Several of his co-stars and stuntmen hired by the [[movie studio|film studios]] began working together regularly. This engendered a familiarity of one another's skills and abilities and it made sense for them to become a working team. Some of the members had received training at the [[Peking Opera school]]s, similar to Chan.\n\nBy 1983, and the release of the film ''[[Project A]]'', the stunt team had become an official organisation of 6 members. The organisation meant that the stuntmen not only received [[Insurance|insurance coverage]], but also a monthly salary and higher pay.\nBy the time of ''[[Police Story 2]]'' in 1988, the team had expanded to around 20 members.\nThis incarnation of the team was disbanded in 1990 and thereafter, individual members were contracted and used on a film-by-film basis rather than all members remaining on the payroll.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = The Unauthorised Jackie Chan Encyclopedia\n | last = Corcoran\n | first = John\n | coauthors = \n | authorlink = \n | year = 2002\n | publisher = McGraw Hill\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 978-0-07-138899-3\n | page = \n | pages = \n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/unauthorizedjack0000corc\n }}</ref> This allowed for some new faces, and the return of former members.\n\nThe formation of Chan's team influenced others in the [[Film industry|business]] to follow suit, particularly his former co-stars and \"brothers\" [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]] (their stunt teams known as \"Hung Ga Ban\" and \"Yuen Ga Ban\" respectively). Other actors who formed their own stunt teams include [[Lau Kar-leung]], [[Philip Ko]], [[Stanley Tong]] and [[Bruce Law]].\nChan's stunt team worked in collaboration with Sammo Hung's team on films including [[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]] and [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]].\nA small number of films that Chan produced but did not appear in, or was not involved in at all, have utilised his stunt team.

{"title_page": "Ronald Anderson", "text_new": "{{BLP sources|date=August 2012}}\n\n'''Ronald Eugene Anderson''' (born June 14, 1941), also known as '''Ron Anderson''', is Professor Emeritus, [[University of Minnesota]], [[Twin Cities]] where he taught [[sociology]] from 1968 to 2005. His early work focused on social and institutional factors shaping the diffusion of technology-based teaching. Since 2007, his work has focused on web-based compassion and world suffering.\n\n==Personal History==\n\nWhile born in [[Sikeston, Missouri]], from 1944 to 1953 he lived in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]]. He graduated from [[La Sierra University]] in [[Riverside, California|Riverside, CA]] with a BA in psychology, and from [[Stanford University]] with a PhD in [[sociology]] in 1970. In 1968, he accepted a faculty position at the [[University of Minnesota]] and still resides in the [[Minneapolis]] area.\n\n==Professional History and Honors==\n\nDuring most of his professional career, Dr. Anderson actively contributed in three distinct disciplines: [[sociology]], [[educational research]], and [[computer science]]. While his publications reside within the intersection of these fields, he has received honors or awards for outstanding service from the principal professional associations of each of these three fields: [[American Sociological Association]], the [[American Educational Research Association]], and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. In 2001, he was awarded the Outstanding Service Award<ref>[http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1 Awards&nbsp;\u2014 SIGCAS&nbsp;\u2013 Computers & Society<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> by the Special Interest Group for Computers and Society<ref>[http://www.sigcas.org/ SIGCAS Mission&nbsp;\u2014 SIGCAS&nbsp;\u2013 Computers & Society<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 1990, he became an invited member of [[Sociological Research Association]]; and in 2008, he became an invited Fellow<ref>[http://www.aera.net/AboutAERA/AERAFellows/tabid/12727/Default.aspx AERA Fellows<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> of the [[American Educational Research Association]]. In August, 2012, the Communication and Information Technology Section[4] of the American Sociological Association will honor him with the prestigious William F. Ogburn Lifetime Achievement Award<ref>[http://www2.asanet.org/citasa/awards.html Awards | CITASA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Secondary (Re-purposed) Survey Data Analysis==\n\nRon Anderson learned secondary data analysis skills from his mentor, [[Stuart C. Dodd]] at the University of Washington in 1963, and his advisor, [[John W. Meyer]] at Stanford University. Anderson applied these skills with John O. Field to study how ideology influenced presidential elections. The resulting paper,<ref>Field, J. O. & Anderson, R. E. (1969) \"Ideology in the Public's Con-ceptualization of the 1964 Election,\" Public Opinion Quarterly 33, pp. 380-398</ref> published in the [[Public Opinion Quarterly]], was reprinted in several major political science texts and was discussed at length by [[Herbert Hyman]], who considered the Anderson-Field link between theoretical analysis and creative mining  of secondary data resources to be exemplary and a contribution to both theory and data analysis methodology.<ref name=\"HymanHerbert\">Hyman, Herbert (1970) Second\u00acary Analysis of Sample Surveys, pp. 185-191.</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Anderson received a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to conduct secondary analysis of the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP) of science and math. One of the papers from this project was published in 1984 and was the first report on the [[digital divide in the United States]] using large-scale, national survey data.<ref name=\"Anderson\">R. Anderson, L. Harris, W. Welch (1984)  \u201cInequities in Opportunities for Computer Literacy,\" The Computing Teacher, 11, 8, pp 10-13.</ref> The term [[digital divide]] did not appear in the literature or the media until 11 years later.\n\nThese results, with lengthy quotes from Anderson, who directed the US portion of the study, were widely disseminated in the popular media including articles in the New York Times,<ref>\u201cRicher Schools Likelier to Obtain Computers\u201d New York Times (Sept 6, 1983).</ref> the Washington Post,<ref>\u201cComputers Give Poor Kids New Handicap\u201d The Washington Post  (Front page, September 12, 1983).</ref> Business Week,<ref>\u201cIf women don\u2019t go into Computers\u201d Business Week (June 21, 1982)</ref> the Wall Street Journal,<ref>\u201cCourses in Computer Literacy Beginning to Draw Bad Marks,\u201d The Wall Street Journal (Sept. 16, 1983)</ref> and Ms. Magazine.<ref>\u201cDo Schools Teach Computer Anxiety?\u201d Ms. Magazine (December 1982)</ref> In the academic literature, Anderson is reported as \u201cexplicating the depth of the digital divide in shaping the adolescent life course.\u201d<ref>Mortimer, J T. and Larson, R. W. in The Changing Adolescent Experience (2002), [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002025928.pdf].</ref> While the media focused upon the findings of sex and income gaps in access and computer course enrollments, Anderson and his associates also found major differences by race and region.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Thirty years later, researchers continue to find major gaps (digital divides) in the demographics of the use of information technology<ref>Anderson, R. E. & Ainley, J. (2010) \"Technology and Learning: Access in Schools Around the World\" in Baker, E., Peterson, P, & McGraw, B.

(Editor) Gender & Higher Education, Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press, Pp. 254-260.</ref> In 1981, Anderson founded and served as Director of the Minnesota Center for Survey Research.<ref>Minnesota Center for Survey Research: http://oms.umn.edu/mcsr/.</ref> He served in that capacity for five years and started the Minnesota State Survey and the Twin Cities Area Survey, both of which are still conducted annually by the Center, which is a unit of the University of Minnesota. During the next two decades, Anderson continued survey work but mostly cross-nationally, which is described in later sections below.\n\n==Computing Applications in Research and Teaching==\n\nIn the late 1960s, Anderson worked full-time as a computer programmer at the Stanford University Computation Center, now called Information Technology Services. Throughout his career as a sociologist, he also worked as a computer consultant developing applications for many educational, governmental and business organizations.<ref name=\"soc\">Vita of Ronald Anderson: http://www.soc.umn.edu/~rea/documents/ron%20anderson%20vita%20full%20%2022july2012.pdf</ref> Many of publications by Anderson (125 articles, 4 books authored, and 5 books edited) describe and critique the use of computers and [[new media]] in research, teaching, and learning.<ref>Vita of Ronald Anderson: http://www.soc.umn.edu/~rea/documents/ron%20anderson%20vita%20full%20%2022july2012.pdf.</ref> He also (with David Garson) has served as Co-Editor of the Sage Publishing academic journal, [[Social Science Computer Review]], since 1987.<ref>[http://www.sagepub.com/editorDetails.nav?contribId=665775 Social Science Computer Review ]</ref>\n\n===Simulation Modeling===\n\nRonald Anderson pioneered the development of two major simulation models. The first provides scenario-based analysis of the impacts of changing sentencing laws. This work started in 1979 for the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission<ref>Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission: http://www.msgc.state.mn.us/.</ref> and the [Minnesota Department of Corrections] (MDOC). It consisted of a [microsimulation] model of the effects of hypothetical changes in sentencing laws upon prison and probation populations.  The model, now called the Structured Sentencing Simulation,<ref>Anderson, R. E.(1993) \"Development of a Structured Sentencing Simulation,\" Social Science Computer Review 11,2 pp. 166-178.</ref><ref>http://www.nccourts.org/Courts/CRS/Councils/spac/Documents/2011-popproj.pdf.</ref> is still used by [Minnesota] and [North Carolina] in prison population projections and \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario simulations.\n\nHis second major simulation work, between 2009 and 2012, addresses college student retention. He and demographer, Dr. Martin Spielauer,<ref>Martin Spielauer: http://www.spielauer.ca/</ref> developed a computer model called MicroCC.<ref>Spielauer, M. & Anderson, R. E. (2012) \u201cMicrosimulation Modeling of Student Success in Community Colleges Using MicroCC,\u201d Social Science Computer Review 30, 4 (Nov 2012) pp499-512.</ref> It was developed under a grant from the [National Science Foundation], and has been applied to 250,000 community college students in New England.<ref>DECA report on community college student progress: http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/decaproject/pubs/Report%20on%20Feasibility%20of%20Using%20SURs%20for%20ATE%20Retention%20v2%206july10.pdf.</ref>\n\n===Educational Software===\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s, Anderson pioneered educational software applications for social science teaching and research. He developed over 50 applications that were distributed by [[Random House]], Longman Publishing, and [[Control Data Corporation]]. Some of the more popular titles include Social Indicators Game,\nThe Public Opinion Exercise:  American Sexual Values and Social Power Game.<ref>Magnuson-Martinson, Scott (1995) \"Classroom Computerization: Ambivalent Attitudes and Ambiguous Outcomes.\"  Teaching Sociology.  23:1-7.</ref> The latter game received the NCRIPTAL/EDUCOM Higher Education Distinguished Software Award in 1987.\n\n===Lectures on New Media in Education===\n\nPrincipally during the 1980s and 1990s, Anderson gave invited lectures on using [[new media]], which includes [[educational technology]] and [[instructional technology]], to teachers and administrators in both secondary and postsecondary institutions as well as national educational organizations. The latter included the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)]], Japan\u2019s National Institute for Educational Policy Research,<ref>Japan\u2019s National Institute for Educational Policy Research: http://www.nier.go.jp/English/index.html</ref> and the [[Ministry of Education and Research (Norway)]]. Within the United States, his lectures included the [[National Academy of Sciences]], [[Eastern Montana College]], [[University of Akron]], [[University of Dayton]], [[Ball State University]], and [[Eastern Michigan University]].\n\n==Social Implications of Technology==\n\nDuring the 1970s, Professor Anderson published a number of articles on the ways in which the social context of computing shaped its use and development. In his writing on the social aspects and implications of computing, he persistently emphasized the need for research data for making decisions about the implementation of computer technology. The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Digital Library contains 33 articles by Anderson with a total of 982 citations and 617 downloads in 2012 alone.<ref>ACM Digital Library: http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104145&CFID=85046073&CFTOKEN=10671748</ref>\n\nWith funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] to the [[MECC|Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]], Ron Anderson and Dan Klassen conducted the first large-scale survey, which surveyed the nearly 7,000 Minnesota high school teachers of math and science regarding their use of computers in teaching.[29] They found that in 1978, before the release of the PC, half of the teachers used computers in their classes and the social context and social attributes of the teachers determined computer utilization.<ref name=\"Anderson_b\">Anderson, R.E., Hansen, T.,  Johnson, D.C., and Klassen, D.L.(1979) \"Acceptance and Rejection of Instructional Computing by Secondary School Teachers,\" Sociology of Work and Occupations 6,2  pp 227-250.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, then U.S. Congressman [[Al Gore]] invited Anderson to participate in the \u201cComputers and Education Hearings\u201d of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Science and Technology Committee<ref>Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the U. S. House Science and Technology Committee:  http://science.house.gov/subcommittee-investigations-and-oversight</ref> in Washington, D.C., on September 29, 1983. The full Statement of Dr. Ronald E.

(2006). \u201cCITASA\u201d Social Science Computer Review 24,2, 150-157.</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Anderson under the auspices of the ACM organized a conference on \u201cComputers and the Quality of Life,\u201d the first conference to link IT with quality of life issues. The Conference Proceedings is still downloadable at the ACM Digital Library and was downloaded 414 times in 2012.<ref>Proceedings of the conference on Computers and the quality of life: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=97344&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=85046073&CFTOKEN=10671748.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the Association for Computing Machinery Council appointed Anderson to represent ACM and the United States on the 30-nation Technical Committee (TC9) on \u201cRelationship between Computers and Society\u201d<ref>TC9 of IFIPS: http://ifiptc9.csir.co.za/</ref> of the International Federation of Information Processing Societies (IFIPS). He served in that capacity for five years. The principal products of this international Committee during that time was to hold two symposia and collectively author a book entitled Perspectives and Policies on ICT in Society, which was published by Springer in 2007.<ref>Berleur, J. & Avgerou, C.,(2005) Perspectives and Policies on ICT in Society. New York: Springer.</ref>\n\n===Code of Ethics for the Computing Professions===\n\nDuring the 1980s, Anderson held several leadership positions in the [Association for Computing Machinery] (ACM), the principle association of computer scientists and computing professionals. He served as a Council member as well as Chair of the Special Interest Group on Computers and Society (SIGCAS)<ref>http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1.</ref> [His most important achievement within ACM was to chair the Working Group that developed the new ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. It was officially published in 1992 and remains the official ACM Code of Ethics.<ref>ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct: Communications of the ACM 35, 5 (May 1992) Pages 94\u201399: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=129875.129885&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=85046073&CFTOKEN=.</ref> The ACM Digital Library Guide lists 2,393 citations of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct in the literature since 1992.<ref name=\"Anderson_a\">Anderson, R.

Anderson (ed.) Computers in American Schools, 1992: An Overview, IEA Computers in Education Study, University of  Minnesota, 1993.</ref> The key findings were that school computers were more outdated in the USA than in most other countries in the study and the diffusion of computer augmented learning tended to be less prevalent in lower income school districts and in highly rural areas. These results, with lengthy quotes from Anderson, who directed the US portion of the study, were widely disseminated in the popular media including articles in USA Today,<ref>Henry, Tamara (1993) \u201cComputers serve as equalizers in schools\u201d USA Today (front page)</ref> and Education Week.<ref>West, Peter (1993) \u201cSurvey Finds Gaps in U.S. Schools' Computer Use\u201d Education Week (December 15, 1993)</ref> and many others.\n\nSix years later in 1998, Ron Anderson (with Henry J.

The principal findings of the study were that teacher professional identities, constructivist pedagogy, and instructionally oriented technology support were key factors in effective use of computers in teaching.<ref>Report to Participants: http://www.crito.uci.edu/tlc/findings/special_report/index.htm.</ref>\n\n===Second International Technology in Education Study (SITES)===\n\nBeginning in 1997, Dr. Anderson Co-Chaired the International Steering Committee for the first two modules of the IEA\u2019s<ref>The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA): http://www.iea.nl.</ref> Second International Technology in Education Study (SITES).<ref>Second Information Technology in Education Study Module 1: http://www.iea.nl/sites-m1.html</ref><ref name=\"iea_a\">Second Information Technology in Education Study Module 2: http://www.iea.nl/sites-m2.html</ref> Anderson continued with the SITES 2006 Study<ref>Second Information Technology in Education Study 2006  (SITES 2006): http://www.iea.nl/sites_2006.html</ref> until 2007 when it ended.<ref>Law, N., Pelgrum, W.J., & Plomp, T. (Eds.). (2008). Pedagogy and ICT use in schools around the world: Findings from the IEA SITES 2006 study. Hong Kong: CERC-Springer.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Ron Anderson and Sara Dexter, directed a large national study funded by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], \"Exemplary Technology-Supported-Schooling Case Studies,\" a project providing for the United States participation in both the IEA<ref name=\"iea\" /> SITES Module 2<ref name=\"iea_a\" /> and the OECD ([[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]) \"case studies of reform and innovation using information technology in learning.\"<ref>Kozma, R.

Eugene, OR: International Society for Technology in Education.</ref> The results of this large study of innovative exemplars of teaching with technology for the United States can be found online.<ref>USA Exemplary Case Studies: http://edtechcases.info/</ref>\n\n===Contribution to Theories on the Social Dynamics of Technology===\n\nRon Anderson has contributed to theories on the sociology of educational technology, especially in the areas of [[Diffusion of Innovations]] and application of [[Information Society]] concepts. In 1976, he published results about the diffusion of computer utilization among sociologists<ref>\"Diffusion of Computer Utilization among Sociology Instructors,\" Computers and the Humanities, 10 (1976), pp. 201-07.</ref> and in 1979 about secondary mathematics and science teachers.<ref name=\"Anderson_b\" /> The former study found that while the time of adoption of computers in teaching followed an S-shaped curve as predicted by diffusion theory, the majority of applications used were not particularly innovative. In the latter study, he found that technology resources and social factors were about equally powerful in explaining adoption of technology in teaching. More interesting, however, in terms of theory was the finding that a substantial number of teachers had discontinued their use of the innovation, an aspect of the theory not yet developed.<ref>Rogers, Everett M. (1983). Diffusion of Innovations. New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|978-0-02-926650-2}}</ref>\n\nA second area of theoretical contribution was that of theories of the [[information society]], of which the concept of \u201cknowledge society\u201d is an extension. While Anderson began in the 1990s, applying information economy and knowledge management concepts to theories of what students would need in the 21st Century, his most extensive analysis was published in 2008.<ref>Anderson, R. E., (2008) \u201cImplications of the Information and Knowledge Society for Education,\u201d In Voogt, J. and G. Knezek (Editors) International Handbook of Information Technology in Primary and Secondary Education, Springer.</ref> Anderson introduced the concepts of tacit knowledge and tacit knowledge demand to pedagogical reform with technology. His original notions of the information society paradigm are generally accepted among those concerned with defining [[21st Century Skills]]. The acceptance of the concept of [[Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge]] (TPACK) is a case in point.\n\n==Evaluation Research==\n\nAnderson frequently received consulting requests to evaluate educational interventions and conduct [educational research], especially with regard to the role of [information technology] in teaching. Numerous clients include: [Control Data Corporation], [Xerox Corporation], the [United States Department of Education], and the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong.<ref name=\"soc\" /> For example, he reviewed test items and research designs for the Australian Center for Educational Research helping them administer the [[OECD]] [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) project. In 2004 he spent two weeks working with the [Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology] in [Bangkok], Thailand reviewing their IT-related projects and research needs. He also has worked with several [[SRI International]] projects, funded by the [National Science Foundation] to develop performance assessments and surveys related ion the use of [[Information and communication technologies in education]] by both teachers and students.\n\n==Expert Witness==\n\nOn several occasions, Anderson was asked to serve as an expert witness on issues related to [[survey research]]. From 2003 to 2005, he served as an expert witness for Mahoney & Foster, Ltd on an advertising fraud case.<ref>Wildlife Research Center, Inc., Plaintiff, v. Robinson Outdoors, Inc., f/k/a Robinson Laboratories, Inc., Defendant. Civil No. 02-2773(DSD/SRN) UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46701</ref> His role included the conduct a survey of consumers of deer hunting products and critiquing the research quality of other surveys conducted.\n\nAnderson also served as an expert witness on several [[Change of venue]] hearings. One was the trial of Marjorie Congdon Caldwell Hagen for the 1977 murder of [[Elisabeth Congdon]] and her nurse in her [[Glensheen Historic Estate]].<ref>Hendry, S. D.

The first was Human Suffering and Quality of Life -Conceptualizing Stories and Statistics. The second was World Suffering and the Quality of Life in 2015; and the third was Alleviation of World Suffering in 2017. The last two were anthologies including chapters written by over 25 authors in each volume.</ref>\n\n==Recent Research==\n\nBeginning in about 2007, Professor Anderson decided he could contribute to the common good by addressing larger societal issues rather than technology alone. He established the nonprofit Foundation for the Relief of Suffering, Inc. to develop and promoted the website WorldSuffering.org, and proceeded to write numerous articles and books on Suffering. His three books on suffering and world suffering are listed in the previou paragraph. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soc.umn.edu/-rea/ Ronald Anderson's homepage]\n* [http://www.soc.umn.edu/people/anderson_r.html/ University of Minnesota Faculty Emeritus Page]\n* [http://www.worldsuffering.org/ World Suffering Website]\n* [http://www.iea.nl/ The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA)]\n\n<!-- This will add a notice to the bottom of the page and won't blank it!

His early work focused on social and institutional factors shaping the diffusion of technology-based teaching. Since 2007, his work has focused on web-based compassion and world suffering.\n\n==Personal History==\n\nWhile born in [[Sikeston, Missouri]], from 1944 to 1953 he lived in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]]. He graduated from [[La Sierra University]] in [[Riverside, California|Riverside, CA]] with a BA in psychology, and from [[Stanford University]] with a PhD in [[sociology]] in 1970. In 1968, he accepted a faculty position at the [[University of Minnesota]] and still resides in the [[Minneapolis]] area.\n\n==Professional History and Honors==\n\nDuring most of his professional career, Dr. Anderson actively contributed in three distinct disciplines: [[sociology]], [[educational research]], and [[computer science]]. While his publications reside within the intersection of these fields, he has received honors or awards for outstanding service from the principal professional associations of each of these three fields: [[American Sociological Association]], the [[American Educational Research Association]], and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. In 2001, he was awarded the Outstanding Service Award<ref>[http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1 Awards&nbsp;\u2014 SIGCAS&nbsp;\u2013 Computers & Society<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> by the Special Interest Group for Computers and Society<ref>[http://www.sigcas.org/ SIGCAS Mission&nbsp;\u2014 SIGCAS&nbsp;\u2013 Computers & Society<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 1990, he became an invited member of [[Sociological Research Association]]; and in 2008, he became an invited Fellow<ref>[http://www.aera.net/AboutAERA/AERAFellows/tabid/12727/Default.aspx AERA Fellows<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> of the [[American Educational Research Association]]. In August, 2012, the Communication and Information Technology Section[4] of the American Sociological Association will honor him with the prestigious William F. Ogburn Lifetime Achievement Award<ref>[http://www2.asanet.org/citasa/awards.html Awards | CITASA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Secondary (Re-purposed) Survey Data Analysis==\n\nRon Anderson learned secondary data analysis skills from his mentor, [[Stuart C. Dodd]] at the University of Washington in 1963, and his advisor, [[John W. Meyer]] at Stanford University. Anderson applied these skills with John O. Field to study how ideology influenced presidential elections. The resulting paper,<ref>Field, J. O. & Anderson, R. E. (1969) \"Ideology in the Public's Con-ceptualization of the 1964 Election,\" Public Opinion Quarterly 33, pp. 380-398</ref> published in the [[Public Opinion Quarterly]], was reprinted in several major political science texts and was discussed at length by Herbert Hyman, who considered the Anderson-Field link between theoretical analysis and creative mining  of secondary data resources to be exemplary and a contribution to both theory and data analysis methodology.<ref name=\"HymanHerbert\">Hyman, Herbert (1970) Second\u00acary Analysis of Sample Surveys, pp. 185-191.</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Anderson received a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to conduct secondary analysis of the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP) of science and math. One of the papers from this project was published in 1984 and was the first report on the [[digital divide in the United States]] using large-scale, national survey data.<ref name=\"Anderson\">R.

(Editor) Gender & Higher Education, Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press, Pp. 254-260.</ref> In 1981, Anderson founded and served as Director of the Minnesota Center for Survey Research.<ref>Minnesota Center for Survey Research: http://oms.umn.edu/mcsr/.</ref> He served in that capacity for five years and started the Minnesota State Survey and the Twin Cities Area Survey, both of which are still conducted annually by the Center, which is a unit of the University of Minnesota. During the next two decades, Anderson continued survey work but mostly cross-nationally, which is described in later sections below.\n\n==Computing Applications in Research and Teaching==\n\nIn the late 1960s, Anderson worked full-time as a computer programmer at the Stanford University Computation Center, now called Information Technology Services. Throughout his career as a sociologist, he also worked as a computer consultant developing applications for many educational, governmental and business organizations.<ref name=\"soc\">Vita of Ronald Anderson: http://www.soc.umn.edu/~rea/documents/ron%20anderson%20vita%20full%20%2022july2012.pdf</ref> Many of publications by Anderson (125 articles, 4 books authored, and 5 books edited) describe and critique the use of computers and [[new media]] in research, teaching, and learning.<ref>Vita of Ronald Anderson: http://www.soc.umn.edu/~rea/documents/ron%20anderson%20vita%20full%20%2022july2012.pdf.</ref> He also (with David Garson) has served as Co-Editor of the Sage Publishing academic journal, [[Social Science Computer Review]], since 1987.<ref>[http://www.sagepub.com/editorDetails.nav?contribId=665775 Social Science Computer Review ]</ref>\n\n===Simulation Modeling===\n\nRonald Anderson pioneered the development of two major simulation models. The first provides scenario-based analysis of the impacts of changing sentencing laws. This work started in 1979 for the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission<ref>Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission: http://www.msgc.state.mn.us/.</ref> and the [Minnesota Department of Corrections] (MDOC). It consisted of a [microsimulation] model of the effects of hypothetical changes in sentencing laws upon prison and probation populations.  The model, now called the Structured Sentencing Simulation,<ref>Anderson, R. E.(1993) \"Development of a Structured Sentencing Simulation,\" Social Science Computer Review 11,2 pp. 166-178.</ref><ref>http://www.nccourts.org/Courts/CRS/Councils/spac/Documents/2011-popproj.pdf.</ref> is still used by [Minnesota] and [North Carolina] in prison population projections and \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario simulations.\n\nHis second major simulation work, between 2009 and 2012, addresses college student retention. He and demographer, Dr. Martin Spielauer,<ref>Martin Spielauer: http://www.spielauer.ca/</ref> developed a computer model called MicroCC.<ref>Spielauer, M. & Anderson, R. E. (2012) \u201cMicrosimulation Modeling of Student Success in Community Colleges Using MicroCC,\u201d Social Science Computer Review 30, 4 (Nov 2012) pp499-512.</ref> It was developed under a grant from the [National Science Foundation], and has been applied to 250,000 community college students in New England.<ref>DECA report on community college student progress: http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/decaproject/pubs/Report%20on%20Feasibility%20of%20Using%20SURs%20for%20ATE%20Retention%20v2%206july10.pdf.</ref>\n\n===Educational Software===\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s, Anderson pioneered educational software applications for social science teaching and research. He developed over 50 applications that were distributed by [[Random House]], Longman Publishing, and [[Control Data Corporation]]. Some of the more popular titles include Social Indicators Game,\nThe Public Opinion Exercise:  American Sexual Values and Social Power Game.<ref>Magnuson-Martinson, Scott (1995) \"Classroom Computerization: Ambivalent Attitudes and Ambiguous Outcomes.\"  Teaching Sociology.  23:1-7.</ref> The latter game received the NCRIPTAL/EDUCOM Higher Education Distinguished Software Award in 1987.\n\n===Lectures on New Media in Education===\n\nPrincipally during the 1980s and 1990s, Anderson gave invited lectures on using [[new media]], which includes [[educational technology]] and [[instructional technology]], to teachers and administrators in both secondary and postsecondary institutions as well as national educational organizations. The latter included the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)]], Japan\u2019s National Institute for Educational Policy Research,<ref>Japan\u2019s National Institute for Educational Policy Research: http://www.nier.go.jp/English/index.html</ref> and the [[Ministry of Education and Research (Norway)]]. Within the United States, his lectures included the [[National Academy of Sciences]], [[Eastern Montana College]], [[University of Akron]], [[University of Dayton]], [[Ball State University]], and [[Eastern Michigan University]].\n\n==Social Implications of Technology==\n\nDuring the 1970s, Professor Anderson published a number of articles on the ways in which the social context of computing shaped its use and development. In his writing on the social aspects and implications of computing, he persistently emphasized the need for research data for making decisions about the implementation of computer technology. The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Digital Library contains 33 articles by Anderson with a total of 982 citations and 617 downloads in 2012 alone.<ref>ACM Digital Library: http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104145&CFID=85046073&CFTOKEN=10671748</ref>\n\nWith funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] to the [[MECC|Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]], Ron Anderson and Dan Klassen conducted the first large-scale survey, which surveyed the nearly 7,000 Minnesota high school teachers of math and science regarding their use of computers in teaching.[29] They found that in 1978, before the release of the PC, half of the teachers used computers in their classes and the social context and social attributes of the teachers determined computer utilization.<ref name=\"Anderson_b\">Anderson, R.E., Hansen, T.,  Johnson, D.C., and Klassen, D.L.(1979) \"Acceptance and Rejection of Instructional Computing by Secondary School Teachers,\" Sociology of Work and Occupations 6,2  pp 227-250.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, then U.S. Congressman [[Al Gore]] invited Anderson to participate in the \u201cComputers and Education Hearings\u201d of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Science and Technology Committee<ref>Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the U. S. House Science and Technology Committee:  http://science.house.gov/subcommittee-investigations-and-oversight</ref> in Washington, D.C., on September 29, 1983. The full Statement of Dr. Ronald E.

The Conference Proceedings is still downloadable at the ACM Digital Library and was downloaded 414 times in 2012.<ref>Proceedings of the conference on Computers and the quality of life: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=97344&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=85046073&CFTOKEN=10671748.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the Association for Computing Machinery Council appointed Anderson to represent ACM and the United States on the 30-nation Technical Committee (TC9) on \u201cRelationship between Computers and Society\u201d<ref>TC9 of IFIPS: http://ifiptc9.csir.co.za/</ref> of the International Federation of Information Processing Societies (IFIPS). He served in that capacity for five years. The principal products of this international Committee during that time was to hold two symposia and collectively author a book entitled Perspectives and Policies on ICT in Society, which was published by Springer in 2007.<ref>Berleur, J. & Avgerou, C.,(2005) Perspectives and Policies on ICT in Society. New York: Springer.</ref>\n\n===Code of Ethics for the Computing Professions===\n\nDuring the 1980s, Anderson held several leadership positions in the [Association for Computing Machinery] (ACM), the principle association of computer scientists and computing professionals. He served as a Council member as well as Chair of the Special Interest Group on Computers and Society (SIGCAS)<ref>http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1.</ref> [His most important achievement within ACM was to chair the Working Group that developed the new ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.

Anderson (ed.) Computers in American Schools, 1992: An Overview, IEA Computers in Education Study, University of  Minnesota, 1993.</ref> The key findings were that school computers were more outdated in the USA than in most other countries in the study and the diffusion of computer augmented learning tended to be less prevalent in lower income school districts and in highly rural areas. These results, with lengthy quotes from Anderson, who directed the US portion of the study, were widely disseminated in the popular media including articles in USA Today,<ref>Henry, Tamara (1993) \u201cComputers serve as equalizers in schools\u201d USA Today (front page)</ref> and Education Week.<ref>West, Peter (1993) \u201cSurvey Finds Gaps in U.S. Schools' Computer Use\u201d Education Week (December 15, 1993)</ref> and many others.\n\nSix years later in 1998, Ron Anderson (with Henry J. Becker) conducted another national survey of schools and teachers: Teaching, Learning and Computing.<ref>[http://www.crito.uci.edu/tlc/html/tlc_home.html Teaching, Learning and Computing:1998]</ref>\nThe project produced 16 reports that were widely circulated. The principal findings of the study were that teacher professional identities, constructivist pedagogy, and instructionally oriented technology support were key factors in effective use of computers in teaching.<ref>Report to Participants: http://www.crito.uci.edu/tlc/findings/special_report/index.htm.</ref>\n\n===Second International Technology in Education Study (SITES)===\n\nBeginning in 1997, Dr. Anderson Co-Chaired the International Steering Committee for the first two modules of the IEA\u2019s<ref>The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA): http://www.iea.nl.</ref> Second International Technology in Education Study (SITES).<ref>Second Information Technology in Education Study Module 1: http://www.iea.nl/sites-m1.html</ref><ref name=\"iea_a\">Second Information Technology in Education Study Module 2: http://www.iea.nl/sites-m2.html</ref> Anderson continued with the SITES 2006 Study<ref>Second Information Technology in Education Study 2006  (SITES 2006): http://www.iea.nl/sites_2006.html</ref> until 2007 when it ended.<ref>Law, N., Pelgrum, W.J., & Plomp, T.

Hong Kong: CERC-Springer.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Ron Anderson and Sara Dexter, directed a large national study funded by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], \"Exemplary Technology-Supported-Schooling Case Studies,\" a project providing for the United States participation in both the IEA<ref name=\"iea\" /> SITES Module 2<ref name=\"iea_a\" /> and the OECD ([[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]) \"case studies of reform and innovation using information technology in learning.\"<ref>Kozma, R. (2003) Technology, Innovation and Educational Change\u2014A Global Perspective. Eugene, OR: International Society for Technology in Education.</ref> The results of this large study of innovative exemplars of teaching with technology for the United States can be found online.<ref>USA Exemplary Case Studies: http://edtechcases.info/</ref>\n\n===Contribution to Theories on the Social Dynamics of Technology===\n\nRon Anderson has contributed to theories on the sociology of educational technology, especially in the areas of [[Diffusion of Innovations]] and application of [[Information Society]] concepts. In 1976, he published results about the diffusion of computer utilization among sociologists<ref>\"Diffusion of Computer Utilization among Sociology Instructors,\" Computers and the Humanities, 10 (1976), pp. 201-07.</ref> and in 1979 about secondary mathematics and science teachers.<ref name=\"Anderson_b\" /> The former study found that while the time of adoption of computers in teaching followed an S-shaped curve as predicted by diffusion theory, the majority of applications used were not particularly innovative. In the latter study, he found that technology resources and social factors were about equally powerful in explaining adoption of technology in teaching. More interesting, however, in terms of theory was the finding that a substantial number of teachers had discontinued their use of the innovation, an aspect of the theory not yet developed.<ref>Rogers, Everett M. (1983). Diffusion of Innovations. New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|978-0-02-926650-2}}</ref>\n\nA second area of theoretical contribution was that of theories of the [[information society]], of which the concept of \u201cknowledge society\u201d is an extension. While Anderson began in the 1990s, applying information economy and knowledge management concepts to theories of what students would need in the 21st Century, his most extensive analysis was published in 2008.<ref>Anderson, R. E., (2008) \u201cImplications of the Information and Knowledge Society for Education,\u201d In Voogt, J. and G. Knezek (Editors) International Handbook of Information Technology in Primary and Secondary Education, Springer.</ref> Anderson introduced the concepts of tacit knowledge and tacit knowledge demand to pedagogical reform with technology. His original notions of the information society paradigm are generally accepted among those concerned with defining [[21st Century Skills]]. The acceptance of the concept of [[Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge]] (TPACK) is a case in point.\n\n==Evaluation Research==\n\nAnderson frequently received consulting requests to evaluate educational interventions and conduct [educational research], especially with regard to the role of [information technology] in teaching. Numerous clients include: [Control Data Corporation], [Xerox Corporation], the [United States Department of Education], and the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong.<ref name=\"soc\" /> For example, he reviewed test items and research designs for the Australian Center for Educational Research helping them administer the [[OECD]] [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) project. In 2004 he spent two weeks working with the [Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology] in [Bangkok], Thailand reviewing their IT-related projects and research needs. He also has worked with several [[SRI International]] projects, funded by the [National Science Foundation] to develop performance assessments and surveys related ion the use of [[Information and communication technologies in education]] by both teachers and students.\n\n==Expert Witness==\n\nOn several occasions, Anderson was asked to serve as an expert witness on issues related to [[survey research]]. From 2003 to 2005, he served as an expert witness for Mahoney & Foster, Ltd on an advertising fraud case.<ref>Wildlife Research Center, Inc., Plaintiff, v. Robinson Outdoors, Inc., f/k/a Robinson Laboratories, Inc., Defendant. Civil No. 02-2773(DSD/SRN) UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46701</ref> His role included the conduct a survey of consumers of deer hunting products and critiquing the research quality of other surveys conducted.\n\nAnderson also served as an expert witness on several [[Change of venue]] hearings. One was the trial of Marjorie Congdon Caldwell Hagen for the 1977 murder of [[Elisabeth Congdon]] and her nurse in her [[Glensheen Historic Estate]].<ref>Hendry, S. D. (1998) Glensheen\u2019s Daughter, the Marjorie Congdon Story.

The first was Human Suffering and Quality of Life -Conceptualizing Stories and Statistics. The second was World Suffering and the Quality of Life in 2015; and the third was Alleviation of World Suffering in 2017. The last two were anthologies including chapters written by over 25 authors in each volume.</ref>\n\n==Recent Research==\n\nBeginning in about 2007, Professor Anderson decided he could contribute to the common good by addressing larger societal issues rather than technology alone. He established the nonprofit Foundation for the Relief of Suffering, Inc. to develop and promoted the website WorldSuffering.org, and proceeded to write numerous articles and books on Suffering. His three books on suffering and world suffering are listed in the previou paragraph. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soc.umn.edu/-rea/ Ronald Anderson's homepage]\n* [http://www.soc.umn.edu/people/anderson_r.html/ University of Minnesota Faculty Emeritus Page]\n* [http://www.worldsuffering.org/ World Suffering Website]\n* [http://www.iea.nl/ The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA)]\n\n<!-- This will add a notice to the bottom of the page and won't blank it!

The Soviet sector, informally called [[East Berlin]], was considered by [[East Germany]], then a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]], to be part of its territory and in fact its capital, and the American, French, and British Sectors, collectively called [[West Berlin]], were in some respects governed as if they were a part of [[West Germany]], a member of [[NATO]].  Seldom did the American government exercise power directly in the American sector, except as it affected American military forces stationed in Berlin.  In particular, the judgeship of the United States Court for Berlin was vacant except during the trial over which Judge Stern presided.\n\nIn 1978, after prodigious diplomatic efforts, [[NATO]] had convinced the [[Warsaw Pact]] states to sign an international convention on [[aircraft hijacking|hijacking]], in which each signatory state promised to punish hijackers who landed in their territory.\n\nOn 30 August 1978, Hans Detlef Alexander Tiede and Ingrid Ruske, both East Germans, used a [[starting pistol]] (not an actual gun) to hijack a Polish passenger aircraft ([[LOT Polish Airlines Flight 165 hijacking|LOT Polish Airlines Flight 165]]) from [[Gda\u0144sk]] bound for East Berlin's [[Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and diverted it instead to the [[U.S. Air Force]] base at [[Tempelhof International Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] in West Berlin.  The West German government was very reluctant to prosecute Tiede and Ruske because of the West German policy of supporting the right of East Germans to flee oppression in the [[East Germany|GDR]].  However, the NATO members did not want to lose the hijacking treaty on which they had worked for so long.  Consequently, the case was prosecuted in the never-before-convened United States Court for Berlin.\n\nOver the prosecutor's objections, Judge Stern ruled that the defendants were entitled to be [[jury trial|tried by a jury]], a procedure abolished in Germany in 1924.  The case against Tiede's co-defendant Ingrid Ruske was dismissed because she had not been notified of her [[Miranda rights]] before signing a confession.  Tiede was acquitted on three charges, including hijacking and possession of a firearm, but convicted of taking a hostage.  He was sentenced to time served&nbsp;\u2014 about nine months.\n\nA significant subtext in the book is Judge Stern's refusal to accept assertions made by representatives of the [[United States Department of State]] that, as the authority appointing the judge for the United States Court for Berlin, it also had the right to control the judge's decision, i.e., tell Stern what to decide. The \"time served\" sentence, writes Stern, was the only method by which he could protect Tiede from the [[State Department]].\n\nIn 1988, Judge Stern's book became the basis of a [[Judgment in Berlin (film)|movie with the same name]] that starred [[Martin Sheen]] as Judge Stern, [[Harris Yulin]] as Bruno Ristau, and [[Sean Penn]] as Witness X.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0095415|title=Judgment in Berlin}}\n\n{{Berlin Wall}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Judgment In Berlin}}\n[[Category:1984 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Non-fiction crime books]]\n[[Category:Aircraft hijackings]]\n[[Category:Legal history of Germany]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Berlin]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2019}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Judgment in Berlin''''' is a 1984 book by [[United States federal judge|federal judge]] [[Herbert Jay Stern]] about a [[aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] trial in the [[United States Court for Berlin]] in 1979, over which he presided.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1988-05-25-8802010132-story.html|title='JUDGMENT IN BERLIN' A POWERFUL STATEMENT|last=Writer|first=ROGER HURLBURT, Entertainment|website=Sun-Sentinel.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nFrom the end of [[World War II]] in Europe in May 1945 until the [[German reunification|reunification]] of Germany in October 1990, [[Berlin]] was divided into four sectors: the American Sector, the French Sector, the British Sector, and the Soviet Sector, each named after the occupying power.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

This policy was followed in 1963 by a motion opposed to [[nuclear weapon]]s: a policy that has remained in place ever since.<ref name=\"Mitchell19961994\">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=194}}</ref> The 1964 policy document, ''SNP & You'', contained a clear centre-left policy platform, including commitments to [[full employment]], government intervention in fuel, power and transport, a state bank to guide economic development, encouragement of [[cooperative]]s and [[credit union]]s, extensive building of [[council house]]s (social housing) by central and local government, pensions adjusted to cost of living, a [[minimum wage]] and an improved [[NHS Scotland|national health service]].<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nThe 1960s also saw the beginnings of the SNP's efforts to establish an industrial organisation and mobilise amongst trade unionists in Scotland, with the establishment of the SNP Trade Union Group, and identifying the SNP with industrial campaigns, such as the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish ''[[Daily Express]]'' to run as a co-operative.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections, the SNP finally self-identified as a social democratic party, and proposed a range of social democratic policies.<ref name=\"Brand199027\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=27|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name=\"Hassan2009121\">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=121}}</ref> There was also an unsuccessful proposal at the 1975 party conference to rename the party as the ''Scottish National Party (Social Democrats)''.<ref name=\"Hepburn2013143\">{{cite book|author=Eve Hepburn|title=New Challenges for Stateless Nationalist and Regionalist Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96596-1|page=143|access-date=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503092815/https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the UK wide referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the same year as the aforementioned attempted name change, the SNP campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Devenney|first=Andrew D.|date=2008|title=Regional Resistance to European Integration: The Case of the Scottish National Party, 1961-1972|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20762312|journal=Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung|volume=33|issue=3 (125)|pages=319\u2013345|issn=0172-6404}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37107148|title=The dilemma facing Scotland's Eurosceptic nationalists|last=Ley|first=Shaun|date=2016-08-18|access-date=2020-01-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThere were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979, with the [[79 Group]] attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a \"social-democratic\" party, to an expressly \"[[socialism|socialist]]\" party. Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Economic Policy===\n[[File:Revenue Scotland logo.png|left|thumb|The [[First Sturgeon government|Sturgeon Government]] created [[Revenue Scotland]] in 2015.]]\nWith the SNP's policy base being mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition, the party is committed to polices such as [[progressive tax|progressive personal taxation]].

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nFundamentalism stands in opposition to the so-called gradualist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it.

The number of ''n''-digit positive integers that have no digit equal to '9' is 8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;9<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> because there are 8 choices (1 through 8) for the first digit, and 9 independent choices (0 through 8) for each of the other ''n''&minus;1 digits. Each of these numbers having no '9' is greater than or equal to 10<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>, so the reciprocal of each of these numbers is less than or equal to 10<sup>1&minus;''n''</sup>. Therefore, the contribution of this group to the sum of reciprocals is less than 8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;({{sfrac|9|10}})<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>. Therefore the whole sum of reciprocals is at most\n\n:<math>8 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^{n-1} = 80.</math>\n\nThe same argument works for any omitted non-zero digit.

This can be proved in almost the same way.<ref name=\"Schmelzer and Baillie 2008\" /> First we observe that we can work with numbers in base 10<sup>''k''</sup> and omit all denominators that have the given string as a \"digit\". The analogous argument to the base 10 case shows that this series converges. Now switching back to base 10, we see that this series contains all denominators that omit the given string, as well as denominators that include it if it is not on a \"''k''-digit\" boundary. For example, if we are omitting 42, the base-100 series would omit 4217 and 1742, but not 1427, so it is larger than the series that omits all 42s.\n\nFarhi<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Farhi\n | first = Bakir\n |date=December 2008\n | title = A Curious Result Related to Kempner's Series\n | journal = American Mathematical Monthly\n | volume = 115\n | issue = 10\n | pages = 933&ndash;938\n | publisher = Mathematical Association of America\n | location = Washington, DC\n | issn = 0002-9890\n | mr = 2468554\n | bibcode = 2008arXiv0807.3518F\n | jstor = 27642640\n | arxiv=0807.3518\n}}</ref> considered generalized Kempner series, namely, the sums ''S''(''d'',&nbsp;''n'') of the reciprocals of the positive integers that have exactly ''n'' instances of the digit&nbsp;''d'' where 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''d''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;9 (so that the original Kempner series is ''S''(9,&nbsp;0)).
