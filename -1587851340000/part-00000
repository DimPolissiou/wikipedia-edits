This first of three volumes primarily consist of the examination of certain theologians: [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus of Lyons]], [[Hippolytus of Rome]] and the Roman Debates, [[Origen]] and Alexandria, and [[Paul of Samosata]] and the Council of Antioch.  In his second volume, Behr provides a short biographical sketch of each, and then focuses on their works and the controversies they were engaged in.  Neither a comprehensive history of theology nor a compendium of Christian doctrine, Behr instead draws attention to the theological debates and reflections that led up to the [[First Council of Nicaea]].\n\nBecause the answer to a question can only be provided by its meaning, Behr begins with the question Christ himself asks, \"Who do you say I am?\"  This answer, while provided by the Gospel, requires reflection\u2014interpretation and explanation of this very person of Jesus Christ, his life and works. The writings of the New Testament, written from an interpretative confession of the crucified and risen Christ contemplated through Scripture, were the subject of intense debate and formation, eventually finding their normative foundation by the end of the 2nd century.  According to Behr, this background is not only necessary for understanding later theological debates, but it is crucial to understanding those boundaries that identify Jesus Christ.  It is the unique Jesus Christ-crucified on a cross, buried, risen three days later-contemplated through the texture of Scripture-the Law, the Psalms, and the Prophets-who is revealed as the Son of God. The incarnation, then, is not the single moment in which something began but rather a recapitulation\u2014the same presence of the same word.  It is through the Word of God previously hidden in the Scripture, as preached by the Apostles, revealed by the Holy Spirit, that the invisible, incomprehensible Father is made visible and comprehensible by the crucified and risen Jesus Christ.  It is he who is always the Coming One, whom through continual contemplation and immersion in Scripture, devotion and death in his name, allows us to participate in the fullness of God.\n\n=== ''The Nicene Faith'' ===\nReleased in 2004, ''The Nicene Faith'' examines the theological reflection of the 4th century, beginning with the church shaking debates that led to Council of Nicaea and ending with their resolution at the Council of Constantinople.  Like its predecessor, ''The Nicene Faith'' is structured not only chronologically, but according theme, examining of only certain theologians-[[Athanasius]], Basil of Cesarea, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and [[Gregory of Nyssa]].  Adapting a similar approach to ''The Way to Nicaea'', this volume is neither a complete collection of theological discourses nor does it have a sole focus, such as Trinitarian theology.  Rather, ''The Nicene Faith'' traces the development of theological reflection in the 4th century\u2014Athanasius and the Cappadocians expounding their vision, preparing the path for the councils of Nicaea and Constantinople, providing the proper context in which their creeds can be correctly understood.  One simply cannot reduce the results of these debates into shorthand formulae.  \n \nKey to understanding Behr's approach, the introduction, standing outside of the main body of work, explains the need to scrutinize our inherently flawed perspectives and presuppositions regarding 4th century theology.  An awareness of this 21st century understanding of such terms as \"orthodoxy\", \"incarnation\", and \"Trinitarian\" theology recognizes that we speak these terms with 1,600 years of definitions already read into them, rather than how the authors themselves used these words within their own texts.\n\n''The Nicene Faith'' both discusses and reflects upon Athanasius and the Cappadocians\u2019 exegetical principles and subsequently derived theology, specifically within the context of the controversies upon which this was forced.  Thus, leading to a further, more carefully worded engagement with Scripture, once again seeking to answer the same question that led the way to Nicaea, Christ's \u201cWho do you say that I am?\u201d \n  \nNicene faith is, then, a particular confession, revealing the power of God, responding to Christ and the Spirit, concerning the God whom they reveal as the Father.  It is the transformation fashioned in and by Christ that propels all theological contemplation.  It provides the lens through which one understands his Passion. When Christ dies as a human being, he demonstrates his divinity as God\u2014he raises his own body.  God's power is found in human weakness\u2014the form of a servant transforms into the form of the Lord\u2014revealing not inferiority but true divinity and equality.  It is as the crucified one that glory is both received and revealed\u2014the same glory which he shared with the Father from all eternity, by which there is no other.  This revelation, the cornerstone of all Christian theology, through which God is made known, is located solely on the Cross.  The one who was creator is the one who now renews.  It is the Passion, the mystery of the Incarnation of the Word of God, illumined by and through the Cross, Christ's voluntary bodily death and resurrection, through which those who have put on his faith, now live in Christ and continue to demonstrate his victory.\n\n=== ''The Mystery of Christ'' ===\n''The Mystery of Christ'' is a systematic presentation of theology that emerged from Behr's first two volumes, ''The Way to Nicaea'' and ''The Nicene Faith''.  A break from ''The Formation of Christian Theology'' series, the book provides a vision of Christian theology that challenges the reader to rethink the modern historical approach to theology\u2014a discipline that has become ever more fragmented in its study.\n\nOnce again returning to the earlier witnesses, Behr begins with the way in which the disciples came to know Jesus Christ as the Son of God\u2014through the Cross and the manner in which the Passion was interpreted and proclaimed.  This revelation does not occur in light of the Passion, but when the risen Christ himself directs the disciples to the scriptures.  The text of the Old Testament, previously viewed as a narrative of the past, is revealed as a thesaurus of imagery, with the historical event of the Passion as its starting point.  It is Christ, not scripture, who is exegeted. The crucified and risen Lord standing before them is the one of whom the scriptures have always spoken\u2014 the one who is still the Coming One.\n\nGiven this perspective, Behr continues by explaining how the results of the theological debates of the first four centuries\u2014particularly Trinitarian theology and Christology\u2014have become separated from the way in which they were exegetically formed and articulated.  Within this structure he considers questions of canon and tradition.  How is it that we speak of creation and salvation today?  How is the \u201cFall\u201d (mis)understood?  This is crucial, not only regarding the narrative of salvation history, but more importantly how we understand our own lives.  Additionally, Behr examines how Mary is spoken of in the Gospels and liturgical texts\u2014both the nativity and the Virgin Mother as the church.  Finally, he focuses on theme of incarnation, which upon interpretation presents the body as that through which Christians are to glorify God.\n\nIn the carefully worded postscript, Behr provides further attention to modern theology's paradigmatic shift away from the exegetical methods from which early Christian doctrine was originally elaborated.  Today's starting points are conclusions without arguments that have resulted in ambiguity.  Much of our theology now works within a modern historical framework, recounting the interaction between God as Trinity and the world.  With a Trinity as a starting point, the linear movement proceeds to retell the creation story, our time in Eden, and the Fall of Man as a historical moment in history.  Thus begins salvation history, the second person of the Trinity\u2014the pre-incarnate Logos\u2014revealing himself to Abraham, conversing with Moses, and speaking through the Prophets.  This culminates in the incarnation of one of the Trinity, who then returns to the Father, sends the Holy Spirit to guide the church for the rest of humankind until the second coming, which is the literal, definable end of the time-line.  This popular modern trend which seeks the reality of history\u2014how things really occurred as a neutral statement\u2014ignores the recognition that history is an interpretation of past events.  Instead of interpretation and confession, theology has become a fusion of metaphysics and mythology.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''John the Theologian and His Paschal Gospel: A Prologue to Theology'', Oxford University Press, 2019 (ISBN 978-0-19-883753-4)\n*''Origen: On First Principles'', ed. and trans.

He played every instrument on the CD, which was produced by [[Corey Lowery]] at Exocet Studios which the name of the project is title Hello Demons Meet Skeletons.\n\nAccording to Lowery's personal website, Hello Demons Meet Skeletons was a phrase used to described what happened to a life when all the demons in someone's life came head to head with the skeletons one can accumulate in life. This project was created to unload the demons and skeletons in Lowery's life. A way to lyrically touch on subjects that needed to be touched on in order to move forward with his life and leave the past behind without completely forgetting it. He wanted to play everything himself and sing everything himself because it's a very personal project.

He played every instrument on the CD, which was produced by [[Corey Lowery]] at Exocet Studios which the name of the project is title Hello Demons Meet Skeletons.\n\nAccording to Lowery's personal website, Hello Demons Meet Skeletons was a phrase used to described what happened to a life when all the demons in someone's life came head to head with the skeletons one can accumulate in life. This project was created to unload the demons and skeletons in Lowery's life. A way to lyrically touch on subjects that needed to be touched on in order to move forward with his life and leave the past behind without completely forgetting it. He wanted to play everything himself and sing everything himself because it's a very personal project.

The [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|plantation house]] is a [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]- and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate-styled]] [[mansion]] built by John Hampden Randolph in 1859, and is the largest extant [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] plantation house in the South with {{convert|53000|sqft|m2}} of floor space.\n\n==Mansion and grounds==\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation House.jpg|thumb|left|250px|North Front of Nottoway]]\nJohn Randolph commissioned renowned architect [[Henry Howard (architect)|Henry Howard]] of [[New Orleans]] with the task of designing the grand mansion with the intention that no expense would be spared in the construction. Howard sited the three-story wooden frame house, that includes a one-story rusticated stucco-covered brick base on a concrete foundation, to face east towards the [[Mississippi River]]. The entrance facade is asymmetrically balanced with a projecting bedroom wing to the left side and a large curved bay with galleries on the right. The main five-bay structure, with a central projecting portico, emphasizes height rather than width with the main living areas on the second and third-stories both being {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} in height above the one-story basement, scored to appear as stone, and featuring an arched niche flanked with narrow [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestrations]]. The galleries are embellished with custom ornamental iron railings made in New Orleans, capped with molded wooden handrails. Double curved [[granite]] staircases, installed by skilled mason, Newton Richards, rise to the second-story. These steps were built with the left side intended for ladies and the right side for gentlemen. The steps for the men can also be identified by the boot scraper at the bottom. The separate staircases were so that the men would not see the women's ankles beneath their skirts as they climbed, which was considered a severe breach of social [[etiquette]] at the time. The close spacing and angularity of the gallery's 22 square columns and their elongated capitals also emphasize the vertical qualities of the house. Above the capitals, small brackets branch out to carry a tall [[entablature]] decorated with [[modillions]], supporting a projecting [[cornice]] that nearly covers the hipped roof that is pierced with six chimneys. In the rear of the house is a two-story [[studio apartment|gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re]] wing where the Randolph sons resided.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway Plantation|url=http://www.knowla.org/entry/1727/|publisher=Knowla.org|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of Nottoway was completed in 1859 at an estimated cost of $80,000; to prevent any duplicate homes being built, Randolph destroyed the architect's plans after completion.\n\n===Interiors===\n[[File:Nottoway Interior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The White Ballroom]][[File:Nottoway Dining Room.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Dining Room]]\nNottoway has over an acre of floor space spread out over three floors, and a total of 64 rooms with 165 doors and 200 windows, most of which can also double as doors.  The house enjoyed 19th-century novelties such as a bathroom located on each floor with flushing toilets and hot and cold running water, gas lighting throughout the house and a complex servant call bell system. The principal rooms of the house are located on the second floor. The entrance hall runs the length of the house and is 12 feet wide and 40 feet long. Large [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] and brass chandeliers hang from the {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} high ceilings and the doors with hand-painted German Dresden porcelain doorknobs and matching keyhole covers, leading to the adjacent rooms are {{convert|11|ft|m}} tall. Above the doors and along the ceilings are plaster frieze moldings, with modillions interspersed with [[paterae]], that are made from mud, clay, horse hair and Spanish moss. To the right of the entrance hall is the most unusual, and reportedly John Randolph's most favorite room in the house, the White Ballroom. With [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, hand-cast archways and an L-shaped extension into a curved bay, Randolph had it painted completely white, including the flooring, to show off the natural beauty of his seven daughters, six of whom would be married there. Featuring two fireplaces with hand-carved [[rococo]] white marble mantles, there is also an original mirror placed so that the women could see if their ankles or [[Hoop skirt|hoops]] were showing beneath their skirts. Over one of the fireplaces, there is a painting of Mary Henshaw (no relation to the family), whose eyes are said to follow the viewer around the room. Flanking the entrance hall to the left is a gentleman's study, a stair hall and the formal dining room. Both the study and the dining room feature black Italian hand-carved marble mantles on their coal burning fireplaces, and the rooms are filled with period antique furniture. The dining room plasterwork showcases pink camellias, Emily Randolph's favorite flower, and is the only plasterwork in the house to have color.\n\nThe main staircase of Honduran mahogany is covered in green velvet and ascends to the Ancestral Hall on the third-floor. The hall was used by the Randolphs as a family parlor, being a central thoroughfare to many of the adjacent bedrooms, and gave access to the third-floor gallery with views of the Mississippi River. Nearby, is the master bedroom, with one of the three original bathrooms, as well as a small room that was used as a [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] for Julia Marceline, the Randolph's last and only child born at Nottoway. During the Civil War, Emily Randolph utilized a bedpost at the end of the bed to hide valuable jewelry. Though originally bedrooms, one has been made into a music room displaying musical instruments from the 19th-century, and another known as the Wicker Room features wicker furniture originally owned by the Randolph family.\n\nThe first floor basement has been transformed into a restaurant and a small museum about the Randolph family, and the history of the plantation. Originally the space held the laundry, dairy, wine cellar and servants quarters, as well as a 10-pin bowling alley for the amusement of the children.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe landscape for Nottoway was designed by John Nelson of New Orleans whose plan included 120 fruit and citrus trees, 12 magnolia trees, poplar and live oak trees, 75 rose bushes, 150 strawberry plants and a variety of flower and vegetable gardens. However, due to neglect and the erosion of six and a half acres of land by the Mississippi River, the gardens designed by Nelson no longer exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway's Architectural History|url=https://nottowayplantation.wordpress.com/|publisher=Nottoway Plantation's Blog|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Today, the house sits only 200 feet behind a river levee and the grounds include a small formal hedge garden adjacent to the gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re where the detached kitchen once stood, and a fountain courtyard in front of the southern bedroom wing. Surrounding the house are modern ancillary buildings that house offices and event facilities. The owners expanded the property in 2008 by building a carriage house, ballroom and nine Acadian-style cottages modeled after the property's original slave quarters, while the plantation was closed to the public for repairs, as a result of damage incurred by [[Hurricane Gustav]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Louisiana plantation to be auctioned|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/02/historic-louisiana-plantation-to-be-auctioned/|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> To the north of the house is the reconstructed stables, now re-purposed as a ballroom, and the Randolph cemetery where the remains of the family were reinterred in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nJohn Hampden Randolph was born in [[Virginia]] in 1813, a member of the prominent [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph family]]. He migrated with his family to Mississippi when his father, [[Peter Randolph|Peter Randolph Jr.]], was appointed a federal judge in [[Woodville, Mississippi]], by [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] in 1820.\n\nJohn Randolph married Emily Jane Liddell in 1837 and went on to have eleven children with her. Randolph devoted most of his time to his [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], but believing sugar production would be more lucrative he decided to move his family to southern Louisiana in 1842 where he purchased a {{convert|1650|acre|km2}} cotton plantation that he named Forest Home. Converting the plantation to [[sugar cane]] production two years later and constructing [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish's]] first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[sugar cane mill|sugar mill]], he was able to triple his earnings over his cotton production. Within ten years he had increased his holdings to {{convert|7116|acre|km2}} and owned 176 [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved people]] making Randolph one of the larger slaveholders in the South. In 1855 he purchased an additional {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of highland, and {{convert|620|acre|km2}} of [[swamp]] and Mississippi River-front land where he sought to build a more prestigious home that he named \"Nottoway\", after [[Nottoway County, Virginia|Nottoway County]] in the part of Virginia where he was born.\n\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation-022.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Painting by Cornelia Randolph showing original garden landscape]]\nHe selected Henry Howard, a very popular architect of the time, considered to have been one of the finest architects of 19th-century [[New Orleans]]. Many of his Greek Revival and Italianate style buildings, churches, and homes can still be found in the city.  He also designed the neighboring [[Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)|Belle Grove]], now destroyed.  Randolph and the owner of Belle Grove, John Andrews, are known to have had a rivalry of sorts that even extended to their homes.<ref name=\"lostplan\">{{cite book |title=Lost Plantations of the South |last=Matrana |first=Marc R. |year=2009 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1-57806-942-2 |pages=184\u2013192 }}</ref> Compiling the materials for his [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation home]], cypress logs were cut and cured under water for six years, then cut into planks and dried into what is called virgin cypress. The wood's most notable feature is not its durability, but its resistance to termites. Handmade bricks were baked in kilns by enslaved workers and 40 carpenters, brick masons and plumbers were hired by Howard, who lived in tents at the site of construction while doing their work. The massive home was completed in 1859 along with a variety of other buildings including quarters for enslaved workers, a schoolhouse, greenhouse, stable, steam-powered sugar house, wood cisterns, and other necessary buildings for an agricultural operation.<ref name=\"Nottoway\">{{cite book |title=Nottoway Plantation: The South's Largest Antebellum Mansion |last=Sommers Castaldi |first=Robin |year=2013 |publisher=Nottoway Properties, Inc |isbn=978-0-9891285-0-6 |pages=26\u201369 }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the house was completed the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began. Randolph did not support secession from the Union, but once the war began, backed the war financially and sent his three sons to fight for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], losing his oldest son, Algernon Sidney Randolph, at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. With the war coming ever closer to Nottoway, it was decided that Randolph would take 200 enslaved people to [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], and grow cotton there while his wife, Emily, stayed at Nottoway with the youngest children, hoping that their presence would save it from destruction. The plantation was occupied by both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate troops and though the grounds were damaged and the animals taken, Nottoway survived the war with only a single [[grapeshot]] to the far left column that did not fall out until 1971.\n\nWith the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] of the slaves, John Randolph contracted with 53 of his former bond people to continue working as laborers. When he returned to Nottoway after the Civil War, most, having few other choices, returned with him. The sugar business was not as profitable after the war and by 1875, Nottoway was reduced to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. John Randolph died at Nottoway on September 8, 1883, leaving the plantation to his wife.\n\nEmily Randolph sold the plantation in 1889 for [[$]]50,000, which she divided equally among her nine surviving children and herself. She died in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1904.<ref>Fisher, C. (1996). ''The Nottoway Plantation, Restaurant, and Inn: The White Castle of Louisiana''. North American Case Research Association (NACRA), 16(3).</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe new owners of Nottoway were D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Pierre Landry and his father-in-law, Jean Baptiste Dugas, whose family owned the plantation until 1909, when Landry's widow sold Nottoway to sugar [[Planter (American South)|planter]] Alfonse Hanlon. Soon after, Hanlon lost Nottoway to foreclosure in 1913 due to crop failures the previous two years that resulted in tax problems and accrued medical bills by his wife's failing health. Dr. Whyte G. Owen purchased the plantation out of foreclosure in the amount of $10,000.\n\nDr. Owen, one-time Surgeon General of Louisiana, attempted to run the estate as a sugar plantation, but was not successful.  He sold off {{convert|1193|acre|km2}}, keeping the house and surrounding property. After his death in 1949, Nottoway was inherited by his son Stanford who lived with his wife Odessa in the house until his death in 1974. Thereafter, Odessa Owen lived alone in the massive house trying to maintain the house with her limited resources. Knowing she was unable to adequately care for the house, Owen sold the plantation to Arlin K. Dease in 1980, who had restored three other antebellum mansions, including the [[Myrtles Plantation]] in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]] with the caveat that she be allowed to live in house until her death. Dying in 2003, it was at this time the house ceased to be a private home. Dease restored Nottoway, working a crew of 40 to 60 men 12 hours a day, and opened the house to the public three months after his purchase. Arlin Dease sold Nottoway to [[Paul Ramsay]] of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1985, after he had stayed at the property while in the area for business.<ref name=Nottoway/>\n\n===21st century===\nUnder Ramsay's tenure, Nottoway has become a resort destination.

In the rear of the house is a two-story [[studio apartment|gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re]] wing where the Randolph sons resided.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway Plantation|url=http://www.knowla.org/entry/1727/|publisher=Knowla.org|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of Nottoway was completed in 1859 at an estimated cost of $80,000; to prevent any duplicate homes being built, Randolph destroyed the architect's plans after completion.\n\n===Interiors===\n[[File:Nottoway Interior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The White Ballroom]][[File:Nottoway Dining Room.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Dining Room]]\nNottoway has over an acre of floor space spread out over three floors, and a total of 64 rooms with 165 doors and 200 windows, most of which can also double as doors.  The house enjoyed 19th-century novelties such as a bathroom located on each floor with flushing toilets and hot and cold running water, gas lighting throughout the house and a complex servant call bell system. The principal rooms of the house are located on the second floor. The entrance hall runs the length of the house and is 12 feet wide and 40 feet long. Large [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] and brass chandeliers hang from the {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} high ceilings and the doors with hand-painted German Dresden porcelain doorknobs and matching keyhole covers, leading to the adjacent rooms are {{convert|11|ft|m}} tall. Above the doors and along the ceilings are plaster frieze moldings, with modillions interspersed with [[paterae]], that are made from mud, clay, horse hair and Spanish moss. To the right of the entrance hall is the most unusual, and reportedly John Randolph's most favorite room in the house, the White Ballroom. With [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, hand-cast archways and an L-shaped extension into a curved bay, Randolph had it painted completely white, including the flooring, to show off the natural beauty of his seven daughters, six of whom would be married there. Featuring two fireplaces with hand-carved [[rococo]] white marble mantles, there is also an original mirror placed so that the women could see if their ankles or [[Hoop skirt|hoops]] were showing beneath their skirts. Over one of the fireplaces, there is a painting of Mary Henshaw (no relation to the family), whose eyes are said to follow the viewer around the room. Flanking the entrance hall to the left is a gentleman's study, a stair hall and the formal dining room. Both the study and the dining room feature black Italian hand-carved marble mantles on their coal burning fireplaces, and the rooms are filled with period antique furniture. The dining room plasterwork showcases pink camellias, Emily Randolph's favorite flower, and is the only plasterwork in the house to have color.\n\nThe main staircase of Honduran mahogany is covered in green velvet and ascends to the Ancestral Hall on the third-floor. The hall was used by the Randolphs as a family parlor, being a central thoroughfare to many of the adjacent bedrooms, and gave access to the third-floor gallery with views of the Mississippi River. Nearby, is the master bedroom, with one of the three original bathrooms, as well as a small room that was used as a [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] for Julia Marceline, the Randolph's last and only child born at Nottoway. During the Civil War, Emily Randolph utilized a bedpost at the end of the bed to hide valuable jewelry. Though originally bedrooms, one has been made into a music room displaying musical instruments from the 19th-century, and another known as the Wicker Room features wicker furniture originally owned by the Randolph family.\n\nThe first floor basement has been transformed into a restaurant and a small museum about the Randolph family, and the history of the plantation. Originally the space held the laundry, dairy, wine cellar and servants quarters, as well as a 10-pin bowling alley for the amusement of the children.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe landscape for Nottoway was designed by John Nelson of New Orleans whose plan included 120 fruit and citrus trees, 12 magnolia trees, poplar and live oak trees, 75 rose bushes, 150 strawberry plants and a variety of flower and vegetable gardens. However, due to neglect and the erosion of six and a half acres of land by the Mississippi River, the gardens designed by Nelson no longer exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway's Architectural History|url=https://nottowayplantation.wordpress.com/|publisher=Nottoway Plantation's Blog|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Today, the house sits only 200 feet behind a river levee and the grounds include a small formal hedge garden adjacent to the gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re where the detached kitchen once stood, and a fountain courtyard in front of the southern bedroom wing. Surrounding the house are modern ancillary buildings that house offices and event facilities. The owners expanded the property in 2008 by building a carriage house, ballroom and nine Acadian-style cottages modeled after the property's original slave quarters, while the plantation was closed to the public for repairs, as a result of damage incurred by [[Hurricane Gustav]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Louisiana plantation to be auctioned|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/02/historic-louisiana-plantation-to-be-auctioned/|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> To the north of the house is the reconstructed stables, now re-purposed as a ballroom, and the Randolph cemetery where the remains of the family were reinterred in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nJohn Hampden Randolph was born in [[Virginia]] in 1813, a member of the prominent [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph family]]. He migrated with his family to Mississippi when his father, [[Peter Randolph|Peter Randolph Jr.]], was appointed a federal judge in [[Woodville, Mississippi]], by [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] in 1820.\n\nJohn Randolph married Emily Jane Liddell in 1837 and went on to have eleven children with her. Randolph devoted most of his time to his [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], but believing sugar production would be more lucrative he decided to move his family to southern Louisiana in 1842 where he purchased a {{convert|1650|acre|km2}} cotton plantation that he named Forest Home. Converting the plantation to [[sugar cane]] production two years later and constructing [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish's]] first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[sugar cane mill|sugar mill]], he was able to triple his earnings over his cotton production. Within ten years he had increased his holdings to {{convert|7116|acre|km2}} and owned 176 [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved people]] making Randolph one of the larger slaveholders in the South. In 1855 he purchased an additional {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of highland, and {{convert|620|acre|km2}} of [[swamp]] and Mississippi River-front land where he sought to build a more prestigious home that he named \"Nottoway\", after [[Nottoway County, Virginia|Nottoway County]] in the part of Virginia where he was born.\n\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation-022.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Painting by Cornelia Randolph showing original garden landscape]]\nHe selected Henry Howard, a very popular architect of the time, considered to have been one of the finest architects of 19th-century [[New Orleans]]. Many of his Greek Revival and Italianate style buildings, churches, and homes can still be found in the city.  He also designed the neighboring [[Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)|Belle Grove]], now destroyed.  Randolph and the owner of Belle Grove, John Andrews, are known to have had a rivalry of sorts that even extended to their homes.<ref name=\"lostplan\">{{cite book |title=Lost Plantations of the South |last=Matrana |first=Marc R. |year=2009 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1-57806-942-2 |pages=184\u2013192 }}</ref> Compiling the materials for his [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation home]], cypress logs were cut and cured under water for six years, then cut into planks and dried into what is called virgin cypress. The wood's most notable feature is not its durability, but its resistance to termites. Handmade bricks were baked in kilns by enslaved workers and 40 carpenters, brick masons and plumbers were hired by Howard, who lived in tents at the site of construction while doing their work. The massive home was completed in 1859 along with a variety of other buildings including quarters for enslaved workers, a schoolhouse, greenhouse, stable, steam-powered sugar house, wood cisterns, and other necessary buildings for an agricultural operation.<ref name=\"Nottoway\">{{cite book |title=Nottoway Plantation: The South's Largest Antebellum Mansion |last=Sommers Castaldi |first=Robin |year=2013 |publisher=Nottoway Properties, Inc |isbn=978-0-9891285-0-6 |pages=26\u201369 }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the house was completed the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began. Randolph did not support secession from the Union, but once the war began, backed the war financially and sent his three sons to fight for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], losing his oldest son, Algernon Sidney Randolph, at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. With the war coming ever closer to Nottoway, it was decided that Randolph would take 200 enslaved people to [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], and grow cotton there while his wife, Emily, stayed at Nottoway with the youngest children, hoping that their presence would save it from destruction. The plantation was occupied by both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate troops and though the grounds were damaged and the animals taken, Nottoway survived the war with only a single [[grapeshot]] to the far left column that did not fall out until 1971.\n\nWith the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] of the slaves, John Randolph contracted with 53 of his former bond people to continue working as laborers. When he returned to Nottoway after the Civil War, most, having few other choices, returned with him. The sugar business was not as profitable after the war and by 1875, Nottoway was reduced to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. John Randolph died at Nottoway on September 8, 1883, leaving the plantation to his wife.\n\nEmily Randolph sold the plantation in 1889 for [[$]]50,000, which she divided equally among her nine surviving children and herself. She died in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1904.<ref>Fisher, C. (1996). ''The Nottoway Plantation, Restaurant, and Inn: The White Castle of Louisiana''. North American Case Research Association (NACRA), 16(3).</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe new owners of Nottoway were D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Pierre Landry and his father-in-law, Jean Baptiste Dugas, whose family owned the plantation until 1909, when Landry's widow sold Nottoway to sugar [[Planter (American South)|planter]] Alfonse Hanlon. Soon after, Hanlon lost Nottoway to foreclosure in 1913 due to crop failures the previous two years that resulted in tax problems and accrued medical bills by his wife's failing health. Dr. Whyte G. Owen purchased the plantation out of foreclosure in the amount of $10,000.\n\nDr. Owen, one-time Surgeon General of Louisiana, attempted to run the estate as a sugar plantation, but was not successful.  He sold off {{convert|1193|acre|km2}} keeping the house and surrounding property. After his death in 1949, Nottoway was inherited by his son Stanford who lived with his wife Odessa in the house until his death in 1974. Thereafter, Odessa Owen lived alone in the massive house trying to maintain the house with her limited resources. Knowing she was unable to adequately care for the house, Owen sold the plantation to Arlin K. Dease in 1980, who had restored three other antebellum mansions, including the [[Myrtles Plantation]] in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]] with the caveat that she be allowed to live in house until her death. Dying in 2003, it was at this time the house ceased to be a private home. Dease restored Nottoway, working a crew of 40 to 60 men 12 hours a day, and opened the house to the public three months after his purchase. Arlin Dease sold Nottoway to [[Paul Ramsay]] of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1985, after he had stayed at the property while in the area for business.<ref name=Nottoway/>\n\n===21st century===\nUnder Ramsay's tenure, Nottoway has become a resort destination.
