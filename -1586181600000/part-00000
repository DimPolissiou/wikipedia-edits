The plan was drafted by [[Israel]]i Minister [[Yigal Allon]] shortly after the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967.

Under the plan, Israel would assert and sustain military presence over the West Bank up to the Jordan River, the West Bank would be demilitarized, the Palestinians would be provided self-administration in an autonomous or semiautonomous region, and Israel would remain in full control over a united Jerusalem, with perhaps a Jordanian status in the Muslim quarter of the Old City. Israeli leaders then ruled out the possibility of incorporating the West Bank Palestinian population into a greater Israel because it would have dramatically changed the states Jewish demographic orientation.

According to him, Nasreddin was born in the city of [[Khoy]] in [[West Azerbaijan Province]] of [[Iran]], had his education in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and became the pupil of famous Quran mufassir [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] in Herat. He was sent to Anatolia by the Khalif in Baghdad to organize resistance and uprising against the Mongol invasion. He served as a [[Kadi (Ottoman Empire)|kad\u0131]] (an Islamic judge and ombudsman) in [[Kayseri]]. This explains why he addresses judicial problems in the jokes not only religious ones. During the turmoil of the Mongol invasion he became a political opponent of [[Persia]]n [[Rumi]]. He was addressed in [[Masnavi]] by juha anecdotes for this reason. He became the [[vizier|vazir]] at the court of [[Kaykaus II]]. Having lived in numerous cities in vast area and being steadfastly against the Mongol invasion as well as having his witty character, he was embraced by various nations and cultures from Turkey to Arabia, from Persia to Afghanistan, and from Russia to China, most of which suffered from those invasions.\n\nThe Arabic version of the character, known as ''\"juha\"'' ({{lang-ar|\u062c\u062d\u0627}}), is the oldest attested version of the character and the most divergent, being mentioned in [[Al-Jahiz]]'s book ''\"Saying on Mules\"''\u2014 {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u063a\u0627\u0644}}\u2014, according [[Al-Dhahabi]]'s book [[Al-Dhahabi]]'s book \"{{lang|ar|\u0645\u064a\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644}}\", his full name was ''\"Abu al-Ghusn Dujayn al-Fizari\"'', he lived under the [[Umayyads]] in [[Kufa]], his mother was said to be a servant to [[Anas ibn Malik]], thus he was one of the [[Tabi'un]] in [[Sunni]] tradition.<ref>\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0647\u0628\u064a \u0645\u064a\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0644 (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0644\u062f 1)\u060c \u0635 326</ref>\n\n{{quote| and of them (juha), and he is nicknamed ''\"aba ghusn\"'', and it has been told about him what suggests astuteness and intelligence, although overwhelmingly made foolish, and it has been said that some who antagonize him put out tales about him.|sign=[[Ibn al-Jawzi]]<ref>\"\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628\u064a \"\u0639\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\" \u0635 373 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u062f\u0647\u0627</ref>}}\n\nAs generations have gone by, new stories have been added to the Nasreddin corpus, others have been modified, and he and his tales have spread to many regions. The themes in the tales have become part of the folklore of a number of nations and express the national imaginations of a variety of cultures. Although most of them depict Nasreddin in an early small-village setting, the tales deal with concepts that have a certain timelessness. They purvey a pithy [[folk wisdom]] that triumphs over all trials and tribulations. The oldest manuscript of Nasreddin dates to 1571.\n\nToday, Nasreddin stories are told in a wide variety of regions, especially across the [[Muslim world]] and have been translated into many languages. Some regions independently developed a character similar to Nasreddin, and the stories have become part of a larger whole. In many regions, Nasreddin is a major part of the culture, and is quoted or alluded to frequently in daily life. Since there are thousands of different Nasreddin stories, one can be found to fit almost any occasion.<ref>Ohebsion, Rodney (2004) ''A Collection of Wisdom'', Immediex Publishing, {{ISBN|1-932968-19-9}}.</ref> Nasreddin often appears as a whimsical character of a large [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Chinese, [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Judeo-Spanish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], Russian, and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] [[Folklore|folk]] tradition of [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s, not entirely different from [[zen]] [[koan]]s.\n\n1996\u20131997 was declared International Nasreddin Year by [[UNESCO]].<ref>[http://www.rri.ro/art.shtml?lang=1&sec=170&art=27256 ''\"...UNESCO declared 1996\u20131997 the International Nasreddin Year...\"''].</ref>\n\n{{quote| Some people say that, whilst uttering what seemed madness, he was, in reality, divinely inspired, and that it was not madness but wisdom that he uttered.|sign=''The Turkish Jester or The Pleasantries of Cogia Nasr Eddin Effendi''<ref>{{cite book|title=The Turkish Jester or The Pleasantries of Cogia Nasr Eddin Effendi|year=1884|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16244 | others=Translated from the Turkish by [[George Borrow]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Name ==\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Goha story cloth.jpg|thumb|A Goha story cloth by Ahmed Yossery (2007) depicting a version of [[The miller, his son and the donkey]], [[The Children\u2019s Museum of Indianapolis]]]]\n\nMany peoples of the [[Near East|Near]], Middle East, South Asia and Central Asia claim Nasreddin as their own (''e.g.'', Turks,<ref name=nasruddin>The outrageous Wisdom of Nasruddin, ''[http://www.nasruddin.org/ Mullah Nasruddin]''; accessed 19 February 2007.</ref><ref name=\"Nasreddin Hoca\">{{cite web\n | title = Nasreddin Hoca\n | publisher=Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism\n | url = http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D3138DF7C92FCA5B4D0584F186FD0FCCD518\n | accessdate =28 December 2006\n}}</ref><ref name=sysinia>[http://www.sysindia.com/emagazine/mulla/mulla.html Sysindia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218094252/http://www.sysindia.com/emagazine/mulla/mulla.html |date=18 February 2007 }}, Mulla Nasreddin Stories, accessed 20 February 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.silk-road.com/folklore/nasreddin.html Silk-road.com], Nasreddin Hoca</ref> Afghans,<ref name=sysinia /> Iranians,<ref name=nasruddin /><ref>{{cite web| title=First Iranian Mullah who Was a Master in Anecdotes| publisher=Persian Journal|url=http://www.iranian.ws/iran_news/publish/printer_28786.shtml| accessdate=26 July 2009\n}}</ref> and Uzbeks).<ref name=\"psiche\">{{cite book|last= Fiorentini|first=Gianpaolo|title= Storie di Nasreddin|chapter= Nasreddin, una biografia possibile|publisher= Libreria Editrice Psiche|location=Toronto|year=2004|isbn=978-88-85142-71-8|chapter-url=http://www.psiche.info/estratti/psiche/StorieDiNasreddin.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407123310/http://www.psiche.info/estratti/psiche/StorieDiNasreddin.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 April 2004|accessdate=28 December 2006\n}}</ref> His name is spelt in a wide variety of ways: ''Nasrudeen'', ''Nasrudin'', ''Nasruddin'', ''Nasr ud-Din'', ''Nasredin'', ''Nasiruddin,'' ''Naseeruddin'', ''Nasr&nbsp;Eddin'', ''Nastradhin'', ''Nasreddine'', ''Nastratin'', ''Nusrettin'', ''Nasrettin'', ''Nostradin'', ''Nastradin'' (lit.: [[Nasr (surname)|Victory]] of the [[Din (Arabic)|Deen]]) and ''Nazaruddin''.

The musical Nasirdin Apandim features the legend of Nasreddin [[effendi]] (\"sir, lord\"), largely sourced from Uighur folklore.\n\nIn Central Asia, he is commonly known as \"Afandi\". The Central Asian peoples also claim his local origin, as do Uyghurs.\n\n== Tales ==\nThe Nasreddin stories are known throughout the Middle East and have touched cultures around the world. Superficially, most of the Nasreddin stories may be told as jokes or humorous anecdotes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and [[caravanserai]]s of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasreddin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, followed by a moral and usually the little extra which brings the consciousness of the potential mystic a little further on the way to realization.<ref>Idris Shah (1964), ''The Sufis'', London: W. H. Allen {{ISBN|0-385-07966-4}}.</ref>\n\n=== Examples ===\n==== The Sermon ====\n:Once Nasreddin was invited to deliver a [[sermon]]. When he got on the pulpit, he asked, ''Do you know what I am going to say?'' The audience replied ''\"no\"'', so he announced, ''I have no desire to speak to people who don't even know what I will be talking about!'' and left.\n:The people felt embarrassed and called him back again the next day. This time, when he asked the same question, the people replied ''yes''. So Nasreddin said, ''Well, since you already know what I am going to say, I won't waste any more of your time!'' and left.\n:Now the people were really perplexed. They decided to try one more time and once again invited the Mulla to speak the following week. Once again he asked the same question \u2013 ''Do you know what I am going to say?'' Now the people were prepared and so half of them answered \"yes\" while the other half replied \"no\". So Nasreddin said ''Let the half who know what I am going to say, tell it to the half who don't,'' and left.<ref>Many written versions of this tale exist, for example in {{cite book|last=Kelsey|first=Alice|title=Once the Hodja|url=https://archive.org/details/oncehodja00kels|url-access=registration|year=1943|publisher=David McKay Company Inc}}</ref>\n\n==== Whom do you believe? ====\n[[File:Nasr Eddin Hodja statue in Bukhara Liab -i-Haouz complex.JPG|thumb|Nasreddin Hodja in [[Bukhara]]]]\n[[File:Harikalar Diyari Nasrettin Hoca 05981 nevit.jpg|thumb|Nasreddin Hodja in [[Ankara]]]]\n:A neighbour came to the gate of Mulla Nasreddin's yard.

According to him, Nasreddin was born in the city of [[Khoy]] in [[West Azerbaijan Province]] of [[Iran]], had his education in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and became the pupil of famous Quran mufassir [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] in Herat. He was sent to Anatolia by the Khalif in Baghdad to organize resistance and uprising against the Mongol invasion. He served as a [[Kadi (Ottoman Empire)|kad\u0131]] (an Islamic judge and ombudsman) in [[Kayseri]]. This explains why he addresses judicial problems in the jokes not only religious ones. During the turmoil of the Mongol invasion he became a political opponent of [[Persia]]n [[Rumi]]. He was addressed in [[Masnavi]] by juha anecdotes for this reason. He became the [[vizier|vazir]] at the court of [[Kaykaus II]]. Having lived in numerous cities in vast area and being steadfastly against the Mongol invasion as well as having his witty character, he was embraced by various nations and cultures from Turkey to Arabia, from Persia to Afghanistan, and from Russia to China, most of which suffered from those invasions.\n\nThe Arabic version of the character, known as ''\"juha\"'' ({{lang-ar|\u062c\u062d\u0627}}), is the oldest attested version of the character and the most divergent, being mentioned in [[Al-Jahiz]]'s book ''\"Saying on Mules\"''\u2014 {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u063a\u0627\u0644}}\u2014, according [[Al-Dhahabi]]'s book [[Al-Dhahabi]]'s book \"{{lang|ar|\u0645\u064a\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644}}\", his full name was ''\"Abu al-Ghusn Dujayn al-Fizari\"'', he lived under the [[Umayyads]] in [[Kufa]], his mother was said to be a servant to [[Anas ibn Malik]], thus he was one of the [[Tabi'un]] in [[Sunni]] tradition.<ref>\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0647\u0628\u064a \u0645\u064a\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0644 (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0644\u062f 1)\u060c \u0635 326</ref>\n\n{{quote| and of them (juha), and he is nicknamed ''\"aba ghusn\"'', and it has been told about him what suggests astuteness and intelligence, although overwhelmingly made foolish, and it has been said that some who antagonize him put out tales about him.|sign=[[Ibn al-Jawzi]]<ref>\"\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628\u064a \"\u0639\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\" \u0635 373 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u062f\u0647\u0627</ref>}}\n\nAs generations have gone by, new stories have been added to the Nasreddin corpus, others have been modified, and he and his tales have spread to many regions. The themes in the tales have become part of the folklore of a number of nations and express the national imaginations of a variety of cultures. Although most of them depict Nasreddin in an early small-village setting, the tales deal with concepts that have a certain timelessness. They purvey a pithy [[folk wisdom]] that triumphs over all trials and tribulations. The oldest manuscript of Nasreddin dates to 1571.\n\nToday, Nasreddin stories are told in a wide variety of regions, especially across the [[Muslim world]] and have been translated into many languages. Some regions independently developed a character similar to Nasreddin, and the stories have become part of a larger whole. In many regions, Nasreddin is a major part of the culture, and is quoted or alluded to frequently in daily life. Since there are thousands of different Nasreddin stories, one can be found to fit almost any occasion.<ref>Ohebsion, Rodney (2004) ''A Collection of Wisdom'', Immediex Publishing, {{ISBN|1-932968-19-9}}.</ref> Nasreddin often appears as a whimsical character of a large [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Chinese, [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Judeo-Spanish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], Russian, and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] [[Folklore|folk]] tradition of [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s, not entirely different from [[zen]] [[koan]]s.\n\n1996\u20131997 was declared International Nasreddin Year by [[UNESCO]].<ref>[http://www.rri.ro/art.shtml?lang=1&sec=170&art=27256 ''\"...UNESCO declared 1996\u20131997 the International Nasreddin Year...\"''].</ref>\n\n{{quote| Some people say that, whilst uttering what seemed madness, he was, in reality, divinely inspired, and that it was not madness but wisdom that he uttered.|sign=''The Turkish Jester or The Pleasantries of Cogia Nasr Eddin Effendi''<ref>{{cite book|title=The Turkish Jester or The Pleasantries of Cogia Nasr Eddin Effendi|year=1884|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16244 | others=Translated from the Turkish by [[George Borrow]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Name ==\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Goha story cloth.jpg|thumb|A Goha story cloth by Ahmed Yossery (2007) depicting a version of [[The miller, his son and the donkey]], [[The Children\u2019s Museum of Indianapolis]]]]\n\nMany peoples of the [[Near East|Near]], Middle East, South Asia and Central Asia claim Nasreddin as their own (''e.g.'', Turks,<ref name=nasruddin>The outrageous Wisdom of Nasruddin, ''[http://www.nasruddin.org/ Mullah Nasruddin]''; accessed 19 February 2007.</ref><ref name=\"Nasreddin Hoca\">{{cite web\n | title = Nasreddin Hoca\n | publisher=Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism\n | url = http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D3138DF7C92FCA5B4D0584F186FD0FCCD518\n | accessdate =28 December 2006\n}}</ref><ref name=sysinia>[http://www.sysindia.com/emagazine/mulla/mulla.html Sysindia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218094252/http://www.sysindia.com/emagazine/mulla/mulla.html |date=18 February 2007 }}, Mulla Nasreddin Stories, accessed 20 February 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.silk-road.com/folklore/nasreddin.html Silk-road.com], Nasreddin Hoca</ref> Afghans,<ref name=sysinia /> Iranians,<ref name=nasruddin /><ref>{{cite web| title=First Iranian Mullah who Was a Master in Anecdotes| publisher=Persian Journal|url=http://www.iranian.ws/iran_news/publish/printer_28786.shtml| accessdate=26 July 2009\n}}</ref> and Uzbeks).<ref name=\"psiche\">{{cite book|last= Fiorentini|first=Gianpaolo|title= Storie di Nasreddin|chapter= Nasreddin, una biografia possibile|publisher= Libreria Editrice Psiche|location=Toronto|year=2004|isbn=978-88-85142-71-8|chapter-url=http://www.psiche.info/estratti/psiche/StorieDiNasreddin.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407123310/http://www.psiche.info/estratti/psiche/StorieDiNasreddin.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 April 2004|accessdate=28 December 2006\n}}</ref> His name is spelt in a wide variety of ways: ''Nasrudeen'', ''Nasrudin'', ''Nasruddin'', ''Nasr ud-Din'', ''Nasredin'', ''Nasiruddin,'' ''Naseeruddin'', ''Nasr&nbsp;Eddin'', ''Nastradhin'', ''Nasreddine'', ''Nastratin'', ''Nusrettin'', ''Nasrettin'', ''Nostradin'', ''Nastradin'' (lit.: [[Nasr (surname)|Victory]] of the [[Din (Arabic)|Deen]]) and ''Nazaruddin''.

The Central Asian peoples also claim his local origin, as do Uyghurs.\n\n== Tales ==\nThe Nasreddin stories are known throughout the Middle East and have touched cultures around the world. Superficially, most of the Nasreddin stories may be told as jokes or humorous anecdotes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and [[caravanserai]]s of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasreddin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, followed by a moral and usually the little extra which brings the consciousness of the potential mystic a little further on the way to realization.<ref>Idris Shah (1964), ''The Sufis'', London: W. H. Allen {{ISBN|0-385-07966-4}}.</ref>\n\n=== Examples ===\n==== The Sermon ====\n:Once Nasreddin was invited to deliver a [[sermon]]. When he got on the pulpit, he asked, ''Do you know what I am going to say?'' The audience replied ''\"no\"'', so he announced, ''I have no desire to speak to people who don't even know what I will be talking about!'' and left.\n:The people felt embarrassed and called him back again the next day. This time, when he asked the same question, the people replied ''yes''. So Nasreddin said, ''Well, since you already know what I am going to say, I won't waste any more of your time!'' and left.\n:Now the people were really perplexed. They decided to try one more time and once again invited the Mulla to speak the following week. Once again he asked the same question \u2013 ''Do you know what I am going to say?'' Now the people were prepared and so half of them answered \"yes\" while the other half replied \"no\". So Nasreddin said ''Let the half who know what I am going to say, tell it to the half who don't,'' and left.<ref>Many written versions of this tale exist, for example in {{cite book|last=Kelsey|first=Alice|title=Once the Hodja|url=https://archive.org/details/oncehodja00kels|url-access=registration|year=1943|publisher=David McKay Company Inc}}</ref>\n\n==== Whom do you believe? ====\n[[File:Nasr Eddin Hodja statue in Bukhara Liab -i-Haouz complex.JPG|thumb|Nasreddin Hodja in [[Bukhara]]]]\n[[File:Harikalar Diyari Nasrettin Hoca 05981 nevit.jpg|thumb|Nasreddin Hodja in [[Ankara]]]]\n:A neighbour came to the gate of Mulla Nasreddin's yard.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp; June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

respectively.{{efn|For the Tsuen Wan incident, the police defended the officer's actions, saying that the officer and his colleague's lives were at risk as a group of protesters was assaulting another

police sought to counter this development, and suggested that in several instances, verbal abuse by protesters may have led officers to use the term.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/> An officer was reprimanded by the police for shouting derisive comments to protesters about the [[death of Chow Tsz-lok]].<ref name=\"scmp_3037087\"/> The police's description of a man wearing a yellow vest, who was taken to an alley, surrounded by police officers and apparently physically abused by one of them, as a \"yellow object\" due to supposedly impossible recognition of a person in the video footage, was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged police misconducts in the protests, although the protesters demand an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and IPCC lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> [[Carrie Lam]] has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8 November, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns.

disruption of public events and press conferences by protesters.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval ratings declined to 22.3 in October, lowest among all chief executives, and her performance was categorised as \"disastrous\" alongside [[Secretary for Security]] [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], prompting institute director [[Robert Chung]] to describe the situation as \"dire\".<ref

both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823

the heavy-handed treatment of protesters.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190625_policeconfusion\"/><ref name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of the respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, the police's aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represented hostility and suppression and police's actions on the protesters has resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust towards the police.<ref

force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\". Criminals also had taken advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain types of crimes such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency as compared to the same period in 2018.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government has spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests have deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the city's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded the government to fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12 June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15 June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18 June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead the government despite calls asking her to resign. For the demand to set up an independent commission to investigate police misconduct, she insisted that the existing mechanism, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) would suffice.<ref name=\"scmp_3017795\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190709\"/>\n\nAfter condemning the protesters for storming the legislature on 1 July for their \"use of extreme violence\"<ref name=\"hkfp_20190702_condemnsoccupation\"/> and defacing the national emblem during the 21 July protest,<ref name=\"coconutshk_20190722\"/> Lam suggested in early August that the protests had derailed from their original purposes and that its goal was to challenge China's sovereignty and damage \"[[one country, two systems]]\".<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> She suggested that the radical protesters were dragging Hong Kong to a \"point of no return\"<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\" /> and that they had \"no stake in society\",<ref name=\"standardhk_132809\"/> a remark that received criticisms from some civil servants.<ref name=\"standardhk_133040\"/>\n\nFollowing a rally on 18 August that was attended by more than 1.7&nbsp;million people, Lam announced that she would create platforms for dialogue.<ref name=\"scmp_3023512\"/> On 4 September, Lam announced that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill, introduce measures such as introducing new members to the IPCC, engaging in dialogue in a community level, and inviting academics to evaluate the deep-rooted problems of Hong Kong. However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer youth in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp; June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners.

Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts

Criminals also had taken advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain types of crimes such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency as compared to the same period in 2018.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government has spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests have deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the city's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

{"title_page": "Happy ending", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Original research|date=March 2010}}\nA '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the positive characters, their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.\n\nIn storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of \"[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]\", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. \n\nA happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, \"'''happily ever after'''\" or \"and they lived happily ever after\". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula \"they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness\" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with \"they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day\".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that \"there were good days and bad days\" afterwards.\n\n==Features==\nA happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': \"Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n===William Shakespeare===\nThe presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the seventeenth century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end \u2013 [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened \u2013 equally, with no lasting success \u2013 to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. \n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.\n\n===Don Juan===\n\nMost interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's \u2013 thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].\n\n===Opera===\n\nIn 17th Century Italy, [[Francesco Cavalli]] wrote the [[opera]] ''[[Didone (opera)| Didone]]'', based on [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' (Book 4 in particular) and set to a [[libretto]] by [[Giovanni Francesco Busenello]]. However, Busenello's  libretto changed the tragic ending provided by Virgil, in which [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] commits suicide after [[Aeneas]] abandons her. In Busenello's version Iarbas, King of the Getuli, shows up in the nick of time to save Dido from herself, and she ends up happily marrying him.\n\n===Novels===\nA ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carr\u00e9]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: \"''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''\"<ref>''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.</ref>\n\n[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his \"[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]\" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately marry.<ref>Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997).

Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film \"[[My Fair Lady]]\".\n\n===Hollywood films===\n\nIn numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. \n* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. \n* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). \n* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.\n* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.\n* [[Herman Wouk]]'s novel ''[[Marjorie Morningstar (novel)| Marjorie Morningstar]]'' ends with the formerly vibrant protagonist giving up her dreams of an artistic career, marrying a mediocre middle-class man approved by her parents and becoming totally reconciled to the commonplace life of a suburban housewife and mother. In her review for [[Slate Magazine]], [[Alana Newhouse]] wrote that \"most female readers cry when they reach the end of this book, and for good reason. Marjorie Morningstar, as they came to know her, has become another woman entirely\"; Newhouse expressed the opinion that an adaptation to a film or a stage play which would keep the book's ending \"would not run for a week\". But the makers of [[Marjorie Morningstar (film)|the film version]] did change the ending, letting Marjorie end up in the loving arms of a talented, sensitive and warm-hearted playwright \u2013 whom she unwisely rejected in the book, and who in the film version can be expected to encourage and support her in launching her own artistic career.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Eucatastrophe]]\n* [[Once upon a time]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Fantasy fiction}}\n\n[[Category:Endings]]\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Plot (narrative)]]\n[[Category:Recurrent elements in fairy tales]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Original research|date=March 2010}}\nA '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the positive characters, their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.\n\nIn storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of \"[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]\", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. \n\nA happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, \"'''happily ever after'''\" or \"and they lived happily ever after\". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula \"they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness\" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with \"they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day\".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that \"there were good days and bad days\" afterwards.\n\n==Features==\nA happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': \"Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n===William Shakespeare===\nThe presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the seventeenth century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end \u2013 [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened \u2013 equally, with no lasting success \u2013 to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. \n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.\n\n===Don Juan===\n\nMost interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's \u2013 thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].\n\n===Opera===\n\nIn 17th Century Italy, [[Francesco Cavalli]] wrote the [[opera]] ''[[Didone (opera)| Didone]]'', based on [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' (Book 4 in particular) and set to a [[libretto]] by [[Giovanni Francesco Busenello]]. However, Busenello's  libretto changed the tragic ending provided by Virgil, in which [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] commits suicide after [[Aeneas]] abandons her. In Busenello's version Iarbas, King of the Getuli, shows up in the nick of time to save Dido from herself, and she ends up happily marrying him.\n\n===Novels===\nA ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carr\u00e9]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: \"''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''\"<ref>''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.</ref>\n\n[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his \"[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]\" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.<ref>Evans, T.F.

Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film \"[[My Fair Lady]]\".\n\n===Hollywood films===\n\nIn numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. \n* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. \n* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). \n* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.\n* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.\n* [[Herman Wouk]]'s novel ''[[Marjorie Morningstar (novel)| Marjorie Morningstar]]'' ends with the formerly vibrant protagonist giving up her dreams of an artistic career, marrying a mediocre middle-class man approved by her parents and becoming totally reconciled to the commonplace life of a suburban housewife and mother. In her review for [[Slate Magazine]], [[Alana Newhouse]] wrote that \"most female readers cry when they reach the end of this book, and for good reason. Marjorie Morningstar, as they came to know her, has become another woman entirely\"; Newhouse expressed the opinion that an adaptation to a film or a stage play which would keep the book's ending \"would not run for a week\".

Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of a specific frequency (e.g., [[musical instrument]]s), or pick out specific frequencies from a complex vibration containing many frequencies (e.g., filters).\n\nThe term ''resonance'' (from [[Latin]] ''resonantia'', 'echo', from ''resonare'', 'resound') originated from the field of acoustics, particularly the [[sympathetic resonance]] observed in musical instruments, e.g., when one string starts to vibrate and produce sound after a different one is struck. Another example, [[electrical resonance]], occurs in a [[Electrical network|circuit]] with [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s because the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor generates an electric current in its windings that charges the capacitor, and then the discharging capacitor provides an electric current that builds the magnetic field in the inductor. Once the circuit is charged, the oscillation is self-sustaining, and there is no external periodic driving action.{{clarify|date=December 2019}}  This is analogous to a mechanical [[pendulum]], where [[mechanical energy]] is converted back and forth between [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy|potential]], and both systems are forms of [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s.\n\n==Overview==\n\nResonance occurs when a system is able to store and easily transfer energy between two or more different [[storage mode]]s (such as kinetic energy and potential energy in the case of a simple pendulum). However, there are some losses from cycle to cycle, called [[damping]]. When damping is small, the resonant frequency is approximately equal to the [[natural frequency]] of the system, which is a frequency of unforced vibrations. Some systems have multiple, distinct, resonant frequencies.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Little girl on swing.jpg|thumb|Pushing a person in a [[swing (seat)|swing]] is a common example of resonance. The loaded swing, a [[pendulum]], has a [[natural frequency]] of oscillation, its resonant frequency, and resists being pushed at a faster or slower rate.]]\n\nA familiar example is a playground [[Swing (seat)|swing]], which acts as a [[pendulum]]. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the swing's natural oscillations.\n\nResonance occurs widely in nature, and is exploited in many manmade devices. It is the mechanism by which virtually all [[sinusoidal]] waves and vibrations are generated. Many sounds we hear, such as when hard objects of [[metal]], [[glass]], or [[wood]] are struck, are caused by brief resonant vibrations in the object. Light and other short wavelength [[electromagnetic radiation]] is produced by resonance on an [[Atomic spacing|atomic scale]], such as [[electron]]s in atoms.  Other examples of resonance:\n\n* Timekeeping mechanisms of modern clocks and watches, e.g., the [[balance wheel]] in a mechanical [[watch]] and the [[quartz crystal]] in a [[quartz watch]]\n* [[Tidal resonance]] of the [[Bay of Fundy]]\n* [[Acoustic resonance]]s of [[musical instruments]] and the human [[vocal tract]]\n* Shattering of a crystal wineglass when exposed to a musical tone of the right pitch (its resonant frequency)\n* [[Friction idiophone]]s, such as making a glass object (glass, bottle, vase) [[vibration|vibrate]] by rubbing around its rim with a fingertip\n* [[Electrical resonance]] of [[tuned circuit]]s in [[radio]]s and [[TV]]s that allow radio frequencies to be selectively received\n* Creation of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] light by [[optical resonance]] in a [[laser]] [[Optical cavity|cavity]]\n* [[Orbital resonance]] as exemplified by some [[natural satellite|moons]] of the [[solar system]]'s [[gas giants]]\n* Material resonances in atomic scale are the basis of several [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that are used in [[condensed matter physics]]\n**[[Electron spin resonance]]\n**[[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]]\n**[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]]\n\n===Tacoma Narrows Bridge===\n{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)}}\n\nThe dramatically visible, rhythmic twisting that resulted in the 1940 collapse of \"Galloping Gertie\", the original [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], is mistakenly characterized as an example of resonance phenomenon in certain textbooks.<ref name = \"Resnick and Halliday\"/> The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated interaction between the bridge and the winds passing through it\u2014a phenomenon known as [[aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]], which is a kind of \"self-sustaining vibration\" as referred to in the nonlinear theory of vibrations.

It may cause violent swaying motions and even catastrophic failure in improperly constructed structures including bridges, buildings, trains, and aircraft. When designing objects, [[engineers]]  must ensure the mechanical resonance frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of motors or other oscillating parts, a phenomenon known as [[mechanical resonance#Resonance disaster|resonance disaster]].\n\nAvoiding resonance disasters is a major concern in every building, tower, and [[bridge]] [[construction]] project. As a countermeasure, [[shock mount]]s can be installed to absorb resonant frequencies and thus dissipate the absorbed energy. The [[Taipei 101]] building relies on a {{convert|660|t|ST|adj=mid|[[pendulum]]}}\u2014a [[tuned mass damper]]\u2014to cancel resonance. Furthermore, the structure is designed to resonate at a frequency that does not typically occur. Buildings in [[seismic]] zones are often constructed to take into account the oscillating frequencies of expected ground motion. In addition, [[engineer]]s designing objects having engines must ensure that the mechanical resonant frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of the motors or other strongly oscillating parts.\n\n[[Clock]]s keep time by mechanical resonance in a [[balance wheel]], [[pendulum]], or [[Quartz clock|quartz crystal]].\n\nThe cadence of runners has been hypothesized to be energetically favorable due to resonance between the elastic energy stored in the lower limb and the mass of the runner.<ref name=\"Snyder and Farley.

For humans, hearing is normally limited to frequencies between about 20&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&nbsp;Hz (20&nbsp;[[kHz]]),<ref>[[Harry F. Olson]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC&pg=PA248 ''Music, Physics and Engineering.''] Dover Publications, 1967, pp. 248\u2013249. \"Under very favorable conditions most individuals can obtain tonal characteristics as low as 12 Hz.\"</ref>  Many objects and materials act as resonators  with resonant frequencies within this range, and when struck vibrate mechanically, pushing on the surrounding air to create sound waves.  This is the source of many percussive sounds we hear.   \n\nAcoustic resonance is an important consideration for instrument builders, as most acoustic [[Musical instrument|instruments]] use [[resonator]]s, such as the [[string resonance|strings]] and body of a [[violin]], the length of tube in a [[flute]], and the shape of, and tension on, a drum membrane.\n\nLike mechanical resonance, acoustic resonance can result in catastrophic failure of the object at resonance. The classic example of this is breaking a wine glass with sound at the precise resonant frequency of the glass, although this is difficult in practice.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://demoweb.physics.ucla.edu/content/50-breaking-glass-sound|title =  Breaking Glass with Sound|publisher = UCLA Physics & Astronomy|website = Instructional Resource Lab}}</ref>\n\n===Electrical resonance===\n{{Main|Electrical resonance}}\n[[Image:Tuned circuit animation 3.gif|thumb|upright=1.1|Animation illustrating electrical resonance in a [[tuned circuit]], consisting of a [[capacitor]] (C) and an [[inductor]] (L) connected together.

Resonance in circuits are used for both transmitting and receiving wireless communications such as television, cell phones and radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Physics Of Resonance|url=http://www.intuitor.com/resonance/circuits.html|website=Intuitor|accessdate=10 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Optical resonance===\n{{Main|Optical cavity}}\n\nAn [[optical cavity]], also called an ''optical resonator'', is an arrangement of [[mirror]]s that forms a [[standing wave]] [[cavity resonator]] for [[light wave]]s. Optical cavities are a major component of [[laser]]s, surrounding the [[gain medium]] and providing [[feedback]] of the laser light. They are also used in [[optical parametric oscillator]]s and some [[interferometer]]s. Light confined in the cavity reflects multiple times producing standing waves for certain resonant frequencies. The standing wave patterns produced are called \"modes\". [[Longitudinal mode]]s differ only in frequency while [[transverse mode]]s differ for different frequencies and have different intensity patterns across the cross-section of the beam. [[Optical ring resonators|Ring resonators]] and [[Whispering gallery|whispering galleries]] are examples of optical resonators that do not form standing waves.\n\nDifferent resonator types are distinguished by the focal lengths of the two mirrors and the distance between them; flat mirrors are not often used because of the difficulty of aligning them precisely. The geometry (resonator type) must be chosen so the beam remains stable, i.e., the beam size does not continue to grow with each reflection. Resonator types are also designed to meet other criteria such as minimum beam waist or having no focal point (and therefore intense light at that point) inside the cavity.\n\nOptical cavities are designed to have a very large [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]].<ref>[http://www.rp-photonics.com/q_factor.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology - ''Q'' factor, quality factor, cavity, resonator, oscillator, frequency standards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A beam reflects a large number of times with little [[attenuation]]\u2014therefore the frequency [[line width]] of the beam is small compared to the frequency of the laser.\n\nAdditional optical resonances are [[guided-mode resonance]]s and [[surface plasmon resonance]], which result in anomalous reflection and high evanescent fields at resonance. In this case, the resonant modes are guided modes of a waveguide or surface plasmon modes of a dielectric-metallic interface. These modes are usually excited by a subwavelength grating.\n\n===Orbital resonance===\n{{Main|Orbital resonance}}\n\nIn [[celestial mechanics]], an [[orbital resonance]] occurs when two [[orbit]]ing bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually due to their [[orbital period]]s being related by a ratio of two small integers. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies. In most cases, this results in an ''unstable'' interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of [[Jupiter]]'s moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the 2:3 resonance between [[Pluto]] and [[Neptune]]. Unstable resonances with [[Saturn]]'s inner moons give rise to gaps in the [[rings of Saturn]]. The special case of 1:1 resonance (between bodies with similar orbital radii) causes large Solar System bodies to [[Clearing the neighbourhood|clear the neighborhood]] around their orbits by ejecting nearly everything else around them; this effect is used in the current [[definition of planet|definition of a planet]].\n\n=== Atomic, particle, and molecular resonance ===\n{{Main|Nuclear magnetic resonance|Resonance (particle physics)}}\n\n[[File:HWB-NMR - 900MHz - 21.2 Tesla.jpg|thumb|upright|NMR Magnet at HWB-NMR, Birmingham, UK. In its strong 21.2-[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] field, the proton resonance is at 900&nbsp;MHz.]]\n[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) is the name given to a physical resonance phenomenon involving the observation of specific [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[magnetism|magnetic]] properties of an [[atom]]ic [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] in the presence of an applied, external magnetic field. Many scientific techniques exploit NMR phenomena to study [[molecular physics]], [[crystallography|crystal]]s, and non-crystalline materials through [[NMR spectroscopy]]. NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).\n\nAll nuclei containing odd numbers of [[nucleon]]s have an intrinsic [[magnetic moment]] and [[angular momentum]]. A key feature of NMR is that the resonant frequency of a particular substance is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonant frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Therefore, the particle can be located quite precisely by its resonant frequency.\n\n[[Electron paramagnetic resonance]], otherwise known as ''electron spin resonance'' (ESR), is a spectroscopic technique similar to NMR, but uses unpaired electrons instead. Materials for which this can be applied are much more limited since the material needs to both have an unpaired spin and be [[paramagnetic]].\n\nThe [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]] is the resonant and [[recoil]]-free emission and absorption of [[gamma ray]] photons by atoms bound in a solid form.\n\n[[Resonance (particle physics)|Resonance in particle physics]] appears in similar circumstances to [[classical physics]] at the level of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. However, they can also be thought of as unstable particles, with the formula above valid if ''\u0393'' is the [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] and ''\u03a9'' replaced by the particle's mass ''M''. In that case, the formula comes from the particle's [[Propagator (Quantum Theory)|propagator]], with its mass replaced by the [[complex number]] ''M''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''i\u0393''. The formula is further related to the particle's [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] by the [[optical theorem]].\n\n==Theory==\n[[File:Universal Resonance Curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|\"Universal Resonance Curve\", a symmetric approximation to the normalized response of a resonant circuit; [[abscissa]] values are deviation from center frequency, in units of center frequency divided by 2Q; [[ordinate]] is relative amplitude, and phase in cycles; dashed curves compare the range of responses of real two-pole circuits for a ''Q'' value of 5; for higher ''Q'' values, there is less deviation from the universal curve.

This is a [[Lorentzian function]], or [[Cauchy distribution]], and this response is found in many physical situations involving resonant systems. ''\u0393'' is a parameter dependent on the [[harmonic oscillator|damping]] of the oscillator, and is known as the ''linewidth'' of the resonance. Heavily damped oscillators tend to have broad linewidths, and respond to a wider range of driving frequencies around the resonant frequency. The linewidth is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|inversely proportional]] to the [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]], which is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance.\n\nIn [[radio engineering]] and [[electronics engineering]], this approximate symmetric response is known as the ''universal resonance curve'', a concept introduced by [[Frederick E. Terman]] in 1932 to simplify the approximate analysis of radio circuits with a range of center frequencies and ''Q'' values.<ref>{{cite book | title = Radio Engineering | author = Frederick Emmons Terman | publisher = McGraw-Hill Book Company | year = 1932 | url = https://archive.org/details/radioengineering00term\n | url-access = registration | quote = terman frederick universal. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Circuits, Signals, and Systems | author = William McC.

Systems with one degree of freedom, such as a mass on a spring, [[pendulum]]s, [[balance wheel]]s, and [[RLC circuit|LC tuned circuits]] have one resonant frequency. Systems with two degrees of freedom, such as [[Double pendulum|coupled pendulums]] and [[resonant transformer]]s can have two resonant frequencies. As the number of coupled harmonic oscillators grows, the time it takes to transfer energy from one to the next becomes significant. The vibrations in them begin to travel through the coupled harmonic oscillators in waves, from one oscillator to the next.\n\nExtended objects that can experience resonance due to vibrations inside them are called [[resonator]]s, such as [[organ pipe]]s, [[vibrating string]]s, [[quartz crystal]]s, [[microwave]] and [[laser]] [[Resonators#Cavity resonators|cavities]]. Since these can be viewed as being made of many coupled moving parts (such as [[atom]]s), they can have correspondingly many resonant frequencies. The vibrations inside them travel as waves, at an approximately constant velocity, bouncing back and forth between the sides of the resonator. If the distance between the sides is ''d'', the length of a roundtrip is 2''d''. To cause resonance, the phase of a [[sinusoidal]] wave after a roundtrip must be equal to the initial phase, so the waves reinforce the oscillation. So the condition for resonance in a resonator is that the roundtrip distance, 2''d'', be equal to an [[integer]] number of wavelengths ''\u03bb'' of the wave:\n\n:<math>2d = N\\lambda,\\qquad\\qquad N \\in \\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}</math>\n\nIf the velocity of a wave is ''v'', the frequency is ''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|''v''|''\u03bb''}} so the resonant frequencies are:\n\n:<math>f = \\frac{Nv}{2d}\\qquad\\qquad N \\in \\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}</math>\n\nSo the resonant frequencies of resonators, called [[normal modes]], are equally spaced multiples of a lowest frequency called the [[fundamental frequency]]. The multiples are often called [[overtone]]s. There may be several such series of resonant frequencies, corresponding to different modes of oscillation.\n\n== Quality factor==\n{{Main|Q factor}}\nThe [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]] or ''quality factor'' is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] parameter that describes how [[damping|under-damped]] an [[oscillation|oscillator]] or [[resonator]] is,<ref>{{cite book | title = Electric Power Transformer Engineering | author = James H.

A pendulum suspended from a high-quality bearing, oscillating in air, has a high ''Q'', while a pendulum immersed in oil has a low ''Q''. To sustain a system in resonance in constant amplitude by providing power externally, the energy provided in each cycle must be less than the energy stored in the system (i.e., the sum of the potential and kinetic) by a factor of {{sfrac|''Q''|2{{pi}}}}. Oscillators with high-quality factors have low [[damping]], which tends to make them ring longer.\n\n[[sine wave|Sinusoidally]] driven [[resonator]]s having higher Q factors resonate with greater amplitudes (at the resonant frequency) but have a smaller range of frequencies around the frequency at which they resonate. The range of frequencies at which the oscillator resonates is called the bandwidth. Thus, a high-''Q'' [[RLC circuit|tuned circuit]] in a radio receiver would be more difficult to tune, but would have greater [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]], it would do a better job of filtering out signals from other stations that lie nearby on the spectrum. High Q oscillators operate over a smaller range of frequencies and are more stable. (See [[oscillator phase noise]].)\n\nThe quality factor of oscillators varies substantially from system to system. Systems for which damping is important (such as dampers keeping a door from slamming shut) have ''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}. Clocks, lasers, and other systems that need either strong resonance or high frequency stability need high-quality factors. [[Tuning fork]]s have quality factors around ''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000.

Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of a specific frequency (e.g., [[musical instrument]]s), or pick out specific frequencies from a complex vibration containing many frequencies (e.g., filters).\n\nThe term ''resonance'' (from [[Latin]] ''resonantia'', 'echo', from ''resonare'', 'resound') originated from the field of acoustics, particularly the [[sympathetic resonance]] observed in musical instruments, e.g., when one string starts to vibrate and produce sound after a different one is struck. Another example, [[electrical resonance]], occurs in a [[Electrical network|circuit]] with [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s because the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor generates an electric current in its windings that charges the capacitor, and then the discharging capacitor provides an electric current that builds the magnetic field in the inductor. Once the circuit is charged, the oscillation is self-sustaining, and there is no external periodic driving action.{{clarify|date=December 2019}}  This is analogous to a mechanical [[pendulum]], where [[mechanical energy]] is converted back and forth between [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy|potential]], and both systems are forms of [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s.\n\n==Overview==\n\nResonance occurs when a system is able to store and easily transfer energy between two or more different [[storage mode]]s (such as kinetic energy and potential energy in the case of a simple pendulum). However, there are some losses from cycle to cycle, called [[damping]]. When damping is small, the resonant frequency is approximately equal to the [[natural frequency]] of the system, which is a frequency of unforced vibrations. Some systems have multiple, distinct, resonant frequencies.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Little girl on swing.jpg|thumb|Pushing a person in a [[swing (seat)|swing]] is a common example of resonance. The loaded swing, a [[pendulum]], has a [[natural frequency]] of oscillation, its resonant frequency, and resists being pushed at a faster or slower rate.]]\n\nA familiar example is a playground [[Swing (seat)|swing]], which acts as a [[pendulum]]. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the swing's natural oscillations.\n\nResonance occurs widely in nature, and is exploited in many manmade devices. It is the mechanism by which virtually all [[sinusoidal]] waves and vibrations are generated. Many sounds we hear, such as when hard objects of [[metal]], [[glass]], or [[wood]] are struck, are caused by brief resonant vibrations in the object. Light and other short wavelength [[electromagnetic radiation]] is produced by resonance on an [[Atomic spacing|atomic scale]], such as [[electron]]s in atoms.

It may cause violent swaying motions and even catastrophic failure in improperly constructed structures including bridges, buildings, trains, and aircraft. When designing objects, [[engineers]]  must ensure the mechanical resonance frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of motors or other oscillating parts, a phenomenon known as [[mechanical resonance#Resonance disaster|resonance disaster]].\n\nAvoiding resonance disasters is a major concern in every building, tower, and [[bridge]] [[construction]] project. As a countermeasure, [[shock mount]]s can be installed to absorb resonant frequencies and thus dissipate the absorbed energy. The [[Taipei 101]] building relies on a {{convert|660|t|ST|adj=mid|[[pendulum]]}}\u2014a [[tuned mass damper]]\u2014to cancel resonance. Furthermore, the structure is designed to resonate at a frequency that does not typically occur.

Optical cavities are a major component of [[laser]]s, surrounding the [[gain medium]] and providing [[feedback]] of the laser light. They are also used in [[optical parametric oscillator]]s and some [[interferometer]]s. Light confined in the cavity reflects multiple times producing standing waves for certain resonant frequencies. The standing wave patterns produced are called \"modes\". [[Longitudinal mode]]s differ only in frequency while [[transverse mode]]s differ for different frequencies and have different intensity patterns across the cross-section of the beam. [[Optical ring resonators|Ring resonators]] and [[Whispering gallery|whispering galleries]] are examples of optical resonators that do not form standing waves.\n\nDifferent resonator types are distinguished by the focal lengths of the two mirrors and the distance between them; flat mirrors are not often used because of the difficulty of aligning them precisely. The geometry (resonator type) must be chosen so the beam remains stable, i.e., the beam size does not continue to grow with each reflection. Resonator types are also designed to meet other criteria such as minimum beam waist or having no focal point (and therefore intense light at that point) inside the cavity.\n\nOptical cavities are designed to have a very large [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]].<ref>[http://www.rp-photonics.com/q_factor.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology - ''Q'' factor, quality factor, cavity, resonator, oscillator, frequency standards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A beam reflects a large number of times with little [[attenuation]]\u2014therefore the frequency [[line width]] of the beam is small compared to the frequency of the laser.\n\nAdditional optical resonances are [[guided-mode resonance]]s and [[surface plasmon resonance]], which result in anomalous reflection and high evanescent fields at resonance. In this case, the resonant modes are guided modes of a waveguide or surface plasmon modes of a dielectric-metallic interface. These modes are usually excited by a subwavelength grating.\n\n===Orbital resonance===\n{{Main|Orbital resonance}}\n\nIn [[celestial mechanics]], an [[orbital resonance]] occurs when two [[orbit]]ing bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually due to their [[orbital period]]s being related by a ratio of two small integers. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies. In most cases, this results in an ''unstable'' interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of [[Jupiter]]'s moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the 2:3 resonance between [[Pluto]] and [[Neptune]]. Unstable resonances with [[Saturn]]'s inner moons give rise to gaps in the [[rings of Saturn]]. The special case of 1:1 resonance (between bodies with similar orbital radii) causes large Solar System bodies to [[Clearing the neighbourhood|clear the neighborhood]] around their orbits by ejecting nearly everything else around them; this effect is used in the current [[definition of planet|definition of a planet]].\n\n=== Atomic, particle, and molecular resonance ===\n{{Main|Nuclear magnetic resonance|Resonance (particle physics)}}\n\n[[File:HWB-NMR - 900MHz - 21.2 Tesla.jpg|thumb|upright|NMR Magnet at HWB-NMR, Birmingham, UK.

It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonant frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Therefore, the particle can be located quite precisely by its resonant frequency.\n\n[[Electron paramagnetic resonance]], otherwise known as ''electron spin resonance'' (ESR), is a spectroscopic technique similar to NMR, but uses unpaired electrons instead. Materials for which this can be applied are much more limited since the material needs to both have an unpaired spin and be [[paramagnetic]].\n\nThe [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]] is the resonant and [[recoil]]-free emission and absorption of [[gamma ray]] photons by atoms bound in a solid form.\n\n[[Resonance (particle physics)|Resonance in particle physics]] appears in similar circumstances to [[classical physics]] at the level of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. However, they can also be thought of as unstable particles, with the formula above valid if ''\u0393'' is the [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] and ''\u03a9'' replaced by the particle's mass ''M''. In that case, the formula comes from the particle's [[Propagator (Quantum Theory)|propagator]], with its mass replaced by the [[complex number]] ''M''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''i\u0393''. The formula is further related to the particle's [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] by the [[optical theorem]].\n\n==Theory==\n[[File:Universal Resonance Curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|\"Universal Resonance Curve\", a symmetric approximation to the normalized response of a resonant circuit; [[abscissa]] values are deviation from center frequency, in units of center frequency divided by 2Q; [[ordinate]] is relative amplitude, and phase in cycles; dashed curves compare the range of responses of real two-pole circuits for a ''Q'' value of 5; for higher ''Q'' values, there is less deviation from the universal curve. Crosses mark the edges of the 3&nbsp;dB bandwidth (gain 0.707, phase shift 45\u00b0 or 0.125 cycle).]]\n\nThe exact response of a resonance, especially for frequencies far from the resonant frequency, depends on the details of the physical system, and is usually not exactly symmetric about the resonant frequency, as illustrated for the [[simple harmonic oscillator]] above.\nFor a lightly [[damping|damped]] linear oscillator with a resonance frequency ''\u03a9'', the ''intensity'' of oscillations ''I'' when the system is driven with a driving frequency ''\u03c9'' is typically approximated by a formula that is symmetric about the resonance frequency:<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Lasers\n | author = A.

This is a [[Lorentzian function]], or [[Cauchy distribution]], and this response is found in many physical situations involving resonant systems. ''\u0393'' is a parameter dependent on the [[harmonic oscillator|damping]] of the oscillator, and is known as the ''linewidth'' of the resonance. Heavily damped oscillators tend to have broad linewidths, and respond to a wider range of driving frequencies around the resonant frequency. The linewidth is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|inversely proportional]] to the [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]], which is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance.\n\nIn [[radio engineering]] and [[electronics engineering]], this approximate symmetric response is known as the ''universal resonance curve'', a concept introduced by [[Frederick E. Terman]] in 1932 to simplify the approximate analysis of radio circuits with a range of center frequencies and ''Q'' values.<ref>{{cite book | title = Radio Engineering | author = Frederick Emmons Terman | publisher = McGraw-Hill Book Company | year = 1932 | url = https://archive.org/details/radioengineering00term\n | url-access = registration | quote = terman frederick universal. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Circuits, Signals, and Systems | author = William McC.

Systems with one degree of freedom, such as a mass on a spring, [[pendulum]]s, [[balance wheel]]s, and [[RLC circuit|LC tuned circuits]] have one resonant frequency. Systems with two degrees of freedom, such as [[Double pendulum|coupled pendulums]] and [[resonant transformer]]s can have two resonant frequencies. As the number of coupled harmonic oscillators grows, the time it takes to transfer energy from one to the next becomes significant. The vibrations in them begin to travel through the coupled harmonic oscillators in waves, from one oscillator to the next.\n\nExtended objects that can experience resonance due to vibrations inside them are called [[resonator]]s, such as [[organ pipe]]s, [[vibrating string]]s, [[quartz crystal]]s, [[microwave]] and [[laser]] [[Resonators#Cavity resonators|cavities]]. Since these can be viewed as being made of many coupled moving parts (such as [[atom]]s), they can have correspondingly many resonant frequencies. The vibrations inside them travel as waves, at an approximately constant velocity, bouncing back and forth between the sides of the resonator. If the distance between the sides is ''d'', the length of a roundtrip is 2''d''. To cause resonance, the phase of a [[sinusoidal]] wave after a roundtrip must be equal to the initial phase, so the waves reinforce the oscillation. So the condition for resonance in a resonator is that the roundtrip distance, 2''d'', be equal to an [[integer]] number of wavelengths ''\u03bb'' of the wave:\n\n:<math>2d = N\\lambda,\\qquad\\qquad N \\in \\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}</math>\n\nIf the velocity of a wave is ''v'', the frequency is ''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|''v''|''\u03bb''}} so the resonant frequencies are:\n\n:<math>f = \\frac{Nv}{2d}\\qquad\\qquad N \\in \\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}</math>\n\nSo the resonant frequencies of resonators, called [[normal modes]], are equally spaced multiples of a lowest frequency called the [[fundamental frequency]]. The multiples are often called [[overtone]]s. There may be several such series of resonant frequencies, corresponding to different modes of oscillation.\n\n== Quality factor==\n{{Main|Q factor}}\nThe [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]] or ''quality factor'' is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] parameter that describes how [[damping|under-damped]] an [[oscillation|oscillator]] or [[resonator]] is,<ref>{{cite book | title = Electric Power Transformer Engineering | author = James H.

A pendulum suspended from a high-quality bearing, oscillating in air, has a high ''Q'', while a pendulum immersed in oil has a low ''Q''. To sustain a system in resonance in constant amplitude by providing power externally, the energy provided in each cycle must be less than the energy stored in the system (i.e., the sum of the potential and kinetic) by a factor of {{sfrac|''Q''|2{{pi}}}}. Oscillators with high-quality factors have low [[damping]], which tends to make them ring longer.\n\n[[sine wave|Sinusoidally]] driven [[resonator]]s having higher Q factors resonate with greater amplitudes (at the resonant frequency) but have a smaller range of frequencies around the frequency at which they resonate. The range of frequencies at which the oscillator resonates is called the bandwidth. Thus, a high-''Q'' [[RLC circuit|tuned circuit]] in a radio receiver would be more difficult to tune, but would have greater [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]], it would do a better job of filtering out signals from other stations that lie nearby on the spectrum. High Q oscillators operate over a smaller range of frequencies and are more stable. (See [[oscillator phase noise]].)\n\nThe quality factor of oscillators varies substantially from system to system. Systems for which damping is important (such as dampers keeping a door from slamming shut) have ''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}. Clocks, lasers, and other systems that need either strong resonance or high frequency stability need high-quality factors. [[Tuning fork]]s have quality factors around ''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000. The quality factor of [[atomic clock]]s and some high-''Q'' [[optical cavity|lasers]] can reach as high as 10<sup>11</sup><ref>[http://www.rp-photonics.com/q_factor.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology: ''Q'' factor]</ref> and higher.<ref>[http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm Time and Frequency from A to Z: Q to Ra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm |date=2008-05-04 }}</ref>\n\nThere are many alternate quantities used by physicists and engineers to describe how damped an oscillator is that are closely related to its quality factor. Important examples include: the [[damping ratio]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|relative bandwidth]], [[oscillator linewidth|linewidth]], and bandwidth measured in [[Octave (electronics)|octave]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Resonance}}\n{{Portal|Electronics|Physics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em|small=yes}}\n* [[Acoustic resonance]]\n* [[Antiresonance]]\n* [[Center frequency]]\n* [[Cymatics]]\n* [[Damping]]\n* [[Driven harmonic motion]]\n* [[Earthquake engineering]]\n* [[Electrical resonance]]\n* [[Electric dipole spin resonance]] \n* [[Formant]]\n* [[Harmonic oscillator]]\n* [[Electrical impedance|Impedance]]\n* [[Limbic resonance]]\n* [[Nonlinear resonance]]\n* [[Parametric oscillator]]\n* [[Positive feedback]]\n* [[Q factor]]\n* [[Resonance disaster]]\n* [[Resonator]]\n* [[Schumann resonance]]\n* [[Simple harmonic motion]]\n* [[Stochastic resonance]]\n* [[Sympathetic string]]\n* [[Tuned circuit]]\n* [[Vibration]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.answers.com/topic/resonance Definition of Resonance] - \"The increase in amplitude of oscillation of an electric or mechanical system exposed to a periodic force whose frequency is equal or very close to the natural undamped frequency of the system.\"\n*[http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch18/ch18.html Resonance] - a chapter from an online textbook\n*[[Brian Greene|Greene, Brian]], \"''[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/resonance.html Resonance in strings]''\".

Plans were made to construct an entirely new deep-water port. Kompong Saom (Kampong Som)  was selected for water depth and ease of access. In August 1955, a French/Cambodian construction team cut a base camp into the unoccupied jungle in the area that is now known as Hawaii Beach.

Inconsistency and chaos during the long [[Cambodian Civil War|civil wars]] had far greater impact on the city's current image.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/magazine/the-city-he-built.html |title= The City He Built |work= The New York Times|date= May 15, 2005 |accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/7days/vann-molyvann-my-legacy-will-disappear |title= Vann Molyvann: my legacy will disappear|work= Phnom Penh Post|date= January 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the first urban plan for the city was completed for a population of 55,000 residents; it included cycle paths and green spaces. The plan also clearly marked out zoning for the port, the railway network, the town center with municipal offices, business and residential housing, and finally a tourist zone to the south along the beaches. A feasibility study by the United States Operations Mission (USOM) looked at drawing on a new water supply from the Prek Tuk Sap and existing lagoons; these were subsequently improved (cut off from the sea) and used as the initial source for town supply. The reservoirs are still operational, although insufficient for today's demands.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/sihanoukville-runs-dry-during-water-crisis-16609/ |title=Sihanoukville Runs Dry During Water Crisis|work=The Cambodia Daily |date=April 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ekreach Road Sihanoukville.jpg|thumb|left|Ekreach Road, Sihanoukville's main thoroughfare]]\n\nThe years of turmoil that followed meant that little of the original plan was implemented. The current state of structural inconsistency is testimony to decades of upheaval as layout planning was by no means a subject of aesthetic considerations and applied sciences.\n\nBetween the National Bank complex and Victory Beach Pier is one of the very few spots in town that gives the impression of having been planned in advance. The area connects with the city center along a single highway via typical irregular successions of residential buildings, bare of any distinct features and landmarks. These highways were designed to connect the very few and widely dispersed actual settlement foundations. The neighborhoods lack intimacy, due to a one-dimensional infrastructure. The city's center is a sequence of alternating single blocks of solid urban edifices, such as banks, middle-class hotels, gas stations, pharmacies, Chinese bakeries and electronics retailers followed by long rows of low-end food stalls, makeshift shops, motor-bike repair services, mini-markets, laundry, gas, lock-picker services and mobile phone shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bayonpearnik.com/cambodia/places/sihanoukville/ |title= Layout Of Sihanoukville |website= Bayon Pearnik |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footprinttravelguides.com/asia/cambodia/southern-cambodia/sihanoukville/ |title= Sihanoukville |website= Footprint Travel Guides 2015 |accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Gallery of Ochheuteal/Serendipity Beach area===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Golden_Lions_roundabout_Sihanoukville_Cambodia.jpg|Golden Lions Roundabout\nFile:Tuk_tuks_serendipity_road_Sihanoukville.jpg|[[Auto Rickshaw|Tuk-tuks]], Serendipity Road\nFile:Serendipity_Road_Sihanoukville.jpg|Serendipity Road\nFile:Sihanoukville_island_ferry_pier.jpg|Island Ferry Pier, 2015.

Plans were made to construct an entirely new deep-water port. Kompong Saom (Kampong Som)  was selected for water depth and ease of access.

Inconsistency and chaos during the long [[Cambodian Civil War|civil wars]] had far greater impact on the city's current image.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/magazine/the-city-he-built.html |title= The City He Built |work= The New York Times|date= May 15, 2005 |accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/7days/vann-molyvann-my-legacy-will-disappear |title= Vann Molyvann: my legacy will disappear|work= Phnom Penh Post|date= January 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the first urban plan for the city was completed for a population of 55,000 residents; it included cycle paths and green spaces. The plan also clearly marked out zoning for the port, the railway network, the town center with municipal offices, business and residential housing, and finally a tourist zone to the south along the beaches. A feasibility study by the United States Operations Mission (USOM) looked at drawing on a new water supply from the Prek Tuk Sap and existing lagoons; these were subsequently improved (cut off from the sea) and used as the initial source for town supply. The reservoirs are still operational, although insufficient for today's demands.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/sihanoukville-runs-dry-during-water-crisis-16609/ |title=Sihanoukville Runs Dry During Water Crisis|work=The Cambodia Daily |date=April 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ekreach Road Sihanoukville.jpg|thumb|left|Ekreach Road, Sihanoukville's main thoroughfare]]\n\nThe years of turmoil that followed meant that little of the original plan was implemented. The current state of structural inconsistency is testimony to decades of upheaval as layout planning was by no means a subject of aesthetic considerations and applied sciences.\n\nBetween the National Bank complex and Victory Beach Pier is one of the very few spots in town that gives the impression of having been planned in advance. The area connects with the city center along a single highway via typical irregular successions of residential buildings, bare of any distinct features and landmarks. These highways were designed to connect the very few and widely dispersed actual settlement foundations. The neighborhoods lack intimacy, due to a one-dimensional infrastructure. The city's center is a sequence of alternating single blocks of solid urban edifices, such as banks, middle-class hotels, gas stations, pharmacies, Chinese bakeries and electronics retailers followed by long rows of low-end food stalls, makeshift shops, motor-bike repair services, mini-markets, laundry, gas, lock-picker services and mobile phone shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bayonpearnik.com/cambodia/places/sihanoukville/ |title= Layout Of Sihanoukville |website= Bayon Pearnik |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footprinttravelguides.com/asia/cambodia/southern-cambodia/sihanoukville/ |title= Sihanoukville |website= Footprint Travel Guides 2015 |accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Gallery of Ochheuteal/Serendipity Beach area===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Golden_Lions_roundabout_Sihanoukville_Cambodia.jpg|Golden Lions Roundabout\nFile:Tuk_tuks_serendipity_road_Sihanoukville.jpg|[[Auto Rickshaw|Tuk-tuks]], Serendipity Road\nFile:Serendipity_Road_Sihanoukville.jpg|Serendipity Road\nFile:Sihanoukville_island_ferry_pier.jpg|Island Ferry Pier, 2015.
