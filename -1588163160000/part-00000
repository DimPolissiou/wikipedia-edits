At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for [[hominid]] [[fossil]]s.

Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers [[Joan Root|Joan]] and [[Alan Root]]. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas.<ref name=GFDFL/> After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans.

With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped [[Land Rover]] which she named \"Lily\". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe Stream Research Centre]] to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees.<ref name=GFDFL/> Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the [[Virunga Mountains]], Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=136}}</ref>  Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp.

During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the [[Kivu]] Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was detained at [[Rumangabo]] for two weeks.

In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity.<ref name=\"Mowat223\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|p=223}}</ref> The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers' traps during the same period.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/> In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park's [[elephant]]s for [[ivory]] and killed more than a dozen gorillas.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/>\n\nFossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served or are serving long prison sentences.<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\nIn 1978, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the [[Cologne Zoological Garden|zoo]] in [[Cologne, Germany]]. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed.<ref name=\"Mowat74\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=74\u20138}}</ref> The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to some approximation of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month.<ref name=\"farley\"/> She viewed the holding of animals in \"prison\" ([[zoo]]s) for the entertainment of people as unethical.<ref name=\"fossey\">Fossey, Dian : ''Gorillas in the Mist''. 1983</ref>\n\nWhile gorillas from rival gang groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favorite gorilla Digit was killed in 1978. Later that year, the [[Silverback#Group life|silverback]] of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator.<ref name=\"Mowat187\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=187\u2013190}}</ref> Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but Kweli was not captured due to Uncle Bert's intervention; however, three-year-old Kweli died slowly and painfully of [[gangrene]], from being brushed by a poacher's bullet.<ref name=\"fossey\"/><ref name=\"Mowat187\"/>\n\nAccording to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[African Wildlife Foundation]], Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the [[Mount Sabyinyo]] area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation.<ref name=\"farley\"/> The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and [[bushmeat]] hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it \"to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life.\" Fossey described the differing two philosophies as her own \"active conservation\" or the international conservation groups' \"theoretical conservation.\"<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\n===Opposition to tourism===\nFossey strongly opposed [[wildlife tourism]], as gorillas are very susceptible to [[Anthroponotic disease|human anthroponotic diseases]] like [[influenza]] for which they have no immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned Jane Goodall, who actually joined a chimpanzee society as a member, was inappropriately changing her study subjects' behavior.<ref name=\"Mowat174\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=174\u20135}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillafund.org/travel|title=Visit Gorillas - The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Preservation of habitat===\nFossey is responsible for the revision of a European Community project that converted parkland into [[pyrethrum]] farms.

[[Harold Hayes]]'s book ''The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey'' was published in 1989 after extensive interviews with people who lived and worked with Fossey. Haye's book shows Fossey in a less positive or romanticized light than previous accounts had done. The film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'' was based on Hayes' 1987 article in ''Life'' magazine, as cited in the film's credits, instead of Fossey's self-edited autobiography by that title.\n\n''No One Loved Gorillas More'' (2005) was written by Camilla de la Bedoyere and published by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] in the [[United States]] and [[Palazzo Editions]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Gorilla Dreams: The Legacy of Dian Fossey'' was written by the investigative journalist Georgianne Nienaber and published in 2006. This account of Fossey's story is told as if in her own words from beyond the grave. Fossey is also prominently featured in a book by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' journalist [[Alex Shoumatoff]] called ''African Madness'', in which the author expands on Fossey's controversial behaviors, implying that Fossey provoked her own murder by way of her private and public inflammatory interactions with people.

The book also shows the daily workings of camp, Fossey's dependence on her students and the movement to remove her from Karisoke years before her brutal murder.<ref name=\"Fowler 2018\">{{cite book |last=Fowler |first=John |title=A forest in the clouds : my year among the mountain gorillas in the remote enclave of Dian Fossey |publisher=Pegasus Books |location=New York |year=2018 |isbn=9781681776330 |oclc=1022267461}}</ref>\n\n===In media===\nThe [[Kentucky Opera]] Visions Program, in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], has written an [[opera]] about Fossey, entitled ''Nyiramachabelli''; it premiered on May 23, 2006.\n\n[[Universal Studios]] bought the film rights to ''Gorillas in the Mist'' from Fossey in 1985, and [[Warner Bros. Studios]] bought the rights to the Hayes article, despite its having been severely criticized by [[Rosamond Carr]]. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'', starring [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Bryan Brown]], and John Omirah Miluwi. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]]. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by [[Bryan Brown]]) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.\n\nIn the 2011 BBC documentary ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', [[Adam Curtis]] uses Fossey as a symbol of the ideology of [[ecology]], a balance of nature and western post-colonial political exploits in Africa.\n\nIn December 2017, ''Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist'', a three-hour series, aired on the [[National Geographic Channel]], The series tells the story of Fossey's life, work, murder and legacy, using archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with her, specially shot footage and reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Dian Fossey: Secrets In The Mist|url=http://www.natgeotv.com/za/shows/natgeo/dian-fossey-secrets-in-the-mist#synopsis|website=National Geographic TV|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |last=Fossey |first=Dian |author-mask=2 |title=Gorillas in the Mist |url=https://archive.org/details/gorillasinmist00dian |url-access=registration |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Mass |year=1983 |isbn=9780395282175 |oclc=9132014}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-link=Thomas B.

At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for [[hominid]] [[fossil]]s.

Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers [[Joan Root|Joan]] and [[Alan Root]]. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas.<ref name=GFDFL/> After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans.

With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped [[Land Rover]] which she named \"Lily\". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe Stream Research Centre]] to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees.<ref name=GFDFL/> Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the [[Virunga Mountains]], Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=136}}</ref>  Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp.

She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds assured them, together with submissive behavior and eating of the local celery plant.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\"/> She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with autistic children.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual \"noseprints\" for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nFossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the [[Belgian Congo]] until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the [[Congo Crisis]]. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the [[Kivu]] Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was detained at [[Rumangabo]] for two weeks. Fossey eventually escaped through bribery to Walter Baumg\u00e4rtel's Travellers Rest Hotel in [[Kisoro]], where her escort was arrested by the Ugandan military.<ref name=GFDFL/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gorillafund.org/dian_fossey/ |title=About Dian Fossey - Info about the Life of Dian Fossey |publisher=Gorillafund.org |date=2013-11-16 |accessdate=2014-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612232428/http://gorillafund.org/dian_fossey/ |archivedate=2010-06-12 }}</ref>\nAdvised by the Ugandan authorities not to return to Congo, after meeting Leakey in Nairobi, Fossey agreed with him against [[Us embassy|US Embassy]] advice to restart her study on the [[Rwanda]]n side of the [[Virunga Mountains|Virungas]].<ref name=GFDFL/> In Rwanda, Fossey had met local American expatriate [[Rosamond Carr]], who introduced her to [[Belgium|Belgian]] local Alyette DeMunck; DeMunck had a local's knowledge of Rwanda and offered to find Fossey a suitable site for study.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\n==Conservation work in Rwanda==\n[[File:Visoke.jpg|upright=1.15|thumbnail|right|Fossey established her research camp on the foothills of [[Mount Bisoke]].]]\nOn September 24, 1967, Fossey founded the [[Karisoke Research Center]], a remote [[rainforest]] camp nestled in [[Ruhengeri]] province in the saddle of two volcanoes.

In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity.<ref name=\"Mowat223\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|p=223}}</ref> The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers' traps during the same period.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/> In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park's [[elephant]]s for [[ivory]] and killed more than a dozen gorillas.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/>\n\nFossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served or are serving long prison sentences.<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\nIn 1978, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the [[Cologne Zoological Garden|zoo]] in [[Cologne, Germany]]. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed.<ref name=\"Mowat74\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=74\u20138}}</ref> The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to some approximation of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month.<ref name=\"farley\"/> She viewed the holding of animals in \"prison\" ([[zoo]]s) for the entertainment of people as unethical.<ref name=\"fossey\">Fossey, Dian : ''Gorillas in the Mist''. 1983</ref>\n\nWhile gorillas from rival gang groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favorite gorilla Digit was killed in 1978. Later that year, the [[Silverback#Group life|silverback]] of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator.<ref name=\"Mowat187\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=187\u2013190}}</ref> Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but Kweli was not captured due to Uncle Bert's intervention; however, three-year-old Kweli died slowly and painfully of [[gangrene]], from being brushed by a poacher's bullet.<ref name=\"fossey\"/><ref name=\"Mowat187\"/>\n\nAccording to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[African Wildlife Foundation]], Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the [[Mount Sabyinyo]] area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation.<ref name=\"farley\"/> The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and [[bushmeat]] hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it \"to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life.\" Fossey described the differing two philosophies as her own \"active conservation\" or the international conservation groups' \"theoretical conservation.\"<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\n===Opposition to tourism===\nFossey strongly opposed [[wildlife tourism]], as gorillas are very susceptible to [[Anthroponotic disease|human anthroponotic diseases]] like [[influenza]] for which they have no immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned Jane Goodall, who actually joined a chimpanzee society as a member, was inappropriately changing her study subjects' behavior.<ref name=\"Mowat174\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=174\u20135}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillafund.org/travel|title=Visit Gorillas - The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Preservation of habitat===\nFossey is responsible for the revision of a European Community project that converted parkland into [[pyrethrum]] farms.

Haye's book shows Fossey in a less positive or romanticized light than previous accounts had done.

Fossey is also prominently featured in a book by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' journalist [[Alex Shoumatoff]] called ''African Madness'', in which the author expands on Fossey's controversial behaviors, implying that Fossey provoked her own murder by way of her private and public inflammatory interactions with people. The author also wrote a lengthy article titled \"The Fatal Obsession of Dian Fossey\".<ref>Shoumatoff, Alex (September 1986).

''Vanity Fair''.</ref>\n\n''A Forest in the Clouds: My Year among the Mountain Gorillas in the Remote Enclave of Dian Fossey'', by John Fowler,  is a first-person account from inside Dian Fossey's camp. The author gives a candid and vivid portrait of Fossey's mercurial personality, her ill treatment of staff and research students, and her alcohol-fueled tirades. The book also shows the daily workings of camp, Fossey's dependence on her students and the movement to remove her from Karisoke years before her brutal murder.<ref name=\"Fowler 2018\">{{cite book |last=Fowler |first=John |title=A forest in the clouds : my year among the mountain gorillas in the remote enclave of Dian Fossey |publisher=Pegasus Books |location=New York |year=2018 |isbn=9781681776330 |oclc=1022267461}}</ref>\n\n===In media===\nThe [[Kentucky Opera]] Visions Program, in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], has written an [[opera]] about Fossey, entitled ''Nyiramachabelli''; it premiered on May 23, 2006.\n\n[[Universal Studios]] bought the film rights to ''Gorillas in the Mist'' from Fossey in 1985, and [[Warner Bros. Studios]] bought the rights to the Hayes article, despite its having been severely criticized by [[Rosamond Carr]]. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'', starring [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Bryan Brown]], and John Omirah Miluwi. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]]. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by [[Bryan Brown]]) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.\n\nIn the 2011 BBC documentary ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', [[Adam Curtis]] uses Fossey as a symbol of the ideology of [[ecology]], a balance of nature and western post-colonial political exploits in Africa.\n\nIn December 2017, ''Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist'', a three-hour series, aired on the [[National Geographic Channel]], The series tells the story of Fossey's life, work, murder and legacy, using archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with her, specially shot footage and reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Dian Fossey: Secrets In The Mist|url=http://www.natgeotv.com/za/shows/natgeo/dian-fossey-secrets-in-the-mist#synopsis|website=National Geographic TV|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |last=Fossey |first=Dian |author-mask=2 |title=Gorillas in the Mist |url=https://archive.org/details/gorillasinmist00dian |url-access=registration |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Mass |year=1983 |isbn=9780395282175 |oclc=9132014}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-link=Thomas B.

In July 1997, he was convicted of [[terrorism]] ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by a Yugoslav court.

In July 1997, he was convicted of [[terrorism]] ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by a Yugoslav court.

Prior to the [[Kosovo War]], the government of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] considered it \"the hotbed of Albanian terrorism.\"{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=18}} Jashari was a farmer.{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=193}}  In 1991, he participated in an armed uprising against the Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo.{{sfn|Elsie|2011|p=32}} During this period, a Kosovo Albanian [[irredentist]] organization that came to be known as the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] first emerged.{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=193}}\n\nFrom 1991 to 1992, Jashari and about 100 other ethnic Albanians wishing to fight for the independence of Kosovo underwent military training in the municipality of [[Labinot-Mal]] in [[Albania]].{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=111}} Afterwards, Jashari and other ethnic Albanians committed several acts of [[sabotage]] aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in Kosovo. Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Ham\u00ebz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=142}}\n\nWhile in Albania, he was arrested in 1993 by the government of [[Sali Berisha]] and sent to jail in [[Tirana]]{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|p=113}} before being released alongside other Kosovo Albanian militants at the demand of the [[Albanian Army]].{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|pp=98\u201399}} With the Yugoslav forces now considering Prekaz a \"no-go\" area, Jashari launched several attacks over the next several years.

[[Human Rights Watch]] subsequently described the trial, in which fourteen other Kosovo Albanians were also convicted, as \"[failing] to conform to international standards.\"{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=27}} Pursuing Jashari for the murder of a Serb policeman, Yugoslav forces again attempted to assault the Jashari compound in Prekaz on 22 January 1998.{{sfn|Elsie|2011|p=142}} With Jashari not present, thousands of Kosovo Albanians descended on Prekaz and again succeeded in pushing the Serbs out of the village and its surroundings. The next month, a small unit of the KLA ambushed Serbian policemen. Four Serbs were killed and two were injured in the ensuing clashes. At dawn on 5 March 1998, the KLA launched an attack against a police patrol in Prekaz.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=142}}\n\n===Death===\n{{main|Attack on Prekaz}}\nIn response to this attack, the Yugoslavs organized a \"full-scale revenge mission\" involving tanks, [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] and [[helicopter]]s.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|pp=142\u2013143}} They were backed up by [[artillery]] from a nearby ammunition factory.{{sfn|Pettifer|2005|p=144}} With the intention of \"eliminating the suspects and their families,\"{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=27}} the police attacked villages that had been identified as KLA strongholds, including [[Liko\u0161ane]] and [[\u0106irez]]. Human Rights Watch noted that \"special police forces attacked without warning, firing indiscriminately at women, children and other noncombatants.\" KLA members and their families subsequently fled to Jashari's compound. Here, the police invited Jashari to surrender, giving him a deadline of two hours in which to respond. During this period, a number of families left the compound.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=143}} Jashari remained, ordering his family members to stay inside and telling his militants to resist to the last man.{{sfn|Henriksen|2007|p=127}}\n\nOnce the two-hour deadline had expired, the two sides began exchanging gunfire. In one of the houses, where most of Jashari's extended family had gathered, a mortar shell fell in through the roof, causing many deaths. After a two{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=143}} or three-day siege, the police captured the Jashari compound.{{sfn|Judah|2008|p=81}} Once inside, they discovered that Jashari and his brother Ham\u00ebz had been killed.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=143}} Also killed were Jashari's wife, Adilje, and his thirteen-year-old son, Kushtrim.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=29}} Overall, approximately fifty-eight Kosovo Albanians were killed in the attack, including eighteen women and ten children under the age of sixteen.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=140}} [[Goran Radosavljevi\u0107]], a major in the Serbian [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Interior Ministry]], said that \"[Jashari] used women, children and the elderly as hostages.\"{{sfn|Henriksen|2007|p=128}} Speaking of the attack, Yugoslav General [[Neboj\u0161a Pavkovi\u0107]] stated that it was \"a normal policing action against a well-known criminal.

There, they were placed inside a warehouse located on the outskirts of town. Photographs taken during this time revealed that Jashari had received a bullet wound to the neck. On 9 March, the police publicly stated that they would themselves bury the bodies of those killed if they were not quickly claimed and buried by family members. The next day, the police dug a large grave near Donji Prekaz and buried the bodies of fifty-six people, ten of whom could not be identified. On 11 March, the bodies were disinterred by relatives and reburied in accordance with Islamic tradition{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|pp=30\u201331}} on a field known as the \"field of peace\".{{sfn|Judah|2008|p=28}}\n\nThe shootout at the Jashari family compound involving Adem Jashari, a KLA commander and surrounding Yugoslav troops in 1998 resulted in the massacre of most Jashari family members.<ref name=\"DiLellioSchwandersSievers514515516\"/><ref name=\"KoktsidisDam169\">{{harvnb|Koktsidis|Dam|2008|pp=169}}.</ref> The deaths of Jashari and his family generated an international backlash against the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Carmichael|2012|p=558}} As news of the killings spread, armed Kosovo Albanian militias emerged throughout Kosovo, seeking to avenge Jashari's death as Albanians flocked to join the KLA.{{sfn|Petersen|2011|p=154}} The event became a rallying myth for KLA recruitment regarding armed resistance to Yugoslav forces.<ref name=\"DiLellioSchwandersSievers514515516\">{{harvnb|Di Lellio|Schwanders-Sievers|2006a|p=514}}. \"We concentrate on one symbolic event \u2013 the massacre of the insurgent Jashari family, killed in the hamlet of Prekaz in March 1998 while fighting Serbs troops.

C&nbsp;14.01), is a work thought to be by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] for oboe, clarinet, horn, bassoon, and orchestra. He originally wrote a work for flute, oboe, horn, bassoon, and orchestra, K.&nbsp;Anh. 9 (297B), in Paris in April 1778 for performance at the  [[concert spirituel]]. Mozart wrote to his father about the composition naming the four virtuoso soloists who were to play.  However at the last minute Mozart's piece was displaced from the concert program by a piece for similar forces by [[Giuseppe Cambini]] and the Mozart work was never played. <ref>[[Robert Levin (musicologist)|Robert Levin]], ''Who Wrote the Mozart Four-Wind Concertante?''

Jahn wrote the first scholarly biography of Mozart <ref>[[Otto Jahn]], ''Life of Mozart \u2013 tr P. D. Townsend Cooper Square Publishers Inc'' {{ISBN|9781108064859}} </ref> and had amassed a large quantity of Mozart letters, original manuscripts and score copies.

Trained as a dancer, Loy devoted herself fully to an acting career following a few minor roles in [[silent film]]s. She was originally typecast in exotic roles, often as a [[femme fatale|vamp]] or a woman of Asian descent, but her career prospects improved greatly following her portrayal of [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nora Charles]] in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934).{{Sfn|Curtis|2011|page=333}}\n\nBorn in [[Helena, Montana]], Loy was raised in rural [[Radersburg, Montana|Radersburg]] during her early childhood, before relocating to [[Los Angeles]] with her mother in her early adolescence. There, she began studying dance, and trained extensively throughout her high school education. She was discovered by production designer [[Natacha Rambova]], who helped facilitate film auditions for her, and she began obtaining small roles in the late 1920s, mainly portraying vamps. Her role in ''The Thin Man'' helped elevate her reputation as a versatile actress, and she reprised the role of [[Nora Charles]] five more times.\n\nLoy's career began to slow in the 1940s, and she appeared in only a few films in the 1950s, including a lead role in the comedy ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (1950 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (1950), as well as supporting parts in ''[[The Ambassador's Daughter (1956 film)|The Ambassador's Daughter]]'' (1956) and the drama ''[[Lonelyhearts]]'' (1958). She appeared in only eight films between 1960 and 1981, after which she retired from acting.\n\nAlthough Loy was never nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], in March 1991 she received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] in recognition of her life's work both onscreen and off, including serving as assistant to the director of military and naval welfare for the [[Red Cross]] during [[World War II]], and a member-at-large of the U.S. Commission to [[UNESCO]]. Loy died in December 1993 in New York City, aged 88.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1905\u20131924: Early life===\n[[File:Myrna-Loy-1911.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Loy (left) at age six, standing on her grandmother's porch in Helena, Montana, with her cousin Laura Belle Wilder (1911)]]\nLoy was born Myrna Adele Williams on August 2, 1905, in [[Helena, Montana]],{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=1}}{{sfn|Parish|Bowers|1974|p=443}} the daughter of Adelle Mae (n\u00e9e Johnson) and rancher David Franklin Williams.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=1\u20134}} Her parents had married in Helena in 1904, one year before Loy was born.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=13}} She had one younger brother, David Frederick Williams ({{abbr|d.|died}} 1982).{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=385}} Loy's paternal grandfather, David Thomas Williams, was [[Welsh people|Welsh]], and immigrated from [[Liverpool]], England to the United States in 1856, arriving in [[Philadelphia]].{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=9}} Unable to read or write in [[English language|English]], he later settled in the [[Montana Territory]] where he began a career as a rancher.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=9\u201310}} Loy's maternal grandparents were [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Swedes|Swedish]] immigrants.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=10\u201312}}<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Rex Reed|Reed, Rex]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E5DF1F39E63ABC4B52DFB2668382679EDE|title=Myrna's Back \u2013 And Boyer's Got Her|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 13, 1969|accessdate=August 31, 2018}} {{closed access}}</ref> During her childhood, her father worked as a banker, real estate developer, and farmland appraiser in Helena, and was the youngest man ever elected to serve in the [[Montana state legislature]].{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=11\u201312}} Her mother had studied music at the [[American Conservatory of Music]] in Chicago, and at one time considered a career as a concert performer, but instead devoted her time to raising Loy and her brother.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=12}} Loy's mother was a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], while her father was a staunch [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=12}} She was raised in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] faith.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=14}}\n\n[[File:Venice High School Fountain of Education.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Loy modeled for the central figure in Harry Fielding Winebrenner's ''Fountain of Education'', a sculpture at Venice High School in Los Angeles (1922)]]\n\nLoy spent her early life in [[Radersburg, Montana]], a rural mining community approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}}{{sfn|Swartout|2015|p=34}} southeast of Helena.<!--\n--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myrnaloy.org/bio.html|title=About Myrna Loy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705012959/http://www.myrnaloy.org/bio.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}</ref><!--\n--><ref name=loy2>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers1/loy.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102212127/http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers1/loy.html|archivedate=November 2, 2011|title=125 Montana Newsmakers: Myrna Loy Reynolds|work=Great Falls Tribune|location=Great Falls, Montana|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}</ref><!--ENDRef\n--> During the winter of 1912, Loy's mother nearly died from [[pneumonia]], and her father sent his wife and daughter to [[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla, California]].{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=22}} Loy's mother saw great potential in [[Southern California]], and during one of her husband's visits, she encouraged him to purchase real estate there.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=22\u201323}} Among the properties he bought was land that he would later sell, at a considerable profit, to filmmaker [[Charlie Chaplin]] for his film studio there. Although her mother tried to persuade her husband to move to California permanently, he preferred ranch life and the three eventually returned to Montana. Soon afterward, Loy's mother needed a [[hysterectomy]] and insisted Los Angeles was a safer place to have it done, so she, Loy, and Loy's brother David moved to [[Santa Monica neighborhoods#Ocean Park Neighborhood|Ocean Park]], where Loy began to take dancing lessons.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=22}} After the family returned to Montana, Loy continued her dancing lessons, and at the age of 12, Myrna Williams made her stage debut performing a dance she had choreographed based on \"The Blue Bird\" from the ''Rose Dream'' operetta<ref>Willis, Gertruce Knox and Mrs. R.R.

She obtained work at [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]], where she performed in what were called prologues, elaborate musical sequences that were related to and served as preliminary entertainment before the feature film. During this period, Loy saw [[Eleonora Duse]] in the play ''Thy Will Be Done'', and the simple acting techniques she employed made such an impact on Loy that she tried to emulate them throughout her career.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=33\u201334}}\n\n===1925\u20131932: Career beginnings===\n[[File:Myrna-Loy-1925.jpg|thumb|In its September 1925 issue, ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture]]'' magazine featured two Henry Waxman photographs of Loy, costumed by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], as she appeared in ''[[What Price Beauty?]]'' ]]\n\nWhile Loy was dancing in prologues at the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]], portrait photographer Henry Waxman took several pictures of her that were noticed by [[Rudolph Valentino]] when the actor went to Waxman's studio for a sitting.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=34\u201338}} Valentino was looking for a leading lady for ''[[Cobra (1925 film)|Cobra]]'', the first independent project he and his wife [[Natacha Rambova]] were producing.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=47\u201348}} Loy tested for the role, which went to [[Gertrude Olmstead]] instead, but soon after she was hired as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]] for ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (1925), in which she and fellow newcomer [[Joan Crawford]] were among a bevy of chorus girls dangling from an elaborate chandelier.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=37\u201341}}\n\nRambova hired Loy for a small but showy role opposite [[Nita Naldi]] in ''[[What Price Beauty?]]'', a film she was producing. Shot in May 1925, the film remained unreleased for three years; but [[Film still|stills]] of Loy in her exotic makeup and costume appeared in ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture]]'' magazine and led to a contract with [[Warner Bros.]] There, her surname was changed from Williams to Loy.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=42\u201343}}\n\nLoy's [[silent film]] roles were mainly as a vamp or ''[[femme fatale]]'', and she frequently portrayed characters of Asian or Eurasian background in films such as ''[[Across the Pacific (1926 film)|Across the Pacific]]'' (1926), ''[[A Girl in Every Port (1928 film)|A Girl in Every Port]]'' (1928), ''[[The Crimson City]]'' (1928), ''[[The Black Watch]]'' (1929), and ''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929), which she later recalled \"kind of solidified my exotic non-American image.\"{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|p=66}} In 1930 she appeared in ''[[The Great Divide (1929 film)|The Great Divide]]''. It took years for her to overcome this stereotype, and as late as 1932, she was cast as a villainous Eurasian in ''[[Thirteen Women]]'' (1932). She also played, opposite [[Boris Karloff]], the depraved sadistic daughter of the title character in ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1932, Loy began dating producer [[Arthur Hornblow Jr.]], when he was still married to his wife, Juliette Crosby.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=92}} \nPrior to that, Loy appeared in small roles in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' and a number of early lavish [[Technicolor]] musicals, including ''[[The Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Bride of the Regiment]]'', and ''[[Under a Texas Moon (film)|Under a Texas Moon]]''. As a result, she became associated with musical roles, and when they began to lose favor with the public, her career went into a slump. In 1934, Loy appeared in ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[William Powell]]. When gangster [[John Dillinger]] was shot to death after leaving a screening of the film at the [[Biograph Theater]] in Chicago, the film received widespread publicity, with some newspapers reporting that Loy had been Dillinger's favorite actress.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|p=97}}\n\n===1933\u20131938: Rise to stardom===\n[[File:Thin-Man-Loy-Powell-Skippy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Loy, [[William Powell]] and [[Skippy (dog)|Asta]] in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934)]]\nAfter appearing with [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]] in ''[[The Barbarian (1933 film)|The Barbarian]]'' (1933), Loy was cast as [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nora Charles]] in the 1934 film ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]''. Director [[W. S. Van Dyke]] chose Loy after he detected a wit and sense of humor that her previous films had not revealed. At a Hollywood party, he pushed her into a swimming pool to test her reaction, and felt that her aplomb in handling the situation was exactly what he envisioned for Nora.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|p=88}} [[Louis B. Mayer]] at first refused to allow Loy to play the part because he felt she was a dramatic actress, but Van Dyke insisted. Mayer finally relented on the condition that filming be completed within three weeks, as Loy was committed to start filming ''[[Stamboul Quest]]''.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=88\u201389}} ''The Thin Man'' became one of the year's biggest hits, and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Loy received excellent reviews and was acclaimed for her comedic skills. Her costar [[William Powell]] and she proved to be a popular screen couple and appeared in 14 films together, [[William Powell and Myrna Loy|one of the most prolific pairings]] in [[Hollywood]] history. Loy later referred to ''The Thin Man'' as the film \"that finally made me ... after more than 80 films.\"{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=88\u201391}}\n[[File:Hornblow-Loy-1936.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Hornblow Jr.]] and Loy soon after their marriage in 1936]]\n\nHer successes in ''Manhattan Melodrama'' and ''The Thin Man'' marked a turning point in her career, and she was cast in more important pictures. Such films as ''[[Wife vs. Secretary]]'' (1936) with Clark Gable and [[Jean Harlow]], and ''[[Petticoat Fever]]'' (1936) with [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] gave her opportunity to develop comedic skills. She made four films in close succession with William Powell: ''[[Libeled Lady]]'' (1936), which also starred Jean Harlow and [[Spencer Tracy]]; ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936), in which she played [[Billie Burke]] opposite Powell's [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]; the second Thin Man film, ''[[After the Thin Man]]'' (1936), with Powell and [[James Stewart]]; and the romantic comedy ''[[Double Wedding]]'' (1937). Loy married Arthur Hornblow in 1936 in-between filming the successive productions.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=149}} She was later rumored to have had affairs with co-star Tracy between 1935 and 1936 while filming ''[[Whipsaw (film)|Whipsaw]]'' and ''[[Libeled Lady]]''.{{sfn|Wayne|2005|pages=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Andersen|1997|p=86}}\n[[File:Clark Gable and Myrna Loy on set of Too Hot to Handle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Loy with [[Clark Gable]] on the set of ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1938 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'', 1938]]\nShe also made three more films with Gable at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM): ''[[Parnell (film)|Parnell]]'' (1937) was a historical drama and one of the most poorly received films of either Loy's or Gable's career, but their other pairings in ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' and ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1938 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'' (both 1938) were successes. While working for MGM, Loy was outspoken about the studio's casting hierarchy, especially based on [[race (human categorization)|race]], and was quoted as saying: \"Why does every black person in the movies have to play a servant? How about a black person walking up the steps of a court house carrying a briefcase?\"{{sfn|Maier|2011|p=17}}\n\nDuring this period, Loy was one of Hollywood's busiest and highest-paid actresses, and in 1937 and 1938, she was listed in the annual \"Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars,\" which was compiled from the votes of movie exhibitors throughout the United States for the stars who had generated the most revenue in their theaters over the previous year.<ref>[http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html \"The 2007 Motion Picture Almanac, Top Ten Money Making Stars\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221063625/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |date=December 21, 2014 }},  quigleypublishing.com; retrieved July 11, 2007.</ref>\n\n===1939\u20131949: Mainstream work and war activism===\n[[File:Rains-Came-Loy-Power.jpg|left|thumb|Loy and [[Tyrone Power]] in ''[[The Rains Came]]'' (1939)]]\nBy the late 1930s, Loy was highly regarded for her performances in romantic comedies, and she was anxious to demonstrate her dramatic ability.

Trained as a dancer, Loy devoted herself fully to an acting career following a few minor roles in [[silent film]]s. She was originally typecast in exotic roles, often as a [[femme fatale|vamp]] or a woman of Asian descent, but her career prospects improved greatly following her portrayal of [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nora Charles]] in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934).{{Sfn|Curtis|2011|page=333}}\n\nBorn in [[Helena, Montana]], Loy was raised in rural [[Radersburg, Montana|Radersburg]] during her early childhood, before relocating to [[Los Angeles]] with her mother in her early adolescence. There, she began studying dance, and trained extensively throughout her high school education. She was discovered by production designer [[Natacha Rambova]], who helped facilitate film auditions for her, and she began obtaining small roles in the late 1920s, mainly portraying vamps. Her role in ''The Thin Man'' helped elevate her reputation as a versatile actress, and she reprised the role of [[Nora Charles]] five more times.\n\nLoy's career began to slow in the 1940s, and she appeared in only a few films in the 1950s, including a lead role in the comedy ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (1950 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (1950), as well as supporting parts in ''[[The Ambassador's Daughter (1956 film)|The Ambassador's Daughter]]'' (1956) and the drama ''[[Lonelyhearts]]'' (1958).

As a result, she became associated with musical roles, and when they began to lose favor with the public, her career went into a slump. In 1934, Loy appeared in ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[William Powell]].

Over the next few years, he laid the foundation for the modern theme park by installing various permanent rides and developing areas of the grounds in progressive stages. In the 1980s, Broome opened a succession of rides and roller coasters around the park, including [[Corkscrew (Alton Towers)|Corkscrew]], Pirate Ship (now The Blade), [[Alpine Bobsleigh]], [[The Flume (Alton Towers)|The Flume]], and [[Black Hole (roller coaster)|The Black Hole]].\n\nBroome sold Alton Towers to [[The Tussauds Group]], then a division of [[Pearson plc]], in 1990, after encountering financial troubles in attempting to develop the former [[Battersea Power Station]] into a similar theme park. The change of ownership brought an era of major redevelopment and promotion, involving the opening of large themed areas and new attractions, such as [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] (1992), [[Duel - The Haunted House Strikes Back!|The Haunted House]] (1992), [[Toyland Tours]] (1994), and [[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]] (1994). Later, [[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]] (1998) and Air (2002, now [[Galactica (roller coaster)|Galactica]]) saw the park sustain its reputation for major roller coasters, both marketed as 'World First' rides. Tussauds' park development team from 1990 to 2002 included well-known attraction producer [[John Wardley]], among experienced others.\n\nThe Tussauds Group was sold to venture capitalist firm Charterhouse in 1998, then to [[Dubai International Capital]] (DIC) for \u00a3800 million in 2005.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Dubai firm buys Tussauds\n| work=BBC News\n| date=23 March 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4375219.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> The Tussauds Group was then bought by [[Merlin Entertainments]] in March 2007 for over \u00a31billion from DIC, placing Alton Towers under their control.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal\n| work=BBC News\n| date=23 March 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007, [[The Blackstone Group]] purchased [[The Tussauds Group]] for US$1.9 billion and merged it into [[Merlin Entertainments]] with management by Merlin.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2812377/Merlin-conjures-up-leaseback-deal.html|title=Merlin conjures up leaseback deal|date=17 July 2007|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/05/AR2007030501369.html|title=Blackstone Buys Madame Tussauds Chain|first=David|last=Cho|date=6 March 2007|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Dubai International Capital also gained 20% of Merlin Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm |work=BBC News| title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal | date=5 March 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 July 2007, Alton Towers was sold to private investor [[Nick Leslau]]'s investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6902797.stm |work=BBC News| title=Alton Towers sold in \u00a3622m deal | date=17 July 2007}}</ref> Merlin continues to operate the site under a renewable 35-year lease.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> As of 2016, the property is now transferred to Secure Income REIT Plc, of which Nick Leslau is a non-executive director.<ref name=\"Secure Income REIT Plc\" />\n\n== Rides and attractions ==\n\n=== Roller coasters ===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!

Themed loosely as a town street, it leads to views of the gardens and the Towers across the lake in the distance. Along the pathway are the park's jumping frog fountains and a lawn where seasonal events take place. The first ''SkyRide'' station is located nearby, which is a 1048&nbsp;m long [[Aerial lift|cable car]] transport that opened in 1987, and was refurbished 2009. The [[monorail]] moves guests from the three on-site hotels and the water park to the theme park; it opened 1987 and was refurbished in 2008. In this area during the hour before the park's daily closure, departing guests are entertained by three people wearing police costumes, two of them riding [[Segway]]-like vehicles which play party music and the third standing with an old-fashioned megaphone that is unused, and a man riding a miniature ship while dressed as a sea captain.\n\n=== Katanga Canyon ===\nThemed as an African village; created in 1992 and incorporated existing rapids ride. Rides include the roller coaster [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] and [[Congo River Rapids (Alton Towers)|Congo River Rapids]]. Both are well-established rides in the park whose ride tracks share a tunnel. Congo River Rapids is a river rapids ride that opened 1986, as The Grand Canyon Rapids, and was refurbished in 1992. A 735 m long wild river rapids ride down the Congo River that lasts six minutes. Runaway Mine Train is a steel sit down powered coaster that reaches a speed of 22&nbsp;mph (36&nbsp;km/h) on a 1000&nbsp;ft long track (305 m) and height of {{convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}}; height limit 90&nbsp;cm. It was designed by [[John Wardley]] for Tussauds and manufactured by [[Mack Rides]].\n\n=== Gloomy Wood ===\nGloomy Wood serves as the area for the dark ride ''[[Duel (ride)|Duel - The Haunted House Strikes Back!]]'', originally ''The Haunted House''. Opening in 1992, this was originally Europe's largest haunted dark ride, but was significantly altered with interactive laser guns in 2003. Each player's shooting score is recorded on a display in the ride car, as guests shoot targets around the ride.\n\nIn 2007, a themed footpath through the woods was added to the area, named ''Haunted Hollow''. The pathway follows the route formerly used by the park's old scenic railway, linking from Mutiny Bay. ''Haunted Hollow'' includes tombstones, statues and other features, some of which interact with guests using sound effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altontowers.com/rides-and-attractions/fun-rides/haunted-hollow/|title=Haunted Hollow - Theme Park Experience at Alton Towers Resort|website=www.altontowers.com}}</ref> In July 2015, Nitrogenie opened and replaced the old Waffles and Ices, a shop producing ice cream using liquid [[nitrogen]]. Gloomy Wood was suggested by the 2017 park map to be home to the new ''Wicker Man'' wooden coaster, opening 2018. However, the park later stated that the ride was in Mutiny Bay.\n\n=== Forbidden Valley ===\n[[File:Alton Towers Forbidden Valley ride signs.jpg|thumb|Theming and signs in Forbidden Valley]]\nForbidden Valley is set in a '[[post-apocalyptic]]' landscape, with [[standing stones]] and rustic structures populating the 'valley'. A ''SkyRide'' station also serves this area of the park.\n\nThe area's principal attraction is ''[[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]]'', opened in 1994. ''Nemesis'' is a steel inverted coaster that reaches a speed of 50&nbsp;mph (81&nbsp;km) with four inversions, set in a rocky quarry over waterfalls. The ride is built down into excavated ground and was designed by Tussauds, primarily [[John Wardley]]. The attraction is themed as an alien creature inhabiting the quarry where the coaster is situated. \n\n''The Blade'' is a Huss Pirate Boat modified with a pendulum blade. It opened in 1980, and was relocated to the area in 1997 from Fantasy World. The Blade currently operates as the only flat ride in Forbidden Valley since the removal of ''[[Ripsaw (Alton Towers)|Ripsaw]]''. However, in October 2019, The Blade was dismantled to be 'Resharpened by the Phalanx' and has been added back to the Alton Towers app hinting it\u2019s return.\n\n[[Galactica (roller coaster)|Galactica]] is a B&M flying coaster, originally opening as ''Air'' in 2002. Air was loosely themed as a peaceful landscape, distanced from the 'apocalyptic' look of Nemesis. Air was redesigned as Galactica in 2016, adopting [[virtual reality]] headsets and a space travel theme. The VR headsets have since been removed due to feedback from customers.<ref name=\"Twitter170320191501\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/altontowers/status/1107295909078097923|date=17 March 2019|accessdate=18 March 2019|title=Reply to user @Ev_Jay|quote=Galactica no longer features VR due to guest feedback regarding their experience on the ride.|publisher=Alton Towers official Twitter account}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, the '[[Rollercoaster Restaurant]]' opened, offering a dining experience where guests have their food delivered by looping rails. The restaurant is open daily from 10am - 9:30pm; available to guests without theme park admission after the park has closed, except during Scarefest and Fireworks events.\n\n=== Adventure Land ===\nAdventure Land is a small family area featuring ''[[Spinball Whizzer (roller coaster)|Spinball Whizzer]]'';<ref>{{cite web|title=Theme Park|url=https://www.altontowers.com/theme-park/|website=Alton Towers|accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> based on a pinball machine in which the car is the ball whizzing around the machine. The ride originally had this name, until 2010 when it was known as ''Sonic Spinball'' until the name change back in 2016 when a contract ended with SEGA after six years. The ride is a Maurer S\u00f6hne spinning roller coaster, in which riders sit in cars that can spin on their base whilst travelling at speed around the track. For the park map, Spinball Whizzer is listed as being in The Towers area.\n\nAdventure Land is named after the adventure play ground which previously sat on the site. The former play area was one of the attractions of a larger area called Kiddies Kingdom. In 1996, Kiddies Kingdom was split into Adventure Land and Storybook Land.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adventure Land |url=https://towersstreet.com/theme-park/area/adventure-land/#areahistory |website=towersstreet.com |accessdate=17 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== X-Sector ===\n[[File:Oblivion2015.JPG|thumb|View of Oblivion]]\nX-Sector is themed as a secretive industrial complex, suggested to be subjecting park guests to experimental testing.\n\nThe area currently contains three thrill rides. The steel dive coaster ''[[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]]'' which opened in 1998 as \"the world's first vertical drop rollercoaster\", designed by Tussauds and manufactured by [[Bolliger & Mabillard]]. The cars are held over the edge of the drop for three seconds, before diving into a deep tunnel. ''[[The Smiler]]'' is a [[Gerstlauer]] [[Infinity Coaster]] which opened in May 2013 and currently holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster at 14.<ref name=\"Uttoxeter Advertiser\"/>  ''Enterprise'' is a standard HUSS [[Enterprise (ride)|Enterprise]] model which opened in 1984, spinning riders 360 degrees and giving the illusion of defying gravity. The area layout was partially altered in 2013 season to accommodate the opening of The Smiler.\n\nPrevious rides in X-Sector include The [[Black Hole (roller coaster)|Black Hole]], which was a Jet Star 2 coaster enclosed in a tent, where The Smiler is located today. [[Boneshaker (Alton Towers)|Energizer]] (later renamed Boneshaker) was a swinging gondola flat ride. It was replaced by [[Submission (Alton Towers)|Submission]] in 2001, a \"Chance Double Inverter\" flat ride, which was itself removed in 2014.\n\n=== Mutiny Bay ===\n[[File:Alton Towers 05.jpg|thumb|Mutiny Bay's pirates]]\nMutiny Bay is a pirate-themed family area, which opened in 2008.<ref name=\"Attractions2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaapa.org/ |title=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |date=January 2009 |publisher=IAAPA |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> the area was a retheme for Merrie England.\n\nAttractions in Mutiny Bay include: ''[[Battle Galleons]]'', an interactive \"Splash Battle\" boat ride, where guests sit in tracked boats while soaking other riders with water cannons. Also in the area is the rocking boat ride, ''Heave Ho''. The park's original teacups ride was re-themed to become ''[[Marauder's Mayhem (Alton Towers)|Marauders Mayhem]]'', with the tea cup cars being redesigned as gunpowder barrels. '' The Flume'' was a [[Mack Rides|Mack]] log flume ride that opened in 1981 and was rethemed in 2004 with a sponsorship from Imperial Leather alongside the bubbleworks at Chessington world of adventure. Upon opening, it was the longest flume ride in the world at {{Convert|886|m}}.<ref name=\"Attractions2009\" /> Late in the 2015 season, the ride and the neighboring tavern closed and were removed in 2016 to make way for the [[Wicker Man (roller coaster)|Wicker Man]] roller coaster and the \"Welcome Inn\" bar which shares the coaster's theme.\n\nIn 2009, a [[Sea Life Centres|Sea Life Centre]] named ''Sharkbait Reef'' opened in the location previously home to the 3-D Cinema.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for 3-D Cinema replacement|date=March 2020}} This includes \"touch pools\" for interacting with underwater species and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} underwater tunnel.<ref name=\"Sharkbait Reef Info\">{{cite web |title=Sharkbait Reef by SEA LIFE |url=https://www.towerstimes.co.uk/theme-park/mutiny-bay/sharkbait-reef-by-sea-life/ |website=TowersTimes |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== The World of David Walliams ===\n[[File:Alton Towers - Circuit voitures pour enfants.jpg|thumb|Driving School attraction in Cloud Cuckoo Land]]\nThe World of David Walliams is aimed at younger children aged 7-11, featuring bright colours and fantasy decor. Attractions include ''Raj's Bouncy Bottom Burp'' (the former Frog Hopper) and ''Royal Carousel'' (previously Galloper's Carousel). ''[[Driving School (Alton Towers)|Cuckoo Cars Driving School]]'' allows children to drive miniature electric cars around a themed road layout, featuring visual jokes along the way.<ref>{{cite news | title=Coming soon \u2026 the first 'drive of your life' | publisher=easier.com | date=10 July 2006 | url=http://www.easier.com/view/News/Motoring/Peugeot/article-59601.html | accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> A SkyRide station is located nearby Fountain Square, giving access to other areas of the park.\nThe area was previously known as \"Cred Street\" and \"The Land of Make Believe\", with a cartoon-inspired look, mainly featuring ''[[Toyland Tours]]''. Prior to this, it was first built as \"Talbot Street\" in 1981, becoming the park's first themed area, home to the ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (Alton Towers)|Around The World in 80 Days]]'' and ''[[Doom & Sons]]'' dark rides.\n\nOn 21 July 2009, a fire broke out in the Sky Ride station for this area, caused by a faulty vending machine. The station was completely destroyed and didn't reopen until the 2010 season.\n<ref name=\"towerstimes.co.uk\">https://www.towerstimes.co.uk/theme-park/transportation/skyride/</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Cloud Cuckoo Land will be replaced by \"The World of [[David Walliams]]\" for the 2020 season, which will feature attractions based around Walliams' series of [[children's books]].<ref>https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/alton-towers-open-new-world-17094301</ref>\n\n=== Dark Forest ===\nThe Dark Forest is themed as a supernatural woodland area; to coincide with the opening of ''[[Thirteen (roller coaster)|TH13TEEN]]'', a steel family coaster themed as a haunted [[crypt]], that opened on 20 March 2010. Th13teen, features the \"world's first freefall drop on a roller coaster\" - an indoor, vertically dropping track element. The ride replaced the ''[[Corkscrew (Alton Towers)|Corkscrew]]''; the park's first roller coaster, which opened in 1980. ''[[Rita (roller coaster)|Rita]]'' is a hydraulically launched steel sit-down coaster that reaches a top speed of 62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km) that is now themed around an abandoned [[Drag racing|drag racer]] that is used to escape the Dark Forest.\n\nThe area was previously a cartoon prehistoric area named Ug Land, which opened in 1999, but was half-demolished to make way for Rita's construction in 2005. Rita used to be themed around drag racing but was changed with the opening of Th13teen and the Dark Forest. With the opening of ''Th13teen'', the area was renamed as Dark Forest and further altered with a new colour scheme and entrance feature. ''Rita'' was also given a repainted control cabin and trains, shortening its name from \"Rita - Queen of Speed\".<ref name=\"thirteen\">{{cite web|title=SW6 Revealed: TH13TEEN|url=http://towersnerd.com/news/item.php?id=193|accessdate=1 December 2009|publisher=Towers Nerd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605233654/http://towersnerd.com/news/item.php?id=193|archive-date=5 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== CBeebies Land ===\n{{Main|CBeebies#CBeebies Land|l1=CBeebies: CBeebies Land}}\n\nCBeebies Land is based on the [[BBC]] children's TV channel: [[CBeebies]].

They belonged to the Talbot family as a stately home until 1924 and largely designed by [[Augustus Pugin]], also noted for his work on the [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|website=Explore Parliament}}</ref> The Towers are now in a state of disrepair following decades of neglect. The ruins are open to the public during most of the open season. However, some areas are closed off as part of a \u00a31.1 million project in place to restore the oldest parts of the Towers. Key areas of The Towers include the banqueting hall, the chapel, conservatories, and Her Ladyship's Gardens.\n\n''[[Hex \u2013 The Legend of the Towers]]'', a walk-through dark ride based within the ruins themselves, opened in 2000. The finale to the ride is a Vekoma [[Madhouse (ride)|Madhouse]] located away from the real Towers but themed as a secret vault. The storyline is based on a local legend about the [[chained oak]] tree, located in a nearby forest, and makes use of the history of the Towers. It draws its theme from the legend of the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury who was said to be cursed by a beggar woman to suffer death every time a branch falls from an old oak tree.\n\nDuring the park's Halloween 'Scarefest' event multiple scare mazes operate within the Towers themselves. For 2018's Scarefest event these were; Sub Species: the End Games, and Altonville Mine Tours.\n\n=== The Gardens ===\n[[File:Alton Towers gardens - geograph.org.uk - 1464404.jpg|thumb|Gardens created by the eccentric 15th [[Earl of Shrewsbury]]]]\n\nNear the garden entrance is a [[cenotaph]] to the 15th Earl, a marble bust with an inscription reading \"He made the desert smile\". Landmarks include a Chinese Pagoda Fountain, The Swiss Cottage, Miniature 'Stonehenge', a Greek Choragic Monument, and orangeries.\n\n== Alton Towers Waterpark ==\n{{Main|Alton Towers Waterpark}}\n[[File:Alton Towers Waterpark1.JPG|thumbnail|left|Alton Towers Waterpark]]\nThe Alton Towers Waterpark, formerly known as Cariba Creek, opened alongside the Splash Landings Hotel in 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Making a splash with a 'waterpark hotel'\n |work        = Daily Mail\n |url         = http://www.altontowers.com/waterpark/openingpricing.asp\n |access-date = 14 January 2014\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070325013647/http://www.altontowers.com/waterpark/openingpricing.asp\n |archivedate = 25 March 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> It is a large (with 7 pools and 10 water slides), part-indoor and part outdoor waterpark themed as a tropical Caribbean lagoon. The waterpark features several fast slides, a [[lazy river]], a giant tipping bucket and many other water features. Also located there are two food and drink venues: Adventures Cave and Ice Cream Shack. Unlike [[Chessington Zoo]] at the also [[Merlin Entertainments|Merlin]] operated [[Chessington World of Adventures Resort]], a separate ticket is needed for waterpark access as it is not included with the theme park entrance price.\n\nAttractions include ''Lagoona Bay'', which is the main tropical pool, with water cannons, geysers and waterfalls. ''The Little Leak'' is a paddling pool for young children with two small slides and interactive pipes to play with, while ''Wacky Waterworks Treehouse'' is a wooden 'treehouse' with water cannons, and other interactive features to squirt passing people with.\n\nThe largest ride in the Waterpark is the [[Water Coaster (Mack Rides)|water coaster]] ''The Master Blaster'', with uphill sections similar to the ''Master Blaster'' at [[Sandcastle Water Park (Blackpool)|Sandcastle Waterpark]], ''Blackpool'' and ''Nucleus'' at [[Water World, Stoke-on-Trent]]. ''The Master Blaster'' is a high speed water flume that contains sharp turns, drops and dark sections, and has views of the entire indoor area of the waterpark.\n\nOther rides include ''Rush & Rampage'', twin racing slides where riders experience wide turns. This attraction requires rubber rings. ''Lazy River (Calypso Creek)'' is a slow-moving water circuit, taking riders underneath spraying water jets and tipping buckets of water. Rubber rings are available. ''The Tipping Bucket'' is a container filled with 1000 litres of water which regularly tips its contents over people standing below. ''Flash Floods'' are tiered outdoor pools with two slides leading to the middle pool and three leading to the bottom. Other swimming pools include ''Volcanic Springs'', and indoor heated hot pool, and ''Bubbly Wubbly Pool'', an outdoor heated pool and whirlpool.\n\nThe indoor section of the water park operates 12 months a year excluding Christmas Day and Boxing Day, although it closes for winter maintenance for around 2 weeks each January.\n\n== Resort accommodation ==\n[[File:Alton Towers Hotel, Staffordshire - geograph.org.uk - 6099.jpg|thumb|The fountain at the entrance to Alton Towers Hotel]]\n\n=== Alton Towers Hotel ===\nThe Alton Towers Hotel opened on 10 April 1996 and is themed to the eccentric fictional character Sir Algenon Alton and his travels. The rooms are decorated in a quirky English style with pictures of Sir Algenon's inventions. The hotel is four star and has 180 rooms. The hotel was the first phase in a plan to turn the theme park into a multi-day resort.\n\nThe Alton Towers Hotel is currently undergoing a long term phased refurbishment to theme each floor to a different setting. So far, the plan has produced the Moon Voyage Bedrooms and Arctic Explorer Bedrooms.\n\n=== Splash Landings Hotel ===\nThe Splash Landings Hotel opened in 2003. The hotel has a relaxed Caribbean theme and is attached to the [[Alton Towers Waterpark]]. It is also four star and it has 216 rooms with a choice of six-room types, Family of 4 'Beachcomber' room, Family of 6 'Beachcomber' room, The Ice Age Suites, The Pirate Suites, Interconnected Family of 4 'Beachcomber' room and, Interconnected Family of 3 'Beachcomber' Room. The interconnected rooms are all on the ground floor and the family of 3 rooms are also disabled accessible. The rooms are numbered in the ranges of 1101 to 1159, 1201 to 1259, 1301 to 1359 and, 1401 to 1459, there are a few room numbers that are not used due to the shape of the hotel, these are 27, 29, 31, 33 and 35 on each floor.\n\n=== Enchanted Village ===\nThe Enchanted Village is made up of 120 lodges and 5 secluded treehouses set in the fictional ''Enchanted Forest'' woodland. Situated next to the Alton Towers hotel, it features new recreational activities, such as various playgrounds for children and an archery range, which is available to use at no extra cost. The site is also home to \"The Crooked Spoon\" restaurant, and also an additional shop which sells alcohol and outdoor activity toys.\n\nThe Enchanted Village opened to the public on 18 April 2015.\n\nAlton Towers have submitted planning application to expand the Enchanted Village in several phases. The application has been approved and if the plans go ahead, construction on the first phase will commence in 2018 with a scheduled opening of March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.towerstimes.co.uk/enchanted-village/ |title=Enchanted Village |publisher=TowersTimes |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== CBeebies Land Hotel ===\nThe CBeebies Land Hotel opened on 8 July 2017, the hotel has a total of 76 themed rooms: 42 standard rooms (themed to the CBeebies Bugbies) and 34 premium rooms themed to different CBeebies shows, such as ''Something Special'' and ''Swashbuckle''. Room amenities include child-friendly features, such as steps up to the sink and children's toilet seats. The hotel features CBeebies-themed shows and entertainment, which run every day of the year, as well as the \"Windmill Restaurant\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.altontowers.com/2017/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827103207/https://www.altontowers.com/2017/ |archive-date=27 August 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Stargazing Pods ===\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\nAlthough Alton Towers had previously gained the necessary permits to expand the Enchanted Village, these plans were eventually scrapped and reduced into a \"pod\"-style accommodation option. 102 individual pods were constructed, each sleeping up to four people.\n\nThe proposals have faced some critical views from the public, with many criticisms being raised over the capacity of bathroom facilities as well as how the resort will cope with the increased demand in food and beverages, as the Stargazing Pods will not have its own restaurant or bar facilities. The council even initially rejected the application citing lack of imagination and \"magic\", although the plans were granted permission the second time without making any notable improvements.\n\nThe Stargazing Pods opened on 12 April 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altontowers.com/short-breaks/stargazing-pods/|title=Stargazing Pods|website=www.altontowers.com|language=en|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recreation ==\n\n=== Alton Towers Spa ===\nAlton Towers Spa is part of the Alton Towers Hotel and opened in 2004. It includes relaxation and treatment rooms and an adults only swimming pool. Despite being inside the Alton Towers Hotel, non-hotel guests are able to use the Spa.\n\n=== Extraordinary Golf ===\nOpened in 2007, the Extraordinary Golf mini-golf attraction is themed to different rides and attractions at the park, some of which, are from the park's history. Extraordinary Golf is located to the west of the Splash Landings Hotel. Extraordinary Golf was refreshed for 2016 including the addition of a Galactica themed hole.\n\n=== Tree Top Quest ===\nOpened May 2015, the Enchanted Forest Tree Top Quest is a high ropes course near the Enchanted Village. The attraction opened shortly after, and accompanies, the Enchanted Village development. There is also a low ropes course. Tree Top Quest did not open for the 2018 season or the start of the 2019 season due to budget cuts by parent company, Merlin Entertainments. It is expected to reopen on 13 July 2019.<ref>https://www.altontowers.com/activities/tree-top-quest/</ref>\n\n== Future developments ==\nAlton Towers is working with children's author [[David Walliams]] to develop a new themed area, 'World of David Walliams', replacing Cloud Cuckoo Land in Spring 2020, the new area will feature a dark ride themed to the author's [[Gangsta Granny]] children's book.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chamberlain |first1=Zoe |title=Alton Towers to open new 'World of David Walliams' attraction |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/alton-towers-open-new-world-17094301 |website=Birmingham Mail |accessdate=11 November 2019 |date=17 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlton Towers is located in a [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|Conservation Area]], which puts restrictions on its permissible development, notably that no structures in the park should be built above tree line and if so should be disguised from external views of the park; this can be seen on the ride [[Rita (roller coaster)|Rita]], where the highest sections of track are camouflaged green.\n\nNoise pollution is also a problem for the park due to the close proximity to the villages of Alton and Farley and the town of [[Cheadle, Staffordshire|Cheadle]]. There have been several cases where Alton Towers have been taken to court over the noise levels emitted from the park and have been served noise abatement orders in 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\n== Secret Weapon roller coasters ==\nAlton Towers has a tradition of codenaming its new roller coaster developments as \"Secret Weapon\", or \"SW\", followed by a number. The name is associated with the park's inclination to promote its rides as holding \"world first\" or in some way \"innovative\" features and records. However the naming tradition actually began for unrelated reasons, since \"Secret Weapon\" was the working title of a roller coaster that was ultimately never commissioned.\n\nSW1 was a [[pipeline roller coaster]], planned to open in around 1992, on what later became the Nemesis site. It was provisionally titled the \"Secret Weapon\", with the intention of theming the ride as an ambiguous weapon testing facility.<ref name=\"The Secret Wepons\">{{cite web|title=The Secret Weapons - Developing the Magic|url=http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/history/articles/secretweapons.htm|website=towerstimes.co.uk|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131104102401/http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/history/articles/secretweapons.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref> [[John Wardley]] rode the [[Arrow Dynamics]] prototype of their pipeline coaster, but stated \"it was very slow and rather boring\",<ref name=\"The creation of Nemesis\">{{cite web|last1=Wardley|first1=John|title=The creation of Nemesis|url=http://www.towersalmanac.com/features/multimedia.php?id=19|website=Alton Towers Almanac|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> as well as the requirement for such a high lift hill being unsuitable for the park's planning restrictions. After a second layout revision, labelled \"SW2\", the ride was scrapped and development on SW3 ([[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]]) began.<ref name=\"The Secret Wepons\"/><ref name=\"The creation of Nemesis\"/> The code name subsequently became the standard preliminary name for major roller coaster projects at the park.\n\nThe naming convention was briefly dropped while the Tussauds Group changed ownership under [[Dubai International Capital]], before being continued by Merlin Entertainments.\n\n== Events ==\n{{Overly detailed|date=January 2019}}\nPrior to the main open season, Alton Towers held the February Half-Term event which saw a selected ride offering opened for the week before the start of the main season in March, however the event was cancelled for 2016; with the exception of Sharkbait Reef which was open for Pirate and Princess Week held at the Resort hotels.\n\n=== Concerts ===\nAlton Towers has a history of hosting concerts since the 1960s. Concerts in recent years have included the Alton Towers Live event in 2011 and 2013. In 2010, there was an 80s concert for the 30th Anniversary featuring [[Rick Astley]] and [[Bananarama]] and also that year hosted a [[P!nk]] concert. In the past these concerts were often held in the car park at an additional fee, however more recently concerts have been held within the theme park. Artists that have performed there include [[Tina Turner]] and [[The Black Eyed Peas]].\n\n=== Oktoberfest ===\nThe \"Alton Towers Oktoberfest\" is a new event scheduled to take place in weekends during late September and early October 2020. It is based on the German festival of [[Oktoberfest]] held traditionally in Munich, Germany. The event will involve themed food and drink, entertainment and extended evening hours with selected rides open.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Oktoberfest? |url=https://support.altontowers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006001078-What-is-Oktoberfest- |website=Alton Towers Resort |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Scarefest ===\n''Scarefest'' is the resort's largest annual event. It celebrates [[Halloween]] with a number of temporary scare maze attractions, scare zones, costumed characters and extended opening hours. Rides and areas are lit with coloured lighting at night, with most rides and attractions continuing to operate until 9pm. The Scarefest event has been running since 2007, although the park started celebrating Halloween with decoration several years before and has operated the ''Terror of the Towers'' scaremaze since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/alton-towers-scarefest-2016-you-10099966|title=Alton Towers reveals plans for Scarefest 2017 with a new addition|first=Steve|last=Wollaston|date=31 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/trips-and-breaks/review-alton-towers-scarefest-2017-12034148|title=Travel review: Alton Towers Scarefest 2016|first=Justin|last=Connolly|date=15 October 2016}}</ref> The scare mazes are [[upcharge attraction]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Timeline of Halloween scare mazes\n!

A family of inbred hillbillies are outcast due to their hideous disfigurement and warped way of life. Through desperation they begin capturing townsfolk, before removing their skin and stitching it into their own in a hope that this may finally give them the beauty they so desire.\n\n* ''Sub Species: The End Games'', a live action horror maze returning in 2018, which will push the boundaries of Scarefest's mazes with multiple routes. A post-apocalyptic, sewer dwelling community have been infested by a species from another world. In order to survive, they appease the creature's hunger by sacrificing innocent people from the surface. However, over time, insanity has twisted the feeding ritual into a sick contest.

According to local legend, she tries to avenge the death of her charges by taking the spirits of the living as penance - will you be her next victim?\n\n==== Past seasonal Scarefest attractions ====\n* ''Terror of the Towers''. The first incarnation of this long-running annual scare maze was introduced in 2002, and was located in the Towers ruins themselves. Many scenes from the original maze are still used. Visitors walked through the long, winding corridors of the Towers, through themed scenes while being pursued by live actors. The finale featured a winding pathway around actors behind fences, who lunged towards visitors, accompanied with heavy strobe effects. For 2003 it was restructured and given the tagline and theme \"Bloodfest Banquet\".\n\n* \"TH13TEEN: After Dark\" has an enhanced queue line for Alton Towers' newest roller coaster, using fog and lighting effects as well as live actors. This attraction did not return for 2012.\n\n* ''Terror of the Towers&nbsp;\u2013 Bloodfest Banquet'' was a new version of the Terror of the Towers scare maze, running from 2003 to 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-bloodfest-banquet-alton-towers/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194338/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-bloodfest-banquet-alton-towers/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> It retained much of the original version, but featured new scenes that included scripted dialogue from the several characters, and a new storyline was added. The strobe maze finale was moved to another point in the maze and replaced by a new ending, in which visitors become trapped in a small room with cages on every side, as actors reach for them through the metal bars for almost a minute. Every year, Terror of the Towers kept changing slightly with revised scenes and new scares.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-2008-readers-review-2008/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194427/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-2008-readers-review-2008/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> However, for the 2009 Scarefest event, Terror of the Towers was once again completely rethought, with the tagline \"What Lies Within\". The new incarnation drops the scripted scenes and characters; meaning it is similar to the original Terror of Towers of 2002. The whole layout for the maze was also reversed, with what was previously the entrance becoming the exit.\n\n* ''Room 13'' was first introduced in 2006 and was located in the conference room of the Alton Towers Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61:alton-towers-hotel-room-13&catid=75&Itemid=126 |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224813/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61%3Aalton-towers-hotel-room-13&catid=75&Itemid=126 |archivedate=25 March 2012 }}</ref> It was only available to guests of the hotel, who were led around the maze as many live actors appeared to scare them. Room 13 had positive reviews and returned in 2007, but was replaced by The Boiler House in 2008.\n\n* ''Field of 1000 Screams'' was first introduced in the 2007 Scarefest event and was the first maze at Alton Towers not situated inside a pre-existing building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/alton-towers-scarefest-maze-reviews-2007/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194613/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/alton-towers-scarefest-maze-reviews-2007/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The Field was located entirely outdoors in a moderately sized field of [[maize]], which had to be planted especially for the event several months earlier. It purported to be a fictional village called Altonville that had become overrun by zombies. Visitors walked down a long pathway cut through the corn, and encountered characters and scares along the way, before the finale took place. The Field of 1000 Screams did not return for the 2010 event.\n\n* ''Haunted Hollow Live'' was first seen in 2007 and consisted of several sinister, costumed actors performing along the Haunted Hollow walkway in Gloomy Wood. The attraction was similar to Duel Live, which was introduced the year later. Haunted Hollow Live returned for the 2008 Scarefest event, but was cancelled for 2009.\n\n* ''Duel Live'' was first introduced in the 2008 Scarefest event. Throughout this period, the park's haunted house dark ride, [[Duel (ride)|Duel]], became host to this attraction, which included live actors situated around the ride circuit. Duel was available to ride normally until 12&nbsp;pm, when the laser guns and LED targets were switched and the actors took their positions. This was changed in 2009, when Duel Live took place throughout the whole day and many more actors than the previous year were present. Duel Live was aimed at the family audience, and included such features as new music playing throughout the ride (instead of the usual Duel theme music), as well as a butler or maid who would welcome you inside the house. The attraction was changed slightly for the 2010 season and featured the park's Scarefest mascots.\n\n* ''Skelvin's Haunted Adventure'' was a newer version of [[Duel (ride)#Duel: Live!|Duel Live]], introduced in 2010, and took over [[Duel (ride)|Duel \u2013 The Haunted House Strikes Back!]] throughout Scarefest. As in previous years, the attraction included live actors situated at different points around the ride. The laser guns and LED targets were switched off during this time. The ride featured the Scarefest mascots, notably the character of \"Skelvin\".\n\n* ''The Boiler House'' was a scare maze first introduced in 2008, and was situated next to the Alton Towers Hotel. Originally, the scare maze was set in an abandoned industrial facility and featured live actors in make up. This was changed in 2009, when a new storyline was added. The scare maze later featured the fictional \"Hamble Twins\" serial killers hiding in the industrial building, and visitors have to escape them as they are chased through the scenes. Visitors queued outside, past a van labelled \"Alton News 24\", from which television screens play news reports on the activity of the serial killers. Guests then walk through a covered walkway, which hides the marquee that the maze is contained in from view. Once inside, a man appears and warns guests about the dangers of coming inside. The murderers then appear and kill him, before chasing visitors away. Each of the Twins are played by two different actors wearing the same grotesque, latex mask. They appear at different points in the maze, creating the illusion that one character is in several places at once. Dim lighting and scent effects are heavily used. For the 2011 Scarefest, The Boiler House moved along with the Carnival of Screams to the X Sector, where they both shared the old Black Hole tent. After three years it did not return for the 2012 season.\n\n* ''Carnival of Screams'' was a scare maze that debuted for the 2010 Scarefest event. During its debut it shared the same temporary building as the Boiler House. John Wardley contributed to the development of ''Carnival of Screams'', which was entered through a large clown face with horrific features. For 2011 it and the Boiler House were relocated to the X-Sector area. The maze is a mixture of humor and serious scares, and the music used is the former ''Toy Land Tours'' attraction theme music warped for dramatic effect. From 2012 onwards, the attraction was situated opposite the hospitality suite, with the exit inside the Goal Striker unit. In 2013 and its final incarnation, the maze gained a theatrical ending involving a knife thrower.\n\n* ''The Sanctuary'' was new for the 2012 Scarefest event and returned in 2013 and 2014. The attraction was set in a research facility operated by \"The Ministry of Joy\". Alton Towers released the following description at the time: \"Lost your Smile? Then check yourself in for a refreshing check up at The Sanctuary. After being closed for new patients for almost 50 years The Sanctuary, The Ministry of Joy\u2019s earliest establishment, is now holding important trials searching for 'Advocates' for its 2013 project.\" It was revealed to be part of marketing for ''[[The Smiler (roller coaster)|The Smiler]]'' roller coaster, which opened in 2013.<ref name=\"The Sanctuary\">{{cite web|title=The Sanctuary new for 2012|url=http://www.towerstimes.co.uk/scarefest/attractions/the-sanctuary/|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=TowersTimes}}</ref>\n\n* ''Scary Tales Scare Zone'' was a walk through scare zone that ran for the 2014 event. The attraction setting revolved around fairy tale stories that were rewritten in a nightmarish manner.\n\n* ''The Haunting of Molly Crowe'', a multi-sensory maze set in the Towers ruins. The maze was based on the old and abandoned house of Molly Crowe, who was last seen engulfed in flames in the cellar of her house, emitting a scream of non-human origin. This ran for the 2015 event.\n\n* ''Nox:Infernus Scare Zone'', a scare zone which ran for the 2015 event, set in the Dark Forest. The underworld rises again - Will you join the Cult or face the end of the world as we know it?\n\n* ''Dark Apocalypse Scare Zone'', a scare zone which was first introduced for the 2015 event and returning in 2016. A deadly virus has spread across Forbidden Valley. The infected show signs of highly aggressive behavior and rapid physical decomposition. Phalanx control has quarantined the area however, a recent security breach has questioned their ability to contain the virus and keep society safe.\n\n* ''Terror of the Towers&nbsp;\u2013 What Lies Within'', the signature maze situated inside the Towers themselves, first introduced in 2002. A new format was introduced in the 2009 Scarefest event, along with the new tagline \"What Lies Within\" replacing \"Bloodfest Banquet\". Visitors queue outside in Her Ladyship's Gardens, and the attraction itself starts in the derelict Conservatories. Batches of guests watch a short video showing two men exploring the Towers for ghosts. The video then cuts short, and guests enter the Towers to find the men. At certain points in the maze, the bodies of the two men are each seen hanging from a noose. Visitors become lost in the lengthy corridors and themed scenes in the Towers, with live actors pursuing them in every room. The finale to the attraction is a maze-like walkway that winds around actors in cages, with strobe effects.\n\n=== Fireworks ===\nFor the last days of the season, Alton Towers host [[Fireworks|firework]] Shows, these have been running annually since the 1990s on the Great Lawns. The displays were considered disruptive by some local residents, which led to formal complaints. Two local residents decided to take the theme park to court regarding this issue. The court issued Alton Towers with a noise abatement order in October 2005 which restricted the theme park to three shows a year, previously five, with noise readings not exceeding 40 decibels outside the park.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Fireworks go-ahead for theme park\n| work=BBC News\n| date=14 October 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/4342978.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> In 2006, the display was rebranded as Electric Towers, but then discontinued. However, the fireworks and laser show was reinstated in 2010 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the theme park and has returned to being an annual event.\n\n=== Other events ===\nDuring the closed season months Alton Towers holds regular ''Pirate & Princess Weekends''. The event entails decorations, and themed activities for children in the Hotels and the waterpark. The theme park's Sharkbait Reef aquarium also opens for the event.\n\nDuring December, the ''Santa's Sleepover'' event takes place. Both resort hotels are decorated for the event and a pantomime takes place. The Alton Towers Theme Park also opens for Christmas with a small number of rides open as well as a Santa's Grotto. The event is largely aimed at children. In 2015, the theme park permitted entry to non-hotel guests for the first time however the event reverted to hotel guests only in 2016. Festive Breaks continue from 27 December 2018 to 6 January 2019 with a similar lineup to the Santa's Sleepovers.\n\nSince 2015 Alton Towers have opened the park for a ''Services Day''; a day where a limited quantity of discounted tickets (fewer than on a usual season day) are sold to those who work in public services<ref name=\"ServicesDay\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bluelightcard.co.uk/newsletters/4thjanuary2017/4thjanuary2017-fjknkwjneuwuwn.php?mid=466017&nid=250|title=Blue Light Card Newsletter|publisher=Blue Light Card|date=4 January 2017|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref> such as the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|Police]], [[NHS]], [[Fire brigade]], [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|Prison service]], [[British Army|Army]], [[RAF]], [[Royal Navy]] and other similar services. Services Day is usually held approximately two weeks prior to the start of the new season, which usually begins mid-March. Due to the success of the 2015, '16 and '17 Services Days, a two-day weekend of Services Days was planned for 3 and 4 March 2018, however this was postponed to 11 March [[2018 Great Britain and Ireland cold wave|due to weather conditions]].

The damage was reparable and had to be closed for six months before reopening midway through the 2008 season. Nobody was harmed.<ref name=\"towerstimes.co.uk\"/>\n\nAnother fire happened to the ride this time in the [[Alton Towers#Cloud Cuckoo Land|Cloud Cuckoo Land]] station in the 2009 season, due to a faulty vending machine, on 21 July 2009. The fire completely destroyed the whole station. Over the following season, the station was rebuilt, ready for the 2010 season.\n\n=== Runaway Mine Train ===\n{{Main|Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)}}\nOn 20 July 2006, when the train was entering the tunnel section of its course, two carriages uncoupled, with the front half of the train continuing up the slope while the rear half remained stuck in the tunnel. The front half failed to make it over the hill, rolled back and crashed into the rear half which had remained stuck in the tunnel. Six people were taken to hospital and 23 others were treated for cuts and bruises. Following the incident the [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] was closed for the rest of the season.

The couple have been in a legal battle with the park for nearly a decade, and during this period succeeded in a noise abatement order on the theme park which led to the audio from the top of the [[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]] drop being removed, and Alton Towers having to limit the amount of annual fireworks displays to only three a year.\n\nStephen and Suzanne Roper, who live only 100 yards from the park, say that their lives have been made a misery by the noise of the screams as well as fireworks displays and music. They launched their legal fight in 2002, but after years of wrangling, their claim for an injunction and damages was thrown out in January 2011. Judge [[Gary Hickinbottom|Mr Justice Hickinbottom]] later overturned that decision, bringing the claim back. This now paves the way for a full court hearing. The Ropers will seek an injunction forcing the park owners to close or relocate some rides and an order forcing them to pay damages for noise suffered from 1998 to the present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Theme-park-noise-battle-reignited/story-15990916-detail/story.html |title=Theme park noise battle is reignited |publisher=This is Staffordshire |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Incidents at European amusement parks]]\n* [[List of theme parks in the United Kingdom]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!--\n**************************************************************** \nPlease DO NOT add fansites here.

Over the next few years, he laid the foundation for the modern theme park by installing various permanent rides and developing areas of the grounds in progressive stages. In the 1980s, Broome opened a succession of rides and roller coasters around the park, including [[Corkscrew (Alton Towers)|Corkscrew]], Pirate Ship (now The Blade), [[Alpine Bobsleigh]], [[The Flume (Alton Towers)|The Flume]], and [[Black Hole (roller coaster)|The Black Hole]].\n\nBroome sold Alton Towers to [[The Tussauds Group]], then a division of [[Pearson plc]], in 1990, after encountering financial troubles in attempting to develop the former [[Battersea Power Station]] into a similar theme park. The change of ownership brought an era of major redevelopment and promotion, involving the opening of large themed areas and new attractions, such as [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] (1992), [[Duel - The Haunted House Strikes Back!|The Haunted House]] (1992), [[Toyland Tours]] (1994), and [[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]] (1994). Later, [[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]] (1998) and Air (2002, now [[Galactica (roller coaster)|Galactica]]) saw the park sustain its reputation for major roller coasters, both marketed as 'World First' rides. Tussauds' park development team from 1990 to 2002 included well-known attraction producer [[John Wardley]], among experienced others.\n\nThe Tussauds Group was sold to venture capitalist firm Charterhouse in 1998, then to [[Dubai International Capital]] (DIC) for \u00a3800 million in 2005.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Dubai firm buys Tussauds\n| work=BBC News\n| date=23 March 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4375219.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> The Tussauds Group was then bought by [[Merlin Entertainments]] in March 2007 for over \u00a31billion from DIC, placing Alton Towers under their control.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal\n| work=BBC News\n| date=23 March 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007, [[The Blackstone Group]] purchased [[The Tussauds Group]] for US$1.9 billion and merged it into [[Merlin Entertainments]] with management by Merlin.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2812377/Merlin-conjures-up-leaseback-deal.html|title=Merlin conjures up leaseback deal|date=17 July 2007|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/05/AR2007030501369.html|title=Blackstone Buys Madame Tussauds Chain|first=David|last=Cho|date=6 March 2007|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Dubai International Capital also gained 20% of Merlin Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm |work=BBC News| title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal | date=5 March 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 July 2007, Alton Towers was sold to private investor [[Nick Leslau]]'s investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6902797.stm |work=BBC News| title=Alton Towers sold in \u00a3622m deal | date=17 July 2007}}</ref> Merlin continues to operate the site under a renewable 35-year lease.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> As of 2016, the property is now transferred to Secure Income REIT Plc, of which Nick Leslau is a non-executive director.<ref name=\"Secure Income REIT Plc\" />\n\n== Rides and attractions ==\n\n=== Roller coasters ===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!

Themed loosely as a town street, it leads to views of the gardens and the Towers across the lake in the distance. Along the pathway are the park's jumping frog fountains and a lawn where seasonal events take place. The first ''SkyRide'' station is located nearby, which is a 1048&nbsp;m long [[Aerial lift|cable car]] transport that opened in 1987, and was refurbished 2009. The [[monorail]] moves guests from the three on-site hotels and the water park to the theme park; it opened 1987 and was refurbished in 2008. In this area during the hour before the park's daily closure, departing guests are entertained by three people wearing police costumes, two of them riding [[Segway]]-like vehicles which play party music and the third standing with an old-fashioned megaphone that is unused, and a man riding a miniature ship while dressed as a sea captain.\n\n=== Katanga Canyon ===\nThemed as an African village; created in 1992 and incorporated existing rapids ride. Rides include the roller coaster [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] and [[Congo River Rapids (Alton Towers)|Congo River Rapids]]. Both are well-established rides in the park whose ride tracks share a tunnel. Congo River Rapids is a river rapids ride that opened 1986, as The Grand Canyon Rapids, and was refurbished in 1992. A 735 m long wild river rapids ride down the Congo River that lasts six minutes. Runaway Mine Train is a steel sit down powered coaster that reaches a speed of 22&nbsp;mph (36&nbsp;km/h) on a 1000&nbsp;ft long track (305 m) and height of {{convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}}; height limit 90&nbsp;cm. It was designed by [[John Wardley]] for Tussauds and manufactured by [[Mack Rides]].\n\n=== Gloomy Wood ===\nGloomy Wood serves as the area for the dark ride ''[[Duel (ride)|Duel - The Haunted House Strikes Back!]]'', originally ''The Haunted House''. Opening in 1992, this was originally Europe's largest haunted dark ride, but was significantly altered with interactive laser guns in 2003. Each player's shooting score is recorded on a display in the ride car, as guests shoot targets around the ride.\n\nIn 2007, a themed footpath through the woods was added to the area, named ''Haunted Hollow''. The pathway follows the route formerly used by the park's old scenic railway, linking from Mutiny Bay. ''Haunted Hollow'' includes tombstones, statues and other features, some of which interact with guests using sound effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altontowers.com/rides-and-attractions/fun-rides/haunted-hollow/|title=Haunted Hollow - Theme Park Experience at Alton Towers Resort|website=www.altontowers.com}}</ref> In July 2015, Nitrogenie opened and replaced the old Waffles and Ices, a shop producing ice cream using liquid [[nitrogen]]. Gloomy Wood was suggested by the 2017 park map to be home to the new ''Wicker Man'' wooden coaster, opening 2018. However, the park later stated that the ride was in Mutiny Bay.\n\n=== Forbidden Valley ===\n[[File:Alton Towers Forbidden Valley ride signs.jpg|thumb|Theming and signs in Forbidden Valley]]\nForbidden Valley is set in a '[[post-apocalyptic]]' landscape, with [[standing stones]] and rustic structures populating the 'valley'. A ''SkyRide'' station also serves this area of the park.\n\nThe area's principal attraction is ''[[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]]'', opened in 1994. ''Nemesis'' is a steel inverted coaster that reaches a speed of 50&nbsp;mph (81&nbsp;km) with four inversions, set in a rocky quarry over waterfalls. The ride is built down into excavated ground and was designed by Tussauds, primarily [[John Wardley]]. The attraction is themed as an alien creature inhabiting the quarry where the coaster is situated. \n\n''The Blade'' is a Huss Pirate Boat modified with a pendulum blade. It opened in 1980, and was relocated to the area in 1997 from Fantasy World. The Blade currently operates as the only flat ride in Forbidden Valley since the removal of ''[[Ripsaw (Alton Towers)|Ripsaw]]''. However, in October 2019, The Blade was dismantled to be 'Resharpened by the Phalanx' and has been added back to the Alton Towers app hinting it\u2019s return.\n\n[[Galactica (roller coaster)|Galactica]] is a B&M flying coaster, originally opening as ''Air'' in 2002. Air was loosely themed as a peaceful landscape, distanced from the 'apocalyptic' look of Nemesis. Air was redesigned as Galactica in 2016, adopting [[virtual reality]] headsets and a space travel theme. The VR headsets have since been removed due to feedback from customers.<ref name=\"Twitter170320191501\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/altontowers/status/1107295909078097923|date=17 March 2019|accessdate=18 March 2019|title=Reply to user @Ev_Jay|quote=Galactica no longer features VR due to guest feedback regarding their experience on the ride.|publisher=Alton Towers official Twitter account}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, the '[[Rollercoaster Restaurant]]' opened, offering a dining experience where guests have their food delivered by looping rails. The restaurant is open daily from 10am - 9:30pm; available to guests without theme park admission after the park has closed, except during Scarefest and Fireworks events.\n\n=== Adventure Land ===\nAdventure Land is a small family area featuring ''[[Spinball Whizzer (roller coaster)|Spinball Whizzer]]'';<ref>{{cite web|title=Theme Park|url=https://www.altontowers.com/theme-park/|website=Alton Towers|accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> based on a pinball machine in which the car is the ball whizzing around the machine. The ride originally had this name, until 2010 when it was known as ''Sonic Spinball'' until the name change back in 2016 when a contract ended with SEGA after six years. The ride is a Maurer S\u00f6hne spinning roller coaster, in which riders sit in cars that can spin on their base whilst travelling at speed around the track. For the park map, Spinball Whizzer is listed as being in The Towers area.\n\nAdventure Land is named after the adventure play ground which previously sat on the site. The former play area was one of the attractions of a larger area called Kiddies Kingdom. In 1996, Kiddies Kingdom was split into Adventure Land and Storybook Land.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adventure Land |url=https://towersstreet.com/theme-park/area/adventure-land/#areahistory |website=towersstreet.com |accessdate=17 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== X-Sector ===\n[[File:Oblivion2015.JPG|thumb|View of Oblivion]]\nX-Sector is themed as a secretive industrial complex, suggested to be subjecting park guests to experimental testing.\n\nThe area currently contains three thrill rides. The steel dive coaster ''[[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]]'' which opened in 1998 as \"the world's first vertical drop rollercoaster\", designed by Tussauds and manufactured by [[Bolliger & Mabillard]]. The cars are held over the edge of the drop for three seconds, before diving into a deep tunnel. ''[[The Smiler]]'' is a [[Gerstlauer]] [[Infinity Coaster]] which opened in May 2013 and currently holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster at 14.<ref name=\"Uttoxeter Advertiser\"/>  ''Enterprise'' is a standard HUSS [[Enterprise (ride)|Enterprise]] model which opened in 1984, spinning riders 360 degrees and giving the illusion of defying gravity. The area layout was partially altered in 2013 season to accommodate the opening of The Smiler.\n\nPrevious rides in X-Sector include The [[Black Hole (roller coaster)|Black Hole]], which was a Jet Star 2 coaster enclosed in a tent, where The Smiler is located today. [[Boneshaker (Alton Towers)|Energizer]] (later renamed Boneshaker) was a swinging gondola flat ride. It was replaced by [[Submission (Alton Towers)|Submission]] in 2001, a \"Chance Double Inverter\" flat ride, which was itself removed in 2014.\n\n=== Mutiny Bay ===\n[[File:Alton Towers 05.jpg|thumb|Mutiny Bay's pirates]]\nMutiny Bay is a pirate-themed family area, which opened in 2008.<ref name=\"Attractions2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaapa.org/ |title=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |date=January 2009 |publisher=IAAPA |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> the area was a retheme for Merrie England.\n\nAttractions in Mutiny Bay include: ''[[Battle Galleons]]'', an interactive \"Splash Battle\" boat ride, where guests sit in tracked boats while soaking other riders with water cannons. Also in the area is the rocking boat ride, ''Heave Ho''. The park's original teacups ride was re-themed to become ''[[Marauder's Mayhem (Alton Towers)|Marauders Mayhem]]'', with the tea cup cars being redesigned as gunpowder barrels. '' The Flume'' was a [[Mack Rides|Mack]] log flume ride that opened in 1981 and was rethemed in 2004 with a sponsorship from Imperial Leather alongside the bubbleworks at Chessington world of adventure. Upon opening, it was the longest flume ride in the world at {{Convert|886|m}}.<ref name=\"Attractions2009\" /> Late in the 2015 season, the ride and the neighboring tavern closed and were removed in 2016 to make way for the [[Wicker Man (roller coaster)|Wicker Man]] roller coaster and the \"Welcome Inn\" bar which shares the coaster's theme.\n\nIn 2009, a [[Sea Life Centres|Sea Life Centre]] named ''Sharkbait Reef'' opened in the location previously home to the 3-D Cinema.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for 3-D Cinema replacement|date=March 2020}} This includes \"touch pools\" for interacting with underwater species and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} underwater tunnel.<ref name=\"Sharkbait Reef Info\">{{cite web |title=Sharkbait Reef by SEA LIFE |url=https://www.towerstimes.co.uk/theme-park/mutiny-bay/sharkbait-reef-by-sea-life/ |website=TowersTimes |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== The World of David Walliams ===\n[[File:Alton Towers - Circuit voitures pour enfants.jpg|thumb|Driving School attraction in Cloud Cuckoo Land]]\nThe World of David Walliams is aimed at younger children aged 7-11, featuring bright colours and fantasy decor. Attractions include ''Raj's Bouncy Bottom Burp'' (the former Frog Hopper) and ''Royal Carousel'' (previously Galloper's Carousel). ''[[Driving School (Alton Towers)|Cuckoo Cars Driving School]]'' allows children to drive miniature electric cars around a themed road layout, featuring visual jokes along the way.<ref>{{cite news | title=Coming soon \u2026 the first 'drive of your life' | publisher=easier.com | date=10 July 2006 | url=http://www.easier.com/view/News/Motoring/Peugeot/article-59601.html | accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> A SkyRide station is located nearby Fountain Square, giving access to other areas of the park.\nThe area was previously known as \"Cred Street\" and \"The Land of Make Believe\", with a cartoon-inspired look, mainly featuring ''[[Toyland Tours]]''. Prior to this, it was first built as \"Talbot Street\" in 1981, becoming the park's first themed area, home to the ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (Alton Towers)|Around The World in 80 Days]]'' and ''[[Doom & Sons]]'' dark rides.\n\nOn 21 July 2009, a fire broke out in the Sky Ride station for this area, caused by a faulty vending machine. The station was completely destroyed and didn't reopen until the 2010 season.\n<ref name=\"towerstimes.co.uk\">https://www.towerstimes.co.uk/theme-park/transportation/skyride/</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Cloud Cuckoo Land will be replaced by \"The World of [[David Walliams]]\" for the 2020 season, which will feature attractions based around Walliams' series of [[children's books]].<ref>https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/alton-towers-open-new-world-17094301</ref>\n\n=== Dark Forest ===\nThe Dark Forest is themed as a supernatural woodland area; to coincide with the opening of ''[[Thirteen (roller coaster)|TH13TEEN]]'', a steel family coaster themed as a haunted [[crypt]], that opened on 20 March 2010. Th13teen, features the \"world's first freefall drop on a roller coaster\" - an indoor, vertically dropping track element. The ride replaced the ''[[Corkscrew (Alton Towers)|Corkscrew]]''; the park's first roller coaster, which opened in 1980. ''[[Rita (roller coaster)|Rita]]'' is a hydraulically launched steel sit-down coaster that reaches a top speed of 62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km) that is now themed around an abandoned [[Drag racing|drag racer]] that is used to escape the Dark Forest.\n\nThe area was previously a cartoon prehistoric area named Ug Land, which opened in 1999, but was half-demolished to make way for Rita's construction in 2005. Rita used to be themed around drag racing but was changed with the opening of Th13teen and the Dark Forest. With the opening of ''Th13teen'', the area was renamed as Dark Forest and further altered with a new colour scheme and entrance feature. ''Rita'' was also given a repainted control cabin and trains, shortening its name from \"Rita - Queen of Speed\".<ref name=\"thirteen\">{{cite web|title=SW6 Revealed: TH13TEEN|url=http://towersnerd.com/news/item.php?id=193|accessdate=1 December 2009|publisher=Towers Nerd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605233654/http://towersnerd.com/news/item.php?id=193|archive-date=5 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== CBeebies Land ===\n{{Main|CBeebies#CBeebies Land|l1=CBeebies: CBeebies Land}}\n\nCBeebies Land is based on the [[BBC]] children's TV channel: [[CBeebies]].

They belonged to the Talbot family as a stately home until 1924 and largely designed by [[Augustus Pugin]], also noted for his work on the [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|website=Explore Parliament}}</ref> The Towers are now in a state of disrepair following decades of neglect. The ruins are open to the public during most of the open season. However, some areas are closed off as part of a \u00a31.1 million project in place to restore the oldest parts of the Towers. Key areas of The Towers include the banqueting hall, the chapel, conservatories, and Her Ladyship's Gardens.\n\n''[[Hex \u2013 The Legend of the Towers]]'', a walk-through dark ride based within the ruins themselves, opened in 2000. The finale to the ride is a Vekoma [[Madhouse (ride)|Madhouse]] located away from the real Towers but themed as a secret vault. The storyline is based on a local legend about the [[chained oak]] tree, located in a nearby forest, and makes use of the history of the Towers. It draws its theme from the legend of the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury who was said to be cursed by a beggar woman to suffer death every time a branch falls from an old oak tree.\n\nDuring the park's Halloween 'Scarefest' event multiple scare mazes operate within the Towers themselves. For 2018's Scarefest event these were; Sub Species: the End Games, and Altonville Mine Tours.\n\n=== The Gardens ===\n[[File:Alton Towers gardens - geograph.org.uk - 1464404.jpg|thumb|Gardens created by the eccentric 15th [[Earl of Shrewsbury]]]]\n\nNear the garden entrance is a [[cenotaph]] to the 15th Earl, a marble bust with an inscription reading \"He made the desert smile\". Landmarks include a Chinese Pagoda Fountain, The Swiss Cottage, Miniature 'Stonehenge', a Greek Choragic Monument, and orangeries.\n\n== Alton Towers Waterpark ==\n{{Main|Alton Towers Waterpark}}\n[[File:Alton Towers Waterpark1.JPG|thumbnail|left|Alton Towers Waterpark]]\nThe Alton Towers Waterpark, formerly known as Cariba Creek, opened alongside the Splash Landings Hotel in 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Making a splash with a 'waterpark hotel'\n |work        = Daily Mail\n |url         = http://www.altontowers.com/waterpark/openingpricing.asp\n |access-date = 14 January 2014\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070325013647/http://www.altontowers.com/waterpark/openingpricing.asp\n |archivedate = 25 March 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> It is a large (with 7 pools and 10 water slides), part-indoor and part outdoor waterpark themed as a tropical Caribbean lagoon. The waterpark features several fast slides, a [[lazy river]], a giant tipping bucket and many other water features. Also located there are two food and drink venues: Adventures Cave and Ice Cream Shack. Unlike [[Chessington Zoo]] at the also [[Merlin Entertainments|Merlin]] operated [[Chessington World of Adventures Resort]], a separate ticket is needed for waterpark access as it is not included with the theme park entrance price.\n\nAttractions include ''Lagoona Bay'', which is the main tropical pool, with water cannons, geysers and waterfalls. ''The Little Leak'' is a paddling pool for young children with two small slides and interactive pipes to play with, while ''Wacky Waterworks Treehouse'' is a wooden 'treehouse' with water cannons, and other interactive features to squirt passing people with.\n\nThe largest ride in the Waterpark is the [[Water Coaster (Mack Rides)|water coaster]] ''The Master Blaster'', with uphill sections similar to the ''Master Blaster'' at [[Sandcastle Water Park (Blackpool)|Sandcastle Waterpark]], ''Blackpool'' and ''Nucleus'' at [[Water World, Stoke-on-Trent]]. ''The Master Blaster'' is a high speed water flume that contains sharp turns, drops and dark sections, and has views of the entire indoor area of the waterpark.\n\nOther rides include ''Rush & Rampage'', twin racing slides where riders experience wide turns. This attraction requires rubber rings. ''Lazy River (Calypso Creek)'' is a slow-moving water circuit, taking riders underneath spraying water jets and tipping buckets of water. Rubber rings are available. ''The Tipping Bucket'' is a container filled with 1000 litres of water which regularly tips its contents over people standing below. ''Flash Floods'' are tiered outdoor pools with two slides leading to the middle pool and three leading to the bottom. Other swimming pools include ''Volcanic Springs'', and indoor heated hot pool, and ''Bubbly Wubbly Pool'', an outdoor heated pool and whirlpool.\n\nThe indoor section of the water park operates 12 months a year excluding Christmas Day and Boxing Day, although it closes for winter maintenance for around 2 weeks each January.\n\n== Resort accommodation ==\n[[File:Alton Towers Hotel, Staffordshire - geograph.org.uk - 6099.jpg|thumb|The fountain at the entrance to Alton Towers Hotel]]\n\n=== Alton Towers Hotel ===\nThe Alton Towers Hotel opened on 10 April 1996 and is themed to the eccentric fictional character Sir Algenon Alton and his travels. The rooms are decorated in a quirky English style with pictures of Sir Algenon's inventions. The hotel is four star and has 180 rooms. The hotel was the first phase in a plan to turn the theme park into a multi-day resort.\n\nThe Alton Towers Hotel is currently undergoing a long term phased refurbishment to theme each floor to a different setting. So far, the plan has produced the Moon Voyage Bedrooms and Arctic Explorer Bedrooms.\n\n=== Splash Landings Hotel ===\nThe Splash Landings Hotel opened in 2003. The hotel has a relaxed Caribbean theme and is attached to the [[Alton Towers Waterpark]]. It is also four star and it has 216 rooms with a choice of six-room types, Family of 4 'Beachcomber' room, Family of 6 'Beachcomber' room, The Ice Age Suites, The Pirate Suites, Interconnected Family of 4 'Beachcomber' room and, Interconnected Family of 3 'Beachcomber' Room. The interconnected rooms are all on the ground floor and the family of 3 rooms are also disabled accessible. The rooms are numbered in the ranges of 1101 to 1159, 1201 to 1259, 1301 to 1359 and, 1401 to 1459, there are a few room numbers that are not used due to the shape of the hotel, these are 27, 29, 31, 33 and 35 on each floor.\n\n=== Enchanted Village ===\nThe Enchanted Village is made up of 120 lodges and 5 secluded treehouses set in the fictional ''Enchanted Forest'' woodland. Situated next to the Alton Towers hotel, it features new recreational activities, such as various playgrounds for children and an archery range, which is available to use at no extra cost. The site is also home to \"The Crooked Spoon\" restaurant, and also an additional shop which sells alcohol and outdoor activity toys.\n\nThe Enchanted Village opened to the public on 18 April 2015.\n\nAlton Towers have submitted planning application to expand the Enchanted Village in several phases. The application has been approved and if the plans go ahead, construction on the first phase will commence in 2018 with a scheduled opening of March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.towerstimes.co.uk/enchanted-village/ |title=Enchanted Village |publisher=TowersTimes |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== CBeebies Land Hotel ===\nThe CBeebies Land Hotel opened on 8 July 2017, the hotel has a total of 76 themed rooms: 42 standard rooms (themed to the CBeebies Bugbies) and 34 premium rooms themed to different CBeebies shows, such as ''Something Special'' and ''Swashbuckle''. Room amenities include child-friendly features, such as steps up to the sink and children's toilet seats. The hotel features CBeebies-themed shows and entertainment, which run every day of the year, as well as the \"Windmill Restaurant\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.altontowers.com/2017/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827103207/https://www.altontowers.com/2017/ |archive-date=27 August 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Stargazing Pods ===\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\nAlthough Alton Towers had previously gained the necessary permits to expand the Enchanted Village, these plans were eventually scrapped and reduced into a \"pod\"-style accommodation option. 102 individual pods were constructed, each sleeping up to four people.\n\nThe proposals have faced some critical views from the public, with many criticisms being raised over the capacity of bathroom facilities as well as how the resort will cope with the increased demand in food and beverages, as the Stargazing Pods will not have its own restaurant or bar facilities. The council even initially rejected the application citing lack of imagination and \"magic\", although the plans were granted permission the second time without making any notable improvements.\n\nThe Stargazing Pods opened on 12 April 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altontowers.com/short-breaks/stargazing-pods/|title=Stargazing Pods|website=www.altontowers.com|language=en|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recreation ==\n\n=== Alton Towers Spa ===\nAlton Towers Spa is part of the Alton Towers Hotel and opened in 2004. It includes relaxation and treatment rooms and an adults only swimming pool. Despite being inside the Alton Towers Hotel, non-hotel guests are able to use the Spa.\n\n=== Extraordinary Golf ===\nOpened in 2007, the Extraordinary Golf mini-golf attraction is themed to different rides and attractions at the park, some of which, are from the park's history. Extraordinary Golf is located to the west of the Splash Landings Hotel. Extraordinary Golf was refreshed for 2016 including the addition of a Galactica themed hole.\n\n=== Tree Top Quest ===\nOpened May 2015, the Enchanted Forest Tree Top Quest is a high ropes course near the Enchanted Village. The attraction opened shortly after, and accompanies, the Enchanted Village development. There is also a low ropes course. Tree Top Quest did not open for the 2018 season or the start of the 2019 season due to budget cuts by parent company, Merlin Entertainments. It is expected to reopen on 13 July 2019.<ref>https://www.altontowers.com/activities/tree-top-quest/</ref>\n\n== Future developments ==\nAlton Towers is working with children's author [[David Walliams]] to develop a new themed area, 'World of David Walliams', replacing Cloud Cuckoo Land in Spring 2020, the new area will feature a dark ride themed to the author's [[Gangsta Granny]] children's book.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chamberlain |first1=Zoe |title=Alton Towers to open new 'World of David Walliams' attraction |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/alton-towers-open-new-world-17094301 |website=Birmingham Mail |accessdate=11 November 2019 |date=17 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlton Towers is located in a [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|Conservation Area]], which puts restrictions on its permissible development, notably that no structures in the park should be built above tree line and if so should be disguised from external views of the park; this can be seen on the ride [[Rita (roller coaster)|Rita]], where the highest sections of track are camouflaged green.\n\nNoise pollution is also a problem for the park due to the close proximity to the villages of Alton and Farley and the town of [[Cheadle, Staffordshire|Cheadle]]. There have been several cases where Alton Towers have been taken to court over the noise levels emitted from the park and have been served noise abatement orders in 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\n== Secret Weapon roller coasters ==\nAlton Towers has a tradition of codenaming its new roller coaster developments as \"Secret Weapon\", or \"SW\", followed by a number. The name is associated with the park's inclination to promote its rides as holding \"world first\" or in some way \"innovative\" features and records. However the naming tradition actually began for unrelated reasons, since \"Secret Weapon\" was the working title of a roller coaster that was ultimately never commissioned.\n\nSW1 was a [[pipeline roller coaster]], planned to open in around 1992, on what later became the Nemesis site. It was provisionally titled the \"Secret Weapon\", with the intention of theming the ride as an ambiguous weapon testing facility.<ref name=\"The Secret Wepons\">{{cite web|title=The Secret Weapons - Developing the Magic|url=http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/history/articles/secretweapons.htm|website=towerstimes.co.uk|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131104102401/http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/history/articles/secretweapons.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref> [[John Wardley]] rode the [[Arrow Dynamics]] prototype of their pipeline coaster, but stated \"it was very slow and rather boring\",<ref name=\"The creation of Nemesis\">{{cite web|last1=Wardley|first1=John|title=The creation of Nemesis|url=http://www.towersalmanac.com/features/multimedia.php?id=19|website=Alton Towers Almanac|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> as well as the requirement for such a high lift hill being unsuitable for the park's planning restrictions. After a second layout revision, labelled \"SW2\", the ride was scrapped and development on SW3 ([[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]]) began.<ref name=\"The Secret Wepons\"/><ref name=\"The creation of Nemesis\"/> The code name subsequently became the standard preliminary name for major roller coaster projects at the park.\n\nThe naming convention was briefly dropped while the Tussauds Group changed ownership under [[Dubai International Capital]], before being continued by Merlin Entertainments.\n\n== Events ==\n{{Overly detailed|date=January 2019}}\nPrior to the main open season, Alton Towers held the February Half-Term event which saw a selected ride offering opened for the week before the start of the main season in March, however the event was cancelled for 2016; with the exception of Sharkbait Reef which was open for Pirate and Princess Week held at the Resort hotels.\n\n=== Concerts ===\nAlton Towers has a history of hosting concerts since the 1960s. Concerts in recent years have included the Alton Towers Live event in 2011 and 2013. In 2010, there was an 80s concert for the 30th Anniversary featuring [[Rick Astley]] and [[Bananarama]] and also that year hosted a [[P!nk]] concert. In the past these concerts were often held in the car park at an additional fee, however more recently concerts have been held within the theme park. Artists that have performed there include [[Tina Turner]] and [[The Black Eyed Peas]].\n\n=== Oktoberfest ===\nThe \"Alton Towers Oktoberfest\" is a new event scheduled to take place in weekends during late September and early October 2020. It is based on the German festival of [[Oktoberfest]] held traditionally in Munich, Germany. The event will involve themed food and drink, entertainment and extended evening hours with selected rides open.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Oktoberfest? |url=https://support.altontowers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006001078-What-is-Oktoberfest- |website=Alton Towers Resort |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Scarefest ===\n''Scarefest'' is the resort's largest annual event. It celebrates [[Halloween]] with a number of temporary scare maze attractions, scare zones, costumed characters and extended opening hours. Rides and areas are lit with coloured lighting at night, with most rides and attractions continuing to operate until 9pm. The Scarefest event has been running since 2007, although the park started celebrating Halloween with decoration several years before and has operated the ''Terror of the Towers'' scaremaze since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/alton-towers-scarefest-2016-you-10099966|title=Alton Towers reveals plans for Scarefest 2017 with a new addition|first=Steve|last=Wollaston|date=31 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/trips-and-breaks/review-alton-towers-scarefest-2017-12034148|title=Travel review: Alton Towers Scarefest 2016|first=Justin|last=Connolly|date=15 October 2016}}</ref> The scare mazes are [[upcharge attraction]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Timeline of Halloween scare mazes\n!

A family of inbred hillbillies are outcast due to their hideous disfigurement and warped way of life. Through desperation they begin capturing townsfolk, before removing their skin and stitching it into their own in a hope that this may finally give them the beauty they so desire.\n\n* ''Sub Species: The End Games'', a live action horror maze returning in 2018, which will push the boundaries of Scarefest's mazes with multiple routes. A post-apocalyptic, sewer dwelling community have been infested by a species from another world. In order to survive, they appease the creature's hunger by sacrificing innocent people from the surface. However, over time, insanity has twisted the feeding ritual into a sick contest.

According to local legend, she tries to avenge the death of her charges by taking the spirits of the living as penance - will you be her next victim?\n\n==== Past seasonal Scarefest attractions ====\n* ''Terror of the Towers''. The first incarnation of this long-running annual scare maze was introduced in 2002, and was located in the Towers ruins themselves. Many scenes from the original maze are still used. Visitors walked through the long, winding corridors of the Towers, through themed scenes while being pursued by live actors. The finale featured a winding pathway around actors behind fences, who lunged towards visitors, accompanied with heavy strobe effects. For 2003 it was restructured and given the tagline and theme \"Bloodfest Banquet\".\n\n* \"TH13TEEN: After Dark\" has an enhanced queue line for Alton Towers' newest roller coaster, using fog and lighting effects as well as live actors. This attraction did not return for 2012.\n\n* ''Terror of the Towers&nbsp;\u2013 Bloodfest Banquet'' was a new version of the Terror of the Towers scare maze, running from 2003 to 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-bloodfest-banquet-alton-towers/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194338/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-bloodfest-banquet-alton-towers/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> It retained much of the original version, but featured new scenes that included scripted dialogue from the several characters, and a new storyline was added. The strobe maze finale was moved to another point in the maze and replaced by a new ending, in which visitors become trapped in a small room with cages on every side, as actors reach for them through the metal bars for almost a minute. Every year, Terror of the Towers kept changing slightly with revised scenes and new scares.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-2008-readers-review-2008/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194427/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-2008-readers-review-2008/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> However, for the 2009 Scarefest event, Terror of the Towers was once again completely rethought, with the tagline \"What Lies Within\". The new incarnation drops the scripted scenes and characters; meaning it is similar to the original Terror of Towers of 2002. The whole layout for the maze was also reversed, with what was previously the entrance becoming the exit.\n\n* ''Room 13'' was first introduced in 2006 and was located in the conference room of the Alton Towers Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61:alton-towers-hotel-room-13&catid=75&Itemid=126 |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224813/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61%3Aalton-towers-hotel-room-13&catid=75&Itemid=126 |archivedate=25 March 2012 }}</ref> It was only available to guests of the hotel, who were led around the maze as many live actors appeared to scare them. Room 13 had positive reviews and returned in 2007, but was replaced by The Boiler House in 2008.\n\n* ''Field of 1000 Screams'' was first introduced in the 2007 Scarefest event and was the first maze at Alton Towers not situated inside a pre-existing building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/alton-towers-scarefest-maze-reviews-2007/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194613/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/alton-towers-scarefest-maze-reviews-2007/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The Field was located entirely outdoors in a moderately sized field of [[maize]], which had to be planted especially for the event several months earlier. It purported to be a fictional village called Altonville that had become overrun by zombies. Visitors walked down a long pathway cut through the corn, and encountered characters and scares along the way, before the finale took place. The Field of 1000 Screams did not return for the 2010 event.\n\n* ''Haunted Hollow Live'' was first seen in 2007 and consisted of several sinister, costumed actors performing along the Haunted Hollow walkway in Gloomy Wood. The attraction was similar to Duel Live, which was introduced the year later. Haunted Hollow Live returned for the 2008 Scarefest event, but was cancelled for 2009.\n\n* ''Duel Live'' was first introduced in the 2008 Scarefest event. Throughout this period, the park's haunted house dark ride, [[Duel (ride)|Duel]], became host to this attraction, which included live actors situated around the ride circuit. Duel was available to ride normally until 12&nbsp;pm, when the laser guns and LED targets were switched and the actors took their positions. This was changed in 2009, when Duel Live took place throughout the whole day and many more actors than the previous year were present. Duel Live was aimed at the family audience, and included such features as new music playing throughout the ride (instead of the usual Duel theme music), as well as a butler or maid who would welcome you inside the house. The attraction was changed slightly for the 2010 season and featured the park's Scarefest mascots.\n\n* ''Skelvin's Haunted Adventure'' was a newer version of [[Duel (ride)#Duel: Live!|Duel Live]], introduced in 2010, and took over [[Duel (ride)|Duel \u2013 The Haunted House Strikes Back!]] throughout Scarefest. As in previous years, the attraction included live actors situated at different points around the ride. The laser guns and LED targets were switched off during this time. The ride featured the Scarefest mascots, notably the character of \"Skelvin\".\n\n* ''The Boiler House'' was a scare maze first introduced in 2008, and was situated next to the Alton Towers Hotel. Originally, the scare maze was set in an abandoned industrial facility and featured live actors in make up. This was changed in 2009, when a new storyline was added. The scare maze later featured the fictional \"Hamble Twins\" serial killers hiding in the industrial building, and visitors have to escape them as they are chased through the scenes. Visitors queued outside, past a van labelled \"Alton News 24\", from which television screens play news reports on the activity of the serial killers. Guests then walk through a covered walkway, which hides the marquee that the maze is contained in from view. Once inside, a man appears and warns guests about the dangers of coming inside. The murderers then appear and kill him, before chasing visitors away. Each of the Twins are played by two different actors wearing the same grotesque, latex mask. They appear at different points in the maze, creating the illusion that one character is in several places at once. Dim lighting and scent effects are heavily used. For the 2011 Scarefest, The Boiler House moved along with the Carnival of Screams to the X Sector, where they both shared the old Black Hole tent. After three years it did not return for the 2012 season.\n\n* ''Carnival of Screams'' was a scare maze that debuted for the 2010 Scarefest event. During its debut it shared the same temporary building as the Boiler House. John Wardley contributed to the development of ''Carnival of Screams'', which was entered through a large clown face with horrific features. For 2011 it and the Boiler House were relocated to the X-Sector area. The maze is a mixture of humor and serious scares, and the music used is the former ''Toy Land Tours'' attraction theme music warped for dramatic effect. From 2012 onwards, the attraction was situated opposite the hospitality suite, with the exit inside the Goal Striker unit. In 2013 and its final incarnation, the maze gained a theatrical ending involving a knife thrower.\n\n* ''The Sanctuary'' was new for the 2012 Scarefest event and returned in 2013 and 2014. The attraction was set in a research facility operated by \"The Ministry of Joy\". Alton Towers released the following description at the time: \"Lost your Smile? Then check yourself in for a refreshing check up at The Sanctuary. After being closed for new patients for almost 50 years The Sanctuary, The Ministry of Joy\u2019s earliest establishment, is now holding important trials searching for 'Advocates' for its 2013 project.\" It was revealed to be part of marketing for ''[[The Smiler (roller coaster)|The Smiler]]'' roller coaster, which opened in 2013.<ref name=\"The Sanctuary\">{{cite web|title=The Sanctuary new for 2012|url=http://www.towerstimes.co.uk/scarefest/attractions/the-sanctuary/|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=TowersTimes}}</ref>\n\n* ''Scary Tales Scare Zone'' was a walk through scare zone that ran for the 2014 event. The attraction setting revolved around fairy tale stories that were rewritten in a nightmarish manner.\n\n* ''The Haunting of Molly Crowe'', a multi-sensory maze set in the Towers ruins. The maze was based on the old and abandoned house of Molly Crowe, who was last seen engulfed in flames in the cellar of her house, emitting a scream of non-human origin. This ran for the 2015 event.\n\n* ''Nox:Infernus Scare Zone'', a scare zone which ran for the 2015 event, set in the Dark Forest. The underworld rises again - Will you join the Cult or face the end of the world as we know it?\n\n* ''Dark Apocalypse Scare Zone'', a scare zone which was first introduced for the 2015 event and returning in 2016. A deadly virus has spread across Forbidden Valley. The infected show signs of highly aggressive behavior and rapid physical decomposition. Phalanx control has quarantined the area however, a recent security breach has questioned their ability to contain the virus and keep society safe.\n\n* ''Terror of the Towers&nbsp;\u2013 What Lies Within'', the signature maze situated inside the Towers themselves, first introduced in 2002. A new format was introduced in the 2009 Scarefest event, along with the new tagline \"What Lies Within\" replacing \"Bloodfest Banquet\". Visitors queue outside in Her Ladyship's Gardens, and the attraction itself starts in the derelict Conservatories. Batches of guests watch a short video showing two men exploring the Towers for ghosts. The video then cuts short, and guests enter the Towers to find the men. At certain points in the maze, the bodies of the two men are each seen hanging from a noose. Visitors become lost in the lengthy corridors and themed scenes in the Towers, with live actors pursuing them in every room. The finale to the attraction is a maze-like walkway that winds around actors in cages, with strobe effects.\n\n=== Fireworks ===\nFor the last days of the season, Alton Towers host [[Fireworks|firework]] Shows, these have been running annually since the 1990s on the Great Lawns. The displays were considered disruptive by some local residents, which led to formal complaints. Two local residents decided to take the theme park to court regarding this issue. The court issued Alton Towers with a noise abatement order in October 2005 which restricted the theme park to three shows a year, previously five, with noise readings not exceeding 40 decibels outside the park.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Fireworks go-ahead for theme park\n| work=BBC News\n| date=14 October 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/4342978.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> In 2006, the display was rebranded as Electric Towers, but then discontinued. However, the fireworks and laser show was reinstated in 2010 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the theme park and has returned to being an annual event.\n\n=== Other events ===\nDuring the closed season months Alton Towers holds regular ''Pirate & Princess Weekends''. The event entails decorations, and themed activities for children in the Hotels and the waterpark. The theme park's Sharkbait Reef aquarium also opens for the event.\n\nDuring December, the ''Santa's Sleepover'' event takes place. Both resort hotels are decorated for the event and a pantomime takes place. The Alton Towers Theme Park also opens for Christmas with a small number of rides open as well as a Santa's Grotto. The event is largely aimed at children. In 2015, the theme park permitted entry to non-hotel guests for the first time however the event reverted to hotel guests only in 2016. Festive Breaks continue from 27 December 2018 to 6 January 2019 with a similar lineup to the Santa's Sleepovers.\n\nSince 2015 Alton Towers have opened the park for a ''Services Day''; a day where a limited quantity of discounted tickets (fewer than on a usual season day) are sold to those who work in public services<ref name=\"ServicesDay\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bluelightcard.co.uk/newsletters/4thjanuary2017/4thjanuary2017-fjknkwjneuwuwn.php?mid=466017&nid=250|title=Blue Light Card Newsletter|publisher=Blue Light Card|date=4 January 2017|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref> such as the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|Police]], [[NHS]], [[Fire brigade]], [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|Prison service]], [[British Army|Army]], [[RAF]], [[Royal Navy]] and other similar services.

The damage was reparable and had to be closed for six months before reopening midway through the 2008 season. Nobody was harmed.<ref name=\"towerstimes.co.uk\"/>\n\nAnother fire happened to the ride this time in the [[Alton Towers#Cloud Cuckoo Land|Cloud Cuckoo Land]] station in the 2009 season, due to a faulty vending machine, on 21 July 2009. The fire completely destroyed the whole station. Over the following season, the station was rebuilt, ready for the 2010 season.\n\n=== Runaway Mine Train ===\n{{Main|Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)}}\nOn 20 July 2006, when the train was entering the tunnel section of its course, two carriages uncoupled, with the front half of the train continuing up the slope while the rear half remained stuck in the tunnel. The front half failed to make it over the hill, rolled back and crashed into the rear half which had remained stuck in the tunnel. Six people were taken to hospital and 23 others were treated for cuts and bruises. Following the incident the [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] was closed for the rest of the season.

The couple have been in a legal battle with the park for nearly a decade, and during this period succeeded in a noise abatement order on the theme park which led to the audio from the top of the [[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]] drop being removed, and Alton Towers having to limit the amount of annual fireworks displays to only three a year.\n\nStephen and Suzanne Roper, who live only 100 yards from the park, say that their lives have been made a misery by the noise of the screams as well as fireworks displays and music. They launched their legal fight in 2002, but after years of wrangling, their claim for an injunction and damages was thrown out in January 2011. Judge [[Gary Hickinbottom|Mr Justice Hickinbottom]] later overturned that decision, bringing the claim back. This now paves the way for a full court hearing. The Ropers will seek an injunction forcing the park owners to close or relocate some rides and an order forcing them to pay damages for noise suffered from 1998 to the present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Theme-park-noise-battle-reignited/story-15990916-detail/story.html |title=Theme park noise battle is reignited |publisher=This is Staffordshire |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Incidents at European amusement parks]]\n* [[List of theme parks in the United Kingdom]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!--\n**************************************************************** \nPlease DO NOT add fansites here.

The umpire indicates this type of let by announcing \"Let. First serve,\" or \"Let. Second serve.\" Lets typically occur when an otherwise-valid serve makes contact with the net before hitting the ground. Theoretically, a player could serve an infinite number of otherwise-valid let serves, but a serve that touches the net and then lands out of bounds counts as one of the two allowed serves. A let can also be called during play when there is some distraction to either player not caused by the players themselves, such as a ball boy moving behind a receiver, debris flying across the court in windy conditions, or a ball accidentally falling out of a player's pocket or entering from a neighboring court. The call is made by the chair umpire when one is assigned to the match, as in professional matches, or one of the players when there is no chair umpire. When a receiver is legitimately unprepared for a serve, a let is technically the result, even if the word goes unspoken.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rules of Tennis|year=2012|publisher=ITF|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/117960/117960.pdf|page=9}}</ref>{{sfnp|Shine|2003|pp=70\u201371|ps=}}\n* {{Anchor|Line call|line call}} '''[[Line call]]''' (or '''call'''): Call made by the ''[[#line judge|line judge]]''.

Theoretically, a player could serve an infinite number of otherwise-valid let serves, but a serve that touches the net and then lands out of bounds counts as one of the two allowed serves. A let can also be called during play when there is some distraction to either player not caused by the players themselves, such as a ball boy moving behind a receiver, debris flying across the court in windy conditions, or a ball accidentally falling out of a player's pocket or entering from a neighboring court. The call is made by the chair umpire when one is assigned to the match, as in professional matches, or one of the players when there is no chair umpire. When a receiver is legitimately unprepared for a serve, a let is technically the result, even if the word goes unspoken.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rules of Tennis|year=2012|publisher=ITF|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/117960/117960.pdf|page=9}}</ref>{{sfnp|Shine|2003|pp=70\u201371|ps=}}\n* {{Anchor|Line call|line call}} '''[[Line call]]''' (or '''call'''): Call made by the ''[[#line judge|line judge]]''.

The maximum brightness is obtained when the minor component moves through the [[accretion disk]] of the supermassive component at [[apsis#Terminology|perinigricon]].\n\nThe mass was calculated in 2008 by a team led by [[Mauri Valtonen]] of [[Tuorla Observatory]] in Finland.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7181877.stm | title = Huge black hole tips the scales | date = 2008-01-10 | accessdate = 2008-01-10 | publisher = [[BBC]]}}</ref> The timing of these outbursts allows the [[precession]] of the companion's elliptical orbit to be measured (39\u00b0 per orbit), which allows the mass of the central black hole to be calculated using [[Albert Einstein]]'s principles of [[General relativity]] (see [[Kepler problem in general relativity]]).<ref name=newscientist/>\n\nThe accuracy of this measurement has been called into question due to the limited number and precision of observed companion orbits, but the calculated value will be further refined using future measurements. The companion's orbit is decaying via the emission of [[gravitational radiation]] and it is expected to merge with the central black hole within approximately 10,000 years.<ref name=newscientist/><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Valtonen | first1 = M.
