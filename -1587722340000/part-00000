It is located in the east of the [[Gulf of Gemlik]]. It is approximately {{convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from [[Bursa]]. Gemlik is an industrial port and it has a [[Free economic zone|freezone]] trade center. Port of Gemlik is one of the busiest import harbors in Turkey. Before industrialization, Gemlik's economy based on fishery and olive agriculture. Black olive still the symbol of the town.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nAs a rumor; in [[Ottoman era|Ottoman-era]], Gemlik called as '''Gemilik''' (eng. shipyard). Because there was a [[shipyard]] in the town to build [[Galleon]]s for the [[Ottoman Navy]]\n\nAs of 1920, the British were calling Gemlik, '''Geumlek''' in publications.<ref name=\"Prothero75\">{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/75/}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n'''Cius''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/\u02c8sa\u026a\u0259s/]]; [[Greek language|Greek]]: K\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 or \u039a\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 ''Kios''), later renamed '''Prusias on the Sea''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/\u02c8pru\u02d0\u0292\u0259s/]]; [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Prusias ad Mare'') after king [[Prusias I of Bithynia]], was an [[ancient Greek]] city bordering the Propontis (now known as the [[Sea of Marmara]]), in [[Ancient Bithynia|Bithynia]] and formerly in [[Ancient Mysia|Mysia]] (in modern northwestern Turkey), and had a long history, being mentioned by [[Herodotus]], [[Xenophon]], [[Aristotle]], [[Strabo]] and [[Apollonius Rhodius]]. It was strategically placed at the head of a gulf in the Propontis, called the gulf of Cius, or ''Cianus Sinus''. Herodotus calls it '''Cius of Mysia'''; and also [[Xenophon]], from which it appears that Mysia, even in Xenophon's time, extended at least as far east as the head of the gulf of Cius. [[Pliny the Elder]] reports that Cius was a [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] colony. It was at the foot of [[Mount Arganthonius]], and there was a myth that [[Hylas]], one of the companions of [[Heracles]] on the voyage to [[Colchis]], was carried off by the nymphs when he went to get water here; and also that Cius, another companion of Heracles, on his return from Colchis, stayed here and founded the city, to which he gave his name. Pliny mentions a river Hylas and a river Cius here, one of which reminds us of the name of the youth who was stolen by the nymphs, and the other of the mythical founder. The Cius may be the channel by which the lake Ascania discharges its waters into the gulf of Cius; though Pliny speaks of the ''Ascanium flumen'' as flowing into the gulf, and we must assume that he gives this name to the channel which connects the lake and the sea. If the river Cius is not identical with this channel, it must be a small stream near Cius. As [[Ptolemy]] speaks of the outlets of the Ascanius, it has been conjectured that there may have been two, and that they may be the Hylas and Cius of Pliny; but the plural \u1f10\u03ba\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03af does not necessarily mean more than a single mouth; and Pliny certainly says that the Ascanius flows into the gulf. However, his geography is a constant cause of difficulty. The position of Cius made it the port for the inland parts, and it became a place of much commercial importance. [[Pomponius Mela]] calls it the most convenient emporium of [[Ancient Phrygia|Phrygia]], which was at no great distance from it.\n\nCius was taken by the [[Ancient Persia|Persians]], after the burning of [[Sardis]], in 499 BCE. It joined the [[Aetolian League]], and was destroyed by [[Philip V of Macedon]] in the [[Second Macedonian War]] (200\u2013197 BCE), and given by him to [[Prusias I of Bithynia]]. Prusias, who had assisted Philip in ruining Cius, restored it under the name of '''Prusias''' (\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2). It was sometimes called Prusias \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03af\u03b7, or \"on the sea,\" to distinguish it from other towns of the same name, or \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd. In the text of [[Memnon of Heraclea|Memnon]] the reading is ''Cierus''; but Memnon, both in this and other passages, has confounded Cius and [[Cierus]]. But it is remarked that Cius must either have still existed by the side of the new city, or must have recovered its old name; for Pliny mentions Cius, and also Mela, [[Zosimus]], and writers of a still later date. It was an important chain in the ancient [[Silk Road]] and became known as a wealthy town.\n\nThere are coins of Cius, with the legend \u039a\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, belonging to the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]]; and there are coins of Prusias with the epigraph, \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd.\n\nCius became an early Christian [[bishopric]]. Its bishop, Cyrillus, took part in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, and Theosebius attended the [[Council of Ephesus]]. The names of many of his successors in the first millennium are known from extant contemporary documents. At first a [[suffragan]] of [[Nicomedia]], it soon became an autocephalous [[archdiocese]], being listed as such in ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' from the 7th century onward. No longer a residential bishopric, Cius is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP-->\n\nIn 1891, there were 5147 people lived in town center including; 4620 Greeks, 242 Turks, 178 foreigner and 107 Armenian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gemlik.gov.tr/tarihce|title=Tarih\u00e7e|website=gemlik.gov.tr|access-date=7 February 2020}}</ref> As of 1920, Gemlik was estimated to have a population of 5,000 (.

It is located in the east of the [[Gulf of Gemlik]]. It is approximately {{convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from [[Bursa]]. Gemlik is an industrial port and it has a [[Free economic zone|freezone]] trade center. There is also important industrial establishments in south and west of the harbors. Port of Gemlik is one of the busiest import harbors in Turkey. Also Gemlik is renowned for [[Gemlik olive|black olives]] .\n\n==Etymology==\n\nAs a rumor; in [[Ottoman era|Ottoman-era]], Gemlik called as '''Gemilik''' (eng. shipyard). Because there was a [[shipyard]] in the town to build [[Galleon]]s for the [[Ottoman Navy]]\n\nAs of 1920, the British were calling Gemlik, '''Geumlek''' in publications.<ref name=\"Prothero75\">{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/75/}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n'''Cius''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/\u02c8sa\u026a\u0259s/]]; [[Greek language|Greek]]: K\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 or \u039a\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 ''Kios''), later renamed '''Prusias on the Sea''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/\u02c8pru\u02d0\u0292\u0259s/]]; [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Prusias ad Mare'') after king [[Prusias I of Bithynia]], was an [[ancient Greek]] city bordering the Propontis (now known as the [[Sea of Marmara]]), in [[Ancient Bithynia|Bithynia]] and formerly in [[Ancient Mysia|Mysia]] (in modern northwestern Turkey), and had a long history, being mentioned by [[Herodotus]], [[Xenophon]], [[Aristotle]], [[Strabo]] and [[Apollonius Rhodius]]. It was strategically placed at the head of a gulf in the Propontis, called the gulf of Cius, or ''Cianus Sinus''. Herodotus calls it '''Cius of Mysia'''; and also [[Xenophon]], from which it appears that Mysia, even in Xenophon's time, extended at least as far east as the head of the gulf of Cius. [[Pliny the Elder]] reports that Cius was a [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] colony. It was at the foot of [[Mount Arganthonius]], and there was a myth that [[Hylas]], one of the companions of [[Heracles]] on the voyage to [[Colchis]], was carried off by the nymphs when he went to get water here; and also that Cius, another companion of Heracles, on his return from Colchis, stayed here and founded the city, to which he gave his name. Pliny mentions a river Hylas and a river Cius here, one of which reminds us of the name of the youth who was stolen by the nymphs, and the other of the mythical founder. The Cius may be the channel by which the lake Ascania discharges its waters into the gulf of Cius; though Pliny speaks of the ''Ascanium flumen'' as flowing into the gulf, and we must assume that he gives this name to the channel which connects the lake and the sea. If the river Cius is not identical with this channel, it must be a small stream near Cius. As [[Ptolemy]] speaks of the outlets of the Ascanius, it has been conjectured that there may have been two, and that they may be the Hylas and Cius of Pliny; but the plural \u1f10\u03ba\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03af does not necessarily mean more than a single mouth; and Pliny certainly says that the Ascanius flows into the gulf. However, his geography is a constant cause of difficulty. The position of Cius made it the port for the inland parts, and it became a place of much commercial importance. [[Pomponius Mela]] calls it the most convenient emporium of [[Ancient Phrygia|Phrygia]], which was at no great distance from it.\n\nCius was taken by the [[Ancient Persia|Persians]], after the burning of [[Sardis]], in 499 BCE. It joined the [[Aetolian League]], and was destroyed by [[Philip V of Macedon]] in the [[Second Macedonian War]] (200\u2013197 BCE), and given by him to [[Prusias I of Bithynia]]. Prusias, who had assisted Philip in ruining Cius, restored it under the name of '''Prusias''' (\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2). It was sometimes called Prusias \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03af\u03b7, or \"on the sea,\" to distinguish it from other towns of the same name, or \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd. In the text of [[Memnon of Heraclea|Memnon]] the reading is ''Cierus''; but Memnon, both in this and other passages, has confounded Cius and [[Cierus]]. But it is remarked that Cius must either have still existed by the side of the new city, or must have recovered its old name; for Pliny mentions Cius, and also Mela, [[Zosimus]], and writers of a still later date. It was an important chain in the ancient [[Silk Road]] and became known as a wealthy town.\n\nThere are coins of Cius, with the legend \u039a\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, belonging to the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]]; and there are coins of Prusias with the epigraph, \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd.\n\nCius became an early Christian [[bishopric]]. Its bishop, Cyrillus, took part in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, and Theosebius attended the [[Council of Ephesus]]. The names of many of his successors in the first millennium are known from extant contemporary documents. At first a [[suffragan]] of [[Nicomedia]], it soon became an autocephalous [[archdiocese]], being listed as such in ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' from the 7th century onward. No longer a residential bishopric, Cius is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP-->\n\nIn 1891, there were 5147 people lived in town center including; 4620 Greeks, 242 Turks, 178 foreigner and 107 Armenian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gemlik.gov.tr/tarihce|title=Tarih\u00e7e|website=gemlik.gov.tr|access-date=7 February 2020}}</ref> As of 1920, Gemlik was estimated to have a population of 5,000 (.

The olfactory receptor (OR) cells are [[neuron]]s present in the [[olfactory epithelium]], which is a small patch of tissue at the back of the [[nasal cavity]]. There are millions of olfactory receptor neurons that act as sensory signaling cells. Each neuron has [[cilia]] in direct contact with the air. Odorous molecules bind to receptor proteins extending from cilia and act as a chemical stimulus, initiating electric signals that travel along the olfactory nerve's [[axon]]s to the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=de march |first1=Claire A. |last2=Ryu |first2=sangEun |last3=Sicard |first3=Gilles |last4=Moon |first4=Cheil |last5=Golebiowski |first5=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |title=Structure\u2013odour relationships reviewed in the postgenomic era |journal=Flavour and Fragrance Journal |date=September 2015 |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=342\u201361 |doi=10.1002/ffj.3249}}</ref>\n\nWhen an electrical signal reaches a threshold, the neuron fires, which sends a signal traveling along the axon to the [[olfactory bulb]], a part of the [[limbic system]] of the brain. Interpretation of the smell begins there, relating the smell to past experiences and in relation to the substance(s) inhaled. The olfactory bulb acts as a relay station connecting the nose to the olfactory cortex in the brain. Olfactory information is further processed and forwarded to the central nervous system (CNS), which controls emotions and behavior as well as basic thought processes.\n\nOdor sensation usually depends on the concentration (number of molecules) available to the olfactory receptors. A single odorant is usually recognized by many receptors. Different odorants are recognized by combinations of receptors. The patterns of neuron signals help to identify the smell. The olfactory system does not interpret a single compound, but instead the whole odorous mix. This does not correspond to the concentration or intensity of any single constituent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Axel |first1=Richard |year=1995 |title=The molecular logic of smell |journal=Scientific American |volume=273 |issue=4 |pages=154\u201359 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1095-154 |pmid=7481719 |bibcode=1995SciAm.273d.154A}}</ref><ref name=\"p.492\">[[#Spengler|Spengler]], p. 492</ref>\n\nMost odors consists of [[organic compound]]s, although some simple compounds not containing carbon, such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]], are also odorants. The perception of an odor effect is a two-step process. First, there is the physiological part. This is the detection of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] by receptors in the nose. The stimuli are recognized by the region of the human brain which handles olfaction. Because of this, an [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[analytical technique|analytical]] measure of odor is impossible.

The sensitivity and ability to discriminate odors diminishes with exposure, and the brain tends to ignore continuous stimulus and focus on differences and changes in a particular sensation. When odorants are mixed, a habitual odorant is blocked. This depends on the strength of the odorants in the mixture, which can change the perception and processing of an odor. This process helps classify similar odors as well as adjust sensitivity to differences in complex stimuli.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Devriese |first1=S |last2=Winters |first2=W |last3=Stegen |first3=K |last4=Diest |first4=I Van |last5=Veulemans |first5=H |last6=Nemery |first6=B |last7=Eelen |first7=P |date= 2000 |title=Generalization of acquired somatic symptoms in response to odors: a pavlovian perspective on multiple chemical sensitivity|pmid=11138993 |journal=Psychosom.

He suggested the evolutionary pressure of diversification of food sources and increased complexity of food preparation presented humans with a broader range of odorants, ultimately leading to a \"richer repertoire of smells\". Animals such as dogs show a greater sensitivity to odors than humans, especially in studies using short-chain compounds. Higher cognitive brain mechanisms and more olfactory brain regions enable humans to discriminate odors better than other mammals despite fewer olfactory receptor genes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020146 |pmc=406401 |title=The Human Sense of Smell: Are We Better Than We Think? |year=2004 |last1=Shepherd |first1=Gordon M. |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e146 |pmid=15138509}}</ref>\n\n== Measuring techniques ==\n\n=== Olfaktometrie ===\nIn [[Germany]], the concentrations of odorants have since the 1870s been defined by ''[[Olfaktometrie]]'', which helps to analyze the [[human sense]] of smell according to [[odor substance concentration]], intensity of odor, odor quality, and [[hedonic assessment]].\n\nThe most accurate smell sensing is when a smell is first encountered, before habituation begins to change perception of odor.\n\n==== Concentration ====\nOdor concentration is an odor's pervasiveness. To measure odor sensation, an odor is diluted to a [[odor threshold|detection or recognition threshold]]. The detection threshold is the concentration of an odor in air when 50% of a population can distinguish between the odorous sample and an odor-free reference sample. The recognition odor threshold is usually a factor of 2 to 5 times higher than the detection threshold.<ref name=\"p.483\"/>\n\nThe measurement of odor concentration is the most widespread method to quantify odors. It is standardized in [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN EN]] 13725:2003.<ref>[http://www.sipe-rtd.info/directive/air-quality-determination-odour-concentration-dynamic-olfactometry CEN EN 13725:2003, Air quality \u2013 Determination of odour concentration by dynamic olfactometry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505060914/http://www.sipe-rtd.info/directive/air-quality-determination-odour-concentration-dynamic-olfactometry |date=2015-05-05 }}. sipe-rtd.info</ref> The method is based on dilution of an odor sample to the odor threshold. The numerical value of the odor concentration is equal to the dilution factor that is necessary to reach the odor threshold. Its unit is the ''European Odour Unit'', OU<sub>E</sub>. Therefore, the odor concentration at the odor threshold is 1 OU<sub>E</sub> by definition.\n\n==== Olfactometer ====\nTo establish the odor concentration, an olfactometer is used which employs a group of human panelists. A diluted odorous mixture and an odor-free gas\u2014[[n-Butanol]]\u2014as a reference are presented from sniffing ports to a group of panelists who are sensitive in their perception of odor. To collect an odor sample, the samples must be collected using specialized sample bags, which are made from an odor free material, e.g. [[Teflon]]. The most accepted technique for collecting odor samples is the lung technique, where the sample bag is placed in a sealed drum, where a vacuum is created outside the bag, which fills under expansion, and draws into itself the sample from the source. Critically, all components which touch the odor sample, must be odor free, which includes lines and fittings.\n\nIn comparing the odor emitted from each port, the panelists are asked to report if they can detect a difference between the ports. The gas-diluting ratio is then decreased by a factor of 1.4 or two (i.e., the concentration is increased accordingly). The panelists are asked to repeat the test. This continues until the panelists respond with certainty and correctly twice in a row. These responses are used to calculate the concentration of the odor in terms of European odor units (OU<sub>E</sub>/m<sup>3</sup>), where 1 OU<sub>E</sub>/m<sup>3</sup>\u226140 ppb/v n-butanol.<ref name = hierarchical>{{cite journal |author1= Van Harreveld, A.

Analytical monitoring of individual chemical compounds present in such an odor is usually not practical. As a result, odor sensory methods, instead of instrumental methods, are normally used to measure such odor. Odor sensory methods are available to monitor odor both from source emissions and in the ambient air. These two contexts require different approaches for measuring odor. The collection of odor samples is more easily accomplished for a source emission than for odor in the ambient air.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cpcb.nic.in/divisionsofheadoffice/pci2/package_odourreport_2.12.08.pdf |title=Guidelines on Odour Pollution & It's Control |publisher=Ministry of Environment & Forests, Govt. of India |date=May 2008 |access-date=2014-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409230750/http://cpcb.nic.in/divisionsofheadoffice/pci2/package_odourreport_2.12.08.pdf |archive-date=2009-04-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nField measurement with portable [[Olfactometer|field olfactometers]] can seem more effective, but olfactometer use is not regulated in Europe, while it is popular in the U.S. and Canada, where several States set limits at the receptor sites or along the perimeter of odor-emitting plants, expressed in units of dilution-to-threshold (D/T).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.aidic.it/cet/12/30/018.pdf |title=Measurement of Odour Concentration of Immissions using a New Field Olfactometer and Markers' Chemical Analysis|journal=Chemical Engineering Transactions|volume=30|year=2012|page=103|author1= Benzo, Maurizio|author2=Mantovani, Alice |author3=Pittarello, Alberto }}</ref>\n\n==== Intensity ====\nOdor intensity is the perceived strength of odor sensation. This intensity property is used to locate the source of odors and perhaps most directly related to odor nuisance.<ref name=\"p.492\"/>\n\nThe perceived strength of the odor sensation is measured in conjunction with odor concentration.

It is important to note that intensity and hedonic tone, whilst similar, refer to different things: that is, the strength of the odor (intensity) and the pleasantness of an odor (hedonic tone). Moreover, it is important to note that perception of an odor may change from pleasant to unpleasant with increasing concentration, intensity, time, frequency, and previous experience with a specific odor\u2014all factors in determining a response.<ref>[[#Spengler|Spengler]], p. 486</ref>\n\n=== FIDOL factors ===\nThe overall set of qualities are sometimes identified as the \"FIDOL factors\", (short for '''F'''requency, '''I'''ntensity, '''D'''uration, '''O'''ffensiveness and '''L'''ocation).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.odorimpact.com/en/fidol.shtml |title= F.i.d.o.l. |accessdate= 2011-11-30 }}</ref>\n\nThe character of an odor is a critical element in assessing an odor. This property is the ability to distinguish different odors and is only descriptive. First, a basic description is used\u2014such as sweet, pungent, acrid, fragrant, warm, dry, or sour. The odor is then referenced to a source such as sewage or apple which can then be followed by a reference to a specific chemical such as acids or gasoline.<ref name=\"p.492\"/>\n\nMost commonly, a set of standard descriptors is used, which may range from \"fragrant\" to \"sewer odor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/air/odour-guidelines-jun03/html/page6.html |title=Odour Assessment |publisher=MFE.govt.nz |accessdate=2012-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122072859/http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/air/odour-guidelines-jun03/html/page6.html |archive-date=2012-11-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although the method is fairly simplistic, it is important for the FIDOL factors to be understood by the person rating the smell.

These are a function of modeled concentration, averaging time (over what time period the model steps are run over, typically hourly), and a percentile. Percentiles refer to a statistical representation of how many hours per year the concentration C may be exceeded based on the averaging period.\n\n=== Sampling from area sources ===\nThere are two main odor sampling techniques: direct and indirect odor sampling techniques.\n\n==== Direct sampling ====\nDirect refers to the placement of an enclosure on or over an emitting surface from which samples are collected, and an odor emission rate is determined.\n\nThe most commonly used direct methods include the flux chamber<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceschmidt.com/flux4hra.htm |title=Flux Chamber Measurements: Defensible Analytical Data for Evaluating Human Health Risk |publisher=Ceschmidt.com |accessdate=2012-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208030440/http://ceschmidt.com/flux4hra.htm |archive-date=2013-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[wind tunnel]]s which include the UNSW wind tunnel.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120320101812/http://www.odour.unsw.edu.au/wind-tunnel-design.html UNSW wind tunnel dimensions]. Odour.unsw.edu.au</ref> There are many other available techniques, and consideration should be given to a number of factors before selecting a suitable method.\n\nA source which has implications for this method are sources, such as bark bed [[biofilter]]s, that have a vertical velocity component. For such sources, consideration must be given as to the most appropriate method. A commonly used technique is to measure the odor concentration at the emitting surface, and combine this with the volumetric flow rate of air entering the biofilter to produce an emission rate.\n\n==== Indirect sampling ====\nIndirect sampling is often referred to as back calculation. It involves the use of a mathematical formula to predict an emission rate.\n\nMany methods are used, but all make use of the same inputs which include surface roughness, upwind and downwind concentrations, stability class (or other similar factor), wind speed, and wind direction.\n\n== Health risks ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=December 2019}}\nThe human sense of smell is a primary factor in the sensation of comfort. Olfaction as a sensory system brings awareness of the presence of airborne chemicals. Some inhaled chemicals are volatile compounds that act as a stimulus, triggering unwanted reactions such as nose, eye, and [[throat irritation]]. Perception of odor and of irritation is unique to each person, and varies because of physical conditions or memory of past exposures to similar chemicals. A person's specific threshold, before an odor becomes a nuisance, depends also on the frequency, concentration, and duration of an odor.\n\nThe perception of irritation from odor sensation is hard to investigate because exposure to a volatile chemical elicits a different response based on sensory and physiological signals, and interpretation of these signals is influenced by experience, expectations, personality, or situational factors. [[Volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) may have higher concentrations in confined indoor environments, due to restricted infiltration of fresh air, as compared to the outdoor environment, leading to greater potential for toxic health exposures from a variety of chemical compounds. Health effects of odor are traced to the sensation of an odor or the odorant itself. Health effects and symptoms vary\u2014including eye, nose, or throat irritation, cough, chest tightness, drowsiness, and mood change\u2014all of which decrease as an odor ceases. Odors may also trigger illnesses such as asthma, depression, stress-induced illness, or hypersensitivity. The ability to perform tasks may decrease, and other social/behavioral changes may occur.\n\nOccupants should expect remediation from disturbing and unexpected odors that disturb concentration, diminish productivity, evoke symptoms, and generally increase the dislike for a particular environment. It is important to set occupational exposure limits (OELs) to ensure the health and safety of workers, as well as comfort, because exposure to chemicals can elicit physiological and biochemical changes in the upper respiratory system. Standards are hard to set when exposures are not reported and can also be hard to measure. Workforce populations vary in terms of discomfort from odors because of exposure history or habituation, and they may not realize possible risks of exposure to chemicals that produce specific odors.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Young, Christopher A. |title=What Smells?|journal= Pollution Engineering|volume= 42|issue=5 |year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11981666|year=2002|last1=Dalton|first1=P|title=Odor, irritation and perception of health risk|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|volume=75|issue=5|pages=283\u201390|doi=10.1007/s00420-002-0312-x}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Types of odors}}Types==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Whole industries have developed around products to remove unpleasant odors (see [[deodorant]]).\n\nOdor molecules transmit messages to the [[limbic system]], the area of the brain that governs emotional responses. Some believe that these messages have the power to alter moods, evoke distant memories, raise their spirits, and boost self-confidence. This belief has led to the concept of \"[[aromatherapy]]\" wherein fragrances are claimed to cure a wide range of psychological and physical problems. Aromatherapy claims that fragrances can positively affect sleep, stress, alertness, social interaction, and general feelings of well-being. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of aromatherapy consists mostly of [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]] and lacks controlled [[science|scientific]] studies to back up its claims.\n\nWith some fragrances, such as those found in perfume, scented shampoo, scented deodorant, or similar products, people can be allergic to the ingredients. The reaction, as with other chemical allergies, can be anywhere from a slight headache to [[anaphylactic shock]], which can result in death.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nUnpleasant odors play various roles in nature, often to warn of danger, though this may not be known to the subject who smells it.<ref name=\"Trygg\"/> An odor that is viewed as unpleasant by some people or cultures can be viewed as attractive by others where it is more familiar or has a better reputation.<ref name=\"Trygg\"/>\n\nIt is commonly thought that those exuding an unpleasant [[body odor]] will be unattractive to others. But studies have shown that a person who is exposed to a particular unpleasant odor can be attracted to others who have been exposed to the same unpleasant odor.<ref name=\"Trygg\">{{Cite book |last1=Engen |first1=Trygg |title=Odor sensation and memory |year=1991 |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |isbn=978-0-275-94111-6 |pages=}}</ref> This includes smells associated with pollution.<ref name=\"Trygg\"/>\n\nWhat causes a substance to smell unpleasant may be different from what one perceives. For example, [[perspiration]] is often viewed as having an unpleasant odor, but it is odorless. It is the bacteria in the perspiration that cause the odor.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R0eixKqC0SgC&pg=PA104&dq=%22unpleasant+odor%22stink |title=What's Happening to My Body?

The most common sources of industrial odor arise from [[sewage treatment]] plants, [[Refining|refineries]], animal rendering factories, and industries processing chemicals (such as sulfur) which have odorous characteristics. Sometimes industrial odor sources are the subject of community controversy and scientific analysis.\n\n[[Body odor]] is present both in animals and humans and its intensity can be influenced by many factors (behavioral patterns, survival strategies). Body odor has a strong genetic basis both in animals and humans, but it can be also strongly influenced by various diseases and psychological conditions.\n\n===Study===\nThe study of odors is a growing field but is a complex and difficult one. The human [[olfactory system]] can detect many thousands of scents based on only minute airborne concentrations of a chemical. The sense of smell of many animals is even better. Some fragrant flowers give off ''[[Bee learning and communication|odor plumes]]'' that move downwind and are detectable by [[bee]]s more than a kilometer away.\n\nThe study of odors is complicated by the complex chemistry taking place at the moment of a smell sensation. For example, iron-containing metallic objects are perceived to have a distinctive odor when touched, although iron's [[vapor pressure]] is negligible. According to a 2006 study, this smell is the result of [[aldehyde]]s (for example, [[nonanal]]) and [[ketone]]s: [[1-Octen-3-one|1-octen-3-one]]) released from the human skin on contact with [[ferrous]] ions that are formed in the sweat-mediated corrosion of iron. The same chemicals are also associated with the smell of blood, as ferrous iron in blood on skin produces the same reaction.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Glindemann |first1=Dietmar |last2=Dietrich |first2=Andrea |last3=Staerk |first3=Hans-Joachim |last4=Kuschk |first4=Peter |year=2006 |title=Communication The Two Odors of Iron when Touched or Pickled: (Skin) Carbonyl Compounds and Organophosphines |url= |journal=[[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] |volume= 45 |issue=42 |pages= 7006\u201309 |doi=10.1002/anie.200602100 |pmid=17009284 }}</ref>\n\n===Pheromones===\n[[Pheromone]]s are odors that are used for communication, and are sometimes called \"airborne hormones\". A female [[moth]] may release a pheromone that can entice a male moth that is several kilometers downwind. [[Honeybee]] queens constantly release pheromones that regulate the activity of the [[Beehive|hive]]. Worker bees can release such smells to call other bees into an appropriate cavity when a swarm moves into new quarters, or to \"sound\" an alarm when the hive is threatened.\n\n===Advanced technology===\n\nMost artificial or [[electronic nose]] instruments work by combining output from an array of non-specific [[chemical sensors]] to produce a fingerprint of whatever volatile chemicals in the local environment.

When people find that a particular perfume or aftershave is perceived positively, they may be hard-pressed to change it. Olfactory communication is  natural in humans. Without perfume or aftershave, humans unconsciously detect people's natural scents: in the form of pheromones.

The olfactory receptor (OR) cells are [[neuron]]s present in the [[olfactory epithelium]], which is a small patch of tissue at the back of the [[nasal cavity]]. There are millions of olfactory receptor neurons that act as sensory signaling cells. Each neuron has [[cilia]] in direct contact with the air. Odorous molecules bind to receptor proteins extending from cilia and act as a chemical stimulus, initiating electric signals that travel along the olfactory nerve's [[axon]]s to the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=de march |first1=Claire A. |last2=Ryu |first2=sangEun |last3=Sicard |first3=Gilles |last4=Moon |first4=Cheil |last5=Golebiowski |first5=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |title=Structure\u2013odour relationships reviewed in the postgenomic era |journal=Flavour and Fragrance Journal |date=September 2015 |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=342\u201361 |doi=10.1002/ffj.3249}}</ref>\n\nWhen an electrical signal reaches a threshold, the neuron fires, which sends a signal traveling along the axon to the [[olfactory bulb]], a part of the [[limbic system]] of the brain. Interpretation of the smell begins there, relating the smell to past experiences and in relation to the substance(s) inhaled. The olfactory bulb acts as a relay station connecting the nose to the olfactory cortex in the brain. Olfactory information is further processed and forwarded to the central nervous system (CNS), which controls emotions and behavior as well as basic thought processes.\n\nOdor sensation usually depends on the concentration (number of molecules) available to the olfactory receptors. A single odorant is usually recognized by many receptors. Different odorants are recognized by combinations of receptors. The patterns of neuron signals help to identify the smell. The olfactory system does not interpret a single compound, but instead the whole odorous mix. This does not correspond to the concentration or intensity of any single constituent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Axel |first1=Richard |year=1995 |title=The molecular logic of smell |journal=Scientific American |volume=273 |issue=4 |pages=154\u201359 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1095-154 |pmid=7481719 |bibcode=1995SciAm.273d.154A}}</ref><ref name=\"p.492\">[[#Spengler|Spengler]], p. 492</ref>\n\nMost odors consists of [[organic compound]]s, although some simple compounds not containing carbon, such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]], are also odorants. The perception of an odor effect is a two-step process. First, there is the physiological part. This is the detection of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] by receptors in the nose. The stimuli are recognized by the region of the human brain which handles olfaction. Because of this, an [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[analytical technique|analytical]] measure of odor is impossible.

The sense of smell can induce pleasure or subconsciously warn of danger, which may, for example, help to locate mates, find food, or detect predators. Humans have an unusually good sense of smell considering they have only 350 functional olfactory receptor genes compared to the 1,300 found in mice, for example.

The sensitivity and ability to discriminate odors diminishes with exposure, and the brain tends to ignore continuous stimulus and focus on differences and changes in a particular sensation. When odorants are mixed, a habitual odorant is blocked. This depends on the strength of the odorants in the mixture, which can change the perception and processing of an odor. This process helps classify similar odors as well as adjust sensitivity to differences in complex stimuli.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Devriese |first1=S |last2=Winters |first2=W |last3=Stegen |first3=K |last4=Diest |first4=I Van |last5=Veulemans |first5=H |last6=Nemery |first6=B |last7=Eelen |first7=P |date= 2000 |title=Generalization of acquired somatic symptoms in response to odors: a pavlovian perspective on multiple chemical sensitivity|pmid=11138993 |journal=Psychosom.

They are [[Heptad repeat|seven-helix-turn]] transmembrane proteins. But there are no known structures for any olfactory receptor. There is a conserved sequence in roughly three quarters of all ORs. This is a tripodal metal-ion binding site,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1= J. |last2=Luthey-Schulten |first2=Z. |last3=Suslick |first3=K.

In 1978, [[Robert H. Crabtree|Crabtree]] suggested that Cu(I) is \"the most likely candidate for a metallo-receptor site in olfaction\" of strong-smelling volatiles. These are also good metal-coordinating ligands, such as thiols.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crabtree |first1=R.H. |title=Copper(I) \u2013 Possible Olfactory Binding-Site |journal=J. Inorg. Nucl.

Shepherd|Gordon Shepherd]] proposed that the retro-nasal route of olfaction (odorants introduced to the olfactory mucosa through the oral cavity often as food) was partially responsible for the development of human olfactory acuity. He suggested the evolutionary pressure of diversification of food sources and increased complexity of food preparation presented humans with a broader range of odorants, ultimately leading to a \"richer repertoire of smells\". Animals such as dogs show a greater sensitivity to odors than humans, especially in studies using short-chain compounds. Higher cognitive brain mechanisms and more olfactory brain regions enable humans to discriminate odors better than other mammals despite fewer olfactory receptor genes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020146 |pmc=406401 |title=The Human Sense of Smell: Are We Better Than We Think? |year=2004 |last1=Shepherd |first1=Gordon M. |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e146 |pmid=15138509}}</ref>\n\n== Measuring techniques ==\n\n=== Olfaktometrie ===\nIn [[Germany]], the concentrations of odorants have since the 1870s been defined by ''[[Olfaktometrie]]'', which helps to analyze the [[human sense]] of smell according to [[odor substance concentration]], intensity of odor, odor quality, and [[hedonic assessment]].\n\nThe most accurate smell sensing is when a smell is first encountered, before habituation begins to change perception of odor.\n\n==== Concentration ====\nOdor concentration is an odor's pervasiveness. To measure odor sensation, an odor is diluted to a [[odor threshold|detection or recognition threshold]]. The detection threshold is the concentration of an odor in air when 50% of a population can distinguish between the odorous sample and an odor-free reference sample. The recognition odor threshold is usually a factor of 2 to 5 times higher than the detection threshold.<ref name=\"p.483\"/>\n\nThe measurement of odor concentration is the most widespread method to quantify odors. It is standardized in [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN EN]] 13725:2003.<ref>[http://www.sipe-rtd.info/directive/air-quality-determination-odour-concentration-dynamic-olfactometry CEN EN 13725:2003, Air quality \u2013 Determination of odour concentration by dynamic olfactometry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505060914/http://www.sipe-rtd.info/directive/air-quality-determination-odour-concentration-dynamic-olfactometry |date=2015-05-05 }}. sipe-rtd.info</ref> The method is based on dilution of an odor sample to the odor threshold. The numerical value of the odor concentration is equal to the dilution factor that is necessary to reach the odor threshold. Its unit is the ''European Odour Unit'', OU<sub>E</sub>. Therefore, the odor concentration at the odor threshold is 1 OU<sub>E</sub> by definition.\n\n==== Olfactometer ====\nTo establish the odor concentration, an olfactometer is used which employs a group of human panelists. A diluted odorous mixture and an odor-free gas\u2014[[n-Butanol]]\u2014as a reference are presented from sniffing ports to a group of panelists who are sensitive in their perception of odor. To collect an odor sample, the samples must be collected using specialized sample bags, which are made from an odor free material, e.g. [[Teflon]]. The most accepted technique for collecting odor samples is the lung technique, where the sample bag is placed in a sealed drum, where a vacuum is created outside the bag, which fills under expansion, and draws into itself the sample from the source. Critically, all components which touch the odor sample, must be odor free, which includes lines and fittings.\n\nIn comparing the odor emitted from each port, the panelists are asked to report if they can detect a difference between the ports. The gas-diluting ratio is then decreased by a factor of 1.4 or two (i.e., the concentration is increased accordingly). The panelists are asked to repeat the test. This continues until the panelists respond with certainty and correctly twice in a row. These responses are used to calculate the concentration of the odor in terms of European odor units (OU<sub>E</sub>/m<sup>3</sup>), where 1 OU<sub>E</sub>/m<sup>3</sup>\u226140 ppb/v n-butanol.<ref name = hierarchical>{{cite journal |author1= Van Harreveld, A.

Analytical monitoring of individual chemical compounds present in such an odor is usually not practical. As a result, odor sensory methods, instead of instrumental methods, are normally used to measure such odor. Odor sensory methods are available to monitor odor both from source emissions and in the ambient air. These two contexts require different approaches for measuring odor.

It is important to note that intensity and hedonic tone, whilst similar, refer to different things: that is, the strength of the odor (intensity) and the pleasantness of an odor (hedonic tone). Moreover, it is important to note that perception of an odor may change from pleasant to unpleasant with increasing concentration, intensity, time, frequency, and previous experience with a specific odor\u2014all factors in determining a response.<ref>[[#Spengler|Spengler]], p. 486</ref>\n\n=== FIDOL factors ===\nThe overall set of qualities are sometimes identified as the \"FIDOL factors\", (short for '''F'''requency, '''I'''ntensity, '''D'''uration, '''O'''ffensiveness and '''L'''ocation).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.odorimpact.com/en/fidol.shtml |title= F.i.d.o.l. |accessdate= 2011-11-30 }}</ref>\n\nThe character of an odor is a critical element in assessing an odor.

These are a function of modeled concentration, averaging time (over what time period the model steps are run over, typically hourly), and a percentile. Percentiles refer to a statistical representation of how many hours per year the concentration C may be exceeded based on the averaging period.\n\n=== Sampling from area sources ===\nThere are two main odor sampling techniques: direct and indirect odor sampling techniques.\n\n==== Direct sampling ====\nDirect refers to the placement of an enclosure on or over an emitting surface from which samples are collected, and an odor emission rate is determined.\n\nThe most commonly used direct methods include the flux chamber<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceschmidt.com/flux4hra.htm |title=Flux Chamber Measurements: Defensible Analytical Data for Evaluating Human Health Risk |publisher=Ceschmidt.com |accessdate=2012-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208030440/http://ceschmidt.com/flux4hra.htm |archive-date=2013-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[wind tunnel]]s which include the UNSW wind tunnel.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120320101812/http://www.odour.unsw.edu.au/wind-tunnel-design.html UNSW wind tunnel dimensions]. Odour.unsw.edu.au</ref> There are many other available techniques, and consideration should be given to a number of factors before selecting a suitable method.\n\nA source which has implications for this method are sources, such as bark bed [[biofilter]]s, that have a vertical velocity component. For such sources, consideration must be given as to the most appropriate method. A commonly used technique is to measure the odor concentration at the emitting surface, and combine this with the volumetric flow rate of air entering the biofilter to produce an emission rate.\n\n==== Indirect sampling ====\nIndirect sampling is often referred to as back calculation. It involves the use of a mathematical formula to predict an emission rate.\n\nMany methods are used, but all make use of the same inputs which include surface roughness, upwind and downwind concentrations, stability class (or other similar factor), wind speed, and wind direction.\n\n== Health risks ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=December 2019}}\nThe human sense of smell is a primary factor in the sensation of comfort. Olfaction as a sensory system brings awareness of the presence of airborne chemicals. Some inhaled chemicals are volatile compounds that act as a stimulus, triggering unwanted reactions such as nose, eye, and [[throat irritation]]. Perception of odor and of irritation is unique to each person, and varies because of physical conditions or memory of past exposures to similar chemicals. A person's specific threshold, before an odor becomes a nuisance, depends also on the frequency, concentration, and duration of an odor.\n\nThe perception of irritation from odor sensation is hard to investigate because exposure to a volatile chemical elicits a different response based on sensory and physiological signals, and interpretation of these signals is influenced by experience, expectations, personality, or situational factors. [[Volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) may have higher concentrations in confined indoor environments, due to restricted infiltration of fresh air, as compared to the outdoor environment, leading to greater potential for toxic health exposures from a variety of chemical compounds. Health effects of odor are traced to the sensation of an odor or the odorant itself. Health effects and symptoms vary\u2014including eye, nose, or throat irritation, cough, chest tightness, drowsiness, and mood change\u2014all of which decrease as an odor ceases. Odors may also trigger illnesses such as asthma, depression, stress-induced illness, or hypersensitivity. The ability to perform tasks may decrease, and other social/behavioral changes may occur.\n\nOccupants should expect remediation from disturbing and unexpected odors that disturb concentration, diminish productivity, evoke symptoms, and generally increase the dislike for a particular environment. It is important to set occupational exposure limits (OELs) to ensure the health and safety of workers, as well as comfort, because exposure to chemicals can elicit physiological and biochemical changes in the upper respiratory system. Standards are hard to set when exposures are not reported and can also be hard to measure. Workforce populations vary in terms of discomfort from odors because of exposure history or habituation, and they may not realize possible risks of exposure to chemicals that produce specific odors.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Young, Christopher A. |title=What Smells?|journal= Pollution Engineering|volume= 42|issue=5 |year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11981666|year=2002|last1=Dalton|first1=P|title=Odor, irritation and perception of health risk|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|volume=75|issue=5|pages=283\u201390|doi=10.1007/s00420-002-0312-x}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Types of odors}}Types==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Whole industries have developed around products to remove unpleasant odors (see [[deodorant]]).\n\nOdor molecules transmit messages to the [[limbic system]], the area of the brain that governs emotional responses. Some believe that these messages have the power to alter moods, evoke distant memories, raise their spirits, and boost self-confidence. This belief has led to the concept of \"[[aromatherapy]]\" wherein fragrances are claimed to cure a wide range of psychological and physical problems. Aromatherapy claims that fragrances can positively affect sleep, stress, alertness, social interaction, and general feelings of well-being. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of aromatherapy consists mostly of [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]] and lacks controlled [[science|scientific]] studies to back up its claims.\n\nWith some fragrances, such as those found in perfume, scented shampoo, scented deodorant, or similar products, people can be allergic to the ingredients. The reaction, as with other chemical allergies, can be anywhere from a slight headache to [[anaphylactic shock]], which can result in death.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nUnpleasant odors play various roles in nature, often to warn of danger, though this may not be known to the subject who smells it.<ref name=\"Trygg\"/> An odor that is viewed as unpleasant by some people or cultures can be viewed as attractive by others where it is more familiar or has a better reputation.<ref name=\"Trygg\"/>\n\nIt is commonly thought that those exuding an unpleasant [[body odor]] will be unattractive to others. But studies have shown that a person who is exposed to a particular unpleasant odor can be attracted to others who have been exposed to the same unpleasant odor.<ref name=\"Trygg\">{{Cite book |last1=Engen |first1=Trygg |title=Odor sensation and memory |year=1991 |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |isbn=978-0-275-94111-6 |pages=}}</ref> This includes smells associated with pollution.<ref name=\"Trygg\"/>\n\nWhat causes a substance to smell unpleasant may be different from what one perceives. For example, [[perspiration]] is often viewed as having an unpleasant odor, but it is odorless. It is the bacteria in the perspiration that cause the odor.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R0eixKqC0SgC&pg=PA104&dq=%22unpleasant+odor%22stink |title=What's Happening to My Body?

The most common sources of industrial odor arise from [[sewage treatment]] plants, [[Refining|refineries]], animal rendering factories, and industries processing chemicals (such as sulfur) which have odorous characteristics. Sometimes industrial odor sources are the subject of community controversy and scientific analysis.\n\n[[Body odor]] is present both in animals and humans and its intensity can be influenced by many factors (behavioral patterns, survival strategies). Body odor has a strong genetic basis both in animals and humans, but it can be also strongly influenced by various diseases and psychological conditions.\n\n===Study===\nThe study of odors is a growing field but is a complex and difficult one. The human [[olfactory system]] can detect many thousands of scents based on only minute airborne concentrations of a chemical. The sense of smell of many animals is even better. Some fragrant flowers give off ''[[Bee learning and communication|odor plumes]]'' that move downwind and are detectable by [[bee]]s more than a kilometer away.\n\nThe study of odors is complicated by the complex chemistry taking place at the moment of a smell sensation. For example, iron-containing metallic objects are perceived to have a distinctive odor when touched, although iron's [[vapor pressure]] is negligible. According to a 2006 study, this smell is the result of [[aldehyde]]s (for example, [[nonanal]]) and [[ketone]]s: [[1-Octen-3-one|1-octen-3-one]]) released from the human skin on contact with [[ferrous]] ions that are formed in the sweat-mediated corrosion of iron. The same chemicals are also associated with the smell of blood, as ferrous iron in blood on skin produces the same reaction.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Glindemann |first1=Dietmar |last2=Dietrich |first2=Andrea |last3=Staerk |first3=Hans-Joachim |last4=Kuschk |first4=Peter |year=2006 |title=Communication The Two Odors of Iron when Touched or Pickled: (Skin) Carbonyl Compounds and Organophosphines |url= |journal=[[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] |volume= 45 |issue=42 |pages= 7006\u201309 |doi=10.1002/anie.200602100 |pmid=17009284 }}</ref>\n\n===Pheromones===\n[[Pheromone]]s are odors that are used for communication, and are sometimes called \"airborne hormones\". A female [[moth]] may release a pheromone that can entice a male moth that is several kilometers downwind. [[Honeybee]] queens constantly release pheromones that regulate the activity of the [[Beehive|hive]]. Worker bees can release such smells to call other bees into an appropriate cavity when a swarm moves into new quarters, or to \"sound\" an alarm when the hive is threatened.\n\n===Advanced technology===\n\nMost artificial or [[electronic nose]] instruments work by combining output from an array of non-specific [[chemical sensors]] to produce a fingerprint of whatever volatile chemicals in the local environment.
