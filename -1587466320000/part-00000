Zadeh was enrolled in Alborz College, which was a [[Presbyterian]] [[missionary|missionary school]], where he was educated for the next eight years, and where he met his future wife, Fay.<ref name=FL18 /> Zadeh says that he was \"deeply influenced\" by the \"extremely decent, fine, honest and helpful\" missionaries from the United States who ran the college. \"To me they represented the best that you could find in the United States &ndash; people from the Midwest with strong roots. They were really 'Good Samaritans' &ndash; willing to give of themselves for the benefit of others. So this kind of attitude influenced me deeply. It also instilled in me a deep desire to live in the United States.\"<ref name=blair99 /> During this time, Zadeh was awarded several [[patents]].<ref name=FL18 />\n\nDespite being more fluent in Russian than in Persian, Zadeh sat for the national university exams and placed third in the entire country.<ref name=FL18 /> As a student, he ranked first in his class in his first two years. In 1942, he graduated from the [[University of Tehran]] with a degree in [[electrical engineering]], one of only three students in that field to graduate that year, due to the turmoil created by [[World War II]], when the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran, whose ruler, [[Reza Shah]], was pro-German. Over 30,000 American soldiers were based there, and Zadeh worked with his father, who did business with them as a contractor for hardware and building materials.<ref name=FL19>McNeil & Freiberger, p.19</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Zadeh decided to emigrate to the United States, and traveled to [[Philadelphia]] by way of [[Cairo]] after months of delay waiting for the proper papers or for the right ship to appear. He arrived in mid-1944, and entered the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) as a graduate student later that year.<ref name=FL19 /> While in the United States, he changed his name to Lotfi Asker Zadeh.<ref name=FL17 />\n\nHe received an [[Master of Science|MS degree]] in electrical engineering from MIT in 1946, and then applied to [[Columbia University]], as his parents had settled in [[New York City]].<ref name=FL19 /> Columbia admitted him as a doctoral student, and offered him an instructorship as well.<ref name=FL19 /> He received his [[Ph.D.]] in electrical engineering from Columbia in 1949, and became an assistant professor the next year.<ref name=bookrags/><ref name=FL19 />\n\nZadeh taught for ten years at Columbia, was promoted to [[Full Professor]] in 1957, and taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1959 on. He published his seminal work on [[fuzzy sets]] in 1965, in which he detailed the mathematics of fuzzy set theory. In 1973 he proposed his theory of [[fuzzy logic]].\n\n==Personal life and beliefs==\n{{anchor|Nationality}} Zadeh was called \"quick to shrug off nationalism, insisting there are much deeper issues in life\", and was quoted as saying in an interview: \"The question really isn't whether I'm American, Russian, Iranian, Azerbaijani, or anything else. I've been shaped by all these people and cultures and I feel quite comfortable among all of them.\"<ref>Blair, Betty.

Zadeh] profile page on [[Google Scholar]] (accessed October 19, 2019).</ref>\n\n=== Fuzzy sets and systems ===\nZadeh, in his theory of [[fuzzy set]]s, proposed using a [[membership function]] (with a [[Interval (mathematics)|range]] covering the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,1]) operating on the [[Domain of a function|domain]] of all possible values.  He proposed new operations for the calculus of logic and showed that [[fuzzy logic]] was a generalisation of classical and Boolean [[logic]]. He also proposed [[fuzzy number]]s as a special case of fuzzy sets, as well as the corresponding rules for consistent mathematical operations (fuzzy arithmetic).<ref>McNeil & Freiberger, ''passim''</ref>\n\n=== Other contributions ===\nZadeh is also credited, along with [[John R. Ragazzini]], in 1952, with having pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in discrete time signal processing and analysis. These methods are now standard in [[digital signal processing]], [[digital control]], and other discrete-time systems used in industry and research. He was an editor of the ''International Journal of Computational Cognition''.\n\nZadeh's most recent work included [[computing with words and perceptions]].

Zadeh was enrolled in Alborz College, which was a [[Presbyterian]] [[missionary|missionary school]], where he was educated for the next eight years, and where he met his future wife, Fay.<ref name=FL18 /> Zadeh says that he was \"deeply influenced\" by the \"extremely decent, fine, honest and helpful\" missionaries from the United States who ran the college. \"To me they represented the best that you could find in the United States &ndash; people from the Midwest with strong roots. They were really 'Good Samaritans' &ndash; willing to give of themselves for the benefit of others. So this kind of attitude influenced me deeply. It also instilled in me a deep desire to live in the United States.\"<ref name=blair99 /> During this time, Zadeh was awarded several [[patents]].<ref name=FL18 />\n\nDespite being more fluent in Russian than in Persian, Zadeh sat for the national university exams and placed third in the entire country.<ref name=FL18 /> As a student, he ranked first in his class in his first two years. In 1942, he graduated from the [[University of Tehran]] with a degree in [[electrical engineering]], one of only three students in that field to graduate that year, due to the turmoil created by [[World War II]], when the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran, whose ruler, [[Reza Shah]], was pro-German. Over 30,000 American soldiers were based there, and Zadeh worked with his father, who did business with them as a contractor for hardware and building materials.<ref name=FL19>McNeil & Freiberger, p.19</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Zadeh decided to emigrate to the United States, and traveled to [[Philadelphia]] by way of [[Cairo]] after months of delay waiting for the proper papers or for the right ship to appear. He arrived in mid-1944, and entered the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) as a graduate student later that year.<ref name=FL19 /> While in the United States, he changed his name to Lotfi Asker Zadeh.<ref name=FL17 />\n\nHe received an [[Master of Science|MS degree]] in electrical engineering from MIT in 1946, and then applied to [[Columbia University]], as his parents had settled in [[New York City]].<ref name=FL19 /> Columbia admitted him as a doctoral student, and offered him an instructorship as well.<ref name=FL19 /> He received his [[Ph.D.]] in electrical engineering from Columbia in 1949, and became an assistant professor the next year.<ref name=bookrags/><ref name=FL19 />\n\nZadeh taught for ten years at Columbia, was promoted to [[Full Professor]] in 1957, and taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1959 on. He published his seminal work on [[fuzzy sets]] in 1965, in which he detailed the mathematics of fuzzy set theory. In 1973 he proposed his theory of [[fuzzy logic]].\n\n==Personal life and beliefs==\n{{anchor|Nationality}} Zadeh was called \"quick to shrug off nationalism, insisting there are much deeper issues in life\", and was quoted as saying in an interview: \"The question really isn't whether I'm American, Russian, Iranian, Azerbaijani, or anything else.

He proposed new operations for the calculus of logic and showed that [[fuzzy logic]] was a generalisation of classical and Boolean [[logic]]. He also proposed [[fuzzy number]]s as a special case of fuzzy sets, as well as the corresponding rules for consistent mathematical operations (fuzzy arithmetic).<ref>McNeil & Freiberger, ''passim''</ref>\n\n=== Other contributions ===\nZadeh is also credited, along with [[John R. Ragazzini]], in 1952, with having pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in discrete time signal processing and analysis. These methods are now standard in [[digital signal processing]], [[digital control]], and other discrete-time systems used in industry and research.

He was born in [[Davenport, Iowa]] and attended the [[University of Iowa]], as part of the Air Force [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] program. On June 13, 1958, Horner was commissioned into the [[Air Force Reserve]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], he flew in combat as a [[Wild Weasel]] pilot and received the [[Silver Star]]. During [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]] and [[Operation Desert Storm]], he commanded the American aerial forces, as well as those of the American allies. During the Desert Shield phase of the conflict, Horner briefly served as Commander-in-Chief&nbsp;\u2014 Forward of [[United States Central Command]]; while General [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.]] was still in the United States. He currently serves on the board of directors for the [[United States Institute of Peace]].\n\n==Military career==\nHorner, an Iowa native, entered the [[United States Air Force]] through the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] program. He was commissioned in the [[Air Force Reserve]] on June 13, 1958, just before his graduation from the [[University of Iowa]] and was awarded pilot wings in November 1959 and was resworn with a regular Air Force commission in 1962.<ref>{{Harvnb|Clancy|Horner|1999|p=38}}</ref> He has commanded a tactical training wing, a fighter wing, two air divisions and a numbered Air Force. While Commander of [[9th Air Force]], he also commanded [[United States Central Command Air Forces]], in command of all United States and allied air assets during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.<ref name=USAFbio/>\n\nHorner is a command pilot with more than 5,300 flying hours in a variety of fighter aircraft. During the Vietnam War he flew 41 combat missions over [[North Vietnam]] in the [[F-105]] during a tour. He later flew more than 70 combat missions as an [[F-105]] [[Wild Weasel]] pilot, deliberately drawing anti-aircraft fire to identify and destroy North Vietnamese defenses.<ref name=USAFbio/>\n\nAfter primary flight training at [[Lackland AFB]], jet training at [[Laredo AFB]], gunnery training at [[Williams AFB]], top-off training and [[F-100D]] transition training at [[Nellis AFB]], Horner's first operational assignment was in October 1960 with the [[48th Fighter Wing]] at [[RAF Lakenheath]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Clancy|Horner|1999|pp=42\u201354}}</ref> In 1963, Horner was reassigned to the [[4th Tactical Fighter Wing]] and [[Seymor Johnson AFB]], where he flew the [[F-105]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Clancy|Horner|1999|p=67}}</ref> From April through August 1965, Horner was assigned as an F-105 pilot at [[Korat BA]] in Thailand, flying missions over [[North Vietnam]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Clancy|Horner|1999|pp=75\u201399}}</ref> From August 1965 to 1967, Horner returned to [[Nellis AFB]] as an F-105 instructor, becoming involved in a number of projects involving other aircraft and undergoing F-105 [[Wild Weasel]] training. In 1967, he returned to Korat AB, flying both Wild Weasel and night radar bombing missions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Clancy|Horner|1999|pp=108\u2013111}}</ref>\n\nHorner returned to Nellis AFB in August 1967 where, after initial assignment to the Combat Crew Training Wing, he ended up flying as an instructor at the Fighter Weapons School. In March 1968, he joined the new Fighter Weapons Center at Nellis. From 1970 to 1972 he was assigned as a staff officer to Tactical Air Command (TAC) headquarters at Langley AFB, followed by four months of post-graduate work at the [[College of William and Mary]], where he earned his [[Master of Business Administration]]. This was followed by a three-year assignment at [[The Pentagon]] and subsequent assignment to the National war College at [[Seymore Johnson AFB]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Clancy|Horner|1999|pp=118\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1977, Horner participated in his first [[Exercise Red Flag|Red Flag]] exercise.<ref>{{Harvnb|Clancy|Horner|1999|pp=152-}}</ref> His next assignment was to [[Luke AFB]], as deputy commander of the [[58th fighter Wing]]. In 1980, he was reassigned to Nellis as Wing Commander of the [[474th Tactical fighter Wing]], which was equipped with [[F-4]]Ds but scheduled to transition to [[F-16]]As. TAC Commander General [[Wilbur L. Creech]] kept moving Horner; who commanded at four different bases, two air divisions, the [[Air Defense Weapons Center]], and finally [[Ninth Air Force]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Clancy|Horner|1999|pp=132\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nHorner was Commander in Chief of [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] and the [[United States Space Command]]; and Commander of [[Air Force Space Command]], [[Peterson Air Force Base]], Colorado from 1992 to 1994.

In the 1940s, JSP was shortly in power from 1947 to 1948. From 1951 to 1955, the JSP was once divided into the \"[[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan|Leftist Socialist Party]]\" (\u5de6\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a) and the \"[[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan|Rightist Socialist Party]]\" (\u53f3\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a). In the same year, the two major [[conservative]] parties in Japan merged into the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP), a system called \"[[1955 System]]\" (55\u5e74\u4f53\u5236) was established in Japan. Under the 1955 System, the LDP was continuously in power and the JSP, as the largest opposition party, was incapable of forming an alternative. On the other hand, during this period, JSP could hold around 1/3 seats in the [[National Diet]] to prevent LDP amending the [[Constitution of Japan]].<ref name=Shakaito-Ktbk/><ref name=\"Saito2019\">{{cite book|author=Ken Saito|title=\u5716\u8aaa\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u4e8b\u8a18\uff1a1945-2017\uff0c\u6539\u8b8a\u8207\u5f62\u5851\u73fe\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u7684\u767e\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02HLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50|year=2019|publisher=\u9ea5\u6d69\u65af|isbn=978-986-408-463-0|page=50}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, under the leadership of [[Takako Doi]], JSP earned a record-high number of seats. However, from the middle 1990s, shocked by the establishments of new conservative parties, the seats of JSP in the National Diet decreased significantly. Finally, JSP dissolved on January 19, 1996. The successor of JSP is the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]], which is a [[minor party]] only holding four representatives in the National Diet in 2020.\n\nTwo [[Prime Minister of Japan]] were from JSP: [[Tetsu Katayama]] and [[Tomiichi Murayama]].\n\n==History==\n=== 1940s\u20131970s ===\n[[File:Headquarters of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (2009.09 3).jpg|thumb|250px|Former JSP Head Office in [[Nagatacho]], the Social & Cultural Center (\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u4f1a\u9928)]]\n[[Socialist]] and [[social-democratic]] parties have been active in Japan under various names since the early 20th century, often suffering harsh government repression as well as ideological dissensions and splits.\n\nThe party was originally known as the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) in English and was formed in 1945 following the fall of the [[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|militarist regime]] that had led Japan into World War II. At the time, there was serious conflict inside the party between factions of the right and the left and the party's official name in English became the Japanese Socialist Party (JSP) as the left-wing had advocated. The right had wanted to use the older SDPJ.\n\nThe party became the largest political party in the first general election under the [[Constitution of Japan]] in 1947 (143 of 466 seats) and a government was formed by [[Tetsu Katayama]], forming a coalition with the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1947)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Citizens' Cooperation Party]]. However, the Katayama government collapsed due to the rebellion of [[communists]] in the party. The party continued the coalition with the Democrats under Prime Minister [[Hitoshi Ashida]]; but the cabinet was engulfed by the Sh\u014dwa Denk\u014d scandal, the largest corruption scandal during the occupation, allowing Shigeru Yoshida and the [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]] to return to government. In the period following the end of World War II, the Socialists played a key role in the drafting of the new Japanese constitution, adding progressive articles related to issues such as health, welfare and working conditions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ba5hXsfeyhMC&pg=PA289&dq=Japan+Civil+Code+july+1947+equal+rights#v=onepage&q=Japan%20Civil%20Code%20july%201947%20equal%20rights&f=false|title=Allied Occupation of Japan|accessdate=12 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503141629/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ba5hXsfeyhMC&pg=PA289&dq=Japan+Civil+Code+july+1947+equal+rights&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vJgXUZrZBuWa0QWfkYDQDw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Japan%20Civil%20Code%20july%201947%20equal%20rights&f=false|archivedate=3 May 2018|isbn=9780826415219|last1=Takemae|first1=Eiji|date=January 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe party was split in 1950\u20131951 into the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan|Rightist Socialist Party]], consisting of socialists who leaned more to the [[centrism|political centre]]; and the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan|Leftist Socialist Party]], formed by hardline left-wingers and socialists.<ref>Socialist parties in postwar Japan, by Allan B.

This was enough result to block the attempt of constitutional amendment by the [[Kishi Nobusuke]]-led government.\n\nHowever, the party was again split in 1960 because of internal conflicts and the assassination of [[Inejiro Asanuma]] and the breakaway group (a part of the old Right Socialist Party of Japan, their most moderate faction) created the [[Democratic Socialist Party (Japan)|Democratic Socialist Party]], although the party was preserved. After that, the party's percentage of the popular vote and number of seats gradually declined. However, the party performed well on a local level and by the 1970s many areas were run by SDPJ mayors and governors (including those who were endorsed by the SDPJ), who introduced new social programmes.<ref>Contemporary Japan by Duncan McCargo</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/WBI/Resources/wbi37169.pdf |title=Towards Political Inclusiveness: The Changing Role of Local Government in Japan  |accessdate=2012-04-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202102136/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/WBI/Resources/wbi37169.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g7DdQriL824C&pg=PA131&dq=Ryokichi+Minobe+public+housing#v=onepage&q=Ryokichi%20Minobe%20public%20housing&f=false|title=Cities, Autonomy, and Decentralization in Japan|accessdate=12 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127024014/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g7DdQriL824C&pg=PA131&dq=Ryokichi+Minobe+public+housing&hl=en&sa=X&ei=i2eQT7yzLOnG0QXYyKTlAQ&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Ryokichi%20Minobe%20public%20housing&f=false|archivedate=27 November 2016|isbn=9781134341504|last1=Hein|first1=Carola|last2=Pelletier|first2=Philippe|date=2006-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmode0000stoc|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmode0000stoc/page/239 239]|quote=Japan Tokyo governor minobe free health care.|title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of Japan|publisher=Taylor & Francis|accessdate=12 July 2015|isbn=9780203402177|last=Stockwin|first=J.

Nonetheless, its popular chairwoman [[Takako Doi]] led it to an impressive showing in the [[1990 Japanese general election|1990 general election]], with 136 seats and 24.4 percent of the vote. Some electoral districts had more than one successful socialist candidate. Doi's decision to put up more than one candidate for each of the 130 districts represented a controversial break with the past because unlike their LDP counterparts many party candidates did not want to run against each other. However, the great majority of the 149 socialist candidates who ran were successful, including seven of eight women.\n\nDoi, a university professor of constitutional law before entering politics, had a tough, straight-talking manner that appealed to voters tired of the evasiveness of other politicians. Many women found her a refreshing alternative to submissive female stereotypes and in the late 1980s the public at large in opinion polls voted her their favorite politician (the runner-up in these surveys was equally tough-talking conservative LDP member [[Shintar\u014d Ishihara]]). However, Doi's popularity was of limited aid to the party. The powerful Shakaishugi Kyokai (Japan Socialist Association) which was supported by a hardcore contingent of the party's 76,000-strong membership remained committed to doctrinaire Marxism, impeding Doi's efforts to promote what she called [[perestroika]] and a more moderate program with greater voter appeal.\n\nIn 1983, Doi's predecessor as chairman [[Masashi Ishibashi]] began the delicate process of moving the party away from its strong opposition to the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]]. While maintaining that these forces were unconstitutional in light of [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan|Article 9]], he claimed that because they had been established through legal procedures, they had a legitimate status (this phrasing was changed a year later to say that the Self-Defense Forces exist legally). Ishibashi also broke past precedent by visiting Washington to talk with [[United States]] political leaders.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the party had accepted the Self-Defense Forces and the 1960 [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan|Japan\u2013United States Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security]]. It advocated strict limitations on military spending (no more than 1 percent of GNP annually), a suspension of joint military exercises with United States forces and a reaffirmation of the three non-nuclear principles (no production, possession, or introduction of nuclear weapons into Japanese territory). Doi expressed support for balanced ties with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ([[North Korea]]) and the Republic of Korea ([[South Korea]]). In the past, the party had favored the [[Kim Il-sung]] regime in [[Pyongyang]] and in the early 1990s it still refused to recognize the [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea|1965 normalization of relations between Tokyo and Seoul]]. In domestic policy, the party demanded the continued protection of agriculture and small business in the face of foreign pressure, abolition of the [[consumption tax]] and an end to the construction and use of nuclear power reactors. As a symbolic gesture to reflect its new moderation, the party dropped its commitment to [[revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] at its April 1990 convention and described its goal as social democracy,<ref name=\"Neary2012\">{{cite book|author=Ian Neary|title=War, Revolution and Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yfn7quu5sc0C&pg=PA141|accessdate=29 January 2013|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-873410-08-0|pages=141\u2013}}</ref> the creation of a society in which \"all people fairly enjoy the fruits of technological advancement and modern civilization and receive the benefits of [[social welfare]]\". Delegates also elected Doi to a third term as party chairwoman.\n\nBecause of the party's self-definition as a class-based party and its symbiotic relationship with the [[S\u014dhy\u014d|General Council of Trade Unions of Japan]] (S\u014dhy\u014d), the public-sector workers' confederation, few efforts were made to attract non-union constituencies. Although some S\u014dhy\u014d unions supported the [[Japanese Communist Party]], the party remained the representative of Sohyo's political interests until the merger with private-sector unions and the [[RENGO|Japanese Trade Union Confederation]] (Reng\u014d) in 1989. Because of declining union financial support during the 1980s, some party Diet members turned to dubious fund-raising methods. One was involved in the [[Recruit scandal|Recruit affair]]. Like other parties, it sold large blocks of fund-raising party tickets and the LDP even gave individual party Diet members funds from time to time to persuade them to cooperate in passing difficult legislation.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n{{See also|Social Democratic Party (Japan)}}\nThe party acquired seventy seats (down from 137) in the [[1993 Japanese general election|1993 general election]] while the LDP lost its majority in the lower house for the first time since the [[1983 Japanese general election|1983 general election]] and was out of government for the first time in 38 years. The anti-LDP [[coalition government]] of [[Morihiro Hosokawa]] was formed by reformists who had triggered the 1993 election by leaving the LDP ([[Japan Renewal Party]] and [[New Party Sakigake]]), a liberal party formed only a year before ([[Japan New Party]]), the traditional centre-left opposition ([[K\u014dmeit\u014d (1962\u201398)|K\u014dmeit\u014d]], [[Democratic Socialist Party (Japan)|Democratic Socialist Party]] and [[Socialist Democratic Federation (Japan)|Socialist Democratic Federation]]) and the Democratic Reform Party, the political arm of the Reng\u014d trade union federation, together with the JSP. In 1994, the JSP and the New Sakigake Party decided to leave the non-LDP coalition. The minority Hata cabinet lasted only a few weeks. The JSP then formed a [[grand coalition]] (''dai-renritsu'') government with the LDP and the New Party Sakigake under Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], leader of the party from 1993 to 1996. Most of the other parties from the anti-LDP coalition forced back into opposition, united to form the [[New Frontier Party (Japan)|New Frontier Party]] (NFP) and overtaking the JSP as second largest political party in Japan. The JSP lost in the [[1995 Japanese House of Councillors election|1995 House of Councillors election]].\n\nIn January 1996, the [[New Socialist Party of Japan]] split off, Murayama resigned as Prime Minister and the JSP changed its name from the JSP to the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) as an interim party for forming a new party.\n\n[[File:The History of Japan Socialist Party - en.png|thumb|700px|center|An illustration of the history of JSP]]\n\n==Policies==\nthe JSP supported a neutralist [[foreign policy]].

parties that existed before [[WWII]] including the [[Shakai Taish\u016bt\u014d|Social Mass Party]], the [[Labour-Farmer Party]] and [[Japan Labour-Farmer Party]] by 1945. In the 1940s, JSP was shortly in power from 1947 to 1948. From 1951 to 1955, the JSP was once divided into the \"[[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan|Leftist Socialist Party]]\" (\u5de6\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a) and the \"[[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan|Rightist Socialist Party]]\" (\u53f3\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a). In the same year, the two major [[conservative]] parties in Japan merged into the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP), a system called \"[[1955 System]]\" (55\u5e74\u4f53\u5236) was established in Japan. Under the 1955 System, the LDP was continuously in power and the JSP, as the largest opposition party, was incapable of forming an alternative. On the other hand, during this period, JSP could hold around 1/3 seats in the [[National Diet]] to prevent LDP amending the [[Constitution of Japan]].<ref name=Shakaito-Ktbk/><ref name=\"Saito2019\">{{cite book|author=Ken Saito|title=\u5716\u8aaa\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u4e8b\u8a18\uff1a1945-2017\uff0c\u6539\u8b8a\u8207\u5f62\u5851\u73fe\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u7684\u767e\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02HLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50|year=2019|publisher=\u9ea5\u6d69\u65af|isbn=978-986-408-463-0|page=50}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, under the leadership of [[Takako Doi]], JSP earned a record-high number of seats. However, from the middle 1990s, shocked by the establishments of new conservative parties, the seats of JSP in the National Diet decreased significantly. Finally, JSP dissolved on January 19, 1996. The successor of JSP is the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]], which is a [[minor party]] only holding four representatives in the National Diet in 2020.\n\nTwo Primier Minister of Japan were from JSP: [[Tetsu Katayama]] and [[Tomiichi Murayama]].\n\n==History==\n=== 1940s\u20131970s ===\n[[File:Headquarters of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (2009.09 3).jpg|thumb|250px|Former JSP Head Office in [[Nagatacho]], the Social & Cultural Center (\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u4f1a\u9928)]]\n[[Socialist]] and [[social-democratic]] parties have been active in Japan under various names since the early 20th century, often suffering harsh government repression as well as ideological dissensions and splits.\n\nThe party was originally known as the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) in English and was formed in 1945 following the fall of the [[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|militarist regime]] that had led Japan into World War II. At the time, there was serious conflict inside the party between factions of the right and the left and the party's official name in English became the Japanese Socialist Party (JSP) as the left-wing had advocated. The right had wanted to use the older SDPJ.\n\nThe party became the largest political party in the first general election under the [[Constitution of Japan]] in 1947 (143 of 466 seats) and a government was formed by [[Tetsu Katayama]], forming a coalition with the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1947)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Citizens' Cooperation Party]]. However, the Katayama government collapsed due to the rebellion of [[communists]] in the party. The party continued the coalition with the Democrats under Prime Minister [[Hitoshi Ashida]]; but the cabinet was engulfed by the Sh\u014dwa Denk\u014d scandal, the largest corruption scandal during the occupation, allowing Shigeru Yoshida and the [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]] to return to government. In the period following the end of World War II, the Socialists played a key role in the drafting of the new Japanese constitution, adding progressive articles related to issues such as health, welfare and working conditions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ba5hXsfeyhMC&pg=PA289&dq=Japan+Civil+Code+july+1947+equal+rights#v=onepage&q=Japan%20Civil%20Code%20july%201947%20equal%20rights&f=false|title=Allied Occupation of Japan|accessdate=12 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503141629/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ba5hXsfeyhMC&pg=PA289&dq=Japan+Civil+Code+july+1947+equal+rights&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vJgXUZrZBuWa0QWfkYDQDw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Japan%20Civil%20Code%20july%201947%20equal%20rights&f=false|archivedate=3 May 2018|isbn=9780826415219|last1=Takemae|first1=Eiji|date=January 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe party was split in 1950\u20131951 into the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan|Rightist Socialist Party]], consisting of socialists who leaned more to the [[centrism|political centre]]; and the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan|Leftist Socialist Party]], formed by hardline left-wingers and socialists.<ref>Socialist parties in postwar Japan, by Allan B.

In the [[1958 Japanese general election|1958 general election]], the party gained 32.9 percent of the popular vote and 166 out of 467 seats. This was enough result to block the attempt of constitutional amendment by the [[Kishi Nobusuke]]-led government.\n\nHowever, the party was again split in 1960 because of internal conflicts and the assassination of [[Inejiro Asanuma]] and the breakaway group (a part of the old Right Socialist Party of Japan, their most moderate faction) created the [[Democratic Socialist Party (Japan)|Democratic Socialist Party]], although the party was preserved. After that, the party's percentage of the popular vote and number of seats gradually declined.

Nonetheless, its popular chairwoman [[Takako Doi]] led it to an impressive showing in the [[1990 Japanese general election|1990 general election]], with 136 seats and 24.4 percent of the vote. Some electoral districts had more than one successful socialist candidate. Doi's decision to put up more than one candidate for each of the 130 districts represented a controversial break with the past because unlike their LDP counterparts many party candidates did not want to run against each other. However, the great majority of the 149 socialist candidates who ran were successful, including seven of eight women.\n\nDoi, a university professor of constitutional law before entering politics, had a tough, straight-talking manner that appealed to voters tired of the evasiveness of other politicians. Many women found her a refreshing alternative to submissive female stereotypes and in the late 1980s the public at large in opinion polls voted her their favorite politician (the runner-up in these surveys was equally tough-talking conservative LDP member [[Shintar\u014d Ishihara]]). However, Doi's popularity was of limited aid to the party. The powerful Shakaishugi Kyokai (Japan Socialist Association) which was supported by a hardcore contingent of the party's 76,000-strong membership remained committed to doctrinaire Marxism, impeding Doi's efforts to promote what she called [[perestroika]] and a more moderate program with greater voter appeal.\n\nIn 1983, Doi's predecessor as chairman [[Masashi Ishibashi]] began the delicate process of moving the party away from its strong opposition to the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]]. While maintaining that these forces were unconstitutional in light of [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan|Article 9]], he claimed that because they had been established through legal procedures, they had a legitimate status (this phrasing was changed a year later to say that the Self-Defense Forces exist legally). Ishibashi also broke past precedent by visiting Washington to talk with [[United States]] political leaders.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the party had accepted the Self-Defense Forces and the 1960 [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan|Japan\u2013United States Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security]]. It advocated strict limitations on military spending (no more than 1 percent of GNP annually), a suspension of joint military exercises with United States forces and a reaffirmation of the three non-nuclear principles (no production, possession, or introduction of nuclear weapons into Japanese territory). Doi expressed support for balanced ties with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ([[North Korea]]) and the Republic of Korea ([[South Korea]]). In the past, the party had favored the [[Kim Il-sung]] regime in [[Pyongyang]] and in the early 1990s it still refused to recognize the [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea|1965 normalization of relations between Tokyo and Seoul]]. In domestic policy, the party demanded the continued protection of agriculture and small business in the face of foreign pressure, abolition of the [[consumption tax]] and an end to the construction and use of nuclear power reactors. As a symbolic gesture to reflect its new moderation, the party dropped its commitment to [[revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] at its April 1990 convention and described its goal as social democracy,<ref name=\"Neary2012\">{{cite book|author=Ian Neary|title=War, Revolution and Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yfn7quu5sc0C&pg=PA141|accessdate=29 January 2013|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-873410-08-0|pages=141\u2013}}</ref> the creation of a society in which \"all people fairly enjoy the fruits of technological advancement and modern civilization and receive the benefits of [[social welfare]]\". Delegates also elected Doi to a third term as party chairwoman.\n\nBecause of the party's self-definition as a class-based party and its symbiotic relationship with the [[S\u014dhy\u014d|General Council of Trade Unions of Japan]] (S\u014dhy\u014d), the public-sector workers' confederation, few efforts were made to attract non-union constituencies. Although some S\u014dhy\u014d unions supported the [[Japanese Communist Party]], the party remained the representative of Sohyo's political interests until the merger with private-sector unions and the [[RENGO|Japanese Trade Union Confederation]] (Reng\u014d) in 1989. Because of declining union financial support during the 1980s, some party Diet members turned to dubious fund-raising methods. One was involved in the [[Recruit scandal|Recruit affair]]. Like other parties, it sold large blocks of fund-raising party tickets and the LDP even gave individual party Diet members funds from time to time to persuade them to cooperate in passing difficult legislation.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n{{See also|Social Democratic Party (Japan)}}\nThe party acquired seventy seats (down from 137) in the [[1993 Japanese general election|1993 general election]] while the LDP lost its majority in the lower house for the first time since the [[1983 Japanese general election|1983 general election]] and was out of government for the first time in 38 years. The anti-LDP [[coalition government]] of [[Morihiro Hosokawa]] was formed by reformists who had triggered the 1993 election by leaving the LDP ([[Japan Renewal Party]] and [[New Party Sakigake]]), a liberal party formed only a year before ([[Japan New Party]]), the traditional centre-left opposition ([[K\u014dmeit\u014d (1962\u201398)|K\u014dmeit\u014d]], [[Democratic Socialist Party (Japan)|Democratic Socialist Party]] and [[Socialist Democratic Federation (Japan)|Socialist Democratic Federation]]) and the Democratic Reform Party, the political arm of the Reng\u014d trade union federation, together with the JSP. In 1994, the JSP and the New Sakigake Party decided to leave the non-LDP coalition. The minority Hata cabinet lasted only a few weeks. The JSP then formed a [[grand coalition]] (''dai-renritsu'') government with the LDP and the New Party Sakigake under Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], leader of the party from 1993 to 1996. Most of the other parties from the anti-LDP coalition forced back into opposition, united to form the [[New Frontier Party (Japan)|New Frontier Party]] (NFP) and overtaking the JSP as second largest political party in Japan. The JSP lost in the [[1995 Japanese House of Councillors election|1995 House of Councillors election]].\n\nIn January 1996, the [[New Socialist Party of Japan]] split off, Murayama resigned as Prime Minister and the JSP changed its name from the JSP to the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) as an interim party for forming a new party.\n\n[[File:The History of Japan Socialist Party - en.png|thumb|700px|center|An illustration of the history of JSP]]\n\n==Policies==\nthe JSP supported a neutralist [[foreign policy]]. It opposed amending the [[Constitution of Japan]], especially the [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan]].<ref name=Shakaito-Ktbk/>\n\nThe so-called \"lefists\" in the JSP were Marxists, who are in favour of [[scientific socialism]]. By contrast, the so-called \"rightists\" were in favour of the Social Democracy and they aimed at establishing a [[welfare state]].<ref name=\"\u9ad8\u5c71\u76f4\u4eba2019\">{{cite

It is located on the banks of the [[Noyyal River]] and surrounded by the [[Western Ghats]]. Coimbatore is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu after [[Chennai]] and the 16th largest [[List of million-plus urban agglomerations in India|urban agglomeration in India]]. It is administered by the [[Coimbatore Municipal Corporation]] and is the administrative capital of [[Coimbatore district]]. Tiruppur is the nearest district of Coimbatore and it is well-bounded with the economy of Coimbatore.\n\nThe city is one of the largest exporters of jewellery, [[wet grinder]]s, poultry and [[Automobile|auto components]]; the \"[[Coimbatore Wet Grinder]]\" and the \"[[Kovai Cora Cotton]]\" are recognised as [[Geographical Indications in India|Geographical Indications]] by the [[Government of India]].\n\nCoimbatore was part of [[Kongu Nadu]] during the [[Sangam period]] between c. 1st and the 4th centuries CE and was ruled by the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]] as it served as the eastern entrance to the [[Palakkad Gap]], the principal trade route between the west coast (Kerala) and Tamil Nadu). Coimbatore was located along the ancient trade route that extended from [[Muziris]] to [[Arikamedu]] in South India. The [[medieval Cholas]] conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century followed by the [[Madurai Nayaks|Nayaks]] who introduced the [[Polygar|Palayakkarar system]] under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 ''Palayams''. In the later part of the 18th century, the Coimbatore region came under the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and following the [[Siege of Coimbatore|defeat]] of [[Tipu Sultan]] in the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]], the [[British East India Company]] annexed Coimbatore to the [[Madras Presidency]] in 1799. The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second [[Poligar War]] (1801) when it was the area of operations of [[Dheeran Chinnamalai]].\n\nIn 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866 it was accorded [[municipality]] status with [[Robert Stanes]] as its chairman. 24 November used to be Coimbatore Day, say those familiar with the history of Coimbatore.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-day-celebrated/article20851618.ece|title=Coimbatore Day celebrated|date=25 November 2017|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-12-14|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303163259/http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-day-celebrated/article20851618.ece|archivedate=3 March 2018}}</ref> The city experienced a textile boom in the early 19th century due to the decline of the cotton industry in [[Mumbai]]. Post independence, Coimbatore has seen rapid growth due to industrialisation. Coimbatore was ranked the best emerging city in India by [[India Today]] in the 2014 annual Indian city survey. The city was ranked fourth among Indian cities in investment climate by [[Confederation of Indian Industry]] and 17th among the top global outsourcing cities by Tholons. Coimbatore has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a [[smart city]] under [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi|Narendra Modi's]] flagship [[Smart Cities Mission]].

Coimbatore is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu after [[Chennai]] and the 16th largest [[List of million-plus urban agglomerations in India|urban agglomeration in India]].

Coimbatore was located along the ancient trade route that extended from [[Muziris]] to [[Arikamedu]] in South India. The [[medieval Cholas]] conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century CE.

The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second [[Poligar War]] (1801) when it was the area of operations of [[Dheeran Chinnamalai]].\n\nIn 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866 it was accorded [[municipality]] status with [[Robert Stanes]] as its chairman. 24 November used to be Coimbatore Day, say those familiar with the history of Coimbatore.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-day-celebrated/article20851618.ece|title=Coimbatore Day celebrated|date=25 November 2017|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-12-14|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303163259/http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-day-celebrated/article20851618.ece|archivedate=3 March 2018}}</ref> The city experienced a textile boom in the early 19th century due to the decline of the cotton industry in [[Mumbai]].

The city was ranked fourth among Indian cities in investment climate by [[Confederation of Indian Industry]] and 17th among the top global outsourcing cities by Tholons.

Spotnitz is also the Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Big Light Productions, a London- and Paris-based production company, which specialises in international television series, including drama, comedy and documentaries. Spotnitz\u2019s 25+ career includes creating, writing and producing series with networks, cable, streaming and other broadcast platforms around the world.\n\nUnder the Big Light banner, Spotnitz has produced: Amazon\u2019s Emmy-winning ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]''; ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: Masters of Florence'' and two seasons of ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: The Magnificent'' (RAI, Netflix, SFR Play); ''[[The Indian Detective]]'' (Netflix, CTV); ''[[Ransom (TV series)|Ransom]]'' (CBS, Global, TF1, RTL); ''[[Crossing Lines]]'' season three with Tandem/StudioCanal; and ''[[Transporter: The Series|Transporter: The Serie]]''<span lang=\"EN-GB\">Frank Charles Spotnitz\u00a0</span>''[[Transporter: The Series|s]]'' season two (TNT, M6, HBO Canada). Most recently, Spotnitz co-created and executive produced ''Leonardo'', which is currently in production in Italy. \n==Early life and education==\nBorn in Camp Zama, Japan, in 1960, Spotnitz\u2019s father was a doctor in the US Army. Much of his childhood was peripatetic before the family settled in Phoenix, Arizona. \u00a0As a child, Spotnitz consumed television shows and films as much as he could, sometimes watching the same film two or three times in a row. \n\nSpotnitz\u2019s education at Camelback High School inspired him to pursue a career in Hollywood.\n\nSpotnitz graduated from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) with a bachelor's degree in English literature in 1982, where he was a reporter for the [[Daily Bruin]]. He later received a [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in screenwriting from the [[AFI Conservatory]] in 1989.\n\n==Career==\n'''<big>Journalism</big>'''  \n\nUpon graduation, Spotnitz was employed as a wire-service reporter for the [[United Press International]] in Indianapolis and New York. He also briefly worked for the [[Associated Press]] in Paris. Spotnitz freelanced for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and''[[Rolling Stone]]'' before returning to his passion and studying screenwriting at [[American Film Institute|AFI]].  \n\n'''<big>Television</big>'''  \n\nSpotnitz created, executive produced and wrote several episodes of ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]'', based on the classic alternative history novel by Philip K. Dick, which upon its release became Amazon\u2019s most viewed series ever. Starring Alexa Davalos, Rufus Sewell and Joel de la Fuente, the series explores life in a 1962 America where the Allies lost the war and the country is divided between the fascist Japanese in the West and the Nazis in the East. The series won two Emmy Awards, was nominated for two others, and named Best Drama Series at the Roma Fiction Festival. It was also nominated for an ASC Award for Outstanding Cinematography, the USC Scripter Award and Best Drama at Monte Carlo Television Festival\u2019s Golden Nymph Awards.   \n\nSpotnitz co-created, executive produced and co-wrote ''Leonardo'', currently in production. The eight-part limited series shows the terrible personal sacrifice that led ''Leonardo'' to create masterpieces that changed the way we see the world forever. Starring [[Aidan Turner]] and [[Freddie Highmore]], the series is the first produced by The Alliance (RAI, France T\u00e9l\u00e9vision, ZDF).\n\nSpotnitz co-created, executive produced and co-wrote ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: Masters of Florence'', starring Richard Madden, Dustin Hoffman and Annabel Scholey. Chronicling the rise of the Medici family during the Italian Renaissance, it shows how the family\u2019s ascent from simple merchants to power brokers sparked an economic and cultural revolution, creating powerful enemies in the process. The Netflix Original Series was produced with Lux Vide Productions for RAI, Italy\u2019s largest broadcaster, and SFR in France. The RAI premiere attracted a record-breaking seven million viewers in Italy, becoming the country\u2019s most-watched new series. \n\nSet 20 years later, ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: The Magnificent'' starred Daniel Sharman, Bradley James and Sean Bean, and was also co-created, executive produced and co-written by Spotnitz. After an attempt on Piero de Medici\u2019s life, his son Lorenzo is forced to assume leadership of the family-run bank. Once in power, young Lorenzo resolves to abandon the cynical politics of the past to usher in a new era of creative and political revolution, bringing him into open conflict with rival banker Jacopo Pazzi, who will stop at nothing to defeat him. Their clash gives rise to one of the most thrilling true-life political intrigues of all time, the infamous Pazzi conspiracy. The second season of ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: The Magnificent'' was broadcast on RAI in December 2019 and premieres as a Netflix Original Series in May.\n\nIn 2017, Spotnitz co-created, executive produced and co-wrote the comedy-drama series ''[[The Indian Detective]]'' for Canadian broadcaster CTV and Netflix. It starred international comedy sensation Russell Peters, whom Forbes magazine ranked three times in its Top 10 highest-grossing comics list. Peters portrays Doug D\u2019Mello, a charming, smart Toronto cop, who unexpectedly finds himself investigating murder in his parents\u2019 Indian homeland, where, despite his heritage, he remains an outsider. Canada\u2019s biggest series debut in two years was the second-most watched programme on the day of its CTV premiere, with 1.6 million viewers. It was bestowed the Golden Screen Award by the Canadian Screen Academy.\n\n''[[Ransom (TV series)|Ransom]]'', produced for CBS in the US, France\u2019s TF1, Canada\u2019s Corus/Global and RTL in Germany, was a suspense drama set against an international backdrop. It starred [[Luke Roberts (actor)|Luke Roberts]] and was co-created, executive produced and co-written by Spotnitz. The thriller follows crisis and hostage negotiator Eric Beaumont, whose team is brought in to save lives when no one else can. Beaumont understands criminals better than they understand themselves and uses his insight into human behaviour to resolve the most difficult kidnap and ransom cases. Despite the stakes, Beaumont refuses to resort to violence, even when confronted by some of the world\u2019s most dangerous criminals. ''Ransom'' was VOX Germany\u2019s highest rated drama premiere for over 15 months and France\u2019s TF1 premiere reached over 4 million viewers for a market share of 25%. The show ran for three seasons.\n\nIn 2012, Spotnitz created, wrote and executive produced the international spy drama series ''[[Hunted (2012 TV series)|Hunted]]'' for BBC1 and HBO/Cinemax, starring [[Melissa George]], [[Adam Rayner]], [[Stephen Dillane]] and [[Patrick Malahide]]. \u00a0The series follows Sam Hunter, an operative for a private spy agency, Byzantium. After she is betrayed and nearly killed by one of her colleagues, Sam returns to London in an attempt to root out the traitor, while working undercover in the home of a wealthy and dangerous London gangster on an assignment that could cost her life. The series was BAFTA nominated for cinematography and won the ASC Award. It was also nominated for Best Editing by the Royal Television Society.\n\nSpotnitz served on ''[[The X-Files]]'' for eight of its nine seasons after joining the show in 1994. He called it \u201ca life-changing experience\u201d, graduating from staff writer to executive producer after three seasons. He directed two episodes and wrote or co-wrote more than 40 instalments of the series, including the Emmy-nominated \u201cMemento Mori\u201d with [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]],[[Vince Gilligan]] and [[John Shiban]] in 1997. He served for four years as executive producer and three years as president of Carter\u2019s Ten Thirteen Productions. He was a producer and co-writer of both ''[[The X-Files]]'' feature files, ''[[The X-Files (film)|Fight the Future]]''(1998) and ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe|I Want to Believe]]'' (2008). Spotnitz shares three Golden Globes for Best Dramatic Series and a Peabody Award for his work on ''[[The X-Files]]''. He was also nominated for an Emmy Award for writing and three times for Outstanding Drama Series.\n\nSpotnitz\u2019s additional writing and producing credits include: counter-terrorism drama series ''[[Strike Back (TV series)|Strike Back]]'' (HBO/Cinemax, Sky); action series ''[[Transporter: The Series]]'' (TNT); ABC\u2019s mystery series ''[[Night Stalker (TV series)|Night Stalker]]'' (ABC), starring Stuart Townsend and Gabrielle Union; Michael Mann\u2019s crime series ''[[Robbery Homicide Division]]'' (CBS); unconventional heroes comedy-drama ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'' (Fox); sci-fi drama ''[[Harsh Realm]]'' (Fox); and crime thriller ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' (Fox).\n\n== Writing process ==\nSpotnitz adopted the writers\u2019 room process from his experience in the US, which he brought to the UK when he founded Big Light Productions. \u00a0He cards the story scene by scene on a corkboard, with one board for each episode. \u00a0Spotnitz favours carding in order to better analyse the story and to enable better collaboration. \u00a0He always asks: why do I care about this story? \u00a0Why do I care about this character? \u00a0And aims to draw in the audience early on.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSpotnitz lives with his family in Paris and divides his time between Big Light\u2019s London and Paris offices.\n\n== Works and publications ==\n'''<big>Books</big>''' \n\n''TV Outside the Box: Trailblazing in the Digital Television Revolution'', Neil Landau (2015)\n\n'''<big>Filmography</big>'''\n\n*[[Leonardo (TV series 2020)|Leonardo]] (2020)\n*[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]] (2016\u20132019)\n*[[Ransom (TV series)|Ransom]] (2017\u20132019)\n*[[The Indian Detective]] (2017)\n*[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]] (2015\u20132019)\n*[[Crossing Lines]] (2015)\n*[[Transporter: The Series]] (2014)\n*[[Hunted (2015 TV series)|Hunted]] (2012)\n*[[Strike Back: Project Dawn]] (2011)\n*[[Samurai Girl (miniseries)|Samurai Girl]] (2008)\n*[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]] (2008)\n*[[A.M.P.E.D.]] (2007)\n*[[Night Stalker (TV series)|Night Stalker]] (2005\u20132006)\n*[[Robbery Homicide Division]] (2002\u20132003)\n*[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]] (2001)\n*[[Harsh Realm]] (1999)\n*[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files: Fight the Future]] (1998)\n*Inside the X-Files (1998)\n*[[The X-Files]] (1996\u20132002)\n*[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]] (1996)\n\n\n'''<big>The X-Files credits</big>'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!<abbr>No.</abbr>overall\n!No. of season\n!<abbr>No.</abbr> in\nseason\n!Title\n!Directed by\n!Written by\n!Original air date\n!<abbr>Prod.</abbr>code\u200a\n!US viewers\n(millions)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |41\n|2\n|17\n|\"[[End Game (The X-Files)|End Game]]\"\n|Rob Bowman\n|[[Frank Spotnitz]]\n|February 17, 1995\n|2X17\n|17.5\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |48\n|2\n|24\n|\"[[Our Town (The X-Files)|Our Town]]\"\n|Rob Bowman\n|Frank Spotnitz\n|May 12, 1995\n|2X24\n|14.5\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |58\n|3\n|9\n|\"[[Nisei (The X-Files)|Nisei]]\"\n|David Nutter\n|Chris Carter & Howard Gordon & [[Frank Spotnitz]]\n|November 24, 1995\n|3X09\n|16.36\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |59\n|3\n|10\n|\"[[731 (The X-Files)|731]]\"\n|Rob Bowman\n|Frank Spotnitz\n|December 1, 1995\n|3X10\n|17.68\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |64\n|3\n|15\n|\"[[Piper Maru]]\"\n|Rob Bowman\n|Frank Spotnitz & Chris Carter\n|February 9, 1996\n|3X15\n|16.44\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |65\n|3\n|16\n|\"[[Apocrypha (The X-Files)|Apocrypha]]\"\n|Kim Manners\n|Frank Spotnitz & Chris Carter\n|February 16, 1996\n|3X16\n|16.71\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |81\n|4\n|8\n|\"[[Tunguska (The X-Files)|Tunguska]]\"\n|Kim Manners\n|[[Frank Spotnitz]] & Chris Carter\n|November 24, 1996\n|4X09\n|18.85\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |82\n|4\n|9\n|\"[[Terma (The X-Files)|Terma]]\"\n|Rob Bowman\n|Frank Spotnitz & Chris Carter\n|December 1, 1996\n|4X10\n|17.34\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |85\n|4\n|12\n|\"[[Leonard Betts]]\"\n|Kim Manners\n|Vince Gilligan & John Shiban & Frank Spotnitz\n|January 26, 1997\n|4X14\n|29.15\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |87\n|4\n|14\n|\"[[Memento Mori (The X-Files)|Memento Mori]]\"\n|Rob Bowman\n|Chris Carter & Vince Gilligan & John Shiban & Frank Spotnitz\n|February 9, 1997\n|4X15\n|19.10\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |90\n|4\n|17\n|\"[[Tempus Fugit (The X-Files)|Tempus Fugit]]\"\n|Rob Bowman\n|Chris Carter & Frank Spotnitz\n|March 16, 1997\n|4X17\n|18.85\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |91\n|4\n|18\n|\"[[Max (The X-Files)|Max]]\"\n|Kim Manners\n|Chris Carter & Frank Spotnitz\n|March 23, 1997\n|4X18\n|18.34\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |94\n|4\n|21\n|\"[[Zero Sum (The X-Files)|Zero Sum]]\"\n|Kim Manners\n|Howard Gordon & Frank Spotnitz\n|April 27, 1997\n|4X21\n|18.60\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |101\n|5\n|4\n|\"[[Detour (The X-Files)|Detour]]\"\n|Brett Dowler\n|[[Frank Spotnitz]]\n|November 23, 1997\n|5X04\n|22.88\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |103\n|5\n|6\n|\"[[Christmas Carol (The X-Files)|Christmas Carol]]\"\n|[[Peter Markle]]\n|Vince Gilligan & [[John Shiban]] & Frank Spotnitz\n|December 7, 1997\n|5X05\n|20.91\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |104\n|5\n|7\n|\"[[Emily (The X-Files)|Emily]]\"\n|Kim Manners\n|Vince Gilligan & John Shiban & Frank Spotnitz\n|December 14, 1997\n|5X07\n|20.94\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |110\n|5\n|13\n|\"[[Patient X (The X-Files)|Patient X]]\"\n|Kim Manners\n|Chris Carter & Frank Spotnitz\n|March 1, 1998\n|5X13\n|20.21\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |111\n|5\n|14\n|\"[[The Red and the Black (The X-Files)|The Red and the Black]]\"\n|Chris Carter\n|Chris Carter & Frank Spotnitz\n|March 8, 1998\n|5X14\n|19.98\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" |112\n|5\n|15\n|\"[[Travelers (The X-Files)|Travelers]]\"\n|[[William A.
