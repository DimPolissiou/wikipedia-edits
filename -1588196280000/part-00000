Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2020, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Timeline of cases ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

widespread availability of laboratory testing but due to the restrictive RKI testing criteria, Germans without specific symptoms could not be tested until late March. On 25 March 2020, the Robert Koch Institute announced that people no longer needed to come from risk areas to be tested, and prioritised loosened restrictions to test health care workers.<ref name=\"Focus2503\">{{Cite news |last=Schneider |first=Paula |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/es-grassiert-ungewissheit-repraesentative-tests-sollen-wahres-ausmass-in-deutschland-zeigen_id_11813688.html |title=Statistikerin fordert Tests, die endlich das wahre Corona-Ausma\u00df in Deutschland zeigen |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020 |publisher=Focus}}</ref> RKI criticised that too many people without symptoms were tested.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/RKI-kassiert-Kriterium-fuer-Corona-Tests-article21667740.html |title=RKI kassiert Kriterium f\u00fcr Corona-Tests |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020 |publisher=ntv}}</ref> On 26 March, virologist Streeck said that testing labs were at the limit of their capacity.<ref name=\"Focus2703\">{{Cite news |last=Obermeier |first=Ludwig |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/covid-19-pandemie-top-virologe-wir-stecken-in-einem-dilemma-weil-uns-entscheidende-daten-fehlen_id_11811994.html |title=Zahlen-Chaos: Bonner Virologe zeigt mit 3 Beispielen, warum wir im Corona-Dilemma stecken |date=26 March 2020 |access-date=27 March 2020 |publisher=Focus}}</ref> The more a pandemic spreads, the harder it becomes to increase the number of tests due to overburdening of the healthcare system.<ref name=\"Focus2403\" />\n\n====Reporting lag====\nIncubation period, and turn around time of the only diagnostic test (PCR) can lead to a reporting lag of about five to ten days.<ref name=\"Focus2503\" />\n\nBecause of the federal health care system in Germany, federal countries vary in data collection, aggregation and time of release to the public. Local ([[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]]e / [[Districts of Germany|Kreisfreie St\u00e4dte]]) health departments initially reported data to the federal country health department which transferred data to the nations federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal country health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2020, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Timeline of cases ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

widespread availability of laboratory testing but due to the restrictive RKI testing criteria, Germans without specific symptoms could not be tested until late March. On 25 March 2020, the Robert Koch Institute announced that people no longer needed to come from risk areas to be tested, and prioritised loosened restrictions to test health care workers.<ref name=\"Focus2503\">{{Cite news |last=Schneider |first=Paula |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/es-grassiert-ungewissheit-repraesentative-tests-sollen-wahres-ausmass-in-deutschland-zeigen_id_11813688.html |title=Statistikerin fordert Tests, die endlich das wahre Corona-Ausma\u00df in Deutschland zeigen |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020 |publisher=Focus}}</ref> RKI criticised that too many people without symptoms were tested.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/RKI-kassiert-Kriterium-fuer-Corona-Tests-article21667740.html |title=RKI kassiert Kriterium f\u00fcr Corona-Tests |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020 |publisher=ntv}}</ref> On 26 March, virologist Streeck said that testing labs were at the limit of their capacity.<ref name=\"Focus2703\">{{Cite news |last=Obermeier |first=Ludwig |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/covid-19-pandemie-top-virologe-wir-stecken-in-einem-dilemma-weil-uns-entscheidende-daten-fehlen_id_11811994.html |title=Zahlen-Chaos: Bonner Virologe zeigt mit 3 Beispielen, warum wir im Corona-Dilemma stecken |date=26 March 2020 |access-date=27 March 2020 |publisher=Focus}}</ref> The more a pandemic spreads, the harder it becomes to increase the number of tests due to overburdening of the healthcare system.<ref name=\"Focus2403\" />\n\n====Reporting lag====\nIncubation period, and turn around time of the only diagnostic test (PCR) can lead to a reporting lag of about five to ten days.<ref name=\"Focus2503\" />\n\nBecause of the federal health care system in Germany, federal countries vary in data collection, aggregation and time of release to the public. Local ([[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]]e / [[Districts of Germany|Kreisfreie St\u00e4dte]]) health departments initially reported data to the federal country health department which transferred data to the nations federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal country health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

Dolly was born in the mid 1990s and lived a normal life until she experienced health complications that led to her death.<ref name=\":5\" /> Other animal species known to have been cloned include dogs, pigs, and horses.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Genome editing ===\nGenome editing has been rapidly advancing with the help of the CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal|last=Palermo|first=Giulia|last2=Ricci|first2=Clarisse G.|last3=McCammon|first3=J. Andrew|date=April 2019|title=The invisible dance of CRISPR-Cas9. Simulations unveil the molecular side of the gene-editing revolution.|journal=Physics Today|volume=72|issue=4|pages=30\u201336|doi=10.1063/PT.3.4182|issn=0031-9228|pmc=6738945|pmid=31511751}}</ref> Viral DNA that was injected into the bacterium became incorporated into the bacterial chromosome at specific regions. These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within the chromosome, it gets transcribed into RNA. Once this occurs, the Cas9 binds to the RNA. Cas9 can recognize the foreign insert and cleaves it.<ref name=\":23\" /> This discovery was very crucial because now the Cas protein can be viewed as a scissor in the genome editing process.\n\nBy using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. This results in a hybrid between the two species, since it is not completely one animal. Because it is possible to sequence and assemble the genome of extinct organisms from highly degraded tissues, this technique enables scientists to pursue de-extinction in a wider array of species, including those for which no well-preserved remains exist.<ref name=\":32\"/> However, the more degraded and old the tissue from the extinct species is, the more fragmented the resulting DNA will be, making genome assembly more challenging.\n\n=== Back breeding ===\nBack breeding is a form of selective breeding. As opposed to breeding animals for a trait to advance the species in selective breeding, back breeding involves breeding animals for an ancestral characteristic that may not be seen throughout the species as frequently.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|title=Pathways to de\u2010extinction: how close can we get to resurrection of an extinct species?|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=31|issue=5|pages=996\u20131002|last=Shapiro|first=Beth|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12705|year=2017|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d9fdfbc55d587550d295dc38e4f9d1423922d6f|doi-access=free}}</ref> This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species.<ref name=\":122\"/> Back breeding, however, is contingent on the ancestral trait of the species still being in the population in any frequency.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Iterative evolution===\nA natural process of de-extinction is iterative evolution. This process occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then reappears after some amount of time. An example of this process occurred with the [[white-throated rail]]. This flightless bird became extinct approximately 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise, which resulted in the demise of the species. The species reappeared about 100,000 years ago when sea levels dropped, allowing the bird to evolve once again as a flightless species on the island of [[Aldabra]], where it is found to the present day.<ref name=\"The bird that came back from the dead2\">[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-05/uop-tbt050919.php The bird that came back from the dead]</ref><ref name=\"Extinct species of bird came back from the dead, scientists find2\">[https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/africa/white-throated-rail-extinction-scli-intl-scn/index.html Extinct species of bird came back from the dead, scientists find]</ref><ref name=\"This Bird Went Extinct and Then Evolved Into Existence Again2\">[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb9bpm/this-bird-went-extinct-and-then-evolved-into-existence-again This Bird Went Extinct and Then Evolved Into Existence Again]</ref> Also see [[Elvis taxon]].\n\n== Advantages of de-extinction ==\n\nThe technologies being developed for de-extinction could lead to large advancements in scientific technology and process. This includes the advancement of genetic technologies that are used to improve the cloning process for de-extinction. The technologies could be used to prevent endangered species form going extinct.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e360.yale.edu/features/the_case_for_de-extinction_why_we_should_bring_back_the_woolly_mammoth|title=De-Extinction Debate: Should We Bring Back the Woolly Mammoth?|website=Yale E360|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> The study of reintroduced spices could also lead to advancements in science.

While it was abundant up to the [[Middle Ages|Medieval times]], over-hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries led to its demise. In 1999, only a single female named Celia was left alive in [[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park|Ordesa National Park]]. Scientists captured her, took a tissue sample from her ear, collared her, then released her back into the wild, where she lived until she was found dead in 2000, having been crushed by a fallen tree. In 2003, scientists used the tissue sample to attempt to clone Celia and resurrect the extinct subspecies. Despite having successfully transferred nuclei from her cells into [[domestic goat]] egg cells and impregnating 208 female goats, only one came to term. The baby ibex that was born had a lung defect, and lived for only 7 minutes before suffocating from being incapable of breathing oxygen. Nevertheless, her birth was seen as a triumph and has been considered to have been the first de-extinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090210-bucardo-clone_2.html|title=First Extinct-Animal Clone Created|publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=2009-02-10}}</ref> In late 2013, scientists announced that they would again attempt to recreate the Pyrenean ibex. A problem to be faced, in addition to the many challenges of reproduction of a mammal by cloning, is that only females can be produced by cloning the female individual Celia, and no males exist for those females to reproduce with. This could potentially be addressed by breeding female clones with the closely related [[Southeastern Spanish ibex]], and gradually creating a hybrid animal that will eventually bear more resemblance to the Pyrenean ibex than the Southeastern Spanish ibex.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-25052233|title=BBC News \u2013 Fresh effort to clone extinct animal|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=2013-11-22|last1=Rincon|first1=Paul}}</ref>\n[[File:Aurochs1.png|thumb|The Auroch size compared to the size of a human.]]\n\n=== Aurochs ===\nThe [[aurochs]] was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the [[Pleistocene]], but only the European aurochs (''[[Aurochs|Bos primigenius primigenius]]'') survived into historic times.<ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136721/0|title=Bos primigenius|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as [[Lascaux cave|Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet cave|Chauvet]] cave in France,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Aurochs#p00fc2yh|title=BBC Nature \u2013 Cattle and aurochs videos, news and facts|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> and was still widespread during the [[Roman era]].

[[Cloning]] is the most widely proposed method, although genome editing and [[selective breeding]] have also been considered. Similar techniques have been applied to certain [[endangered species]], in hopes to boost populations. The only method of the three that would provide an animal with the same genetic identity is cloning.<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.nyls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&=&context=fac_other_pubs&=&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.com%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Den%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C10%2526q%253Dde%252Bextinction%2526oq%253Ddeext#search=%22de%20extinction%22|title=What If Extinction Is Not Forever?|last=Sherkow|first=Jacob|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> There are both pros and cons to the process of de-extinction ranging from technological advancements to ethical issues.\n\n==Methods==\n===Cloning===\n[[File:Pyrenean ibex Cloning.svg|thumb|left|Pictured above is the process used to clone the [[Pyrenean ibex]] in 2003. The tissue culture was taken from the last living, female Pyrenean ibex named Celia. The egg was taken from a [[goat]] (''Capra hircus'') and the nuclei removed to ensure the offspring was purely Pyrenean ibex. The egg was implanted into a surrogate goat mother for development.]]\n\n[[Cloning]] is a commonly suggested method for the potential restoration of an extinct species. It can be done by extracting the nucleus from a preserved cell from the extinct species and swapping it into an egg, without a nucleus, of that species' nearest living relative.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Beth|date=2016-08-09|title=Pathways to de-extinction: how close can we get to resurrection of an extinct species?|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=31|issue=5|pages=996\u20131002|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12705|issn=0269-8463|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d9fdfbc55d587550d295dc38e4f9d1423922d6f|doi-access=free}}</ref> The egg can then be inserted into a host from the extinct species\u2019 nearest living relative.

Dolly was born in the mid 1990s and lived a normal life until she experienced health complications that led to her death.<ref name=\":5\" /> Other animal species known to have been cloned include dogs, pigs, and horses.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Genome editing ===\nGenome editing has been rapidly advancing with the help of the CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal|last=Palermo|first=Giulia|last2=Ricci|first2=Clarisse G.|last3=McCammon|first3=J. Andrew|date=April 2019|title=The invisible dance of CRISPR-Cas9.

These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within the chromosome, it gets transcribed into RNA. Once this occurs, the Cas9 binds to the RNA. Cas9 can recognize the foreign insert and cleaves it.<ref name=\":23\" /> This discovery was very crucial because now the Cas protein can be viewed as a scissor in the genome editing process.\n\nBy using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. This results in a hybrid between the two species, since it is not completely one animal. Because it is possible to sequence and assemble the genome of extinct organisms from highly degraded tissues, this technique enables scientists to pursue de-extinction in a wider array of species, including those for which no well-preserved remains exist.<ref name=\":32\"/> However, the more degraded and old the tissue from the extinct species is, the more fragmented the resulting DNA will be, making genome assembly more challenging.\n\n=== Back breeding ===\nBack breeding is a form of selective breeding. As opposed to breeding animals for a trait to advance the species in selective breeding, back breeding involves breeding animals for an ancestral characteristic that may not be seen throughout the species as frequently.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|title=Pathways to de\u2010extinction: how close can we get to resurrection of an extinct species?|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=31|issue=5|pages=996\u20131002|last=Shapiro|first=Beth|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12705|year=2017|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d9fdfbc55d587550d295dc38e4f9d1423922d6f|doi-access=free}}</ref> This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species.<ref name=\":122\"/> Back breeding, however, is contingent on the ancestral trait of the species still being in the population in any frequency.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Iterative evolution===\nA natural process of de-extinction is iterative evolution. This process occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then reappears after some amount of time. An example of this process occurred with the [[white-throated rail]]. This flightless bird became extinct approximately 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise, which resulted in the demise of the species. The species reappeared about 100,000 years ago when sea levels dropped, allowing the bird to evolve once again as a flightless species on the island of [[Aldabra]], where it is found to the present day.<ref name=\"The bird that came back from the dead2\">[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-05/uop-tbt050919.php The bird that came back from the dead]</ref><ref name=\"Extinct species of bird came back from the dead, scientists find2\">[https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/africa/white-throated-rail-extinction-scli-intl-scn/index.html Extinct species of bird came back from the dead, scientists find]</ref><ref name=\"This Bird Went Extinct and Then Evolved Into Existence Again2\">[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb9bpm/this-bird-went-extinct-and-then-evolved-into-existence-again This Bird Went Extinct and Then Evolved Into Existence Again]</ref> Also see [[Elvis taxon]].\n\n== Advantages of de-extinction ==\n\nThe technologies being developed for de-extinction could lead to large advancements in scientific technology and process. This includes the advancement of genetic technologies that are used to improve the cloning process for de-extinction. The technologies could be used to prevent endangered species form going extinct.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e360.yale.edu/features/the_case_for_de-extinction_why_we_should_bring_back_the_woolly_mammoth|title=De-Extinction Debate: Should We Bring Back the Woolly Mammoth?|website=Yale E360|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> The study of reintroduced spices could also lead to advancements in science. By studying previously extinct animals cures to diseases could be discovered.

Conservation would be necessary in order to reintroduce a species into the ecosystem.

The resulting offspring would be an elephant\u2013mammoth hybrid. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth could be produced. However, sperm cells of modern mammals are typically potent for up to 15 years after deep-freezing, which could hinder this method.<ref name=\":42\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/welcome-pleistocene-park-russian-scientists-say-high-chance-cloning-woolly-mammoth/|title=Welcome to Pleistocene Park: Russian scientists say they have a 'high chance' of cloning a woolly mammoth|date=2014-03-14|work=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> In 2008, a Japanese team found usable DNA in the brains of mice that had been frozen for 16 years.

While it was abundant up to the [[Middle Ages|Medieval times]], over-hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries led to its demise. In 1999, only a single female named Celia was left alive in [[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park|Ordesa National Park]]. Scientists captured her, took a tissue sample from her ear, collared her, then released her back into the wild, where she lived until she was found dead in 2000, having been crushed by a fallen tree. In 2003, scientists used the tissue sample to attempt to clone Celia and resurrect the extinct subspecies. Despite having successfully transferred nuclei from her cells into [[domestic goat]] egg cells and impregnating 208 female goats, only one came to term. The baby ibex that was born had a lung defect, and lived for only 7 minutes before suffocating from being incapable of breathing oxygen. Nevertheless, her birth was seen as a triumph and has been considered to have been the first de-extinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090210-bucardo-clone_2.html|title=First Extinct-Animal Clone Created|publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=2009-02-10}}</ref> In late 2013, scientists announced that they would again attempt to recreate the Pyrenean ibex. A problem to be faced, in addition to the many challenges of reproduction of a mammal by cloning, is that only females can be produced by cloning the female individual Celia, and no males exist for those females to reproduce with. This could potentially be addressed by breeding female clones with the closely related [[Southeastern Spanish ibex]], and gradually creating a hybrid animal that will eventually bear more resemblance to the Pyrenean ibex than the Southeastern Spanish ibex.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-25052233|title=BBC News \u2013 Fresh effort to clone extinct animal|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=2013-11-22|last1=Rincon|first1=Paul}}</ref>\n[[File:Aurochs1.png|thumb|The Auroch size compared to the size of a human.]]\n\n=== Aurochs ===\nThe [[aurochs]] was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the [[Pleistocene]], but only the European aurochs (''[[Aurochs|Bos primigenius primigenius]]'') survived into historic times.<ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136721/0|title=Bos primigenius|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as [[Lascaux cave|Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet cave|Chauvet]] cave in France,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Aurochs#p00fc2yh|title=BBC Nature \u2013 Cattle and aurochs videos, news and facts|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> and was still widespread during the [[Roman era]].

Instead, Revive & Restore focuses on identifying mutations in the DNA that would cause a phenotypic difference between the extinct passenger pigeon and its closest living relative the [[band-tailed pigeon]]. In doing this, they can determine how to modify the DNA of the band-tailed pigeon to change the traits to mimic the traits of the passenger pigeon. In this sense, the de-extinct passenger pigeon would not be genetically identical to the extinct passenger pigeon, but it would have the same traits.

Transferred to the Royal Navy and commissioned as ''Dacres'' on 28 August 1943, the ship was named after Vice Admiral [[James Richard Dacres (1749\u20131810)]].\n\n==Service history==\n''Dacres'' was attached to the B4 [[Escort Group (naval)|Escort Group]] based at [[Belfast]], which comprised three destroyers and two Captain class frigates ({{HMS|Foley|K474|2}} and {{HMS|Bayntun|K310|2}}), and carried out escort duties in the Atlantic.\n\n''Dacres'' was one of three Captain class ships (along with {{HMS|Kingsmill|K484|2}} and {{HMS|Lawford|K514|2}}) selected for conversion to headquarters ships for use during \"[[Operation Neptune]]\" \u2013 the invasion of France. Her aft three-inch (76&nbsp;mm) gun and all the depth charge gear was removed and the superstructure extended to provide accommodation for extra Staff Officers; two deck houses were built for communications equipment and a small main mast added to support more aerials. Four more 20&nbsp;mm [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikons]] were fitted, and a number of radar sets installed.\n\nFor [[Normandy Landings|the invasion]] ''Dacres'' sailed from [[Portsmouth]], even though her forward motor room had flooded, which compelled her to sail on only one engine. However she could still make about 16 knots, which was enough for her to lead in her convoy of assault ships to her group position off [[Sword Beach|Sword]] on schedule at daybreak on D-Day \u2013 6 June 1944.\n\nAs the Allied forces moved inland the staff officers were transferred ashore, and ''Dacres'' joined  ''Kingsmill'' in patrolling the Normandy anchorage until August, when she sailed for Portsmouth, salvaging an abandoned [[Liberty ship]] on the way.

Transferred to the Royal Navy and commissioned as ''Dacres'' on 28 August 1943, the ship was named after Vice Admiral [[James Richard Dacres (1749\u20131810)]].\n\n==Service history==\n''Dacres'' was attached to the B4 [[Escort Group (naval)|Escort Group]] based at [[Belfast]], which comprised three destroyers and two Captain class frigates ({{HMS|Foley|K474|2}} and {{HMS|Bayntun|K310|2}}), and carried out escort duties in the Atlantic.\n\n''Dacres'' was one of three Captain class ships (along with {{HMS|Kingsmill|K484|2}} and {{HMS|Lawford|K514|2}}) selected for conversion to headquarters ships for use during \"[[Operation Neptune]]\" - the invasion of France. Her aft three-inch (76&nbsp;mm) gun and all the depth charge gear was removed and the superstructure extended to provide accommodation for extra Staff Officers; two deck houses were built for communications equipment and a small main mast added to support more aerials. Four more 20&nbsp;mm [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikons]] were fitted, and a number of radar sets installed.\n\nFor [[Normandy Landings|the invasion]] ''Dacres'' sailed from [[Portsmouth]], even though her forward motor room had flooded, which compelled her to sail on only one engine. However she could still make about 16 knots, which was enough for her to lead in her convoy of assault ships to her group position off [[Sword Beach|Sword]] on schedule at daybreak on D-Day \u2013 6 June 1944.\n\nAs the Allied forces moved inland the staff officers were transferred ashore, and ''Dacres'' joined  ''Kingsmill'' in patrolling the Normandy anchorage until August, when she sailed for Portsmouth, salvaging an abandoned [[Liberty ship]] on the way. At [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth dockyard]] she was stripped of the additional superstructure and guns, and restored to working order, before returning to Belfast in early 1945 to join the 10th Escort Group. Although the group sank three [[U-boat]]s during February ''Dacres'' was not credited with helping in any of these kills.\n\nIn April 1945 she was transferred to the 15th Escort Group until [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]], after which she was put into reserve until returned to the [[United States Navy]] on 26 January 1946.

It sold 1.15 million units worldwide<ref name=\"nintendo-Q108\" />. The game is one of the best-selling Nintendo DS video games.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=List of best-selling Nintendo DS video games|date=2019-09-26|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_Nintendo_DS_video_games&oldid=917923598|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Super Princess Peach - Gameplay.png|thumb|256px|Princess Peach navigates a level in World 2, Hoo's Wood.  The lower screen indicates that she is expressing the \"calm\" vibe; this can also be seen in the faint bubble surrounding her in the upper screen.]]\n''Super Princess Peach'' plays similarly to traditional platformers. There are eight worlds, each of which contain six levels and a boss battle which leads the player to the next world. Each boss battle requires playing a short minigame that makes use of the DS touchscreen. Three captive Toads are hidden throughout each level, with each boss battle holding a single Toad contained in a bubble. In order to play the final boss battle, the player must rescue all of the Toads.\n\nAfter the game is completed, the player can go through the levels again to pick up more unlockable items. Beating a boss will unlock three new levels for the next world; for instance, beating the World 1 boss will unlock three new levels for World 2 and so on. There are a total of 24 extra levels to unlock.\n\nOn the upper left hand side of the screen, there are two bars: heart gauge (maximum of five hearts) and emotion meter. Whenever Peach falls down a hole, an ocean of lava or gets hit by an enemy, she loses half a heart and respawns at the last checkpoint. When all hearts are gone, she starts over at the beginning of the level. Peach has infinite lives, so the player can continue as much as they please.\n\nThe emotion meter corresponds to the four vibe powers she has. The emotions at Vibe Island affect everybody, even some enemies, but Peach can change her emotions at will. The [[Four temperaments|four emotions]] are joy, gloom, rage, and calm. When the player taps on each mood, it will activate a different ability, which helps solve puzzles and defeat enemies.\n\nEach use will drain the player's vibe meter. The bar can be restored by capturing blue turquoise jewels or absorbing enemies using Perry the parasol.\n\nUnlike Mario, jumping on enemies does not defeat them; Peach must use Perry to hit them. The player can press \"B\" to immediately sweep them aside or \"X\" to put them on top of the umbrella. Once an enemy is on top of the umbrella, the player may press \"X\" again to put the enemy down, \"B\" to throw the enemy, or down on the D-pad to absorb the enemy, which refills part of the emotion meter.\n\nAs the game progresses, Perry gains new abilities. The \"Subrella\" allows Peach to travel underwater. To attack, the player blows into the microphone to blow bubbles to defeat the undersea enemies and break blocks. The \"Slidebrella\" turns Perry upside down and uses his handle like a hook. It is used in areas with a maze of high-flying wires. The \"Bowlbrella\" puts Peach in the umbrella and allows her to navigate through the water's surface.\n\nIn addition, the game features a shop where players can buy items. Using coins as currency the player can buy incremental upgrades to expand the heart gauge or the emotion meter, as well as three new abilities. The \"Floatbrella\" allows Peach to stay afloat for a few seconds. \"Poundbrella\" shakes the ground and stuns any enemies nearby. \"Chargebrella\" creates a small charge that will stun the closest enemy. By finishing the game and completing all bonuses, the player can buy a drink named \"Endless Vibe\". It'll allow Peach to use her vibes without having the vibe meter decreasing, meaning that the player can use her powers as long as they please.\n\nThe game's bonuses include a glossary, puzzles, mini games, a music room, and replays of Perry's dreams. There are three mini games within the game and the levels are unlocked as the player finds more mini game pieces in the levels. All of the mini games has the player control Toad in a variety of activities (such as a platforming mode).\n\n==Plot==\nNear the location of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], a fabled land known as Vibe Island is said to hide a treasure known as the Vibe Scepter, a magical weapon that can be used to control the emotions of other people. Hearing of the island's legendary powers, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] builds a summer getaway home on the island in hopes of using it to his advantage.\n\nAfter his second-in-command, Army Hammer Bro finds the Scepter for him, Bowser hatches a plan to capture the Mario Brothers. Army Hammer Bro. entrusts the scepter to a [[Goomba]] and sends it into the castle.\n\nWith the residents of the castle under the influence of the Scepter, the Army Hammer Bro. and his troops successfully capture [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], and several [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]], imprisoning them all across the island. However, Goomba becomes influenced by the Vibe Scepter and begins swinging it around, causing Bowser and his minions to lose control of their emotions.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Peach and [[List of Mario franchise characters#Toadsworth|Toadsworth]] return to her castle after a short walk only to find the residents in emotional disarray and a note from Bowser saying that he has captured Mario and Luigi. Maddened with rage, Peach decides that she is the only one who can rescue the Mario Brothers and sets out to go to Vibe Island to do so. Shortly before her departure, Toadsworth, who is reluctant to see Peach travel on her own, gives Peach a magical, sentient [[umbrella|parasol]] named Perry to help her on her journey. With Perry now on her side, Peach finally sets out for Vibe Island to rescue Mario and Luigi.\n\nPeach and Perry travel through eight different areas across the island, rescuing various Toads and defeating various enemies along the way. Because of the Goomba's earlier flaunting of the scepter, emotional energy had been dispersed all over the island, causing the residents to experience various moods. Even Peach is affected, but has better control, even gaining new abilities from each emotion. After defeating a boss and clearing the current area, Perry's backstory is revealed in the form of several [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]; long ago, Perry was a young man with magical powers, and was adopted by an old man who he came to call \"Grandpa\". Later, Perry transformed himself into an umbrella and was captured by a wizard and his henchman, but managed to escape by wiggling free from his captors and fell on the road. Sometime later, a traveling merchant found him and sold him to Toadsworth.\n\nAfter defeating Giant Kamek and freeing Luigi, the duo arrive at Bowser's Villa, where they meet Bowser and Army Hammer Bro. Bowser uses the Vibe Scepter to increase Army Hammer Bro's power with rage, but Peach bests him nonetheless. Peach then fights and defeats Bowser, but the Koopa King uses the Vibe Scepter to turn into a giant, but Peach and Perry defeat him once again by throwing Bob-ombs at him, and then whack him out of the villa with the Scepter in hand. After Bowser's defeat, Peach frees Mario, after which they rejoice and return to the Mushroom Kingdom alongside Luigi and the Toads, with the fate of the Vibe Scepter left unknown.\n\n==Release==\n''Super Princess Peach'' was first announced by [[Nintendo]] in October 2004 with the exclusion of a posted release date.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/29/princess-peach-gets-nds-game</ref> It was first released in Japan on October 24, 2005.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/24/now-playing-in-japan-33</ref> It later came out in North America<ref>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dses-now-feeling-peachy/1100-6144990/</ref> and Europe<ref>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-european-release-schedule/1100-6151400/</ref> on February 27 and May 26, 2006, respectively.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n|1UP = B+<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/super-princess-peach|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604072247/http://www.1up.com/reviews/super-princess-peach|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-06-04|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|date=2006-02-27|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|access-date=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n|Allgame = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=48601|title=Super Princess Peach Overview|publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref>\n|EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_peach_ds|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Kumar|first=Mathew|date=2006-03-07|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref>\n|Fam = 34/40<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.finalfantasytr.com/consoles.asp?cid=6|title=NDS Games - Famitsu Scores Archive|publisher=[[Famitsu]] Scores Archive|access-date=2013-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902200145/http://fs.finalfantasytr.com/consoles.asp?cid=6|archive-date=2008-09-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|GamePro = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/52291/super-princess-peach/|title=Review: Super Princess Peach|date=February 27, 2006|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2009-03-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208103943/http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/52291/super-princess-peach/|archivedate=2009-12-08}}</ref>\n|GRadar = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/super-princess-peach-review/|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Elston|first=Brett|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n|GameRev = C+<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/super-princess-peach|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Dodson|first=Joe|publisher=[[Game Revolution]]|date=2006-02-24|accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n|GI = 8.75/10<ref>{{cite journal|title=Super Princess Peach|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=March 2006|page=118}}</ref>\n|GSpot = 7.2/10<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n|GSpy = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"spy\"/>\n|GameZone = 8.8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/super_princess_peach_nds_review|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=David|first=Mike|date=2006-04-12|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref>\n|IGN = 7.8/10<ref name=\"ign\"/>\n|NWR = 8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/4454|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Shughart|first=Ty|publisher=Nintendo World Report|date=November 24, 2005|accessdate=2013-10-27}}</ref>\n|ONM = 72%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/2495/reviews/super-princess-peach-review/|title=DS Review: Super Princess Peach|last=East|first=Tom|date=10 January 2008|publisher=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]|accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n|XPlay = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"xplayreview\">{{cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/xplay/reviews/1083/Super-Princess-Peach.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806062646/http://g4tv.com/xplay/reviews/1083/Super-Princess-Peach.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-08-06|title=Review: Super Princess Peach|publisher=[[X-Play]]|access-date=2009-03-18}}</ref>\n|GR = 76.60% (56 reviews)<ref name=\"grreviews\"/>\n|MC = 75% (48 reviews)<ref name=\"mcreviews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/super-princess-peach/critic-reviews|title=Super Princess Peach Critic Reviews for DS|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n}}\n''Super Princess Peach'' received generally positive reviews from critics, it currently has an average rating of 76.60% on [[GameRankings]],<ref name=\"grreviews\">[http://www.gamerankings.com/ds/925562-super-princess-peach/index.html \"Super Princess Peach for DS\"].

It sold 1.15 million units worldwide<ref name=\"nintendo-Q108\" />.

The lower screen indicates that she is expressing the \"calm\" vibe; this can also be seen in the faint bubble surrounding her in the upper screen.]]\n''Super Princess Peach'' plays similarly to traditional platformers. There are eight worlds, each of which contain six levels and a boss battle which leads the player to the next world. Each boss battle requires playing a short minigame that makes use of the DS touchscreen. Three captive Toads are hidden throughout each level, with each boss battle holding a single Toad contained in a bubble. In order to play the final boss battle, the player must rescue all of the Toads.\n\nAfter the game is completed, the player can go through the levels again to pick up more unlockable items. Beating a boss will unlock three new levels for the next world; for instance, beating the World 1 boss will unlock three new levels for World 2 and so on. There are a total of 24 extra levels to unlock.\n\nOn the upper left hand side of the screen, there are two bars: heart gauge (maximum of five hearts) and emotion meter. Whenever Peach falls down a hole, an ocean of lava or gets hit by an enemy, she loses half a heart and respawns at the last checkpoint. When all hearts are gone, she starts over at the beginning of the level. Peach has infinite lives, so the player can continue as much as they please.\n\nThe emotion meter corresponds to the four vibe powers she has. The emotions at Vibe Island affect everybody, even some enemies, but Peach can change her emotions at will. The [[Four temperaments|four emotions]] are joy, gloom, rage, and calm. When the player taps on each mood, it will activate a different ability, which helps solve puzzles and defeat enemies.\n\nEach use will drain the player's vibe meter. The bar can be restored by capturing blue turquoise jewels or absorbing enemies using Perry the parasol.\n\nUnlike Mario, jumping on enemies does not defeat them; Peach must use Perry to hit them. The player can press \"B\" to immediately sweep them aside or \"X\" to put them on top of the umbrella. Once an enemy is on top of the umbrella, the player may press \"X\" again to put the enemy down, \"B\" to throw the enemy, or down on the D-pad to absorb the enemy, which refills part of the emotion meter.\n\nAs the game progresses, Perry gains new abilities. The \"Subrella\" allows Peach to travel underwater. To attack, the player blows into the microphone to blow bubbles to defeat the undersea enemies and break blocks. The \"Slidebrella\" turns Perry upside down and uses his handle like a hook. It is used in areas with a maze of high-flying wires. The \"Bowlbrella\" puts Peach in the umbrella and allows her to navigate through the water's surface.\n\nIn addition, the game features a shop where players can buy items. Using coins as currency the player can buy incremental upgrades to expand the heart gauge or the emotion meter, as well as three new abilities. The \"Floatbrella\" allows Peach to stay afloat for a few seconds. \"Poundbrella\" shakes the ground and stuns any enemies nearby. \"Chargebrella\" creates a small charge that will stun the closest enemy. By finishing the game and completing all bonuses, the player can buy a drink named \"Endless Vibe\". It'll allow Peach to use her vibes without having the vibe meter decreasing, meaning that the player can use her powers as long as they please.\n\nThe game's bonuses include a glossary, puzzles, mini games, a music room, and replays of Perry's dreams. There are three mini games within the game and the levels are unlocked as the player finds more mini game pieces in the levels. All of the mini games has the player control Toad in a variety of activities (such as a platforming mode).\n\n==Plot==\nNear the location of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], a fabled land known as Vibe Island is said to hide a treasure known as the Vibe Scepter, a magical weapon that can be used to control the emotions of other people. Hearing of the island's legendary powers, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] builds a summer getaway home on the island in hopes of using it to his advantage.\n\nAfter his second-in-command, Army Hammer Bro finds the Scepter for him, Bowser hatches a plan to capture the Mario Brothers. Army Hammer Bro. entrusts the scepter to a [[Goomba]] and sends it into the castle.\n\nWith the residents of the castle under the influence of the Scepter, the Army Hammer Bro. and his troops successfully capture [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], and several [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]], imprisoning them all across the island. However, Goomba becomes influenced by the Vibe Scepter and begins swinging it around, causing Bowser and his minions to lose control of their emotions.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Peach and [[List of Mario franchise characters#Toadsworth|Toadsworth]] return to her castle after a short walk only to find the residents in emotional disarray and a note from Bowser saying that he has captured Mario and Luigi. Maddened with rage, Peach decides that she is the only one who can rescue the Mario Brothers and sets out to go to Vibe Island to do so. Shortly before her departure, Toadsworth, who is reluctant to see Peach travel on her own, gives Peach a magical, sentient [[umbrella|parasol]] named Perry to help her on her journey. With Perry now on her side, Peach finally sets out for Vibe Island to rescue Mario and Luigi.\n\nPeach and Perry travel through eight different areas across the island, rescuing various Toads and defeating various enemies along the way. Because of the Goomba's earlier flaunting of the scepter, emotional energy had been dispersed all over the island, causing the residents to experience various moods. Even Peach is affected, but has better control, even gaining new abilities from each emotion. After defeating a boss and clearing the current area, Perry's backstory is revealed in the form of several [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]; long ago, Perry was a young man with magical powers, and was adopted by an old man who he came to call \"Grandpa\". Later, Perry transformed himself into an umbrella and was captured by a wizard and his henchman, but managed to escape by wiggling free from his captors and fell on the road. Sometime later, a traveling merchant found him and sold him to Toadsworth.\n\nAfter defeating Giant Kamek and freeing Luigi, the duo arrive at Bowser's Villa, where they meet Bowser and Army Hammer Bro. Bowser uses the Vibe Scepter to increase Army Hammer Bro's power with rage, but Peach bests him nonetheless. Peach then fights and defeats Bowser, but the Koopa King uses the Vibe Scepter to turn into a giant, but Peach and Perry defeat him once again by throwing Bob-ombs at him, and then whack him out of the villa with the Scepter in hand. After Bowser's defeat, Peach frees Mario, after which they rejoice and return to the Mushroom Kingdom alongside Luigi and the Toads, with the fate of the Vibe Scepter left unknown.\n\n==Release==\n''Super Princess Peach'' was first announced by [[Nintendo]] in October 2004 with the exclusion of a posted release date.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/29/princess-peach-gets-nds-game</ref> It was first released in Japan on October 24, 2005.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/24/now-playing-in-japan-33</ref> It later came out in North America<ref>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dses-now-feeling-peachy/1100-6144990/</ref> and Europe<ref>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-european-release-schedule/1100-6151400/</ref> on February 27 and May 26, 2006, respectively.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n|1UP = B+<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/super-princess-peach|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604072247/http://www.1up.com/reviews/super-princess-peach|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-06-04|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|date=2006-02-27|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|access-date=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n|Allgame = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=48601|title=Super Princess Peach Overview|publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref>\n|EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_peach_ds|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Kumar|first=Mathew|date=2006-03-07|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref>\n|Fam = 34/40<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.finalfantasytr.com/consoles.asp?cid=6|title=NDS Games - Famitsu Scores Archive|publisher=[[Famitsu]] Scores Archive|access-date=2013-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902200145/http://fs.finalfantasytr.com/consoles.asp?cid=6|archive-date=2008-09-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|GamePro = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/52291/super-princess-peach/|title=Review: Super Princess Peach|date=February 27, 2006|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2009-03-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208103943/http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/52291/super-princess-peach/|archivedate=2009-12-08}}</ref>\n|GRadar = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/super-princess-peach-review/|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Elston|first=Brett|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n|GameRev = C+<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/super-princess-peach|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Dodson|first=Joe|publisher=[[Game Revolution]]|date=2006-02-24|accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n|GI = 8.75/10<ref>{{cite journal|title=Super Princess Peach|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=March 2006|page=118}}</ref>\n|GSpot = 7.2/10<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n|GSpy = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"spy\"/>\n|GameZone = 8.8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/super_princess_peach_nds_review|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=David|first=Mike|date=2006-04-12|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref>\n|IGN = 7.8/10<ref name=\"ign\"/>\n|NWR = 8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/4454|title=Super Princess Peach Review|last=Shughart|first=Ty|publisher=Nintendo World Report|date=November 24, 2005|accessdate=2013-10-27}}</ref>\n|ONM = 72%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/2495/reviews/super-princess-peach-review/|title=DS Review: Super Princess Peach|last=East|first=Tom|date=10 January 2008|publisher=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]|accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n|XPlay = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"xplayreview\">{{cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/xplay/reviews/1083/Super-Princess-Peach.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806062646/http://g4tv.com/xplay/reviews/1083/Super-Princess-Peach.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-08-06|title=Review: Super Princess Peach|publisher=[[X-Play]]|access-date=2009-03-18}}</ref>\n|GR = 76.60% (56 reviews)<ref name=\"grreviews\"/>\n|MC = 75% (48 reviews)<ref name=\"mcreviews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/super-princess-peach/critic-reviews|title=Super Princess Peach Critic Reviews for DS|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n}}\n''Super Princess Peach'' received generally positive reviews from critics, it currently has an average rating of 76.60% on [[GameRankings]],<ref name=\"grreviews\">[http://www.gamerankings.com/ds/925562-super-princess-peach/index.html \"Super Princess Peach for DS\"].

It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. ''Save the World'' and ''Battle Royale'' were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles, while ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for all those platforms, and also for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the ''Save the World'' and ''Creative'' versions have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' in particular became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine; each has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is a player-versus-environment [[cooperative game]], with four players collaborating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[Skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a [[sandbox game]] mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, [[Platform game|platforming]] challenges, and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe. Players are encouraged to be very inventive in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although {{as of|lc=y|2019}}, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 |last1=Alwani |first1=Rishi |publisher=Gadgets360 |date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[Video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

Further, Epic was looking to get into the [[games as a service]] model, and brought in Chinese publisher [[Tencent]] to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]], who had been a key part of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s development.

It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. ''Save the World'' and ''Battle Royale'' were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles, while ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for all those platforms, and also for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the ''Save the World'' and ''Creative'' versions have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' in particular became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine; each has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is a player-versus-environment [[cooperative game]], with four players collaborating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[Skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a [[sandbox game]] mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, [[Platform game|platforming]] challenges, and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe. Players are encouraged to be very inventive in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although {{as of|lc=y|2019}}, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 |last1=Alwani |first1=Rishi |publisher=Gadgets360 |date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[Video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

Further, Epic was looking to get into the [[games as a service]] model, and brought in Chinese publisher [[Tencent]] to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]], who had been a key part of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s development.

The sand and hydrogel combination has a lower [[pH]], lower [[ionic strength]], and lower [[Concrete#Curing|curing]] temperatures than a [[Cement#Safety issues|typical concrete mix]], allowing it to serve as a [[growth medium]] for the bacteria. As the bacteria reproduce they spread through the scaffold, and [[Biomineralization|biomineralize]] it with [[calcium carbonate]], which is the main contributor to the overall strength and durability of the material. After mineralization the sand-hydrogel compound is strong enough to be used in construction, as concrete or [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe bacteria in self-replicating concrete react to [[humidity]] changes, and are most active - and reproduce the fastest - in an environment with 100% humidity.\n\nAs the bacteria reproduce their biomineralization activity increases, allowing production capacity to scale exponentially.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Properties ===\n[[File:Fracture_energy.png|thumb|330x330px|The [[Fracture mechanics|fracture energy]] of a living building material compared with two controls: one with no cyanobacteria, and one with no cyanobacteria and a high pH.<ref name=\":2\" />]]\n\nThe structural properties of this material are similar to those of [[Portland cement]]-based mortars: it has an [[elastic modulus]] of 293.9 MPa, and a [[Yield (engineering)|tensile strength]] of 3.6 MPa (the minimum required value for Portland-cement based concrete is approximately 3.5 MPa);<ref name=\":2\" /> however it has a fracture energy of 170 N, which is much less than most standard concrete formulations, which can reach up to several kN.\n\n=== Uses ===\nThis self-replicating concrete can be used in various applications. While cell growth, reproduction, and biomineralization activity are highest at a humidity of 100%, a drop to 50% does not have a large impact on the cellular activity, meaning that this material can be used in most environments. One major factor is how increasing and decreasing the humidity affect the mechanical properties. The cells grow more efficiently in high humidity, but the material is stronger under conditions with low humidity.<ref name=\":2\" /> This means that the application of this material must be tailored to its environment.\n\nThis material can be used in more humid environments as a crack filler on roads, walls and sidewalks. The high humidity will allow the cells to grow, creating more calcium carbonate, strengthening the material, and naturally filling in the crack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.somagnews.com/scientists-produced-self-replicating-materials/|title=Scientists Produced Self-Replicating Materials|last=Kubrick|first=Kaitlyn|date=2020-01-16|website=Somag News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> In drier environments, the self-replicating concrete can be used more structurally, because of the increased strength due to lack of humidity.\n\nAnother large upside to this material pertains to the manufacturing. As long as new sand hydrogel scaffolds are introduced, multiple generations can be made from one sample of this material. This means that the self-replicating concrete can be mass produced on an exponential scale, assuming each generation is able to be cared for and properly maintained. Furthermore, the bacteria used to make this concrete absorbs carbon instead of emitting carbon like most cements, which account for 8% of the world's [[carbon footprint]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rodgers|first=Lucy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46455844|title=The massive CO2 emitter you may not know about|date=2018-12-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-23|language=en-GB}}</ref> This self-replicating concrete material is not meant to replace standard concrete, but to open up a new class of materials, with a mixture of strength, ecological benefits, and biological functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90455726/these-darpa-funded-bricks-can-self-repair-and-replicate|title=These DARPA-funded bricks can self-repair\u2014and replicate|last=Wilson|first=Mark|date=2020-01-27|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n\n== Self-Mending Biocement ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nAdvancements in optimizing methods to use microorganisms to facilitate carbonate precipitation are rapidly developing.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Irfan|first=M.

Once introduced to water, the bacteria will activate and feed on the calcium lactate that was part of the mixture.<ref name=\":11\" /> This feeding process also consumes oxygen which converts the originally water soluble calcium lactate into insoluble limestone. This limestone then solidifies on surface it is lying on, which in this case is the cracked area, thereby sealing the crack up.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nOxygen is one of the main elements that cause corrosion in materials such as metals. When biocement is used in steel reinforced concrete structures, the microorganisms consume the oxygen thereby increasing corrosion resistance.This property also allows for water resistance as it actually induces healing, and reducing overall corrosion.<ref name=\":11\" /> Water concrete aggregates are what are used to prevent corrosion and these also have the ability to be recycled.<ref name=\":11\" /> There are different methods to form these such as through crushing or grinding of the biocement.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe permeability of biocement is also higher compared to normal cement.<ref name=\":8\" /> This is due to the higher porosity of biocement and this can leader to larger crack propagation when exposed to strong enough forces.

[[Fungus]] depends on mycelium to get nutrients from the environment. There are several uses of mycelium composites in the industry because it is economically and [[Sustainability|environmentally sustainable]].

The mycelium and organic substrate needed to incubate properly and this time is crucial as it is the period that these particles interact together and bind into one to form a dense network and hence form a composite. During this incubation period, mycelium uses the essential nutrients such as carbon, minerals, and water from the waste plant product<ref name=\":14\" />. Some of the organic substrate components include cotton, wheat grain, rice husk, sorghum fiber, agricultural waste, sawdust, bread particles, banana peel, coffee residue, etc<ref name=\":15\" />. \u00a0The composites are synthesized and fabricated using different techniques such as adding carbohydrates, altering fermentation conditions, using different fabrication technology, altering post- processing stages, and modifying [[genetics]] or biochemicals to form products with certain properties<ref name=\":6\" />. Fabrication of most of the mycelium composites are by using plastic molds, so the mycelium can be grown directly into the desired shape<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />. \u00a0Other fabrication methods include laminate skin mold, vacuum skin mold, glass mold, plywood mold, wooden mold, petri dish mold, tile mold, etc<ref name=\":15\" />. During fabrication process, it is essential to have sterilized environment, a controlled environment condition of light, temperature (25-35\u00b0C) and humidity around 60-65% for the best results<ref name=\":14\" />. One way to synthesize a mycelium based composite is by mixing different composition ratio of fibers, water and mycelium together and putting in a PVC molds in layers while compressing each layer and letting it incubate for couple of days<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elsacker|first=Elise|last2=Vandelook|first2=Simon|last3=Brancart|first3=Joost|last4=Peeters|first4=Eveline|last5=Laet|first5=Lars De|date=2019-07-22|title=Mechanical, physical and chemical characterisation of mycelium-based composites with different types of lignocellulosic substrates|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0213954|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=14|issue=7|pages=e0213954|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0213954|issn=1932-6203|pmc=PMC6645453|pmid=31329589}}</ref>. Mycelium based composites can be processed in foam, laminate and mycelium sheet by using processing techniques such as laster cutting, cold and heat compression, etc.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />. Mycelium composites tend to absorb water when they are newly fabricated, therefore this property can be changed by oven drying the product<ref name=\":15\" />.\n\n=== Properties ===\nOne of the advantages about using mycelium based composites is that properties can be altered depending on fabrication process and the use of different fungus. Properties depend on type of fungus used and where they are grown<ref name=\":15\" />. Additionally, fungi has an ability to degrade the cellulose component of the plant to make composites in a preferable manner<ref name=\":3\" />. Some important mechanical properties such as compressive strength, morphology, tensile strength, hydrophobicity, and flexural strength can be modified as well for different use of the composite<ref name=\":15\" />. To increase the tensile strength, the composite can go through heat pressing<ref name=\":6\" />. A mycelium composite made out of 75 wt% rice hulls have density of 193 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, while 75 wt% wheat grains has 359 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which shows how different mycelium substance has effect on its property<ref name=\":3\" />. One the methods to increase the density of the composite would be by deleting a hydrophobin gene<ref name=\":15\" />. These composites also have the ability of self fusion which increases their strength<ref name=\":15\" />. Mycelium based composites are usually compact, porous, lightweight and a good insulator. The main property of these composites is that they are entirely natural, therefore sustainable. Other advantage of mycelium based composites is that this substance acts as an insulator, is fireproof, nontoxic, water resistance, rapidly growing, and has an ability to bond with neighboring mycelium products<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://criticalconcrete.com/building-with-mushrooms/|title=Building with Mushrooms|date=2018-04-23|website=Critical Concrete|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>. Mycelium based foams (MBFs) and sandwich components are two common type of the composites<ref name=\":3\" />. MBFs are the most efficient type because of their low density property, high quality, and sustainability<ref name=\":5\" />. The density of MBFs can be decreased by using substrates that are smaller than 2mm in diameter<ref name=\":5\" />. These composites have higher thermal conductivity as well<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n=== Uses ===\nOne of the most common use of mycelium based composites is for the alternatives for petroleum and [[polystyrene]] based materials<ref name=\":15\" />. These synthetic foams are usually used for sustainable design and architecture products. The use of mycelium based composites are based on their properties. There are several bio-sustainable companies such as [[Ecovative Design|Ecovative Design LLC]], [[MycoWorks]], MyCoPlast, etc. that use mycelium based composites that make protective packaging for electronics and food, bricks, leather substitutes, alternatives for floors and acoustic tiles, thermal and acoustic insulation, construction panels, etc<ref name=\":15\" />. The property of being able to bond with neighboring composite helps the mycelium based composite to form strong bonds for a brick which are widely used<ref name=\":4\" />.

The sand and hydrogel combination has a lower [[pH]], lower [[ionic strength]], and lower [[Concrete#Curing|curing]] temperatures than a [[Cement#Safety issues|typical concrete mix]], allowing it to serve as a [[growth medium]] for the bacteria. As the bacteria reproduce they spread through the scaffold, and [[Biomineralization|biomineralize]] it with [[calcium carbonate]], which is the main contributor to the overall strength and durability of the material. After mineralization the sand-hydrogel compound is strong enough to be used in construction, as concrete or [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe bacteria in self-replicating concrete react to [[humidity]] changes, and are most active - and reproduce the fastest - in an environment with 100% humidity.\n\nAs the bacteria reproduce their biomineralization activity increases, allowing production capacity to scale exponentially.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Properties ===\n[[File:Fracture_energy.png|thumb|330x330px|The [[Fracture mechanics|fracture energy]] of a living building material compared with two controls: one with no cyanobacteria, and one with no cyanobacteria and a high pH.<ref name=\":2\" />]]\n\nThe structural properties of this material are similar to those of [[Portland cement]]-based mortars: it has an [[elastic modulus]] of 293.9 MPa, and a [[Yield (engineering)|tensile strength]] of 3.6 MPa (the minimum required value for Portland-cement based concrete is approximately 3.5 MPa);<ref name=\":2\" /> however it has a fracture energy of 170 N, which is much less than most standard concrete formulations, which can reach up to several kN.\n\n=== Uses ===\nThis self-replicating concrete can be used in various applications. While cell growth, reproduction, and biomineralization activity are highest at a humidity of 100%, a drop to 50% does not have a large impact on the cellular activity, meaning that this material can be used in most environments. One major factor is how increasing and decreasing the humidity affect the mechanical properties. The cells grow more efficiently in high humidity, but the material is stronger under conditions with low humidity.<ref name=\":2\" /> This means that the application of this material must be tailored to its environment.\n\nThis material can be used in more humid environments as a crack filler on roads, walls and sidewalks. The high humidity will allow the cells to grow, creating more calcium carbonate, strengthening the material, and naturally filling in the crack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.somagnews.com/scientists-produced-self-replicating-materials/|title=Scientists Produced Self-Replicating Materials|last=Kubrick|first=Kaitlyn|date=2020-01-16|website=Somag News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> In drier environments, the self-replicating concrete can be used more structurally, because of the increased strength due to lack of humidity.\n\nAnother large upside to this material pertains to the manufacturing. As long as new sand hydrogel scaffolds are introduced, multiple generations can be made from one sample of this material. This means that the self-replicating concrete can be mass produced on an exponential scale, assuming each generation is able to be cared for and properly maintained. Furthermore, the bacteria used to make this concrete absorbs carbon instead of emitting carbon like most cements, which account for 8% of the world's [[carbon footprint]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rodgers|first=Lucy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46455844|title=The massive CO2 emitter you may not know about|date=2018-12-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-23|language=en-GB}}</ref> This self-replicating concrete material is not meant to replace standard concrete, but to open up a new class of materials, with a mixture of strength, ecological benefits, and biological functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90455726/these-darpa-funded-bricks-can-self-repair-and-replicate|title=These DARPA-funded bricks can self-repair\u2014and replicate|last=Wilson|first=Mark|date=2020-01-27|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n\n== Self-Mending Biocement ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nAdvancements in optimizing methods to use microorganisms to facilitate carbonate precipitation are rapidly developing.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Irfan|first=M.

Some of the organic substrate components include cotton, wheat grain, rice husk, sorghum fiber, agricultural waste, sawdust, bread particles, banana peel, coffee residue, etc<ref name=\":15\" />. \u00a0The composites are synthesized and fabricated using different techniques such as adding carbohydrates, altering fermentation conditions, using different fabrication technology, altering post- processing stages, and modifying [[genetics]] or biochemicals to form products with certain properties<ref name=\":6\" />. Fabrication of most of the mycelium composites are by using plastic molds, so the mycelium can be grown directly into the desired shape<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />. \u00a0Other fabrication methods include laminate skin mold, vacuum skin mold, glass mold, plywood mold, wooden mold, petri dish mold, tile mold, etc<ref name=\":15\" />. During fabrication process, it is essential to have sterilized environment, a controlled environment condition of light, temperature (25-35\u00b0C) and humidity around 60-65% for the best results<ref name=\":14\" />. One way to synthesize a mycelium based composite is by mixing different composition ratio of fibers, water and mycelium together and putting in a PVC molds in layers while compressing each layer and letting it incubate for couple of days<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elsacker|first=Elise|last2=Vandelook|first2=Simon|last3=Brancart|first3=Joost|last4=Peeters|first4=Eveline|last5=Laet|first5=Lars De|date=2019-07-22|title=Mechanical, physical and chemical characterisation of mycelium-based composites with different types of lignocellulosic substrates|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0213954|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=14|issue=7|pages=e0213954|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0213954|issn=1932-6203|pmc=PMC6645453|pmid=31329589}}</ref>. Mycelium based composites can be processed in foam, laminate and mycelium sheet by using processing techniques such as laster cutting, cold and heat compression, etc.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />. Mycelium composites tend to absorb water when they are newly fabricated, therefore this property can be changed by oven drying the product<ref name=\":15\" />.\n\n=== Properties ===\nOne of the advantages about using mycelium based composites is that properties can be altered depending on fabrication process and the use of different fungus. Properties depend on type of fungus used and where they are grown<ref name=\":15\" />. Additionally, fungi has an ability to degrade the cellulose component of the plant to make composites in a preferable manner<ref name=\":3\" />. Some important mechanical properties such as compressive strength, morphology, tensile strength, hydrophobicity, and flexural strength can be modified as well for different use of the composite<ref name=\":15\" />. To increase the tensile strength, the composite can go through heat pressing<ref name=\":6\" />. A mycelium composite made out of 75 wt% rice hulls have density of 193 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, while 75 wt% wheat grains has 359 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which shows how different mycelium substance has effect on its property<ref name=\":3\" />. One the methods to increase the density of the composite would be by deleting a hydrophobin gene<ref name=\":15\" />. These composites also have the ability of self fusion which increases their strength<ref name=\":15\" />. Mycelium based composites are usually compact, porous, lightweight and a good insulator. The main property of these composites is that they are entirely natural, therefore sustainable. Other advantage of mycelium based composites is that this substance acts as an insulator, is fireproof, nontoxic, water resistance, rapidly growing, and has an ability to bond with neighboring mycelium products<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://criticalconcrete.com/building-with-mushrooms/|title=Building with Mushrooms|date=2018-04-23|website=Critical Concrete|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>. Mycelium based foams (MBFs) and sandwich components are two common type of the composites<ref name=\":3\" />. MBFs are the most efficient type because of their low density property, high quality, and sustainability<ref name=\":5\" />. The density of MBFs can be decreased by using substrates that are smaller than 2mm in diameter<ref name=\":5\" />. These composites have higher thermal conductivity as well<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n=== Uses ===\nOne of the most common use of mycelium based composites is for the alternatives for petroleum and [[polystyrene]] based materials<ref name=\":15\" />. These synthetic foams are usually used for sustainable design and architecture products. The use of mycelium based composites are based on their properties. There are several bio-sustainable companies such as [[Ecovative Design|Ecovative Design LLC]], [[MycoWorks]], MyCoPlast, etc. that use mycelium based composites that make protective packaging for electronics and food, bricks, leather substitutes, alternatives for floors and acoustic tiles, thermal and acoustic insulation, construction panels, etc<ref name=\":15\" />. The property of being able to bond with neighboring composite helps the mycelium based composite to form strong bonds for a brick which are widely used<ref name=\":4\" />. There is a 40 foot tall tower in MoMa PS1 at New York City, Hy-Fi made using 1000 bricks made from corn stalks and mycelium<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stinson|first=Liz|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/07/a-40-foot-tower-made-of-fungus-and-corn-stalks/|title=A 40-Foot Tower Made of Living Fungus Bricks|date=2014-07-08|work=Wired|access-date=2020-04-16|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>.

There are also other several commonly used products such as lamps, kitchen utensils, ceiling panels, decorative items, fashion items, chair, etc made out of mycelium<ref name=\":4\" />. In architecture, mycelium based composites are widely used because they have better insulation performance and fire resistance than currently used products<ref name=\":15\" />. Mycelium is being used more in industry to replace common plastic materials that are harming the environment. These products are manufactured using low energy, natural manufacturing process and are biodegradable<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Mitchell|last2=Mautner|first2=Andreas|last3=Luenco|first3=Stefano|last4=Bismarck|first4=Alexander|last5=John|first5=Sabu|date=2020-02-01|title=Engineered mycelium composite construction materials from fungal biorefineries: A critical review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264127519308354|journal=Materials & Design|language=en|volume=187|pages=108397|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2019.108397|issn=0264-1275}}</ref>. \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Construction]]\n[[Category:Materials stubs]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed cite error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_building_material"}
