D. Salinger]]'s 1951 novel ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. Since the book's publication, Holden has become an icon for teenage [[rebellion]] and [[angst]], and is considered among the most important characters of 20th-century American literature. The name Holden Caulfield was used in an unpublished short story written in 1941 and first appeared in print in 1945.\n\nAlthough it has been conjectured that J. D. Salinger got the name for Holden Caulfield in ''The Catcher in the Rye'' when he saw a marquee for the 1947 film ''[[Dear Ruth (film)|Dear Ruth]]'', starring [[William Holden]] and [[Joan Caulfield]],<ref>Saturday Evening Post, July 15, 1944</ref> Salinger's first Holden Caulfield story, \"[[I'm Crazy]]\", appeared in ''[[Collier's]]'' on December 22, 1945, a year and a half before this movie was released.\n\n==Explanation of teenage narrative==\nHolden is naive and at the same time resentful of the adult world.<ref>[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/catcher-in-the-rye/character-analysis/holden-caufield.html Cliffs Notes: The Catcher in the Rye - Character Analysis: Holden Caulfield. Accessed 15 February 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217165614/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/catcher-in-the-rye/character-analysis/holden-caufield.html |date=17 February 2013 }}</ref> One of Holden's most striking and quintessential qualities is his powerful revulsion for \"phony\" qualities, a catch-all term for the perceived hypocrisy that irritates Holden. It is this [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] that causes him to distance himself from other people despite wanting connection as well. Holden is very much a character of contradiction; at seventeen years of age, he is six feet two-and-a-half inches (189&nbsp;cm) tall, and already has some grey hair \u2013 though he himself admits that he sometimes acts more like a 13-year-old than an adult. He continually fails classes yet is thought of as a \"hot shot\" by his English teacher, with an obvious flair for writing.\n\n==In ''The Catcher in the Rye''==\nHolden Caulfield is the narrator and main character of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. The novel recounts Holden's week in New York City during [[school holiday|Christmas break]], circa 1948/49, following his expulsion from Pencey Prep, a preparatory school in [[Pennsylvania]] based loosely on Salinger's alma mater [[Valley Forge Military Academy]]. Holden Caulfield tells his story with surprising honesty from a hospital in California in a cynical and jaded language.\n\n==In other works==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nThe character, as Holden Caulfield, appears in Salinger's \"[[Slight Rebellion off Madison]]\", published in the December 21, 1946, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''. An earlier version of this story, titled \"Are You Banging Your Head Against a Wall?\" was accepted for publication by ''The New Yorker'' in October 1941, but was not published then because editors found the tone to be too desolate for its readership. An edited version of this short story later became the basis of several chapters in the middle-late section of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' dealing with Caulfield's date with Sally Hayes, during which he confesses his desire to run away with her, meets Carl Luce for drinks, and makes a drunken phone call to the Hayes' home. Unlike the similar sequence in the novel, Caulfield is on a [[Christmas]] break from school, and, in the story, the interlude with Sally is split into two occurrences. Also, the meeting with Carl Luce is considerably briefer in the story than in the novel.\n\nCaulfield also figures as a character in the short story \"[[I'm Crazy]]\", published in ''Colliers'' (December 22, 1945), and other members of the Caulfield family are featured in \"[[Last Day of the Last Furlough]]\", published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' (July 15, 1944) and the unpublished short stories \"[[The Last and Best of the Peter Pans]]\" (c. 1942) and \"[[The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls]]\" (c. 1945). \"I'm Crazy\" is closely related to the first chapter of ''The Catcher in the Rye''. It begins with Caulfield standing on a hill at Pencey Prep watching a football game below, and develops as Holden visits with his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, for a talk about his expulsion from school and his future. Several other details match those found in the first chapter of ''Catcher'', including a reference to the mother of one of Caulfield's schoolmates and to his own mother sending him a gift of ice skates, but the story ends with his returning home instead of running away from school. Once home, he is not shown confronting his parents, who, according to the maid, are playing bridge. Instead, he goes to speak to Phoebe. Their dialogue is similar to that which appears in the later chapters of ''The Catcher in the Rye''. The other notable feature of the story is that his sister Viola gets her first, and only, mention in the Caulfield saga.\n\n\"[[This Sandwich Has No Mayonnaise]]\" (''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', 1945) has a mention of Holden missing in action during the war.\n\n[[Green Day]] wrote a song titled \"Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?\" for their second studio album ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1992) after lead singer and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] read ''The Catcher in the Rye''. Initially, he gave up on reading it after dropping out from [[Pinole Valley High School]] when he was 18 years old.\n\n==Caulfield family in other works==\n\n\"Last Day of the Last Furlough\" relates the final day of Babe Gladwaller before he leaves to fight in [[World War II]]. Gladwaller spends part of the day with his little sister before Vincent Caulfield (later renamed D.B. in the novel) arrives. At that point Vincent is a fellow soldier about to leave for the war. Vincent announces that his brother, Holden, has been declared missing in action. Gladwaller's relationship with his younger sister can be seen as a parallel to Caulfield's relationship with Phoebe.\n\n\"The Last and Best of the Peter Pans\" relates the story of Vincent's (D.B.) [[conscription|draft]] questionnaire being hidden by his mother. The events occur just after the death of Kenneth (later renamed Allie) and reveal the anxiety of Mary Moriarity, an actress and Caulfield's mother. The story is notable for the appearance of Phoebe and Vincent's statements about a child crawling off a cliff.\n\nIn \"The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls\", Vincent (D.B.) recalls the day his brother Kenneth (Allie) died. The story is set at the Caulfield summer home on [[Cape Cod]]. Several details make their way from this story into ''Catcher'', including the characterization of Allie; Allie's poetry-inscribed left-handed baseball mitt; Vincent's girlfriend, Helen, who keeps her kings in the back row (like Jane Gallagher); and Caulfield's critical view of others. While the cause of death in ''Catcher'' is [[leukemia]], here it is due to an unspecified heart condition. Toward the end of the story, Kenneth and Vincent are on the beach. Kenneth decides to go swimming and is knocked out by a wave. Holden, just home from camp, is waiting on the porch with his suitcases as Vincent comes back with Kenneth's unconscious body. Kenneth dies later the same night. The story was reportedly sold to a magazine, only to be taken back by Salinger before publication.\n\nAnother short story of note with relationship to Caulfield is \"The Boy in the People Shooting Hat\", which was submitted to ''The New Yorker'' sometime between 1948 and 1949 but was never published. It focuses on a fight between two characters named Bobby and Stradlater over Bobby's feelings about Jane Gallagher. This story appears to form the basis for several key scenes in the first several chapters of ''The Catcher in the Rye''.\n\nIn ''[[Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction#Seymour: An Introduction|Seymour: An Introduction]]'' a Curtis Caulfield is mentioned in passing as \"an exceptionally intelligent and likable boy\" who appeared on the same radio show as Seymour and the other [[Glass family|Glass children]]. He is reportedly \"killed during one of the landings in the Pacific\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Salinger|first=J. D.|title=Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters; and Seymour: an introduction|year=2001|publisher=Back Bay books|location=Boston|isbn=0-316-76694-1|pages=225|edition=1st Back Bay paperback}}</ref>\n\nIn \"The Stranger\", published in ''Collier's'' December 1, 1945, Babe Gladwaller and his sister Mattie (a proto-type for Phoebe) visit Vincent Caulfield's former girlfriend, now married, to tell her about his death and deliver a poem he wrote about her.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nHolden Caulfield is one of the most enduring characters in 20th-century American fiction. It has been suggested that Salinger himself related so closely to Holden that he was protective of the character. This was the reason he was unwilling to allow filming of the book or use of the character by other writers.<ref>[http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/10/everybody-still-wants-piece-holden-caulfield/58012/ \"Holden Caulfield, It's Time We Let Go\", ''Atlantic Wire'', October 16, 2012.

Salinger got the name for Holden Caulfield in ''The Catcher in the Rye'' when he saw a marquee for the 1947 film ''[[Dear Ruth (film)|Dear Ruth]]'', starring [[William Holden]] and [[Joan Caulfield]],<ref>Saturday Evening Post, July 15, 1944</ref> Salinger's first Holden Caulfield story, \"[[I'm Crazy]]\", appeared in ''[[Collier's]]'' on December 22, 1945, a year and a half before this movie was released.\n\n==Explanation of teenage narrative==\nHolden is naive and at the same time resentful of the adult world.<ref>[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/catcher-in-the-rye/character-analysis/holden-caufield.html Cliffs Notes: The Catcher in the Rye - Character Analysis: Holden Caulfield. Accessed 15 February 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217165614/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/catcher-in-the-rye/character-analysis/holden-caufield.html |date=17 February 2013 }}</ref> One of Holden's most striking and quintessential qualities is his powerful revulsion for \"phony\" qualities, a catch-all term for the perceived hypocrisy that irritates Holden. It is this [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] that causes him to distance himself from other people despite wanting connection as well. Holden is very much a character of contradiction; at seventeen years of age, he is six feet two-and-a-half inches (189&nbsp;cm) tall, and already has some grey hair \u2013 though he himself admits that he sometimes acts more like a 13-year-old than an adult. He continually fails classes yet is thought of as a \"hot shot\" by his English teacher, with an obvious flair for writing.\n\n==In ''The Catcher in the Rye''==\nHolden Caulfield is the narrator and main character of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. The novel recounts Holden's week in New York City during [[school holiday|Christmas break]], circa 1948/49, following his expulsion from Pencey Prep, a preparatory school in [[Pennsylvania]] based loosely on Salinger's alma mater [[Valley Forge Military Academy]]. Holden Caulfield tells his story with surprising honesty from a hospital in California in a cynical and jaded language.\n\n==In other works==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nThe character, as Holden Caulfield, appears in Salinger's \"[[Slight Rebellion off Madison]]\", published in the December 21, 1946, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''. An earlier version of this story, titled \"Are You Banging Your Head Against a Wall?\" was accepted for publication by ''The New Yorker'' in October 1941, but was not published then because editors found the tone to be too desolate for its readership. An edited version of this short story later became the basis of several chapters in the middle-late section of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' dealing with Caulfield's date with Sally Hayes, during which he confesses his desire to run away with her, meets Carl Luce for drinks, and makes a drunken phone call to the Hayes' home. Unlike the similar sequence in the novel, Caulfield is on a [[Christmas]] break from school, and, in the story, the interlude with Sally is split into two occurrences. Also, the meeting with Carl Luce is considerably briefer in the story than in the novel.\n\nCaulfield also figures as a character in the short story \"[[I'm Crazy]]\", published in ''Colliers'' (December 22, 1945), and other members of the Caulfield family are featured in \"[[Last Day of the Last Furlough]]\", published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' (July 15, 1944) and the unpublished short stories \"[[The Last and Best of the Peter Pans]]\" (c. 1942) and \"[[The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls]]\" (c. 1945). \"I'm Crazy\" is closely related to the first chapter of ''The Catcher in the Rye''. It begins with Caulfield standing on a hill at Pencey Prep watching a football game below, and develops as Holden visits with his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, for a talk about his expulsion from school and his future. Several other details match those found in the first chapter of ''Catcher'', including a reference to the mother of one of Caulfield's schoolmates and to his own mother sending him a gift of ice skates, but the story ends with his returning home instead of running away from school. Once home, he is not shown confronting his parents, who, according to the maid, are playing bridge. Instead, he goes to speak to Phoebe. Their dialogue is similar to that which appears in the later chapters of ''The Catcher in the Rye''. The other notable feature of the story is that his sister Viola gets her first, and only, mention in the Caulfield saga.\n\n\"[[This Sandwich Has No Mayonnaise]]\" (''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', 1945) has a mention of Holden missing in action during the war.\n\n[[Green Day]] wrote a song titled \"Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?\" for their second studio album ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1992) after lead singer and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] read ''The Catcher in the Rye''. Initially, he gave up on reading it after dropping out from [[Pinole Valley High School]] when he was 18 years old.\n\n==Caulfield family in other works==\n\n\"Last Day of the Last Furlough\" relates the final day of Babe Gladwaller before he leaves to fight in [[World War II]]. Gladwaller spends part of the day with his little sister before Vincent Caulfield (later renamed D.B. in the novel) arrives. At that point Vincent is a fellow soldier about to leave for the war. Vincent announces that his brother, Holden, has been declared missing in action. Gladwaller's relationship with his younger sister can be seen as a parallel to Caulfield's relationship with Phoebe.\n\n\"The Last and Best of the Peter Pans\" relates the story of Vincent's (D.B.) [[conscription|draft]] questionnaire being hidden by his mother. The events occur just after the death of Kenneth (later renamed Allie) and reveal the anxiety of Mary Moriarity, an actress and Caulfield's mother. The story is notable for the appearance of Phoebe and Vincent's statements about a child crawling off a cliff.\n\nIn \"The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls\", Vincent (D.B.) recalls the day his brother Kenneth (Allie) died. The story is set at the Caulfield summer home on [[Cape Cod]]. Several details make their way from this story into ''Catcher'', including the characterization of Allie; Allie's poetry-inscribed left-handed baseball mitt; Vincent's girlfriend, Helen, who keeps her kings in the back row (like Jane Gallagher); and Caulfield's critical view of others. While the cause of death in ''Catcher'' is [[leukemia]], here it is due to an unspecified heart condition. Toward the end of the story, Kenneth and Vincent are on the beach. Kenneth decides to go swimming and is knocked out by a wave. Holden, just home from camp, is waiting on the porch with his suitcases as Vincent comes back with Kenneth's unconscious body. Kenneth dies later the same night. The story was reportedly sold to a magazine, only to be taken back by Salinger before publication.\n\nAnother short story of note with relationship to Caulfield is \"The Boy in the People Shooting Hat\", which was submitted to ''The New Yorker'' sometime between 1948 and 1949 but was never published. It focuses on a fight between two characters named Bobby and Stradlater over Bobby's feelings about Jane Gallagher. This story appears to form the basis for several key scenes in the first several chapters of ''The Catcher in the Rye''.\n\nIn ''[[Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction#Seymour: An Introduction|Seymour: An Introduction]]'' a Curtis Caulfield is mentioned in passing as \"an exceptionally intelligent and likable boy\" who appeared on the same radio show as Seymour and the other [[Glass family|Glass children]]. He is reportedly \"killed during one of the landings in the Pacific\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Salinger|first=J.

It has been suggested that Salinger himself related so closely to Holden that he was protective of the character. This was the reason he was unwilling to allow filming of the book or use of the character by other writers.<ref>[http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/10/everybody-still-wants-piece-holden-caulfield/58012/ \"Holden Caulfield, It's Time We Let Go\", ''Atlantic Wire'', October 16, 2012.

The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]''.

The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm \"Grad Named Head of ''People en Espa\u00f1ol''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103091825/http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm |date=January 3, 2005 }}.

The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].\n\n===VFL entry: 1897\u20131909===\nSouth Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.\n\n===Premiership success: 1909\u20131945===\nThe club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933.  The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne's \"Foreign Legion\".<ref>The caricature at the foot of [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/149547747/17704724 page 10 of ''Table Talk'' (22 June 1933)] was created by Richard \"Dick\" Ovenden (1897\u20131972).

Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.<ref>Shaw, I.W. (2006) ''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a [[Herald and Weekly Times]] artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the [[black swan]] being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|date=24 January 1934|location=Melbourne|title=Real story behind South Melbourne's football premiership|page=7|author=J. M. Rohan}}</ref> The name stuck, in part due to the club's association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its [[swan]]s (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).\n\nAfter several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as \"the Bloodbath\", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.\n\n===Struggling times: 1946\u20131981===\nIn the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] failed to help, as the [[Riverina Football League]] proved to be one of the least profitable zones.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they \"won\" three [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]]. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.\n\n==Sydney history==\n{{recentism|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Early years in Sydney: 1982\u20131987===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the [[Fitzroy Lions]] staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. The club had been operating at a loss of at least $150,000 for the previous five years. News of the proposal broke on 2 July 1981, after which a letter was sent to members outlining the board's reasons for making the proposal and noting that the coach and current players were in favour of the move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2019-07-02/on-this-day-swans-move-to-sydney|title=On This Day: Swans move to Sydney|website=sydneyswans.com.au|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.\n\nThe move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South at South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|title=VFL 'no' sends South to Sydney|author=Mike Coward|date=15 October 1981|page=32}}</ref> The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|page=40|author=Geoff Slattery|date=7 November 1981|title=South Players on strike}}</ref> The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.<ref name=\"saga\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Roar|title=Revisiting the South Melbourne to Sydney saga|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/07/06/the-south-to-sydney-saga/|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1982 Escort Championships|1982 Escort Championships Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Swa}}|| '''13''' ||'''12''' ||'''90'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Nor}} || 8 || 10 || 58\n|-\n| Venue: [[Waverley Park]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 20,028\n|}\n\nUpon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name \"South Melbourne\" in June 1982, becoming known as simply \"the Swans\" for the rest of that season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|location=Melbourne|first=Peter|last=Simunovich|title=The Swans \u2013 officially|date=3 June 1982|page=67}}</ref> It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.<ref name=\"saga\" /> Its physical \"home club\" was the \"Southern Cross Social Club\" at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]\n\nOn 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be [[Australian dollar|$]]6.3&nbsp;million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten]] \"bought\" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9&nbsp;million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong's contracts to recruit [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref> The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', p. 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref>\n\nDuring the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field \u2013 all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans\u2019 successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the \"Swanettes\", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no club has had cheerleaders since then.\n\nIn 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992.<ref>[[1992 AFL season]]</ref> However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.\n\n===Dark times: 1988\u20131994===\nThe club's form was to slump in the following year.\n\nLosses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willesee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.\n\nMorale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128</ref> Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).\n\nCapper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club's finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney's goalkicking was led by [[Bernard Toohey]] (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Barry Mitchell (footballer)|Barry Mitchell]]. The careers of stars such as [[Dennis Carroll]], [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Ian Roberts (footballer)|Ian Roberts]], [[Tony Morwood]] and [[David Murphy (Australian rules footballer)|David Murphy]] wound down,<ref>Cowley, Michael (19 October 2009) [http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/gen-next-must-fly-for-swans-as-wily-old-birds-go-20091124-j2aa.html Gen Next must fly for Swans as wily old birds go]</ref> while promising young players like [[Jamie Lawson (Australian footballer)|Jamie Lawson]], [[Robert Teal]] and [[Paul Bryce]] had their careers cut short by injury.\n\nAttendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994. The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.\n\nThe AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.\n\nDuring this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Kelly]].\n\nDesperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.\n\n===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995\u20132001===\nA big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony \"Plugger\" Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the dominant rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.\n\n1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won eight games \u2013 as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined \u2013 and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1996 AFL season|1996 AFL Home & Away Season]]'' || ''W'' || ''L'' || ''D'' ||''Total'' || ''%''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''16''' || '''5''' || '''1''' || '''66''' || '''123.9'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=9 | ''Minor Premiers''\n|}\n\nFormer Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].\n\nThe Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL StK}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].\n\nThe 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.\n\nAfter missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Colonial Stadium]].\n\n===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002\u20132004===\nFormer Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumors that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with [[Terry Wallace]].\n\nRoos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.\n\nA new home ground in [[ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against {{AFL Ess}} attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.\n\n2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended {{AFL StK}}'s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for [[Leo Barry]]'s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Fraser Gehrig]], whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.\n\nSydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL StK}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.\n\n===Premiership glory: 2005===\n{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}\n{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}\nIn 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO [[Andrew Demetriou]], for their unorthodox, \"boring\" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]] maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=35%\n|align=right\n|quote=Nick Davis!

In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth Premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[2005 AFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''8''' || '''10''' || '''58'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[West Coast Eagles]] || 7  || 12 || 54\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 91,898\n|}\n\nOn Friday, 30 September 2005, a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city.

Having qualified for the finals for a sixth consecutive season, the Swans defeated {{AFL Nor}} in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] the following week.\n\n2009 saw the club register only eight victories as they failed to reach the finals for the first time since 2002, finishing 12th with a percentage of below 100% for the first time since 1994. [[Barry Hall]], [[Leo Barry]], [[Jared Crouch]], [[Michael O'Loughlin]], [[Amon Buchanan]] and [[Darren Jolly]] all departed at the conclusion of the season, with [[Mark Seaby]], [[Daniel Bradshaw]] and [[Shane Mumford]], among others, joining the club during the trade period.\n\nThe 2010 season saw Sydney return to the finals by virtue of a fifth-place finish at the end of the regular season. The club defeated {{AFL Car}} by five points in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons.

He led the club to a seventh-place finish at the end of the regular season, therefore qualifying for the finals for the 13th time in the past 16 seasons. The Swans defeated {{AFL StK}} in an elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium]] before losing to {{AFL Haw}} in the semi-finals the following week.\n\nIt was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] on its home ground, [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Skilled Stadium]], where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]] during the regular season. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain [[Jarrad McVeigh]]'s baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match.\n\n[[File:Sydney Swans banner.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Swans players run through the banner before the inaugural Sydney Derby on 24 March 2012.]]\nThe 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers {{AFL GWS}}. After an even and physical first half, Sydney went on to win by 63 points. Subsequent wins over {{AFL Fre}}, {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL Nor}} and {{AFL Haw}} saw the Swans sit second behind {{AFL WC}} on percentage after Round 5, but the Swans would proceed to lose three of their next four matches before embarking on a nine-match winning streak between Rounds 10 and 19 inclusive. The Swans eventually finished the regular season in third place after losing three of their final four matches, all against their fellow top-four rivals (Collingwood, Hawthorn and Geelong in Rounds 20, 22 and 23 respectively).\n\nThe Swans defeated {{AFL Ade}} by 29 points in their qualifying final at [[AAMI Stadium]], thus earning a week off and a home preliminary final, where they then defeated {{AFL Col}} by 26 points to qualify for their first grand final since 2006, ending an eleven-match losing streak against the Magpies in the process.\n\nIn the grand final, the Swans defeated Hawthorn [[2012 AFL Grand Final|by ten points]] in front of 99,683 people at the MCG, with [[Nick Malceski]] kicking a snap goal with 34 seconds left to seal the Swans' fifth premiership and first since 2005.

Sydney lost their first game against {{AFL GWS}} and then to Collingwood before becoming the first non-South Australian team to win at [[Adelaide Oval]] defeating Adelaide by 63 points with Lance Franklin and Luke Parker kicking 4 goals each. After a loss to North Melbourne in Round 4, the Swans' won twelve games in a row, including victories against 2013 grand finalists Fremantle and Hawthorn, Geelong by 110 points at the SCG and then ladder leaders Port Adelaide. In Round 17, the Swans defeated Carlton to match a winning streak set three times in club history, the last of which came way back in 1935,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenewdaily.com.au/sport/2014/07/12/dozen-unstoppable-sydney-swans/|title=Dozen up for unstoppable Swans \u2013 The New Daily|date=12 July 2014|publisher=}}</ref> and eventually closed out the season with their first minor premiership in 18 years and a club record 17 wins for the season, eclipsing the previous highest of 16, which was achieved on six past occasions in 2012, 1996, 1986, 1945, 1936 and 1935. In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the [[2014 AFL Grand Final]]. They defeated [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against [[North Melbourne Kangaroos|North Melbourne]], which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The [[2014 AFL Grand Final]] was played on Saturday 27 September 2014 in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player [[Lance Franklin]] would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137). The 63-point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season, meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history.\n\nThe Swans started the 2015 AFL season well, winning their first three, before losing their next 2 games against [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], where they trailed by as many as 8 goals before half-time, and the [[Western Bulldogs]]. They won their next 6 leading into the bye, including home wins against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], and an upset away win against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the grand final replay. The Swans lost their first game after the bye, their 3rd of the season to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at the SCG, 11.11 (77) to 14.11. (95). The Swans rebounded with unconvincing wins against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane Lions Football Club|Brisbane Lions]], before suffering their heaviest defeat for 17 seasons against the [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawks]] by 89 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/biggest-loss-in-17-years-a-humiliation-for-swans-says-luke-parker-20150719-gifoiw.html|title=Biggest loss in 17 years a humiliation for Swans, says Luke Parker|first=Sebastian|last=Hassett|date=19 July 2015|website=The Age}}</ref> The following week was no better with a road trip to Perth and another loss, this time to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]] by 52 points, the scoreline ultimately flattering the Swans. The Swans bounced back against Adelaide with a convincing win 52-point win, but lost their next game to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Simmonds stadium]]; a close affair that Geelong blew apart in the 3rd quarter. The Swans won their final 4 games to secure a top 4 finish, against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], {{AFL GWS}}, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and {{AFL GCS}}.\n\nThe Swans faced minor premiers [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] in the first qualifying final, their first finals match without Franklin, who had withdrawn from the finals due to illness.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-08/star-swan-franklin-out-of-final-against-freo-with-ongoing-mental-health-condition], AFL.com.au official website, 8 September 2015</ref> Ultimately the Swans would go down in a low scoring affair, effectively kicking themselves out of the game after losing [[Sam Reid (Australian footballer born 1991)|Sam Reid]] to a hamstring injury midway through the 2nd quarter.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/video-sam-reid-subbed-out-of-sydneys-qualifying-final-with-fremantle-with-hamstring-injury/story-e6frf3e3-1227524180065], Fox Sports, 12 September 2015</ref> The following week the Swans were knocked out of the finals in a one-sided contest against [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], struggling to score throughout the first half with the game effectively over by half-time. For the first time since 2011, the Swans failed to make a preliminary final.\n\nThe Swans' continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a [[salary cap]] concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/salary-cap-gave-swans-the-flag-say-hawks/story-e6frexx0-1226497327257|title=Hawks and Crows critical of Swans' salary cap \u2013 thetelegraph.com.au|publisher=|date=16 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/afl-turns-up-heat-on-sydneys-cost-of-living-allowance/story-e6frexwr-1226497138805|title=Dailytelegraph.com.au \u2013 Subscribe to The Daily Telegraph for exclusive stories|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au}}</ref> It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-03-04/afl-to-scrap-cola AFL to scrap COLA], AFL.com.au official website, 4 March 2014</ref> The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000).<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-01-21/swans-ok-to-trade-afl], AFL.com.au official website, 21 January 2015</ref> During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-08-14/swans-chairman-calls-for-trade-ban-to-be-banished], AFL.com.au official website, 14 August 2015</ref> In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA,<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-players-association-joins-fight-over-sydney-swans-trading-ban-20150820-gj4504.html], ''The Age'', 20 August 2015</ref> the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for [[Callum Sinclair]] in a swap deal,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-14/eagles-swans-agree-to-straight-sinclairjetta-swap], AFL.com.au official website, 14 October 2015</ref> as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, [[Michael Talia]] from the Western Bulldogs.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-trade-period-2015-former-bulldog-michael-talia-moves-to-swans-in-lastminute-trade-deal-20151022-gkfzhi.html], ''The Age'', 22 October 2015</ref>\n\nThe Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], with new Swans recruit [[Michael Talia]] suffering a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit [[Callum Sinclair]] kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with [[Lance Franklin]] kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, [[Isaac Heeney]] starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain [[Kieren Jack]] and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.\n\nAhead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant [[Jeremy Cameron]] outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the [[Adelaide Crows]] by 6 goals, with Franklin and [[Tom Papley]] kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the [[Geelong Cats]] at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.\n\nThe Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0\u20136. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.\n\nThe Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether. However three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the Elimination Final.\n\nThe Swans' golden era of finals appearances came to an end in 2019. They missed the finals for the first time in a decade, finishing 15th on the ladder with eight wins and 14 losses. They started the season poorly with just one win in their first seven matches, although they would briefly recover after winning five of the next seven games. Six losses on the trot ended any chance of a tenth consecutive finals appearance, but strong wins over also-rans Melbourne and St Kilda in the final two rounds ensured the season ended on a positive note.\n\nThey won their first match of the interrupted 2020 season against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval by three points.\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Guernsey===\nThe jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red \"V\" on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club's major sponsor is [[QBE Insurance]]. In 2004 the club added the initials 'SMFC' in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club's past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans. The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the [[Brisbane Lions]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]]) and cross town rivals [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] are the only clubs with which there is a clash.<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2012-10-31/swans-2013-fixture-released Swans 2013 fixture released], Sydney Swans official website, 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] have manufactured the Swans' apparel since [[2010 AFL season|2010]], replacing long-time sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104222641/http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-11-04|title=ISC 2018 COMING SOON|website=www.isc-sports.com.au}}</ref>\n\n====Uniform evolution====\nSince the club was called \"South Melbourne\", the team has worn different designs with the traditional red and white colors, as follows:<ref>[https://www.footyjumpers.com/seasons.htm VFL Uniforms by season (since 1897)] on FootyJumpers.com</ref>\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_white|body= 002D62 |shorts= 002D62|socks= 002D62|title= 1874\u20131879}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000 |shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1880-1904}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _3whitestripes|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1905\u201306}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redrightsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1907-11 & 13-31}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redleftsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1912}}\n|}\n{|\n|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= |pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= |socks= ffffff|title= 1920-1922}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1932\u201374}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= ff0000|socks= ffffff|title= 1975\u201386}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= ff0000|title= 1987\u20132005}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= _hoops_red |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= |title= 2006\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Song===\nThe club song is known as ''Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White''' and is to the tune of the ''[[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]]'', the fight song of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in South Bend, Indiana, USA, which was written by [[University of Notre Dame]] graduates and brothers Rev. Michael J. Shea and John F. Shea. In 1961, the school and other musical houses granted South Melbourne a copyright to adapt the ''Victory March'' into the new club song, which replaced an adaptation of ''[[Springtime in the Rockies (1937 film)|Springtime in the Rockies]]'' by [[Gene Autry]].<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/club/our-club/club-song Sydney Swans Club Song] SydneySwans.com.au</ref> Port Adelaide also has used the ''Victory March'' as the basis for their club song since 1971, though their senior team changed their club song to their current original ''Power To Win'' after their entry into the AFL.\n\nGeorge Gershwin's ''[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]'' (1919) was used by the club in marketing promotions during the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Swans mascot.jpg|thumb|Syd 'Swannie' Skilton, Sydney Swans Mascot Manor mascot]]The Sydney Swans' mascot for the [[Mascot Manor|AFL's Mascot Manor]] is Syd 'Swannie' Skilton.\nHe is named after Swans legend [[Bob Skilton]].

The rivalry grew in 2013, when Hawthorn forward Lance Franklin transferred to the Swans as a free agent on a nine-year, $10&nbsp;million deal. In 2014, the Swans finished minor premiers and were favourites to win the grand final, however Hawthorn beat Sydney by 63 points.

Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the [[Sydney AFL]] competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the [[AFL Canberra]] competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the [[Brisbane Lions]], [[Gold Coast Suns]] and [[GWS Giants]]. The team plays home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.\n\nIn [[2011 NEAFL season|2011]] the Swans reserves finished the home and away season with the Eastern Conference minor premiership. In the Eastern Conference grand final [[Ainslie Football Club|Ainslie]] caused a major upset when they defeated the Swans by 52 points. The team suffered the same fate in [[2012 NEAFL season|2012]] when [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] defeated them by 30 points in the Eastern Conference grand final. The Swans reserves would then go on to play in an astonishing five losing NEAFL grand finals; 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Premierships (4)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[2005 AFL Canberra season|2005]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''12.8 (80) \u2013 8.15 (63)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2006 AFL Canberra season|2006]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''10.16 (76) \u2013 6.7 (43)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2007 AFL Canberra season|2007]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] || '''18.14 (122) \u2013 14.10 (94)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2008 AFL Canberra season|2008]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''11.4 (70) \u2013 9.15 (69)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Runners-up (9)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[1927 VFL season|1927]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] || '''11.9 (75) \u2013 12.22 (94)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1956 VFL season|1956]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''10.12 (72) \u2013 16.14 (110)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1980 VFL season|1980]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] || '''19.12 (126) \u2013 24.15 (159)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n|1995\n|AFL Reserves\n|North Melbourne\n|'''13.16 (94) - 11.14 (80)'''\n|MCG\n|-\n| [[2013 NEAFL season|2013]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.13 (73) \u2013 12.9 (81)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2014 NEAFL season|2014]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Aspley Australian Football Club|Aspley Hornets]] || '''15.10 (100) \u2013 15.12 (102)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2016 NEAFL season|2016]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club|WSU Giants]] || '''11.12 (78) \u2013 11.16 (82)''' || [[Blacktown International Sportspark]]\n|-\n| [[2017 NEAFL season|2017]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.22 (82) \u2013 12.13 (85)''' || [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n|-\n| [[2018 NEAFL season|2018]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| Southport {{ref label|1|b}}||'''14.6 (90) \u2013  5.5 (35)''' || [[Fankhauser Reserve]]\n|}\n{{note label|1|a}} Competed as South Melbourne.\n\n{{ref label|1|b}} In the final quarter with Southport leading 76 - 16, Southport were found to have 19 men on the field.

Morning Herald]] and their respective counterpart publications, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] and [[The Sun-Herald]]. Articles about the Swans can occasionally be found in local community newspapers, free magazines and Sydney street press publications.\n\n===Radio===\n\nThe Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match. Matches played at other times and days are broadcast on the [[ABC NewsRadio]] station's analogue AM/FM frequencies for listeners in Sydney, Newcastle, the NSW Central Coast and Canberra. Most Swans matches can be heard by listeners in the Riverina region of N.S.W. via the [[ABC Riverina]] \u2013 [[Wagga Wagga]] ([[2RVR]]) service, on the 675 AM frequency. Match coverage can be heard anywhere in the world via live streaming at the official AFL website or by downloading the AFL app for smartphones such as the [[iPhone]] and [[Samsung Galaxy]].\n\n===Television===\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 [[Network Ten]] televised all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside [[New South Wales]] live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney for Sydney viewers and via affiliated stations in N.S.W and [[Canberra]]. In past and recent years the [[Seven Network]] broadcast Swans games to viewers in Sydney and most of N.S.W. and Canberra via the Prime TV network (now branded as [[Prime7]]). Matches were telecast either live, on a 30\u201390-minute delayed broadcast or late-night replay. Commencing 2002 all their games were broadcast live or on same day delay by Subscription television provider [[Foxtel]] across Australia on either the [[Fox Footy Channel]] or [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, the AFL commenced a new broadcast deal requiring the [[Seven Network]] and their affiliate station [[Prime7]] to broadcast all Sydney Swans (and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]) games live to viewers in Sydney and most of regional [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]]. These games are screened on the [[7mate]] channel in these regions. [[Foxtel]] also signed a new broadcast deal for the 2012 \u2013 2016 seasons which included screening all AFL matches (including all Swans games) live across Australia on their [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[Fox Footy]] channels.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports|Australia}}\n*[[:Category:Sydney Swans players|List of former and current Swans' players' entries]]\n*[[List of South Melbourne/Sydney Football Club coaches]] (includes their W/L records)\n*[[Australian rules football in New South Wales]]\n*[[Lake Oval]] \u2013 former home of the Swans\n*[[North East Australian Football League]] \u2013 Sydney Swans reserves fields a team in this competition.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Jim Main|title=Plugger and the Mighty Swans|publisher=Wilkinson Books|year=1996|isbn=1-86350-229-7|author-link=Jim Main}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.afl.com.au/ Official website of the AFL]\n*[http://sydneyswans.com.au/ Official website of the Sydney Swans Football Club]\n*[http://www.aroundthegrounds.bellestorie.com/lakeside/lakeside.html \"Around the Grounds\" web documentary about the Lakeside Oval]\n\n{{Sydney Swans}}\n{{VFL/AFL minor premiers}}\n{{VFL/AFL premiers}}\n{{Australian Football League}}\n{{NEAFL}}\n{{VFL}}\n{{Aussie Rules in New South Wales}}\n{{Sydney Sports Teams}}\n\n[[Category:Sydney Swans|*]]\n[[Category:Australian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1874]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football clubs in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Former Victorian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:1874 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n[[Category:Sports team relocations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=January 2018}} \n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Infobox Australian football club\n|color1 = #ED171F\n|color2 = white\n|color3 = solid white\n| clubname  = Sydney Swans\n| image     = Sydney Swans Logo.svg\n| image_size      = 125px\n| caption   = \n| fullname  = Sydney Swans Limited<ref>{{cite web|url=https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/adf.task-flow?adf.tfId=panelSearch&adf.tfDoc=/taskflows/panelSearch.xml&searchText=063349708&searchType=OrgAndBusNm|title=ASIC Registry Search}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/staticfile/AFL%20Tenant/SydneySwans/Club%20HQ/Swans%20Constitution.pdf|title=Sydney Swans Constitution|access-date=24 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916123719/http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/staticfile/AFL%20Tenant/SydneySwans/Club%20HQ/Swans%20Constitution.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| formernames = South Melbourne Football Club<br/>(1874\u20131982)<br />Swans Football Club<br/>(1982)<ref>[http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/Sydney_part_2.htm Sydney \u2013 Part 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107085620/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/Sydney_part_2.htm |date=7 January 2009 }} \u2013 FullPointsFooty.

Established in [[Melbourne]] as the '''South Melbourne Football Club''' in 1874, the Swans relocated to [[Sydney]] in 1982, thus making it the first club in the competition to be based outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\nInitially playing in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), the Swans joined seven other clubs in founding the breakaway Victorian Football League (now known as the AFL) in 1896. It won premierships in [[1909 VFL Grand Final|1909]], [[1918 VFL Grand Final|1918]] and [[1933 VFL Grand Final|1933]] before experiencing a 72-year premiership drought\u2014the longest in the competition's history. The club broke the drought in [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005]] and won another premiership in [[2012 AFL season|2012]].\n\nThe club has proven to be one of the most consistent teams in the AFL era, failing to make the finals in only four seasons since [[1995 AFL season|1995]], playing the most number of finals matches and winning the second-most matches overall (only behind {{AFL Gee}}) since 2000 and boasting a finals winning record of over 50% in the same time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKBlqPdAo0WO-F_PQzFLuRX-TDz7xsg7TFb-gQ1C3F0/pubhtml?gid=388289766&single=true|title=AFL Finals Summary All Clubs 2000\u20132015|accessdate=9 November 2015|location=Google Docs|first=Justin|last=Mitchell|year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2017-02-06/which-was-the-best-club-since-2000|title=Which was the best club since 2000?|work=Staff writers|publisher=Australian Football League|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Swans' headquarters and training facilities are located at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], the club's playing home ground since 1982.\n\n==South Melbourne history==\n[[File:Smfc.png|thumb|Old South Melbourne Football Club shield.

The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].\n\n===VFL entry: 1897\u20131909===\nSouth Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.\n\n===Premiership success: 1909\u20131945===\nThe club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933.  The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne's \"Foreign Legion\".<ref>The caricature at the foot of [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/149547747/17704724 page 10 of ''Table Talk'' (22 June 1933)] was created by Richard \"Dick\" Ovenden (1897\u20131972). From left to right those represented are: [[Jack Bisset]], the team's captain; [[Dick Mullaly]], the club's secretary; [[Brighton Diggins]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Bert Beard]], from South Fremantle (WAFL); [[Bill Faul]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jim O'Meara]], from East Perth (WAFL); [[Frank Davies (footballer, born 1907)|Frank Davies]], from City (NTFA); [[Laurie Nash]], from City (NTFA); [[John Bowe (footballer)|John Bowe]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jack Wade (footballer)|Jack Wade]], from Port Adelaide (SANFL); [[Ossie Bertram]], from West Torrens (SANFL); and [[Wilbur Harris]], from West Torrens (SANFL).</ref>\n\nOn grand final eve, 1935, as the Swans prepared to take on Collingwood, star full-forward Bob Pratt was clipped by a truck moments after stepping off a tram and subsequently missed the match for South. Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.<ref>Shaw, I.W. (2006) ''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a [[Herald and Weekly Times]] artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the [[black swan]] being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|date=24 January 1934|location=Melbourne|title=Real story behind South Melbourne's football premiership|page=7|author=J. M. Rohan}}</ref> The name stuck, in part due to the club's association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its [[swan]]s (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).\n\nAfter several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as \"the Bloodbath\", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.\n\n===Struggling times: 1946\u20131981===\nIn the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] failed to help, as the [[Riverina Football League]] proved to be one of the least profitable zones.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they \"won\" three [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]]. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.\n\n==Sydney history==\n{{recentism|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Early years in Sydney: 1982\u20131987===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the [[Fitzroy Lions]] staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. The club had been operating at a loss of at least $150,000 for the previous five years. News of the proposal broke on 2 July 1981, after which a letter was sent to members outlining the board's reasons for making the proposal and noting that the coach and current players were in favour of the move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2019-07-02/on-this-day-swans-move-to-sydney|title=On This Day: Swans move to Sydney|website=sydneyswans.com.au|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.\n\nThe move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South at South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|title=VFL 'no' sends South to Sydney|author=Mike Coward|date=15 October 1981|page=32}}</ref> The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|page=40|author=Geoff Slattery|date=7 November 1981|title=South Players on strike}}</ref> The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.<ref name=\"saga\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Roar|title=Revisiting the South Melbourne to Sydney saga|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/07/06/the-south-to-sydney-saga/|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1982 Escort Championships|1982 Escort Championships Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Swa}}|| '''13''' ||'''12''' ||'''90'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Nor}} || 8 || 10 || 58\n|-\n| Venue: [[Waverley Park]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 20,028\n|}\n\nUpon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name \"South Melbourne\" in June 1982, becoming known as simply \"the Swans\" for the rest of that season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|location=Melbourne|first=Peter|last=Simunovich|title=The Swans \u2013 officially|date=3 June 1982|page=67}}</ref> It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.<ref name=\"saga\" /> Its physical \"home club\" was the \"Southern Cross Social Club\" at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]\n\nOn 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be [[Australian dollar|$]]6.3&nbsp;million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten]] \"bought\" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9&nbsp;million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong's contracts to recruit [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref> The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', p. 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref>\n\nDuring the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field \u2013 all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans\u2019 successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the \"Swanettes\", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no club has had cheerleaders since then.\n\nIn 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992.<ref>[[1992 AFL season]]</ref> However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.\n\n===Dark times: 1988\u20131994===\nThe club's form was to slump in the following year.\n\nLosses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willesee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.\n\nMorale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128</ref> Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).\n\nCapper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club's finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney's goalkicking was led by [[Bernard Toohey]] (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Barry Mitchell (footballer)|Barry Mitchell]]. The careers of stars such as [[Dennis Carroll]], [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Ian Roberts (footballer)|Ian Roberts]], [[Tony Morwood]] and [[David Murphy (Australian rules footballer)|David Murphy]] wound down,<ref>Cowley, Michael (19 October 2009) [http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/gen-next-must-fly-for-swans-as-wily-old-birds-go-20091124-j2aa.html Gen Next must fly for Swans as wily old birds go]</ref> while promising young players like [[Jamie Lawson (Australian footballer)|Jamie Lawson]], [[Robert Teal]] and [[Paul Bryce]] had their careers cut short by injury.\n\nAttendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994. The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.\n\nThe AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.\n\nDuring this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Kelly]].\n\nDesperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.\n\n===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995\u20132001===\nA big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony \"Plugger\" Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the dominant rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.\n\n1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won eight games \u2013 as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined \u2013 and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1996 AFL season|1996 AFL Home & Away Season]]'' || ''W'' || ''L'' || ''D'' ||''Total'' || ''%''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''16''' || '''5''' || '''1''' || '''66''' || '''123.9'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=9 | ''Minor Premiers''\n|}\n\nFormer Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].\n\nThe Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL StK}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].\n\nThe 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.\n\nAfter missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Colonial Stadium]].\n\n===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002\u20132004===\nFormer Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumors that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with [[Terry Wallace]].\n\nRoos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.\n\nA new home ground in [[ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against {{AFL Ess}} attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.\n\n2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended {{AFL StK}}'s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for [[Leo Barry]]'s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Fraser Gehrig]], whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.\n\nSydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL StK}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.\n\n===Premiership glory: 2005===\n{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}\n{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}\nIn 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO [[Andrew Demetriou]], for their unorthodox, \"boring\" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]] maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=35%\n|align=right\n|quote=Nick Davis!

This dropped them into a semi-final against the [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] at the SCG on 9 September, and the Swans trailed the Cats 31\u201353 before [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] kicked four consecutive goals, with the last one a matter of seconds before the siren, to win the game for Sydney by 7.14 (56) to 7.11 (53). In the first preliminary final at the MCG on 16 September against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the Swans used a seven-goal blitz in 11 minutes of the fourth quarter to overturn an 8-point deficit and overrun the Saints by 15.6 (96) to 9.11 (65).\n\nThe Swans faced the Eagles in a rematch in the [[AFL Grand Final]] on 24 September 2005, and this time, they prevailed by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth Premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[2005 AFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''8''' || '''10''' || '''58'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[West Coast Eagles]] || 7  || 12 || 54\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 91,898\n|}\n\nOn Friday, 30 September 2005, a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city.

It was their earliest exit from the finals since 2001 and was a culmination of a mostly disappointing season, as only victories against lesser teams saw them through to a fifth consecutive finals campaign.\n\nThe conclusion of the 2007 trade saw the loss of [[Adam Schneider]] and [[Sean Dempster]] to [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the delisting of [[Simon Phillips (footballer)|Simon Phillips]], Jonathan Simpkin and [[Luke Vogels]], and the gain of [[Henry Playfair]] from [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Martin Mattner]] from [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]].\n\n[[File:Sydney banner honouring Amon Buchanon and Paul Roos.jpg|thumb|A Sydney Swans banner honouring Amon Buchanon's 100th game as a player [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]]' 500th game as player and coach]]\n\nThe Swans spent the middle part of the 2008 season inside the top four, however a late form slump which yielded only three wins in the last nine rounds saw the Swans drop to sixth at the conclusion of the 2008 regular season. Having qualified for the finals for a sixth consecutive season, the Swans defeated {{AFL Nor}} in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] the following week.\n\n2009 saw the club register only eight victories as they failed to reach the finals for the first time since 2002, finishing 12th with a percentage of below 100% for the first time since 1994. [[Barry Hall]], [[Leo Barry]], [[Jared Crouch]], [[Michael O'Loughlin]], [[Amon Buchanan]] and [[Darren Jolly]] all departed at the conclusion of the season, with [[Mark Seaby]], [[Daniel Bradshaw]] and [[Shane Mumford]], among others, joining the club during the trade period.\n\nThe 2010 season saw Sydney return to the finals by virtue of a fifth-place finish at the end of the regular season. The club defeated {{AFL Car}} by five points in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons.

The Swans defeated {{AFL StK}} in an elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium]] before losing to {{AFL Haw}} in the semi-finals the following week.\n\nIt was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] on its home ground, [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Skilled Stadium]], where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]] during the regular season. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain [[Jarrad McVeigh]]'s baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match.\n\n[[File:Sydney Swans banner.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Swans players run through the banner before the inaugural Sydney Derby on 24 March 2012.]]\nThe 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers {{AFL GWS}}.

Subsequent wins over {{AFL Fre}}, {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL Nor}} and {{AFL Haw}} saw the Swans sit second behind {{AFL WC}} on percentage after Round 5, but the Swans would proceed to lose three of their next four matches before embarking on a nine-match winning streak between Rounds 10 and 19 inclusive. The Swans eventually finished the regular season in third place after losing three of their final four matches, all against their fellow top-four rivals (Collingwood, Hawthorn and Geelong in Rounds 20, 22 and 23 respectively).\n\nThe Swans defeated {{AFL Ade}} by 29 points in their qualifying final at [[AAMI Stadium]], thus earning a week off and a home preliminary final, where they then defeated {{AFL Col}} by 26 points to qualify for their first grand final since 2006, ending an eleven-match losing streak against the Magpies in the process.\n\nIn the grand final, the Swans defeated Hawthorn [[2012 AFL Grand Final|by ten points]] in front of 99,683 people at the MCG, with [[Nick Malceski]] kicking a snap goal with 34 seconds left to seal the Swans' fifth premiership and first since 2005.

In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the [[2014 AFL Grand Final]]. They defeated [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against [[North Melbourne Kangaroos|North Melbourne]], which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The [[2014 AFL Grand Final]] was played on Saturday 27 September 2014 in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player [[Lance Franklin]] would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137). The 63-point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season, meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history.\n\nThe Swans started the 2015 AFL season well, winning their first three, before losing their next 2 games against [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], where they trailed by as many as 8 goals before half-time, and the [[Western Bulldogs]]. They won their next 6 leading into the bye, including home wins against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], and an upset away win against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the grand final replay. The Swans lost their first game after the bye, their 3rd of the season to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at the SCG, 11.11 (77) to 14.11. (95). The Swans rebounded with unconvincing wins against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane Lions Football Club|Brisbane Lions]], before suffering their heaviest defeat for 17 seasons against the [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawks]] by 89 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/biggest-loss-in-17-years-a-humiliation-for-swans-says-luke-parker-20150719-gifoiw.html|title=Biggest loss in 17 years a humiliation for Swans, says Luke Parker|first=Sebastian|last=Hassett|date=19 July 2015|website=The Age}}</ref> The following week was no better with a road trip to Perth and another loss, this time to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]] by 52 points, the scoreline ultimately flattering the Swans. The Swans bounced back against Adelaide with a convincing win 52-point win, but lost their next game to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Simmonds stadium]]; a close affair that Geelong blew apart in the 3rd quarter. The Swans won their final 4 games to secure a top 4 finish, against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], {{AFL GWS}}, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and {{AFL GCS}}.\n\nThe Swans faced minor premiers [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] in the first qualifying final, their first finals match without Franklin, who had withdrawn from the finals due to illness.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-08/star-swan-franklin-out-of-final-against-freo-with-ongoing-mental-health-condition], AFL.com.au official website, 8 September 2015</ref> Ultimately the Swans would go down in a low scoring affair, effectively kicking themselves out of the game after losing [[Sam Reid (Australian footballer born 1991)|Sam Reid]] to a hamstring injury midway through the 2nd quarter.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/video-sam-reid-subbed-out-of-sydneys-qualifying-final-with-fremantle-with-hamstring-injury/story-e6frf3e3-1227524180065], Fox Sports, 12 September 2015</ref> The following week the Swans were knocked out of the finals in a one-sided contest against [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], struggling to score throughout the first half with the game effectively over by half-time. For the first time since 2011, the Swans failed to make a preliminary final.\n\nThe Swans' continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a [[salary cap]] concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/salary-cap-gave-swans-the-flag-say-hawks/story-e6frexx0-1226497327257|title=Hawks and Crows critical of Swans' salary cap \u2013 thetelegraph.com.au|publisher=|date=16 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/afl-turns-up-heat-on-sydneys-cost-of-living-allowance/story-e6frexwr-1226497138805|title=Dailytelegraph.com.au \u2013 Subscribe to The Daily Telegraph for exclusive stories|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au}}</ref> It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-03-04/afl-to-scrap-cola AFL to scrap COLA], AFL.com.au official website, 4 March 2014</ref> The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000).<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-01-21/swans-ok-to-trade-afl], AFL.com.au official website, 21 January 2015</ref> During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-08-14/swans-chairman-calls-for-trade-ban-to-be-banished], AFL.com.au official website, 14 August 2015</ref> In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA,<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-players-association-joins-fight-over-sydney-swans-trading-ban-20150820-gj4504.html], ''The Age'', 20 August 2015</ref> the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for [[Callum Sinclair]] in a swap deal,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-14/eagles-swans-agree-to-straight-sinclairjetta-swap], AFL.com.au official website, 14 October 2015</ref> as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, [[Michael Talia]] from the Western Bulldogs.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-trade-period-2015-former-bulldog-michael-talia-moves-to-swans-in-lastminute-trade-deal-20151022-gkfzhi.html], ''The Age'', 22 October 2015</ref>\n\nThe Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], with new Swans recruit [[Michael Talia]] suffering a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit [[Callum Sinclair]] kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with [[Lance Franklin]] kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, [[Isaac Heeney]] starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain [[Kieren Jack]] and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.\n\nAhead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant [[Jeremy Cameron]] outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the [[Adelaide Crows]] by 6 goals, with Franklin and [[Tom Papley]] kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the [[Geelong Cats]] at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.\n\nThe Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0\u20136. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.\n\nThe Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether. However three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the Elimination Final.\n\nThe Swans' golden era of finals appearances came to an end in 2019. They missed the finals for the first time in a decade, finishing 15th on the ladder with eight wins and 14 losses. They started the season poorly with just one win in their first seven matches, although they would briefly recover after winning five of the next seven games. Six losses on the trot ended any chance of a tenth consecutive finals appearance, but strong wins over also-rans Melbourne and St Kilda in the final two rounds ensured the season ended on a positive note.\n\nThey won their first match of the interrupted 2020 season against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval by three points.\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Guernsey===\nThe jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red \"V\" on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club's major sponsor is [[QBE Insurance]]. In 2004 the club added the initials 'SMFC' in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club's past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans. The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the [[Brisbane Lions]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]]) and cross town rivals [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] are the only clubs with which there is a clash.<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2012-10-31/swans-2013-fixture-released Swans 2013 fixture released], Sydney Swans official website, 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] have manufactured the Swans' apparel since [[2010 AFL season|2010]], replacing long-time sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104222641/http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-11-04|title=ISC 2018 COMING SOON|website=www.isc-sports.com.au}}</ref>\n\n====Uniform evolution====\nSince the club was called \"South Melbourne\", the team has worn different designs with the traditional red and white colors, as follows:<ref>[https://www.footyjumpers.com/seasons.htm VFL Uniforms by season (since 1897)] on FootyJumpers.com</ref>\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_white|body= 002D62 |shorts= 002D62|socks= 002D62|title= 1874\u20131879}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000 |shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1880-1904}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _3whitestripes|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1905\u201306}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redrightsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1907-11 & 13-31}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redleftsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1912}}\n|}\n{|\n|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= |pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= |socks= ffffff|title= 1920-1922}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1932\u201374}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= ff0000|socks= ffffff|title= 1975\u201386}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= ff0000|title= 1987\u20132005}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= _hoops_red |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= |title= 2006\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Song===\nThe club song is known as ''Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White''' and is to the tune of the ''[[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]]'', the fight song of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in South Bend, Indiana, USA, which was written by [[University of Notre Dame]] graduates and brothers Rev.

Both teams have had close games since their grand final encounters, with their matches often finishing within single digit margins.\n\n==VFL and AFL premierships==\n\n===Premiers===\n* 1909 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Carlton 4.14 (38) to 4.12 (36)\n* 1918 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Collingwood 9.8 (62) to 7.15 (57)\n* 1933 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Richmond 9.17 (71) to 4.5 (29)\n* 2005 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated West Coast 8.10 (58) to 7.12 (54)\n* 2012 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated Hawthorn 14.7 (91) to 11.15 (81)\n\n===Defeated in grand finals===\n* 1899 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Fitzroy 3.9 (27) to 3.8 (26)\n* 1907 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 6.14 (50) to 6.9 (45)\n* 1912 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Essendon 5.17 (47) to 4.9 (33)\n* 1914 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 6.9 (45) to 4.15 (39)\n* 1934 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Richmond 19.14 (128) to 12.17 (89)\n* 1935 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Collingwood 11.12 (78) to 7.16 (58)\n* 1936 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Collingwood 11.23 (89) to 10.18 (78)\n* 1945 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 15.13 (103) to 10.15 (75)\n* 1996 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by North Melbourne 19.17 (131) to 13.10 (88); first grand final appearance after relocation\n* 2006 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by West Coast 12.13 (85) to 12.12 (84)\n* 2014 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by Hawthorn 21.11 (137) to 11.8 (74)\n* 2016 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by Western Bulldogs 13.11 (89) to 10.7 (67)\n\n==Players and staff==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Sydney Swans current squad}}\n\n===Officials===\n* '''Chairman:''' [[Andrew Pridham]]\n* '''Directors:'''\n** Andrew McMaster (Deputy chairman)\n** Rob Morgan\n** Alexandra Goodfellow\n** Greg Paramor\n** Robert Pascoe\n** Brian Tyson\n** Brad Seymour\n** Tim Worner\n* '''Chief executive:''' [[Tom Harley]]\n* '''general manager \u2013 Football:''' [[Charlie Gardiner (footballer)|Charlie Gardiner]]\n* '''Player Welfare & Development:''' [[Dennis Carroll]]\n\n==Reserves team==\n{{Main|Australian Football League reserves affiliations}}\nThe Swans currently field a reserves team in the [[North East Australian Football League]]. Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the [[Sydney AFL]] competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the [[AFL Canberra]] competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the [[Brisbane Lions]], [[Gold Coast Suns]] and [[GWS Giants]]. The team plays home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.\n\nIn [[2011 NEAFL season|2011]] the Swans reserves finished the home and away season with the Eastern Conference minor premiership. In the Eastern Conference grand final [[Ainslie Football Club|Ainslie]] caused a major upset when they defeated the Swans by 52 points. The team suffered the same fate in [[2012 NEAFL season|2012]] when [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] defeated them by 30 points in the Eastern Conference grand final. The Swans reserves would then go on to play in an astonishing five losing NEAFL grand finals; 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Premierships (4)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[2005 AFL Canberra season|2005]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''12.8 (80) \u2013 8.15 (63)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2006 AFL Canberra season|2006]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''10.16 (76) \u2013 6.7 (43)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2007 AFL Canberra season|2007]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] || '''18.14 (122) \u2013 14.10 (94)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2008 AFL Canberra season|2008]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''11.4 (70) \u2013 9.15 (69)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Runners-up (9)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[1927 VFL season|1927]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] || '''11.9 (75) \u2013 12.22 (94)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1956 VFL season|1956]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''10.12 (72) \u2013 16.14 (110)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1980 VFL season|1980]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] || '''19.12 (126) \u2013 24.15 (159)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n|1995\n|AFL Reserves\n|North Melbourne\n|'''13.16 (94) - 11.14 (80)'''\n|MCG\n|-\n| [[2013 NEAFL season|2013]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.13 (73) \u2013 12.9 (81)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2014 NEAFL season|2014]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Aspley Australian Football Club|Aspley Hornets]] || '''15.10 (100) \u2013 15.12 (102)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2016 NEAFL season|2016]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club|WSU Giants]] || '''11.12 (78) \u2013 11.16 (82)''' || [[Blacktown International Sportspark]]\n|-\n| [[2017 NEAFL season|2017]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.22 (82) \u2013 12.13 (85)''' || [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n|-\n| [[2018 NEAFL season|2018]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| Southport {{ref label|1|b}}||'''14.6 (90) \u2013  5.5 (35)''' || [[Fankhauser Reserve]]\n|}\n{{note label|1|a}} Competed as South Melbourne.\n\n{{ref label|1|b}} In the final quarter with Southport leading 76 - 16, Southport were found to have 19 men on the field.

Morning Herald]] and their respective counterpart publications, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] and [[The Sun-Herald]]. Articles about the Swans can occasionally be found in local community newspapers, free magazines and Sydney street press publications.\n\n===Radio===\n\nThe Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match. Matches played at other times and days are broadcast on the [[ABC NewsRadio]] station's analogue AM/FM frequencies for listeners in Sydney, Newcastle, the NSW Central Coast and Canberra. Most Swans matches can be heard by listeners in the Riverina region of N.S.W. via the [[ABC Riverina]] \u2013 [[Wagga Wagga]] ([[2RVR]]) service, on the 675 AM frequency. Match coverage can be heard anywhere in the world via live streaming at the official AFL website or by downloading the AFL app for smartphones such as the [[iPhone]] and [[Samsung Galaxy]].\n\n===Television===\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 [[Network Ten]] televised all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside [[New South Wales]] live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney for Sydney viewers and via affiliated stations in N.S.W and [[Canberra]]. In past and recent years the [[Seven Network]] broadcast Swans games to viewers in Sydney and most of N.S.W. and Canberra via the Prime TV network (now branded as [[Prime7]]). Matches were telecast either live, on a 30\u201390-minute delayed broadcast or late-night replay. Commencing 2002 all their games were broadcast live or on same day delay by Subscription television provider [[Foxtel]] across Australia on either the [[Fox Footy Channel]] or [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, the AFL commenced a new broadcast deal requiring the [[Seven Network]] and their affiliate station [[Prime7]] to broadcast all Sydney Swans (and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]) games live to viewers in Sydney and most of regional [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]]. These games are screened on the [[7mate]] channel in these regions. [[Foxtel]] also signed a new broadcast deal for the 2012 \u2013 2016 seasons which included screening all AFL matches (including all Swans games) live across Australia on their [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[Fox Footy]] channels.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports|Australia}}\n*[[:Category:Sydney Swans players|List of former and current Swans' players' entries]]\n*[[List of South Melbourne/Sydney Football Club coaches]] (includes their W/L records)\n*[[Australian rules football in New South Wales]]\n*[[Lake Oval]] \u2013 former home of the Swans\n*[[North East Australian Football League]] \u2013 Sydney Swans reserves fields a team in this competition.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Jim Main|title=Plugger and the Mighty Swans|publisher=Wilkinson Books|year=1996|isbn=1-86350-229-7|author-link=Jim Main}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.afl.com.au/ Official website of the AFL]\n*[http://sydneyswans.com.au/ Official website of the Sydney Swans Football Club]\n*[http://www.aroundthegrounds.bellestorie.com/lakeside/lakeside.html \"Around the Grounds\" web documentary about the Lakeside Oval]\n\n{{Sydney Swans}}\n{{VFL/AFL minor premiers}}\n{{VFL/AFL premiers}}\n{{Australian Football League}}\n{{NEAFL}}\n{{VFL}}\n{{Aussie Rules in New South Wales}}\n{{Sydney Sports Teams}}\n\n[[Category:Sydney Swans|*]]\n[[Category:Australian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1874]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football clubs in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Former Victorian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:1874 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n[[Category:Sports team relocations]]\n", "name_user": "Global-Cityzen", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans"}

He attended the [[New Mexico Military Institute|Goss Military Academy]] (since renamed as the New Mexico Military Institute) and St. Michael's College (now [[Santa Fe University of Art and Design]]), and the New Mexico School of Mines (now [[New Mexico Tech]], Socorro, NM). He was a member of the international fraternity [https://www.tke.org/chapter/139/alpha-omicron [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] \u2013 Alpha Omicron Chapter]. In his early twenties, Hilton was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] representative in the first [[New Mexico Legislature]], when the state was newly formed. He served two years in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War I]].  While Conrad was in France with the army after the war, his father was killed in a car accident.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Be My Guest\" by Conrad Hilton, copyright 1958 by the Prentice Hall Press</ref>\n\nThe most enduring influence to shape Hilton's philanthropic philosophy beyond that of his parents was the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and his sisters. He credited his mother with guiding him to prayer and the church whenever he was troubled or dismayed\u2014from the boyhood loss of a beloved pony to severe financial losses during the [[Great Depression]]. His mother continually told him that prayer was the best investment he would ever make.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Career==\nAs a young boy, Hilton developed entrepreneurial skills working at his father's general store in [[Socorro County]], [[New Mexico]], which was partially converted into a 10-room hotel.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhi39 ''The Handbook of Texas Online'' (Texas State Historical Association)].</ref><ref>[https://theoutline.com/post/1073/hilton-never-ending-quest-to-build-a-hotel-in-space ''The never-ending quest to build a hotel in space''].</ref> This was followed by varied experiences, including a stint as a representative in New Mexico's first State Legislature and a career decision to become a banker.\n\nIt was with the intention of buying a bank that he arrived in Texas at the height of the oil boom. He bought his first hotel instead, the 40-room Mobley Hotel in [[Cisco, Texas]], in 1919,<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\"/> when a bank purchase fell through. The hotel did such brisk business that rooms changed hands as often as three times a day, and the dining room was converted into additional rooms to meet the demand.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"bigspring\">Associated Press. \"Modest Inn at Cisco Began Hotel String of Conrad Hilton,\" ''Big Spring Daily Herald'', November 21, 1963, p. 12-A.</ref>\n\nHe went on to buy and build hotels throughout Texas, including the highrise [[Dallas Hilton]], opened in 1925; the Abilene Hilton in 1927; Waco Hilton in 1928; and [[Plaza Hotel (El Paso)|El Paso Hilton]] in 1930. The first hotel outside of Texas that Hilton built was in 1939 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Today it is known as the [[Andaluz Hotel|Hotel Andaluz]]. During the [[Great Depression]], Hilton was nearly forced into [[bankruptcy]] and lost several of his hotels. Nevertheless, he was retained as manager of a combined chain, and eventually regained control of his remaining eight hotels.\n\nOver the next decade, he expanded west to California and east to Chicago and New York, crowning his expansions with such acquisitions as the [[Stevens Hotel]] in Chicago (then the world's largest hotel, it was renamed the Conrad Hilton), and the fabled [[Waldorf-Astoria]] in New York. He formed the [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] in 1946, and [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton International Company]] in 1948.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Hilton Hotels' worldwide expansion facilitated both American tourism and overseas business by American corporations. It was the world's first international hotel chain, at the same time establishing a certain worldwide standard for hotel accommodations. In 1954, Hilton Hotels bought The Hotels Statler Company, Inc., for $111 million, then the world's largest real estate transaction. In all, Hilton eventually owned 188 hotels in 38 cities in the U.S., including the [[Mayflower Hotel]] in Washington, DC, the [[Palmer House]] in Chicago, and the [[Plaza Hotel]] and Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, along with fifty-four hotels abroad. He later purchased the [[Carte Blanche (credit card)|Carte Blanche]] Credit Company and an interest in the American Crystal Sugar Company, as well as other enterprises.\n\nHilton received honorary degrees from the [[University of Detroit]] (1953), [[DePaul University]] (1954), [[Barat College]] (1955), [[Adelphi College]] (1957), [[Sophia University]], Tokyo (1963), and the [[University of Albuquerque]] (1975).

In 1966, Hilton was succeeded as [[president (corporate title)|president]] by his son [[Barron Hilton|Barron]] and was elected [[chairman of the board]].\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1925, Hilton married Mary Adelaide Barron (1906\u20131966). They had three children: [[Conrad Hilton Jr.|Conrad Nicholson \"Nicky\" Hilton Jr.]], [[Barron Hilton|William Barron Hilton]], and [[Eric Hilton|Eric Michael Hilton]], before divorcing in 1934.\n\nIn 1942, Hilton married actress [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]. They had one child: [[Constance Francesca Hilton]], before divorcing in 1947. Gabor wrote in her 1991 autobiography ''One Lifetime is Not Enough'' that she only became pregnant by Hilton after he raped her during their marriage.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/10/zsazsa200710?currentPage=2 Review of Zsa Zsa Gabor's autobiography].</ref> Their daughter Constance died on January 5, 2015, at age 67, from a stroke.\n\nIn 1976, Hilton married Mary Frances Kelly. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1979. Mary Hilton died in 2006, at the age of 90.\n\n===Hilton family fortune===\nOn January 3, 1979, Hilton died of natural causes at the age of 91. He is interred at Calvary Hill Cemetery, a Catholic cemetery in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He left $500,000 to his two surviving siblings, $100,000 to his daughter Francesca, and $10,000 to each of his nieces and nephews.  The bulk of his estate was left to the [[Conrad N.

Taylor presented plans to build a hospitality college on the campus of the [[University of Houston]] to [[Barron Hilton]]. Barron then presented the plans to Conrad who donated $1.5 million for the completion of the project.

He attended the [[New Mexico Military Institute|Goss Military Academy]] (since renamed as the New Mexico Military Institute) and St. Michael's College (now [[Santa Fe University of Art and Design]]), and the New Mexico A&M University (now [[New Mexico State University]], Las Cruces, NM). He was a member of the international fraternity [https://www.tke.org/chapter/139/alpha-omicron [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] \u2013 Alpha Omicron Chapter]. In his early twenties, Hilton was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] representative in the first [[New Mexico Legislature]], when the state was newly formed. He served two years in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War I]].  While Conrad was in France with the army after the war, his father was killed in a car accident.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Be My Guest\" by Conrad Hilton, copyright 1958 by the Prentice Hall Press</ref>\n\nThe most enduring influence to shape Hilton's philanthropic philosophy beyond that of his parents was the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and his sisters. He credited his mother with guiding him to prayer and the church whenever he was troubled or dismayed\u2014from the boyhood loss of a beloved pony to severe financial losses during the [[Great Depression]]. His mother continually told him that prayer was the best investment he would ever make.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Career==\nAs a young boy, Hilton developed entrepreneurial skills working at his father's general store in [[Socorro County]], [[New Mexico]], which was partially converted into a 10-room hotel.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhi39 ''The Handbook of Texas Online'' (Texas State Historical Association)].</ref><ref>[https://theoutline.com/post/1073/hilton-never-ending-quest-to-build-a-hotel-in-space ''The never-ending quest to build a hotel in space''].</ref> This was followed by varied experiences, including a stint as a representative in New Mexico's first State Legislature and a career decision to become a banker.\n\nIt was with the intention of buying a bank that he arrived in Texas at the height of the oil boom. He bought his first hotel instead, the 40-room Mobley Hotel in [[Cisco, Texas]], in 1919,<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\"/> when a bank purchase fell through. The hotel did such brisk business that rooms changed hands as often as three times a day, and the dining room was converted into additional rooms to meet the demand.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"bigspring\">Associated Press. \"Modest Inn at Cisco Began Hotel String of Conrad Hilton,\" ''Big Spring Daily Herald'', November 21, 1963, p. 12-A.</ref>\n\nHe went on to buy and build hotels throughout Texas, including the highrise [[Dallas Hilton]], opened in 1925; the Abilene Hilton in 1927; Waco Hilton in 1928; and [[Plaza Hotel (El Paso)|El Paso Hilton]] in 1930. The first hotel outside of Texas that Hilton built was in 1939 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Today it is known as the [[Andaluz Hotel|Hotel Andaluz]]. During the [[Great Depression]], Hilton was nearly forced into [[bankruptcy]] and lost several of his hotels. Nevertheless, he was retained as manager of a combined chain, and eventually regained control of his remaining eight hotels.\n\nOver the next decade, he expanded west to California and east to Chicago and New York, crowning his expansions with such acquisitions as the [[Stevens Hotel]] in Chicago (then the world's largest hotel, it was renamed the Conrad Hilton), and the fabled [[Waldorf-Astoria]] in New York. He formed the [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] in 1946, and [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton International Company]] in 1948.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Hilton Hotels' worldwide expansion facilitated both American tourism and overseas business by American corporations. It was the world's first international hotel chain, at the same time establishing a certain worldwide standard for hotel accommodations. In 1954, Hilton Hotels bought The Hotels Statler Company, Inc., for $111 million, then the world's largest real estate transaction. In all, Hilton eventually owned 188 hotels in 38 cities in the U.S., including the [[Mayflower Hotel]] in Washington, DC, the [[Palmer House]] in Chicago, and the [[Plaza Hotel]] and Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, along with fifty-four hotels abroad. He later purchased the [[Carte Blanche (credit card)|Carte Blanche]] Credit Company and an interest in the American Crystal Sugar Company, as well as other enterprises.\n\nHilton received honorary degrees from the [[University of Detroit]] (1953), [[DePaul University]] (1954), [[Barat College]] (1955), [[Adelphi College]] (1957), [[Sophia University]], Tokyo (1963), and the [[University of Albuquerque]] (1975).

In 1966, Hilton was succeeded as [[president (corporate title)|president]] by his son [[Barron Hilton|Barron]] and was elected [[chairman of the board]].\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1925, Hilton married Mary Adelaide Barron (1906\u20131966). They had three children: [[Conrad Hilton Jr.|Conrad Nicholson \"Nicky\" Hilton Jr.]], [[Barron Hilton|William Barron Hilton]], and [[Eric Hilton|Eric Michael Hilton]], before divorcing in 1934.\n\nIn 1942, Hilton married actress [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]. They had one child: [[Constance Francesca Hilton]], before divorcing in 1947. Gabor wrote in her 1991 autobiography ''One Lifetime is Not Enough'' that she only became pregnant by Hilton after he raped her during their marriage.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/10/zsazsa200710?currentPage=2 Review of Zsa Zsa Gabor's autobiography].</ref> Their daughter Constance died on January 5, 2015, at age 67, from a stroke.\n\nIn 1976, Hilton married Mary Frances Kelly. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1979. Mary Hilton died in 2006, at the age of 90.\n\n===Hilton family fortune===\nOn January 3, 1979, Hilton died of natural causes at the age of 91. He is interred at Calvary Hill Cemetery, a Catholic cemetery in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He left $500,000 to his two surviving siblings, $100,000 to his daughter Francesca, and $10,000 to each of his nieces and nephews.  The bulk of his estate was left to the [[Conrad N.

In his ''Antiquities of Greece'' (1697\u20131699), [[John Potter (bishop)|Archbishop John Potter]] assumed that \"the excellent passion\" of the [[Theban Band]] was chaste. Potter echoes [[Athenaeus]]'s praise of pederasty, and [[Strabo]]'s account of [[Cretan pederasty]].</ref>\n\nPlato was little read in Byron's time, in contrast to the later [[Victorian era]] when translations of the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' would have been the most likely way for a young student to learn about Greek sexuality.<ref name=\"Crompton1985\"/>{{rp|89}} The one English translation of the ''Symposium'', published in two parts in 1761 and 1767, was an ambitious undertaking by the scholar [[Floyer Sydenham]], who nevertheless was at pains to suppress its homoeroticism: Sydenham regularly translated the word ''[[eromenos]]'' as \"mistress\", and \"boy\" often becomes \"maiden\" or \"woman\".<ref name=\"Crompton1985\"/>{{rp|89\u201390}} At the same time, the classical curriculum in English schools passed over works of history and philosophy in favor of  Latin and Greek poetry that often dealt with erotic themes.<ref name=\"Crompton1985\"/>{{rp|91}}\nIn describing homoerotic aspects of Byron's life and work, Louis Crompton uses the umbrella term \"Greek love\" to cover literary and cultural models of homosexuality from classical antiquity as a whole, both Greek and Roman,<ref>Latin literature in particular was seen as continuing or deriving from a Greek heritage.</ref> as received by intellectuals, artists, and moralists of the time.

The [[countrypolitan]] ballad reached number 1 in the [[United States]] in 1973 on three ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' music charts: [[Billboard Hot 100|the pop chart]] (two weeks), [[Hot Country Songs|the country chart]] (three weeks), and [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|the adult contemporary chart]] (three weeks),<ref>{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961-2001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=203}}</ref> as well as in [[Canada]] on three ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' charts: the ''RPM 100'' Top Singles chart, the Country Tracks chart, and the Adult Contemporary chart. ''Billboard'' ranked it as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1974|No. 23 song for 1974]].\n\nThe song is actually a merging of two songs previously recorded by co-writer Wilson, \"Hey Mister\" (from 1968, which forms a major part of the song), and \"Mama McCluskie\", used in part in the song\u2019s chorus.\n\nRich's [[B-side]], his own \"I Feel Like Going Home\", was later covered by [[Rita Coolidge]] and was released on her 1974 album ''[[Fall into Spring]]''.\nBritish pop singer [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] included \"The Most Beautiful Girl\" on his 1973 album ''Engelbert: King of Hearts''.\n\n\"The Most Beautiful Girl\" was also recorded by [[Slim Whitman]] in the 1970s. [[Andy Williams]] released a version in 1974 on his album ''[[The Way We Were (Andy Williams album)|The Way We Were]]''. In 1975 [[ABBA]] singer [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] recorded a Swedish-language version called \"Vill du l\u00e5na en man?\" (with Swedish lyrics by [[Stig Anderson]]) on her solo album ''[[Frida ensam]]''. [[Sergio Franchi]] recorded the song on his 1976 DynaHouse album ''20 Magnificent Songs''. Country music boy band [[South 65]] recorded an updated version of the song, titled \"The Most Beautiful Girl (2001 Version)\", on their 2001 album ''Dream Large''.\n\nThe song receives a very brief airing by [[Brenda Fricker]] in the film ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]''.

The trophy awarded to a winner is known as the \"Golden Mickey\", a gold-colored statuette with a silhouette figure of [[Mickey Mouse]] donning [[headphones]] nicknamed the \"Ardy\", representing Radio Disney's initials. Before 2014, the ceremony was not televised beyond commercial interstitial segments for [[Disney Channel]] to promote their sister radio network. As of the seventh annual ceremony on April 26, 2014, the ceremony began to be televised in full a day after a tape delay, as the network attempts to compete with [[Nickelodeon]]'s [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids' Choice Awards]] in airing awards programming. Starting in 2016, Canada was able to vote for the first time as Disney programming, formerly under the control of [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], is now carried by Disney-branded [[Corus Entertainment]] networks in both [[Disney Channel (Canada)|English]] and [[Disney La Cha\u00eene|French]].<ref>http://en-ca-music.disney.com/rdma</ref><ref>http://fr-ca-music.disney.com/rdma</ref>\n\nOn June 16, 2019, the Radio Disney Music Awards were renamed ''ARDYs: A Radio Disney Music Celebration'' and aired live for the first time instead of on a tape-delay.<ref name=\"RDMA Name Change\">{{cite web|title=Music's Biggest Event for Families Returns For Its Seventh Year, Live for the First Time and With a New Name: \"ARDYs: A Radio Disney Music Celebration,\" Sunday, June 16|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/04/19/musics-biggest-event-for-families-returns-for-its-seventh-year-live-for-the-first-time-and-with-a-new-name-ardys-a-radio-disney-music-celebration-sunday-june-16-432112/20190419disney01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Awards events==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The trophy awarded to a winner is known as the \"Golden Mickey\", a gold-colored statuette with a silhouette figure of [[Mickey Mouse]] donning [[headphones]] nicknamed the \"Ardy\", representing Radio Disney's initials. Before 2014, the ceremony was not televised beyond commercial interstitial segments for [[Disney Channel]] to promote their sister radio network. As of the seventh annual ceremony on April 26, 2014, the ceremony began to be televised in full a day after a tape delay, as the network attempts to compete with [[Nickelodeon]]'s [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids' Choice Awards]] in airing awards programming. Starting in 2016, Canada was able to vote for the first time as Disney programming, formerly under the control of [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], is now carried by Disney-branded [[Corus Entertainment]] networks in both [[Disney Channel (Canada)|English]] and [[Disney La Cha\u00eene|French]].<ref>http://en-ca-music.disney.com/rdma</ref><ref>http://fr-ca-music.disney.com/rdma</ref>\n\nOn June 16, 2019, the Radio Disney Music Awards were renamed ''ARDYs: A Radio Disney Music Celebration'' and aired live for the first time instead of on a tape-delay.<ref name=\"RDMA Name Change\">{{cite web|title=Music's Biggest Event for Families Returns For Its Seventh Year, Live for the First Time and With a New Name: \"ARDYs: A Radio Disney Music Celebration,\" Sunday, June 16|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/04/19/musics-biggest-event-for-families-returns-for-its-seventh-year-live-for-the-first-time-and-with-a-new-name-ardys-a-radio-disney-music-celebration-sunday-june-16-432112/20190419disney01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Awards events==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

His experience is vast, and that is why he knows how to handle pressure. ''Paco Memo'' has played in some of the most important tournaments in world football, such as the Confederations Cup, Gold Cup and Copa America. Ochoa\u2019s aerial game is enviable. He can catch a cross or a shot, but he can also deflect them with high dives with the top hand and punches. But those are not his only assets. His reflexes are so sharp that he can perform a collapse dive with one hand with ease, even if he has just rejected a shot.

His experience is vast, and that is why he knows how to handle pressure. ''Paco Memo'' has played in some of the most important tournaments in world football, such as the Confederations Cup, Gold Cup and Copa America. Ochoa\u2019s aerial game is enviable. He can catch a cross or a shot, but he can also deflect them with high dives with the top hand and punches. But those are not his only assets. His reflexes are so sharp that he can perform a collapse dive with one hand with ease, even if he has just rejected a shot.

He played [[college football]] for [[Eastern Illinois University]], where he won the [[Walter Payton Award]] in 2002 and led the [[Eastern Illinois Panthers football|Panthers]] to an [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship in 2001.\n\nRomo signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys in 2003. Beginning his career as a [[Holder (American football)|holder]], Romo became the Cowboys' starting quarterback during the 2006 season. Serving as the team's primary starter from 2006 to 2015, he guided the Cowboys to four postseason appearances and was named to the [[Pro Bowl]] four times. Romo retired after the 2016 season, following a preseason back injury that caused him to lose his starting position to [[Dak Prescott]]. Upon retiring, he was hired by [[CBS Sports]] to become the lead color analyst for their [[NFL on CBS|NFL telecasts]], teaming with [[Jim Nantz]] in the broadcast booth.\n\nRomo holds several Cowboys team records, including passing touchdowns, passing yards, most games with at least 300 passing yards, and games with three or more touchdown passes. He also held a higher passer rating in the fourth quarter than any other NFL quarterback from 2006 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000260776/article/tony-romo-is-fourth-quarter-clutch?akmobile=ios-tablet&akcarrier=other | title=Tony Romo is 4th quarter clutch | publisher=nfl.com | date=October 12, 2013 | accessdate=August 28, 2016}}</ref> However, Romo's reputation was affected by a lack of postseason success, having won only two of the six playoff games he appeared in and never advancing beyond the divisional round.<ref name=\"Romo has support\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/123108dnspocowlede.3088633.html |title=Dallas Cowboys' Romo has Support of Jerry Jones, Phillips |last=Watkins |first=Calvin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730213531/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/123108dnspocowlede.3088633.html |archive-date=July 30, 2010 |access-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Choke Artists \">{{Cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1409623-10-biggest-choke-artists-in-the-nfl/page/11 |title=10 Biggest Choke Artists in the NFL |last=Kostora |first=Nick |date=November 15, 2012 |website=Bleacher Report |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Jason Garrett defends \">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/4516633-tony-romo-dallas-cowboys-playoff-record-jason-garrett-nfl-preseason |title=Jason Garrett defends Tony Romo's playoff record with Cowboys |last=Iyer |first=Vinnie |date=August 12, 2013 |website=The Sporting News |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Is Romo Small \">{{Cite web |url=http://mmqb.si.com/2014/12/11/tony-romo-clutch-dallas-cowboys |title=Is Romo Small in Big Games? |last=King |first=Peter |date=December 11, 2014 |website=SI.com |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Playoff demons \">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24932004/tony-romo-looks-to-end-playoff-demons-sunday-in-cowboys-lions |title=Tony Romo looks to end playoff demons Sunday in Cowboys-Lions |last=Brinson |first=Will |date=January 2, 2015 |website=CBS Sports |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> His 97.1 passer rating is the fourth highest of all time and the highest among quarterbacks not to reach the [[Super Bowl]], as well as the highest among retired players.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early years==\nRomo was born in [[San Diego, California]], to Ramiro Romo Jr. and Joan Jakubowski.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://journaltimes.com/sports/jackel-romo-stays-true-to-roots/article_a8a8a08e-4e35-5952-a7fb-31e69feeb70e.html |title=JACKEL: Romo stays true to roots |last=Jackel |first=Peter  |date=June 23, 2008 |work=[[Racine Journal Times|The Journal Times]] |access-date=August 28, 2016 |location=[[Racine, Wisconsin]]}}</ref> Romo is a \"[[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|Navy brat]]\": he was born while his father, Ramiro Romo, Jr., was stationed at the [[Naval Base San Diego|San Diego U.S. Naval Base]].

He played [[college football]] for [[Eastern Illinois University]], where he won the [[Walter Payton Award]] in 2002 and led the [[Eastern Illinois Panthers football|Panthers]] to an [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship in 2001.\n\nRomo signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys in 2003. Beginning his career as a [[Holder (American football)|holder]], Romo became the Cowboys' starting quarterback during the 2006 season. Serving as the team's primary starter from 2006 to 2015, he guided the Cowboys to four postseason appearances and was named to the [[Pro Bowl]] four times. Romo retired after the 2016 season, following a preseason back injury that caused him to lose his starting position to [[Dak Prescott]]. Upon retiring, he was hired by [[CBS Sports]] to become the lead color analyst for their [[NFL on CBS|NFL telecasts]], teaming with [[Jim Nantz]] in the broadcast booth.\n\nRomo holds several Cowboys team records, including passing touchdowns, passing yards, most games with at least 300 passing yards, and games with three or more touchdown passes. He also held a higher passer rating in the fourth quarter than any other NFL quarterback from 2006 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000260776/article/tony-romo-is-fourth-quarter-clutch?akmobile=ios-tablet&akcarrier=other | title=Tony Romo is 4th quarter clutch | publisher=nfl.com | date=October 12, 2013 | accessdate=August 28, 2016}}</ref> However, Romo's reputation was affected by a lack of postseason success, having won only two of the six playoff games he appeared in and never advancing beyond the divisional round.<ref name=\"Romo has support\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/123108dnspocowlede.3088633.html |title=Dallas Cowboys' Romo has Support of Jerry Jones, Phillips |last=Watkins |first=Calvin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730213531/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/123108dnspocowlede.3088633.html |archive-date=July 30, 2010 |access-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Choke Artists \">{{Cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1409623-10-biggest-choke-artists-in-the-nfl/page/11 |title=10 Biggest Choke Artists in the NFL |last=Kostora |first=Nick |date=November 15, 2012 |website=Bleacher Report |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Jason Garrett defends \">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/4516633-tony-romo-dallas-cowboys-playoff-record-jason-garrett-nfl-preseason |title=Jason Garrett defends Tony Romo's playoff record with Cowboys |last=Iyer |first=Vinnie |date=August 12, 2013 |website=The Sporting News |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Is Romo Small \">{{Cite web |url=http://mmqb.si.com/2014/12/11/tony-romo-clutch-dallas-cowboys |title=Is Romo Small in Big Games? |last=King |first=Peter |date=December 11, 2014 |website=SI.com |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Playoff demons \">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24932004/tony-romo-looks-to-end-playoff-demons-sunday-in-cowboys-lions |title=Tony Romo looks to end playoff demons Sunday in Cowboys-Lions |last=Brinson |first=Will |date=January 2, 2015 |website=CBS Sports |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> His 97.1 passer rating is the fourth highest of all time and the highest among quarterbacks not to reach the [[Super Bowl]], as well as the highest among retired players.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early years==\nRomo was born in [[San Diego, California]], to Ramiro Romo Jr. and Joan Jakubowski.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://journaltimes.com/sports/jackel-romo-stays-true-to-roots/article_a8a8a08e-4e35-5952-a7fb-31e69feeb70e.html |title=JACKEL: Romo stays true to roots |last=Jackel |first=Peter  |date=June 23, 2008 |work=[[Racine Journal Times|The Journal Times]] |access-date=August 28, 2016 |location=[[Racine, Wisconsin]]}}</ref> Romo is a \"[[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|Navy brat]]\": he was born while his father, Ramiro Romo, Jr., was stationed at the [[Naval Base San Diego|San Diego U.S. Naval Base]].
