His father was Benizelos Rouphos (elder). Kanakaris was elected as a headsman of Patras in 1785, and became one of the most influential Greek magnates in the [[Morea]]. While serving as the province's representative to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], he became a member of the [[Filiki Eteria]]. During the [[Greek War of Independence]], he served as a member of the [[Peloponnesian Senate]] and of the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]], and contributed from his personal fortune to the Greek cause.

Under the [[Faculty of Arts and Sciences]], individual courses among the school's [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] and professional offerings, a number of which have [[Harvard College]] equivalents, are open-enrollment. However, the Extension School also offers [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate degrees]], [[Graduate school|graduate degrees]], and [[Academic certificate|certificates]] in more than 60 fields of study, provided that a qualifying test is passed, satisfactory grades are obtained in prior Harvard coursework, and a formal application is accepted. Degree candidates and alumni enjoy access to Harvard's many amenities and opportunities.\n\nThe school offers on-campus, online, and hybrid courses. It also offers a pre-medical program for students needing specific coursework to apply to medical school. The school is primarily intended for nontraditional adult learners.\n\nSince its establishment in 1910, an estimated 500,000 students have taken courses at the Extension School.

Lawrence Lowell]], the Harvard Extension School grew out of the [[Lowell Institute]], which was created according to the terms of a bequest by John Lowell, Jr.  It was designed to serve the educational interests and needs of the greater [[Boston]] community,{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=220}} particularly those \"who had the ability and desire to attend college, but also had other obligations that kept them from traditional schools.\"<ref name=\"sampler\" />  It has since extended its academic resources to the public, locally, nationally, and internationally.\n\nDuring the 1920s [[professor]]s from [[Boston University]] and [[Harvard University]] traveled to teach courses offsite.<ref name=\"Yonkers\" /> While they were primarily aimed at teachers, courses were offered wherever 40 or more students expressed an interest.<ref name=\"Yonkers\" />  Professors traveled on a weekly basis to places around New England and as far away as [[Yonkers, New York]],<ref name=\"Yonkers\" /> some 200 miles away.\n\nIn the early years courses were run by a commission composed of several Boston area schools, though it was largely a Harvard-run program.<ref name=\"wheat\" />{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=54}}{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=104}}  In 1938 there were 28 professors from Commission faculties, including 11 full professors.<ref name=\"courses\" />  Early faculty included [[Charles Townsend Copeland]], [[William Yandell Elliot]], [[William L. Langer]], [[Oscar Handlin]], [[Perry Miller]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and [[Frank M. Carpenter]].{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=52}} In 1953 there was a similar number of professors.<ref name=\"wheat\" />\n\nIn his will, John Lowell asked his successors to set up courses \"more erudite and particular corresponding to the age and wants of the age.\"<ref name=\"wheat\" />  By the 50th anniversary of the University Extension in 1960, more than 1,400 courses had been offered and there had been more than 85,000 enrollments.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=81}} Lowell's bequest limited the cost of tuition to no more than two bushels of wheat. During the [[Great Depression]] this amounted to roughly $5 per semester course.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=50}}\n\nSeveral years after retiring, President Lowell wrote that the Extension courses \"have given a service to the public&nbsp;... which seems to me of the utmost importance.\"{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=225}}  In 2013, more than 100 years after its founding, the Extension School's classes were described as \"surprisingly affordable\"<ref name=\"fodors\" /> and the school itself was said to be a \"thriving institution.\"<ref name=\"fortune\" />\n\n===Degree development===\nThe Extension School currently offers two degrees (and has offered these degrees since 1979): the [[Bachelor of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALB) and the [[Master of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALM).<ref name=\"century\" />  From 1911 to 1933, the school offered an Associate in Arts, and from 1933 to 1960, it offered an Adjunct in Arts.<ref name=\"century\" />  Both were considered the [[History of Harvard Extension School#Extension grows|equivalent of a bachelor's degree]].<ref name=\"century\" /> From 1971 to 2014, the school offered an Associate of Arts in Extension Studies (AA), the equivalent of a two-year degree.<ref name=\"century\" />\n\nA proposal before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 2009 and 2010 to rename the school and the degrees offered was not accepted.<ref name=\"sinjin\" /><ref name=\"rename\" />  A committee led by Professor of Computer Science [[Harry R.

Some faculty objected, saying that those degrees were too similar to degrees already offered by the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.<ref name=\"rename\" />\n\nIn 2016, a student group calling itself the Harvard Extension Degree Change Initiative rallied in front of [[University Hall (Harvard University)|University Hall]] to call for removing \u201cExtension Studies\u201d from the degree name and adding a student's field of study instead.<ref name=\"extendingDegree\" /> ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' editorialized in favor, urging Harvard to \"consider changing the title of Extension School degrees to include the field of study rather than the ambiguous 'Extension Studies.'\"<ref name=\"extendingDegree\" /> While the school retains \"Extension Studies\" in official degree titles, transcripts reflect students' area of academic concentration.\n\nIn 2019, Dean [[Huntington D.

Bertocci of Boston University. For 30 years he taught Extension courses, with never fewer than 100 students. He often taught over 300 students per course and once had over 400. Over the years Bertocci taught at least 7,000 Extension students, a record for the school.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=71}}\n\nThe radio courses proved to be so successful that when the television station [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] went on the air in October 1951 they began broadcasting an Extension class every weekday at 3:30 and 7:30.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=72}} The first course, offered by [[Robert G.

Based upon highest cumulative GPA.\n*The Patrick Lee Award in Drama is an annual award given to the student who shows the best promise in the field of dramatic arts.\n*The Reginald H. Phelps Prize, named for the former dean, is awarded annually on the basis of \"academic achievement and character\" to outstanding graduating students receiving bachelor's degrees.\n*The John Osborne Sargent Prize for a Latin Translation is offered for the best metrical translation [students may choose meter] of a lyric poem of Horace, to be selected each year by the Department of the Classics. In addition to ALB candidates, it is also open to undergraduates at the College and visiting undergraduates under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n*The Thomas Small Prize is named for a Lithuanian immigrant who, at the age of 89, became the oldest earned graduate degree recipient in the history of Harvard University. Two prizes are awarded annually on the basis \"academic achievement and character\" to two outstanding Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies degree recipients.\n* The Judith Wood Memorial Prizes are awarded during Commencement Week to Harvard Extension School students who, while compiling honors academic records at the school, also contended with disabilities of a serious nature.

About 85% of those admitted successfully earn their degree (ALB).<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nIt has been estimated that acceptance into the graduate programs (ALM), using the number of accepted students and the number of students enrolled in admission courses, is 15-20%. Thus, based on traditional metrics, admission into the graduate programs is highly selective.\n\nALB students may graduate ''cum laude'', but ''magna''- and ''summa''- ''cum laude'' are not offered. Extension students may earn the Dean's List Academic Achievement Award upon graduation based on a high GPA (at least 3.5 for ALB, 3.8 for ALM).<ref name=\"RFSwK\" /> Many courses are offered online, but a degree cannot be earned entirely online as students are required to take classes on campus before earning their degree.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nStudents who wish to earn degrees must be formally admitted to the Extension School by the Admissions Committee.<ref name=\"open\" />  Admitted degree candidates are granted full privileges to Harvard's libraries, facilities, student resources, as well as access to Harvard's museums and academic workshops. In 2016, an undergraduate degree cost around $40,000, and a graduate degree cost about $25,000.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\n===Bachelor of Liberal Arts===\nThe undergraduate curriculum is similar to the curriculum for [[Harvard College]] students; requirements include expository writing, quantitative reasoning, foreign language, moral reasoning, upper-level coursework, and an area of concentration.<ref name=\"solid\" />  The expository writing class is known as a \"gatekeeper course\" as it will typically \"determine whether [students] are prepared for the intensive and demanding curriculum.\"<ref name=\"open\" />\n\nOnce admitted as an ALB degree candidate, students must successfully complete 128 credits<ref name=\"extension.harvard_b\" /> (Harvard courses are typically 4 credits each) and maintain good academic standing to meet graduation requirements.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" />  Upon admission into the ALB program, students may petition to transfer up to a maximum of 64 credits from other accredited post-secondary institutions, but 64 credits must be completed at Harvard.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" /> Students select one of three \"areas of concentration\" which are humanities, science, and social sciences.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" />\n\nALB degree candidates are also required to complete a minimum of 16 on-campus-only credits at Harvard;<ref name=\"extension.harvard_e\" /> students must also complete a minimum of 12 writing-intensive credits and earn a minimum of 52 credits in courses that are taught by Harvard instructors.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_b\" /> In addition to a concentration, degree candidates have the option to pursue one of twenty \"fields of study\" (similar to majors).<ref name=\"fields\" /> In order to successfully complete a field of study, students must earn a B\u2013 or higher in 32 Harvard credits in one field, and maintain a B average in the field.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" /> Students may also complement their degree with up to two minors.<ref name=\"fields\" />\n\n====Undergraduate admissions====\nUndergraduate degree programs require pre-admission courses as well as a formal application process. <ref name=\"admit\" /> Students must also hold a \"high school diploma or its equivalent [which] must have been earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any ALB degree-applicable courses.\"<ref name=\"GZvkR\" /> Students applying for degree candidacy must complete three 4-credit liberal arts courses at Harvard (Extension School, Summer School, or the Faculty of Arts and Sciences) with at least a B grade in each, and maintain a minimum 3.0 cumulative [[grade point average|GPA]]. One of these three pre-admission courses must be EXPO E-25, the equivalent of Harvard College's mandatory and \"notoriously difficult\" expository writing course.<ref name=\"expos20\" /> To enroll in this course, students must either pass a placement test, which measures critical reading and writing skills, or enroll in EXPO E-15 (a course that acts as a precursor to EXPO E-25).<ref name=\"admit\" />  Students failing to earn at least a B in a class can retake it once. Those who meet all these criteria are then eligible to apply for admission into the school's undergraduate degree programs.\n\n===Master of Liberal Arts===\nThe [[Master of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALM) includes 19 liberal arts fields of study and seven professional degree programs (Biotechnology, Information Technology, Journalism, Management, Mathematics for Teaching, Museum Studies, & Sustainability).<ref name=\"grad\" /> Except for Museum Studies (10 courses), all ALM candidates must complete 12 courses, with most requiring a thesis or capstone project crafted under the direction of an instructor or faculty member holding a teaching appointment in the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=\"thesis\" />\n\n====Graduate admissions====\nAdmission into a graduate degree program requires an accredited bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent), passing the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills, the completion of two or three pre-admission courses with grades of B or higher, and a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0. One of the pre-admission courses must be the \"proseminar\" course for the intended area of study, which is akin to a traditional research methods course.<ref name=\"admit\" /> Certain disciplines have other specified pre-admission coursework, while some have specific coursework that is required before submitting a master's thesis proposal (biology and psychology students must take a specific graduate statistics course). Some programs require supplemental application materials; for instance, Creative Writing and Literature ALM candidates must submit original manuscripts.<ref name=\"apply\" /> Students who meet these criteria are then eligible to submit an application for admission into the graduate degree programs (ALM).\n\nA student who fails to earn a grade of B after twice enrolling in the proseminar course\u2014often considered a \"gatekeeper\" course\u2014will be denied admission indefinitely.<ref name=\"8G1Pv\" />\n\n==Student life==\nBeginning in the 1960s, the university began providing additional facilities for Extension students.  Study spaces, conferences rooms, library facilities, and a dining hall were set up in Lehman Hall for students in 1964.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=111}}  In addition, there was a television lounge where students could watch the WGBH programs.<ref name=\"banner1967\" />\n\nToday, admitted degree candidates are granted access to Harvard's athletic facilities, libraries, and career services, among other amenities. Students have \"nearly unfettered access to some of Harvard's most prized resources\u2014world-renowned libraries, a distinguished faculty, and an impressive body of speakers.\"<ref name=\"wells\" /> The top 10 percent of the undergraduate (ALB) graduating class in good standing is inducted into the Harvard Extension School's Phi Beta chapter (established 2002\u201303) of [[Alpha Sigma Lambda]], the national honor society for nontraditional students. Ordinarily, undergraduate students with GPAs of 3.8 or higher are eligible.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=208}} Degree candidates and alumni are also eligible to work at the [[Harvard Innovation Labs]].<ref name=\"Hi Lab\" />\n\nThe [[Harvard Extension Student Association]] (HESA) is the official acting student government for the Harvard Extension School and is the organization responsible for school's representation on the University's [[Harvard Graduate Council]]. All degree and diploma candidates in good standing at the school are voting members of HESA. Degree candidates are also eligible to be elected to HESA's Board of Directors. Established in 2001, HESA's mission is to build and maintain a sense of community among Extension students. In partnership with many other organizations on campus, HESA provides a variety of social activities, educational/networking events, and forums that enrich student life. HESA is in charge of managing officially sanctioned clubs within Harvard Extension School. Currently, there are two official clubs: Harvard Extension Student Environmental Club and Harvard Extension Student Management & Finance Club.<ref name=\"hesa\" />\n\n[[Drew Gilpin Faust|President Faust]] said that \"the Extension School is a critical part of the University\"<ref name=\"faustTalksHES\" /> and that \"students increasingly should come to see themselves as full-fledged members of not just an individual school but Harvard as a university.\"<ref name=\"24address\" />\n\n==Student demographics==\nThe class of 2019, the largest class to date, had 1,184 graduates.<ref name=\"2019grad\" /> The graduates had an average age of 37 and were nearly evenly split between the genders, with 54% being male.<ref name=\"2019grad\" /> 49 countries were represented in the graduating class.<ref name=\"2019grad\" />\n\nIn 2016, 96% of the students enrolled for professional enrichment.<ref name=\"serve\" /><ref name=\"young\" /> Half took a single course, and half were pursuing a degree.<ref name=\"serve\" /> The increase in online course offerings has fueled growth, and students from more than 150 countries are enrolled.<ref name=\"serve\" /> In 2017, the school educated more students than all of the rest of Harvard combined.<ref name=\"young\" />\n\nIn 2000, there were 14,216 students, with the youngest in their early teens and the oldest in their late 80s.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=199}}<ref name=\"open\" /> There is often a span of 60 years between the oldest and youngest students,{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=212}} and students as young as 11 years old have taken courses alongside those old enough to be their grandparents.<ref name=\"miller\" />  Of the students enrolled in 2000, 75% had a bachelor's degree and 20% had a graduate degree.  More than 1,700 were Harvard employees using the Tuition Assistance Program, and an estimated 10\u201315% were exclusively online students.  Of the 255 Certificate of Special Studies graduates that year, 163 were international students hailing from 39 countries.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=199}}\n\nIn the early 2000s, there were 208 students under the age of 18.{{sfn|Gates|2010}} Most attended local high schools, but a growing number of them were home-schooled.{{sfn|Gates|2010}} In 2018, a student from Kansas received his high school diploma and a bachelor's degree from the Extension School only a few days apart.<ref name=\"kansas\" />  The Extension School now requires that a high school diploma or its equivalent is earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any courses applicable to its undergraduate degree.<ref name=\"CDS-B\" /><ref name=\"kansas\" />\n\nHarvard Extension School accepts international students. To be admitted to courses or degrees, a student must prove proficiency in the English language. If English is not a student's native language then he or she must submit an official TOEFL or IELTS score with a minimum score of 100 for the TOEFL or a minimum score of 7.0 for the IELTS. International students must also meet the on-campus-only course requirements as outlined above.

His speech, \"The 10,000 Ghosts of Harvard,\" was a play on both the [[Ten Thousand Men of Harvard|university's fight song]] and the fact that classes are taught after dark.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=138}}  In 1989, another ALM graduate gave the commencement address. [[Joseph R. Paolino Jr.]] began his studies as a Providence city councilor, and at the time of his speech, he was the Mayor of Providence.

At the top of the shield the three books spelling out ''Veritas'' (Latin for \"truth\") represent graduate education, as the same device is found on the arms of the other graduate schools.  Instead of a straight line separating it from the rest of the shield, as is found in the other schools, a line with six arcs pointing up was used instead.  A silver chevron was used to represent undergraduate education, a device used in the shield of Harvard College in the 17th to 19th centuries.  Two bushels of wheat are included to represent John Lowell's stipulation that courses should not cost more than two bushels of wheat.  A golden lamp is included to represent both learning and the fact that some classes are taught at night.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=137}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Princeton\">{{cite web| url = http://www.princeton.edu/hpa/post-bac-programs/career-changer/| title = Career Change Programs| publisher = The Trustees of [[Princeton University]]| accessdate = December 22, 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"fodors\">{{cite book| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307929235| url-access = registration| quote = harvard extension.| title = Fodor's Boston| first1 = Debbie | last1 = Harmsen| first2 = Maria Teresa | last2 = Hart| publisher = Fodors Travel Pub.| year = 2012| isbn = 9780307929235}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"fortune\">{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=qb50AQAAQBAJ&dq=%22harvard+extension%22| title = Fortune Tellers: The Story of America's First Economic Forecasters| first = Walter | last = Friedman| publisher = Princeton University Press| date = November 28, 2013| isbn = 9781400849864}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"felder\">{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_nVsqM5NxEYC&dq=%22harvard+extension%22| title = Felder's Comprehensive, 2005 Edition: The Annual Desk Reference and Product Thesaurus for Architects, Contractors, Engineers, and Interior Designers| first = Nick | last = Felder| date = July 14, 2005| accessdate = December 22, 2014| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press| isbn = 9781568984742}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"2019grad\">{{cite web| url = https://www.extension.harvard.edu/2019-harvard-extension-commencement| title = Harvard Extension Commencement 2019| publisher = Harvard Extension School| accessdate = December 16, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"CDS-B\">{{cite web|url=https://www.extension.harvard.edu/registration-admissions/degree-program-admissions/undergraduate-degree-program-admissions|title=Undergraduate Degree Program Admissions|publisher=Harvard Extension School}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"2016grad\">{{cite web | url = http://www.extension.harvard.edu/inside-extension/harvard-extension-school-class-2016-numbers | title = Harvard Extension School Class of 2016 by the Numbers | type = Infographic | publisher = President and Fellows of Harvard College | accessdate = May 24, 2016 | date = 2016-05-23}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"363rd\">{{cite web | url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/05/7334-degrees-certificates-awarded-at-harvards-363rd-commencement | title = 7,334 degrees, certificates awarded at Harvard's 363rd Commencement | date = May 29, 2014 | accessdate = December 11, 2014 | publisher = Harvard Gazette}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"admit\">{{cite web | url = https://www.extension.harvard.edu/tuition-enrollment/degree-program-admission | title = Degree Program Admission | publisher = Harvard Extension School | accessdate = November 18, 2015 | date = 2015-04-08}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Albion\">{{cite news | title=Harvard Univ.

Under the [[Faculty of Arts and Sciences]], individual courses among the school's [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] and professional offerings, a number of which have [[Harvard College]] equivalents, are open-enrollment. However, the Extension School also offers [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate degrees]], [[Graduate school|graduate degrees]], and [[Academic certificate|certificates]] in more than 60 fields of study, provided that a qualifying test is passed, satisfactory grades are obtained in prior Harvard coursework, and a formal application is accepted. Degree candidates and alumni enjoy access to Harvard's many amenities and opportunities.\n\nThe school offers on-campus, online, and hybrid courses. It also offers a pre-medical program for students needing specific coursework to apply to medical school. The school is primarily intended for nontraditional adult learners.\n\nSince its establishment in 1910, an estimated 500,000 students have taken courses at the Extension School. Of these, 0.18% earned a degree.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=214}}\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:1em\"\n|-\n! Year<ref name=\"gates\" /> !!

Lawrence Lowell]], the Harvard Extension School grew out of the [[Lowell Institute]], which was created according to the terms of a bequest by John Lowell, Jr.  It was designed to serve the educational interests and needs of the greater [[Boston]] community,{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=220}} particularly those \"who had the ability and desire to attend college, but also had other obligations that kept them from traditional schools.\"<ref name=\"sampler\" />  It has since extended its academic resources to the public, locally, nationally, and internationally.\n\nDuring the 1920s [[professor]]s from [[Boston University]] and [[Harvard University]] traveled to teach courses offsite.<ref name=\"Yonkers\" /> While they were primarily aimed at teachers, courses were offered wherever 40 or more students expressed an interest.<ref name=\"Yonkers\" />  Professors traveled on a weekly basis to places around New England and as far away as [[Yonkers, New York]],<ref name=\"Yonkers\" /> some 200 miles away.\n\nIn the early years courses were run by a commission composed of several Boston area schools, though it was largely a Harvard-run program.<ref name=\"wheat\" />{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=54}}{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=104}}  In 1938 there were 28 professors from Commission faculties, including 11 full professors.<ref name=\"courses\" />  Early faculty included [[Charles Townsend Copeland]], [[William Yandell Elliot]], [[William L. Langer]], [[Oscar Handlin]], [[Perry Miller]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and [[Frank M. Carpenter]].{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=52}} In 1953 there was a similar number of professors.<ref name=\"wheat\" />\n\nIn his will, John Lowell asked his successors to set up courses \"more erudite and particular corresponding to the age and wants of the age.\"<ref name=\"wheat\" />  By the 50th anniversary of the University Extension in 1960, more than 1,400 courses had been offered and there had been more than 85,000 enrollments.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=81}} Lowell's bequest limited the cost of tuition to no more than two bushels of wheat. During the [[Great Depression]] this amounted to roughly $5 per semester course.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=50}}\n\nSeveral years after retiring, President Lowell wrote that the Extension courses \"have given a service to the public&nbsp;... which seems to me of the utmost importance.\"{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=225}}  In 2013, more than 100 years after its founding, the Extension School's classes were described as \"surprisingly affordable\"<ref name=\"fodors\" /> and the school itself was said to be a \"thriving institution.\"<ref name=\"fortune\" />\n\n===Degree development===\nThe Extension School currently offers two degrees (and has offered these degrees since 1979): the [[Bachelor of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALB) and the [[Master of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALM).<ref name=\"century\" />  From 1911 to 1933, the school offered an Associate in Arts, and from 1933 to 1960, it offered an Adjunct in Arts.<ref name=\"century\" />  Both were considered the [[History of Harvard Extension School#Extension grows|equivalent of a bachelor's degree]].<ref name=\"century\" /> From 1971 to 2014, the school offered an Associate of Arts in Extension Studies (AA), the equivalent of a two-year degree.<ref name=\"century\" />\n\nA proposal before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 2009 and 2010 to rename the school and the degrees offered was not accepted.<ref name=\"sinjin\" /><ref name=\"rename\" />  A committee led by Professor of Computer Science [[Harry R. Lewis]] proposed renaming the school the \"Harvard School of Continuing and Professional Studies\" and dropping the words \"in Extension Studies\" from degrees so that the school would offer Bachelor of Liberal Arts, Master of Liberal Arts, and Master of Professional Studies degrees. Some faculty objected, saying that those degrees were too similar to degrees already offered by the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.<ref name=\"rename\" />\n\nIn 2016, a student group calling itself the Harvard Extension Degree Change Initiative rallied in front of [[University Hall (Harvard University)|University Hall]] to call for removing \u201cExtension Studies\u201d from the degree name and adding a student's field of study instead.<ref name=\"extendingDegree\" /> ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' editorialized in favor, urging Harvard to \"consider changing the title of Extension School degrees to include the field of study rather than the ambiguous 'Extension Studies.'\"<ref name=\"extendingDegree\" /> While the school retains \"Extension Studies\" in official degree titles, transcripts reflect students' area of academic concentration.\n\nIn 2019, Dean [[Huntington D.

Students take courses with Harvard affiliates (instructors have included [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]]), as well as faculty from other Boston-area universities, business professionals, and community leaders in various fields.<ref name=\"Practical\" /> The number of courses offered has continuously grown over the school's history.\n\nSome of the courses at the Extension School are \"virtually identical\"<ref name=\"Practical\" /><ref name=\"felder\" /> to courses offered to the traditional students at [[Harvard College]], with \"the only significant difference\" being that many of the classes are taught in the evening or at night instead of during the day.<ref name=\"Practical\" /> Ropes, the school's first dean, said that \"our aim will be to give the young people of Boston who have heretofore been prevented from securing a college education the same instruction they would receive were they undergraduates at Harvard.\"{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=30}} \n\nMany daytime Harvard College courses are recorded and offered to Extension students online. For these courses, office hours and other student support are typically offered using live or asynchronous software. Additionally, Extension students are offered the option to attend class lectures for these dual-listed courses on campus. Extension degree candidates who meet required criteria may also apply for \"Special Student status\" to enroll for up to two courses in Harvard College, Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or another Harvard Graduate School.<ref name=\"Tv75F\" /> The majority of instructors at the school, 52%, are Harvard affiliates; 48% are faculty from other schools and industry professionals.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nStudents may enroll full or part-time, and classes may be taken on campus, via distance-learning, or both. In order to earn an academic degree, students must complete a minimum number of on-campus-only credits at Harvard.{{efn|n.b. These requirements vary for each degree, from 4 classes in residency for the ALB or the ALM/Biology, two semesters residency requirement for the general ALM, and up to 50% residency requirement for the ALM/Management. It is therefore not possible to receive an academic degree solely through distance learning.}}\n\nNon-degree students have access to the [[Harvard Library]], including electronic resources and select computer facilities.<ref name=\"resources\" /> Those registered for a course at the Extension School may also access writing tutorials at the Writing Center as well as assistance with math and related courses at the Math Question Center.<ref name=\"resources\" /><ref name=\"KrErQ\" /><ref name=\"Hq1IU\" /> Career services and academic advising are offered through the school's Career and Academic Resource Center.<ref name=\"resources\" /><ref name=\"DW0rC\" />\n\n===Accreditation and partnerships===\nHarvard Extension School is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] as one of the twelve degree-granting schools of [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"young\" />\n\nThe Extension School and [[Harvard Business School]] have together created the HBX Credential of Readiness (CORe) program.<ref name=\"sean\" /><ref name=\"hbx\" /> Having begun in 2014, this program allows undergraduate students at the Extension School to take courses with Business School professors for credit.<ref name=\"sean\" /><ref name=\"hbx\" />\n\nThe graduate program in Museum Studies has developed a partnership with the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name=\"smithsonian\" />  The new courses include two active learning weekends in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"smithsonian\" />  The Extension School is also looking into partnerships with the [[Harvard School of Public Health|School of Public Health]], the [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], and the [[Harvard Medical School|Medical School]].<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\n===Pre-medical program===\nA [[pre-med]] program was established at the Extension School in 1980.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=129}} Students who successfully complete the pre-medical program are eligible for sponsorship through the program and a committee letter of support in their applications to medical school.<ref name=\"Princeton\" /><ref name=\"jIJ1T\" />\n\n===Distance education===\n\n====History====\nHarvard Extension was a pioneer in [[distance education]].<ref name=\"young\" /> Beginning on December 5, 1949, courses were offered on the [[Lowell Institute|Lowell Institute's]] new radio station. New Englanders could go to college six nights a week at 7:30 in their living rooms simply by tuning into courses on psychology, world history, and economics.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=70}} The first course on radio was by Peter A. Bertocci of Boston University. For 30 years he taught Extension courses, with never fewer than 100 students. He often taught over 300 students per course and once had over 400. Over the years Bertocci taught at least 7,000 Extension students, a record for the school.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=71}}\n\nThe radio courses proved to be so successful that when the television station [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] went on the air in October 1951 they began broadcasting an Extension class every weekday at 3:30 and 7:30.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=72}} The first course, offered by [[Robert G. Albion]], was on European Imperialism on Monday and Thursday evenings.<ref name=\"Albion\" /> In the late 1960s, three of the televised courses were offered in the [[Deer Island Prison]].{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=102}} Students who watched the courses on television could attend six \"conferences\" and take a mid-term and a final exam at Harvard in order to gain credit for the class.<ref name=\"Albion\" />\n\n====Contemporary====\n{{As of|2014}}, distance-learning courses at Harvard Extension School are offered in two formats: asynchronous video courses (lectures are recorded and uploaded within 24 hours of on-campus class meetings); and live web-conference courses (courses are streamed live, and typically allow for synchronous participation from students via a secondary online platform).\n\nThe first online courses were offered in 1997.<ref name=\"serve\" />  Between 2013 and 2016, the number of online classes grew from 200 to more than 450.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\n===Awards and honors===\nThe Dean's Prize for Outstanding Master of Liberal Arts thesis is awarded during [[Graduation|commencement ceremonies]], and includes a medal, a certificate, and a monetary award. It is awarded to a student whose graduate thesis \"embodies the highest level of imaginative scholarship.\"<ref name=\"outstanding\" /> In addition to the Dean's Prize for Outstanding ALM Thesis, there are several other academic prizes:<ref name=\"awards\" /><ref name=\"N841C\" />\n\n*The Academy of American Poets is awarded to an ALB candidate or an undergraduate student at the college for the best poem or group of poems.\n*The Santo J. Aurelio Prize is awarded to an ALB degree recipient aged 50 or older; this prize acknowledges distinguished and unique records of academic achievement and character.\n*The [[Derek Bok Public Service Prizes]] are awards presented at Commencement. They consist of a cash prize along with a citation and a medal given to graduating Extension School students. The award recognizes creative initiatives in community service or long-standing records of civic achievement.<ref name=\"honors\" />\n*The Commencement Speaker Prize is awarded to either an ALB or ALM graduate who delivers the student Commencement speech at the Extension School diploma awarding ceremony.\n*The Annamae and Allan R. Crite Prize is awarded to ALM (liberal arts field) or ALB graduates who concentrate in visual arts or other artistic fields on the basis of academic achievement and dedication to learning and the arts.\n*The Klein Family History Prize recognizes the thesis in the field of history that represents superior achievement in historical scholarship. \n*The Harold Langlois Award recognizes an ALM management or finance graduate who has demonstrated exceptional academic accomplishment and promise as a manager. Based upon highest cumulative GPA.\n*The Patrick Lee Award in Drama is an annual award given to the student who shows the best promise in the field of dramatic arts.\n*The Reginald H. Phelps Prize, named for the former dean, is awarded annually on the basis of \"academic achievement and character\" to outstanding graduating students receiving bachelor's degrees.\n*The John Osborne Sargent Prize for a Latin Translation is offered for the best metrical translation [students may choose meter] of a lyric poem of Horace, to be selected each year by the Department of the Classics. In addition to ALB candidates, it is also open to undergraduates at the College and visiting undergraduates under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n*The Thomas Small Prize is named for a Lithuanian immigrant who, at the age of 89, became the oldest earned graduate degree recipient in the history of Harvard University. Two prizes are awarded annually on the basis \"academic achievement and character\" to two outstanding Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies degree recipients.\n* The Judith Wood Memorial Prizes are awarded during Commencement Week to Harvard Extension School students who, while compiling honors academic records at the school, also contended with disabilities of a serious nature. It was established in honor of a blind Extension Student student who had cystic fibrosis and diabetes to recognize students who must travel a singularly difficult path to degree or certificate completion. \n*The Katie Y.F. Yang Prize is awarded annually to the international ALM management or finance graduate with the most outstanding academic record.\n\n==Degree programs==\nTo be eligible to apply to the Extension School's degree programs, students must \"earn [their] way in\" by passing the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills as well as completing two or three designated admission classes with a B or better.<ref name=\"serve\" /> In 2016, Dean [[Huntington D. Lambert]] said that 32% of those who want to pursue an undergraduate degree (ALB) earn the grades necessary for admission, making admissions \"very selective.\"<ref name=\"serve\" />\nIf the admission requirements are met, acceptance is not guaranteed but very likely. About 85% of those admitted successfully earn their degree (ALB).<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nIt has been estimated that acceptance into the graduate programs (ALM), using the number of accepted students and the number of students enrolled in admission courses, is 15-20%. Thus, based on traditional metrics, admission into the graduate programs is highly selective.\n\nALB students may graduate ''cum laude'', but ''magna''- and ''summa''- ''cum laude'' are not offered. Extension students may earn the Dean's List Academic Achievement Award upon graduation based on a high GPA (at least 3.5 for ALB, 3.8 for ALM).<ref name=\"RFSwK\" /> Many courses are offered online, but a degree cannot be earned entirely online as students are required to take classes on campus before earning their degree.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nStudents who wish to earn degrees must be formally admitted to the Extension School by the Admissions Committee.<ref name=\"open\" />  Admitted degree candidates are granted full privileges to Harvard's libraries, facilities, student resources, as well as access to Harvard's museums and academic workshops. In 2016, an undergraduate degree cost around $40,000, and a graduate degree cost about $25,000.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\n===Bachelor of Liberal Arts===\nThe undergraduate curriculum is similar to the curriculum for [[Harvard College]] students; requirements include expository writing, quantitative reasoning, foreign language, moral reasoning, upper-level coursework, and an area of concentration.<ref name=\"solid\" />  The expository writing class is known as a \"gatekeeper course\" as it will typically \"determine whether [students] are prepared for the intensive and demanding curriculum.\"<ref name=\"open\" />\n\nOnce admitted as an ALB degree candidate, students must successfully complete 128 credits<ref name=\"extension.harvard_b\" /> (Harvard courses are typically 4 credits each) and maintain good academic standing to meet graduation requirements.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" />  Upon admission into the ALB program, students may petition to transfer up to a maximum of 64 credits from other accredited post-secondary institutions, but 64 credits must be completed at Harvard.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" /> Students select one of three \"areas of concentration\" which are humanities, science, and social sciences.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" />\n\nALB degree candidates are also required to complete a minimum of 16 on-campus-only credits at Harvard;<ref name=\"extension.harvard_e\" /> students must also complete a minimum of 12 writing-intensive credits and earn a minimum of 52 credits in courses that are taught by Harvard instructors.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_b\" /> In addition to a concentration, degree candidates have the option to pursue one of twenty \"fields of study\" (similar to majors).<ref name=\"fields\" /> In order to successfully complete a field of study, students must earn a B\u2013 or higher in 32 Harvard credits in one field, and maintain a B average in the field.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" /> Students may also complement their degree with up to two minors.<ref name=\"fields\" />\n\n====Undergraduate admissions====\nUndergraduate degree programs require pre-admission courses as well as a formal application process. <ref name=\"admit\" /> Students must also hold a \"high school diploma or its equivalent [which] must have been earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any ALB degree-applicable courses.\"<ref name=\"GZvkR\" /> Students applying for degree candidacy must complete three 4-credit liberal arts courses at Harvard (Extension School, Summer School, or the Faculty of Arts and Sciences) with at least a B grade in each, and maintain a minimum 3.0 cumulative [[grade point average|GPA]]. One of these three pre-admission courses must be EXPO E-25, the equivalent of Harvard College's mandatory and \"notoriously difficult\" expository writing course.<ref name=\"expos20\" /> To enroll in this course, students must either pass a placement test, which measures critical reading and writing skills, or enroll in EXPO E-15 (a course that acts as a precursor to EXPO E-25).<ref name=\"admit\" />  Students failing to earn at least a B in a class can retake it once. Those who meet all these criteria are then eligible to apply for admission into the school's undergraduate degree programs.\n\n===Master of Liberal Arts===\nThe [[Master of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALM) includes 19 liberal arts fields of study and seven professional degree programs (Biotechnology, Information Technology, Journalism, Management, Mathematics for Teaching, Museum Studies, & Sustainability).<ref name=\"grad\" /> Except for Museum Studies (10 courses), all ALM candidates must complete 12 courses, with most requiring a thesis or capstone project crafted under the direction of an instructor or faculty member holding a teaching appointment in the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=\"thesis\" />\n\n====Graduate admissions====\nAdmission into a graduate degree program requires an accredited bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent), passing the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills, the completion of two or three pre-admission courses with grades of B or higher, and a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0. One of the pre-admission courses must be the \"proseminar\" course for the intended area of study, which is akin to a traditional research methods course.<ref name=\"admit\" /> Certain disciplines have other specified pre-admission coursework, while some have specific coursework that is required before submitting a master's thesis proposal (biology and psychology students must take a specific graduate statistics course). Some programs require supplemental application materials; for instance, Creative Writing and Literature ALM candidates must submit original manuscripts.<ref name=\"apply\" /> Students who meet these criteria are then eligible to submit an application for admission into the graduate degree programs (ALM).\n\nA student who fails to earn a grade of B after twice enrolling in the proseminar course\u2014often considered a \"gatekeeper\" course\u2014will be denied admission indefinitely.<ref name=\"8G1Pv\" />\n\n==Student life==\nBeginning in the 1960s, the university began providing additional facilities for Extension students.  Study spaces, conferences rooms, library facilities, and a dining hall were set up in Lehman Hall for students in 1964.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=111}}  In addition, there was a television lounge where students could watch the WGBH programs.<ref name=\"banner1967\" />\n\nToday, admitted degree candidates are granted access to Harvard's athletic facilities, libraries, and career services, among other amenities. Students have \"nearly unfettered access to some of Harvard's most prized resources\u2014world-renowned libraries, a distinguished faculty, and an impressive body of speakers.\"<ref name=\"wells\" /> The top 10 percent of the undergraduate (ALB) graduating class in good standing is inducted into the Harvard Extension School's Phi Beta chapter (established 2002\u201303) of [[Alpha Sigma Lambda]], the national honor society for nontraditional students. Ordinarily, undergraduate students with GPAs of 3.8 or higher are eligible.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=208}} Degree candidates and alumni are also eligible to work at the [[Harvard Innovation Labs]].<ref name=\"Hi Lab\" />\n\nThe [[Harvard Extension Student Association]] (HESA) is the official acting student government for the Harvard Extension School and is the organization responsible for school's representation on the University's [[Harvard Graduate Council]]. All degree and diploma candidates in good standing at the school are voting members of HESA. Degree candidates are also eligible to be elected to HESA's Board of Directors. Established in 2001, HESA's mission is to build and maintain a sense of community among Extension students. In partnership with many other organizations on campus, HESA provides a variety of social activities, educational/networking events, and forums that enrich student life. HESA is in charge of managing officially sanctioned clubs within Harvard Extension School. Currently, there are two official clubs: Harvard Extension Student Environmental Club and Harvard Extension Student Management & Finance Club.<ref name=\"hesa\" />\n\n[[Drew Gilpin Faust|President Faust]] said that \"the Extension School is a critical part of the University\"<ref name=\"faustTalksHES\" /> and that \"students increasingly should come to see themselves as full-fledged members of not just an individual school but Harvard as a university.\"<ref name=\"24address\" />\n\n==Student demographics==\nThe class of 2019, the largest class to date, had 1,184 graduates.<ref name=\"2019grad\" /> The graduates had an average age of 37 and were nearly evenly split between the genders, with 54% being male.<ref name=\"2019grad\" /> 49 countries were represented in the graduating class.<ref name=\"2019grad\" />\n\nIn 2016, 96% of the students enrolled for professional enrichment.<ref name=\"serve\" /><ref name=\"young\" /> Half took a single course, and half were pursuing a degree.<ref name=\"serve\" /> The increase in online course offerings has fueled growth, and students from more than 150 countries are enrolled.<ref name=\"serve\" /> In 2017, the school educated more students than all of the rest of Harvard combined.<ref name=\"young\" />\n\nIn 2000, there were 14,216 students, with the youngest in their early teens and the oldest in their late 80s.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=199}}<ref name=\"open\" /> There is often a span of 60 years between the oldest and youngest students,{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=212}} and students as young as 11 years old have taken courses alongside those old enough to be their grandparents.<ref name=\"miller\" />  Of the students enrolled in 2000, 75% had a bachelor's degree and 20% had a graduate degree.  More than 1,700 were Harvard employees using the Tuition Assistance Program, and an estimated 10\u201315% were exclusively online students.  Of the 255 Certificate of Special Studies graduates that year, 163 were international students hailing from 39 countries.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=199}}\n\nIn the early 2000s, there were 208 students under the age of 18.{{sfn|Gates|2010}} Most attended local high schools, but a growing number of them were home-schooled.{{sfn|Gates|2010}} In 2018, a student from Kansas received his high school diploma and a bachelor's degree from the Extension School only a few days apart.<ref name=\"kansas\" />  The Extension School now requires that a high school diploma or its equivalent is earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any courses applicable to its undergraduate degree.<ref name=\"CDS-B\" /><ref name=\"kansas\" />\n\nHarvard Extension School accepts international students. To be admitted to courses or degrees, a student must prove proficiency in the English language.

At the top of the shield the three books spelling out ''Veritas'' (Latin for \"truth\") represent graduate education, as the same device is found on the arms of the other graduate schools.  Instead of a straight line separating it from the rest of the shield, as is found in the other schools, a line with six arcs pointing up was used instead.

He played a significant though understated role in the nationalist attempt to preserve a non-communist Vietnam.\n\nThe website [http://www.tonthatthien.com T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n (1924-2014)] presents a complete bibliography and almost 400 collected articles, book excerpts, editorials, letters, interview transcripts and poetry.\n \nFrom 1945 to 1975 Thien was an active participant or a personal witness to almost all of the major historic events in Vietnam: the 1945 [[August Revolution]], the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]], division of the country and birth of the [[Republic of Vietnam]], the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|1963 coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] in Hu\u1ebf and the April 1975 [[Fall of Saigon]].\n\nHe knew or met virtually all of the significant actors among the North Vietnamese, South Vietnamese and American political and military leadership, as well as most foreign journalists who covered the conflict.\n\nIn 1968 he served as Minister of Information in the [[South Vietnam]]ese  government.

Described by [[Daniel Ellsberg]] as an \"outstanding Vietnamese journalist\",<ref>Daniel Ellsberg, ''A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers'', Penguin, 2003, p. 176</ref> he was a leading supporter of freedom of the press and vociferous in his belief that the most effective strategy in fighting the Communists was to counter their claim to be the true and only nationalists fighting for Vietnam's national independence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyThienTon.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref>  His life saw the span of cataclysmic political and social changes in Vietnam from titular imperial rule under French colonialism to nationalist republican government to eventual communist rule.\n\nIn his life and writings, Thi\u1ec7n upheld the ideals drawn from the old, essentially Confucian traditions of the country - service to society, rule of customs and laws and orderly government.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  At the same time, he advocated the western ideals of modernity, progress, freedom and democracy developed from his contact with western culture through his studies in Hu\u1ebf, London and Geneva. His conception of Viet Nam's post-colonial society echoed that of Phan Chu Trinh, a leading Vietnamese nationalist and Confucian scholar of the early 20th century who nevertheless supported modernization through unreserved westernization.\n\nA generation of domestic and foreign journalists in the 1950s and 1960s were influenced by Thi\u1ec7n's English-language critiques of the political crises in Vietnam, the political and social dynamics of the conflict and the consequent cultural impact.  As an independent political commentator after 1966 he could be equally critical of misguided South Vietnamese government policies and abuses and the heavy-handedness of U.S. intervention in Viet Nam. His writings on the Vietnamese communist threat and the negative impact of American cultural, economic and political interventions showed a balanced and analytical approach that was recognized as distinctive in its time.\n\nU.S. Ambassador [[Ellsworth Bunker]]'s assessment of Thi\u1ec7n upon his appointment to the South Vietnamese cabinet in 1968 established the stature he held in foreign and Vietnamese political and social circles:\n  \n<blockquote>The new Minister of Information, Ton That Thien, has been described as one of the best economists and one of the most articulate and intelligent of all Vietnamese in Saigon.  He has also been known as a well informed, articulate critic of both the U.S. and G.V.N; but he is a man of ability, energy, and patriotism, and is certainly not anti-American. He should be a very considerable improvement over his predecessor, Tran Van An, who has been ineffectual in this important post.<ref>Douglas Pike, editor, ''The Bunker Papers, Reports to the President from Vietnam 1967-1973'', 3 vol., Institute of East Asian Studies.  University of California at Berkeley, 1990. Volume 2, Page 453</ref>\n</blockquote>\n \nIn 1945-1946 Thi\u1ec7n personally witnessed the momentous events which were to mark Viet Nam's post-war history: the overthrow of French rule by the Japanese and Emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]]'s proclamation of the termination of the French protectorate over Viet Nam (March 1945), the formation of the first independent government of Viet Nam (April 1945), Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's abdication in Hu\u1ebf (August 1945) and Ho Chi Minh's declaration of independence in Hanoi (September 1945), the arrival of the Americans and the Chinese (September 1945), the return of the French (March 1946), and the breaking out of the Franco-Vietnamese war (December 1946). He served for a year in Ho's administration before quitting upon realizing the true communist nature of the Viet-Minh United Front government headed by Ho Chi Minh. He was one of the first few non-Communist Vietnamese to perceive the August Revolution as a [[Leninist]] cover for the introduction of communism to Viet Nam as a part of a world revolution.<ref>Ton That Thien, The Foreign Politics of The Communist Party of Vietnam:  A Study of Communist Tactics, p. 177</ref>\n\nIn 1947 he went to Europe to resume his studies. Although he distanced himself from the Ho-led Viet Minh government, he did not support the various B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i-led governments.  Like many other nationalists at that time he faced a dilemma in terms of where to direct support for Vietnamese independence. Supporting Ho would be to abet communism, and supporting B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i would be to prolong French colonialism. In his view, neither Ho nor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i were true nationalists.  As a result, he remained non-committed to either side throughout the war until Ngo Dinh Diem became Prime Minister of the State of Viet Nam in June 1954. He considered Mr. Diem a true nationalist.\n\nThien served as press aide to Ngo Dinh Diem, and was with him when he was overthrown in an American-condoned military coup on 1 November 1963.  Despite this close and loyal association, in the aftermath of the coup he was not persecuted by the coup leaders and the post-coup governments. In 1964 he voluntarily left government service to take up journalism, working for Vietnamese as well as foreign newspapers. In 1967, he accepted a professorship at Van Hanh University in Saigon. In 1968 he served briefly as Minister of Information during which time he enacted libertarian reforms that removed all government censorship.  In the same year he was awarded the Magsaysay Award in Manila for \"significant contributions\" to journalism, literature and creative communication arts in Asia.\n\nIn April 1975, just before the fall of Saigon to communist forces he went into exile in Quebec, Canada.  After a university teaching career at the University of Quebec, Trois Rivieres campus, he retired in Ottawa in 1992.  He continued to write on Vietnamese social and political issues, in particular on the necessity \u2013 first advocated by Phan Chu Trinh - of making the appropriate changes in culture to enable Vietnamese to acquire the values required for rapid development, the basic condition of the advancement of the Vietnamese people.\n\nContrary to many educated Vietnamese, in his writings Thi\u1ec7n considered development to be the primary objective of Vietnam, with independence as only a secondary objective.<ref name=\"Ton That Thien p. 60\">Ton That Thien, The Foreign Politics of The Communist Party of Vietnam:  A Study of Communist Tactics, p. 60</ref> In his view, it was this error in setting the priority of objectives which led to the costly and lengthy wars from 1945 to 1975.  He viewed these national traumas as unnecessary for the country to achieve freedom and independence, but indispensable for the Communists to secure and retain power.  He held the Communist Party accountable for this development and saw the consequence as the ruin of the country, the exhaustion of its people, and the establishment of a brutal dictatorship.<ref name=\"Ton That Thien p. 60\"/>\n\nThroughout the political upheavals from the 1945 August Revolution to his exile in 1975, T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n remained consistently committed to his political and nationalist convictions and active in the political discourse of South Viet Nam.  After the fall of the Ngo Dinh Diem administration he remained unattached to any political party or movement despite offers of government appointments.  The ''Viet Nam Guardian'', of which he was managing editor, maintained private ownership and an independent editorial policy.\n\n== Early life and education: 1924\u201345 ==\n\nBorn on September 22, 1924 in Hu\u1ebf, the imperial capital of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]], T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n was descended from a family with a long history of service to the state. His ancestry can be traced to Nguyen B\u1ea1c, a close adviser to Emperor [[\u0110inh Ti\u00ean Ho\u00e0ng]] (r. 968-979), a founder of independent Viet Nam in the 10th century; and to [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng]], founder of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, which ruled over most of Vietnam for almost four centuries (1600-1945).  His grandfather was a military officer (born in 1835, in the reign of Emperor [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]]) who served Emperor [[T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c]] (1847\u20131883), fought against the French in [[Cochinchina]] (1860), the battle of Thuan An (1883), and the failed coup staged by [[T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thuy\u1ebft]] against the French (1885), and ended his career as a general in the reign of Emperor [[Th\u00e0nh Th\u00e1i]] (1889\u20131907).  His father T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Qu\u1ea3ng (1883\u20131972) served for thirty years in the Imperial government, rising to the rank of Minister, in charge of Rites. He retired in 1942, only three years before the end of the Vietnamese monarchy, and was thus the last but one Minister of Rites Ministry of Rites in Vietnam's long history.  Thien was influenced by the Confucian philosophy followed by his father and the Buddhist beliefs of his mother.\n\nIn Hu\u1ebf he attended a \"franco-indig\u00e8ne\" \u2013 half Vietnamese, half French - elementary school, then a Catholic high school and the state-run Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh College. The last two establishments were \"modern\" schools which eliminated Chinese script and Confucian ideas and introduced a French education standard curriculum with French as the medium of instruction. Thien was thereby introduced to Western political and social ideas, graduating with a Baccalaureate of Philosophy in 1944.  Plans for medical studies in Hanoi were interrupted in March 1945 when the Japanese occupying forces took over control of the country from the French.  With no other transportation available he rode his bicycle the 400 miles from Hanoi to Hu\u1ebf.  Along the way he witnessed the terrible effects of a famine estimated to have killed over one million Vietnamese in 1944/45.  This traumatic experience convinced him to switch his course of studies from medicine to economics on the understanding he could thereby help more people.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Revolution and education: 1945\u201355 ==\n\nIn April 1945, after the French colonial administration was ended by a Japanese coup, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i set up the first independent government of Viet Nam led by Mr. [[Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim]]. A well known lawyer, Phan Anh was appointed Minister of Youth and Thien served as his personal secretary. This marked Thien's first introduction to Vietnamese politics, at the age of twenty-one.\n\nAfter the abdication of Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i in late August 1945, on the recommendation of Mr. Ta Quang Buu he was called to Hanoi to serve in the new Viet Minh National Front Government led by Ho Chi Minh. Fluent in English he was posted in the Foreign Relations section of the president's office headed by Mr. Buu. The latter had been his teacher of English and rated him as the best of the class. More noteworthy still, Mr. Buu was an assistant to [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] and had access to the top echelons of the leadership. Thien was thus placed close to the power center. This inclusion in the workings of the inner circle of the highest level of the Viet Minh leadership enabled him to observe at close quarters the core Viet Minh leadership in Hanoi including Ho Chi Minh, V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, [[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh]], [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]] as well as many of the foreign officials in Hanoi at the time including [[Archimedes Patti]] of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS). It also allowed him to understand the Communist Party of Vietnam's manipulation of the nationalist front as a means to secure power.  He was one of the first few non-Communist Vietnamese to have this understanding at that time.\n\nThien's work was varied.  He translated and typed government documents, and served as an announcer and commentator for Hanoi Radio's English language service \"The Voice of Viet Nam\", thereby becoming practically the first Vietnamese to address the English speaking world.  He also was a major contributor to the magazine of the Vietnamese-American Friendship Association (VAFA) launched by Ta Quang Buu and General Gallagher at a time when Ho Chi Minh was courting American support for the Viet Minh government and its continued independence from French colonial rule.\n\nDismissive of communist ideology from his economics studies and unable to support the radical political aims of Ho Chi Minh which included on-going systematic persecution of Vietnamese nationalists, he left Hanoi and returned to Hu\u1ebf in late 1946.  In 1947 he went abroad to study.  He continued to morally support the anti-French aims of the Viet Minh until 1950 when the Ho-led Viet Minh forces unreservedly turned to communist China for material and advisory support, and Ho Chi Minh publicly proclaimed Vietnam \"the forward post of socialism in South-east-Asia\" and the Vietnamese Communist Party re-emerged under the thin guise of the \"Lao Dong\" (Worker's) Party. From then on Thien distanced himself from the Viet Minh government, remained aloof from the various political formations, and concentrated on his studies. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics at the London School of Economics and a master's degree in Political Science at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in Geneva. He maintained his political neutrality until 1953. In October of that year, he met Mr. Ngo Dinh Diem in Paris and judged him to be a true nationalist leader.  He also learned that Mr. Diem was going to be appointed by B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i as the next Prime Minister of the non-communist State of Viet Nam.\n\n== Government service: 1954\u201364 ==\n\nIn May 1954, Thien joined the South Vietnamese delegation as an observer at the Geneva Conference. He then assisted at close quarters in the Vietnam-French negotiations in Paris regarding the transfer of control of major state organs to the new government.  In Saigon he served as press secretary and official interpreter for Prime Minister, then President, Ngo Dinh Diem. For a brief period in 1955-1956 he went abroad, serving at the Vietnamese embassy in Paris where he got married.  In the fall of 1955 he went to the U.S. where he was an instructor at Michigan State University which was initiating a major government contract to provide technical assistance to Ngo Dinh Diem's administration.  Upon returning to Saigon in May 1956, he resumed his former duties. In his capacity as presidential press officer, he was the first government point of contact for American journalists reporting on the new state. He came to know almost all foreign correspondents posted in Viet Nam in those years.\n\nIn October 1959, Thien returned to Geneva for doctoral studies, graduating in June 1963 with a Doctorate in Political Science.  While there, he was a member of the South Vietnamese delegation to the Geneva Conference on Laos in 1961 and 1962.  He returned to Saigon in mid-July 1963 as Director General of the Vietnam Press, a position he held until 1964.\n\nAs a close aide to Ngo Dinh Diem, he was with the President on 1 November 1963 when the South Vietnamese military successfully launched a coup d'\u00e9tat which was condoned by the U.S. government.  Ton That Thien witnessed the last meeting conducted between President Diem and Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] on the occasion of a courtesy call on the President by Admiral Harry Felt.  Thien observed that the Ambassador kept the President preoccupied in discussions from 10.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. The coup was initiated at 01.00 p.m.<ref>Michael Maclear, ''Vietnam'', p. 101</ref>\n\n== Journalism, teaching and government service: 1964\u201375 ==\n\nIn August 1964 Thien left government service to take up journalism.  He worked for the respected English language newspaper the ''Saigon Daily News'', then for the ''Viet Nam Guardian'', owned by a like-minded friend. As managing editor and columnist at both papers, he was stubbornly independent of government bias with often blunt commentary that offered constructive criticism.  Vietnamese and foreign journalists were attracted by his blunt candour, convictions and independent political analysis.  In December 1966 the ''Viet Nam Guardian'' was ordered by the government of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] to suspend publication for several months.  Thien learned that he was on a police blacklist and at one point escaped an assassination attempt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  During this time he was writing for a number of foreign publications including ''The Economist'', and ''The Far Eastern Economic Review''.\n\nIn 1967 he was asked by the Buddhist hierarchy to help establish a Faculty of Social Sciences at the Buddhist Van Hanh University, and was appointed Dean of that faculty although he was well known as an unrepentant close aide of the late President Diem.\n\nIn 1968, the war was brought home to Thi\u1ec7n personally and painfully during the \"Tet\" Vietnamese New Year.  Both Vietnamese warring sides had agreed to observe the customary one-week holiday ceasefire.  Although as a security precaution he usually avoided staying in Hu\u1ebf, on Tet's eve, Thi\u1ec7n and his elder brother Hanh flew from Saigon to visit his ailing father for a quick three-day visit.  On the night of the second day, the communist forces staged a surprise general offensive and succeeded in occupying almost the entire city including the area of Thi\u1ec7n's family home.  As a high-profile prisoner he risked execution or captivity in the North.  Fortunately, a quick counter offensive by U.S. Marines through his area diverted his captors and he was able to escape.  In later fighting in the area where Thi\u1ec7n's home was located, Thi\u1ec7n's mother, who had stayed behind, was wounded in the head by mortar shrapnel.  With the central hospital still under communist occupation, and no other medical service available she died of cerebral hemorrhage and had to be buried on the spot, on the lawn of the old French Resident's office adjacent to the Hu\u1ebf bridge. Thien's sister-in-law, Thu Ba (Hanh's wife) risked her life to get a coffin with money given to Thi\u1ec7n's family by an American journalist who happened to be in the area.  During the week he was stranded in Hu\u1ebf, he was a witness to the duplicity and brutality of the communists.  After the battle it was found that up to five thousand people had been executed, many of whom had been on prepared target lists.<ref>\"Hu\u1ebf Massacre of 1968 Goes Beyond Hearsay\": REED IRVINE Chairman, Accuracy in Media Washington, September 2, 1987.  Letter to the Editor, ''New York Times'' Published: Tuesday, September 22, 1987</ref>  This experience deepened his conviction that the communists could not be trusted. \n  \nIn April 1968, Thien was appointed Minister of Information by Prime Minister [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]].  His first act was to remove all censorship of the press although South Viet Nam was facing a widespread long standing insurgency and invasion from the North.  In his view the country's security and freedom would be strengthened by greater freedom of expression.\n\nIn August 1968, the Philippine-based Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation awarded him the prestigious Magsaysay Award for journalism, literature and creative communication in recognition of \"his enduring commitment to free inquiry and debate.\"  \nThe official citation read:\n\n<blockquote>Ton That Thien relentlessly has sought to digest the essence of Western scientific method and wed it to Vietnamese cultural values.  Freedom of thought and expression he found were essential to this pursuit.  His convictions led him to act with perceptive courage and staunch individualism as writer and editor, professor and government official.<ref name=\"rmaf.org.ph\"/></blockquote>\n\nAt the end of 1968, he resigned his post after President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] twice failed to honor a pledge on a major policy issue.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  From 1968 to 1975 he continued to work as a journalist, newspaper editor and professor.\n\n== Political and journalistic influences ==\n\nThi\u1ec7n's alternating roles as Presidential personal interpreter and press secretary, journalist and professor provided him with a platform for critical commentary on political events as well as the advocacy of the ideals he thought the country should uphold:  traditional Confucian values which he considered to have universal and perennial value and basic to the good functioning of a society, namely:  service to community, respect of traditions, honesty and faithfulness to recognized and honourable freely elected leaders.<ref>Quoted in [[Michael Maclear]], ''Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War'', p. 200-201</ref>\n\nThese roles also gave him reason for official or unofficial contact with a who's who of historic figures in that period of Viet Nam's history. These included, among government and political officials: Major Archimedes Patti, [[Edward Lansdale]], Wesley Fishel, Wolfe Ladejinsky, [[Ted Serong]], [[William Colby]], Chester Cooper, [[Daniel Ellsberg]], Douglas Pike, John Mecklin, [[Barry Zorthian]], Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]], Ambassador [[Ellsworth Bunker]], Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], General [[William Westmoreland]], Dr. [[Thomas Anthony Dooley III|Tom Dooley]] and Senator [[Mike Mansfield]].  In 1965 Don Luce, the International Volunteer Service (IVS) field director arranged a private meeting with Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] during a fact-finding trip to Viet Nam.\n\nAmong journalists he knew or met virtually the whole range of the Saigon foreign press corps over the course of twenty years, from 1954 to 1975.  He often served as a respected source of information and insight on Vietnamese cultural sensibilities and political traditions.  His press contacts included: [[Stanley Karnow]], Robert Shaplen, [[Homer Bigart]], [[Sol Sanders]], Keyes Beech, [[Bernard Kalb]], [[David Halberstam]], Malcom Browne, [[Charles Mohr (journalist)|Charles Mohr]], [[Neil Sheehan]], [[Denis Warner]], [[Peter Arnett]], Joel Blocker, [[Fran\u00e7ois Sully]], [[Ward Just]], [[Marguerite Higgins]], [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]], Beverly Deepe, Elisabeth Pond, [[R. W. Apple]], [[Don Oberdorfer]], William Tuohy, Arthur Dommen, Michael Field, Bernard Crozier, [[Bernard Fall]], Olivier Todd, Richard Gwynn, Max Clos, and Fran\u00e7ois Nivolon.\n\nHe also was consulted by or became friends with several leading academics, including [[Joseph Buttinger]], Gerald Hickey, Patrick J. Honey, Denis Duncanson and [[George Tanham]].\n\n== Exile in Canada:  1975\u20132014 ==\n\nThien believed that without the leadership of President Diem, South Vietnam would be doomed and this conviction remained with him following the 1963 coup d'\u00e9tat.<ref>Ton That Thien, \"The Year of the Hare:  New Light on the Anti-Diem Coup\", in ''World Affairs'', Vol. 3, No. 4, October\u2013December 1999, p. 116\u2013117</ref>  By early 1975 as it became apparent that the anti-communist South's fall was inevitable, he knew too well that under communist rule a normal life - particularly one of independent political discourse \u2013 would be impossible.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  Communist practice would require him to write a \"confession\" stating that he had betrayed his country and his people, and this was an act he could not accept.  Due to his political background his daughter would not be allowed to access high school or university.  He would have to undergo \"socialist re-education\" and would be barred from his journalism and teaching professions.  Although assured by a man known to have connections with Hanoi that he would be \"welcomed by the Revolution\", the painful memories of Tet 1968 in Hu\u1ebf were still fresh in his mind and he made plans for an emergency evacuation.  At the same time, he felt it was his duty to fight on to keep South Vietnam free as long as possible and remained until the [[Fall of Saigon]] was imminent.\n\nAs the communist forces closed in on Saigon, Thien put his escape plan into effect: with the help of a foreign friend, he smuggled his family out of Vietnam to Paris.\n\nThere, thanks to the connections of a brother-in-law, he was able to get asylum.\n\nThe husband of a sister of his wife who had settled in Canada happened to be in Paris at that time and urged him to move there. Fluent in both French and English, with a good educational background and a great deal of professional experience, he had no difficulty finding employment and settling down in his new country.\n\nThi\u1ec7n became a professor in linguistics at the [[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]].\n\nIn these years he travelled extensively to academic conferences in Europe, [[Thailand]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Taiwan]], [[China]], the [[USSR]], and [[Australia]].\n\nHe also served as a visiting professor at the Graduate [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]], and a senior visiting fellow at the [[U.S. Naval War College]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].\n\nIn 1989 he wrote ''The Foreign Politics of the Communist Party of Vietnam: A Study of Communist Tactics'', published by Crane Russak, New York.\n\nIn 1990, a monograph was published in Singapore by the Information and Resource Centre titled ''\"Ho Chi Minh a Nationalist?  Ho Chi Minh and the Comintern\"''.  [[BBC Radio]] service occasionally invited him to make comments in the 1980s and 1990s as did BBC television for a documentary on [[Ho Chi Minh]].\n\nIn 1992, Thi\u1ec7n retired in [[Ottawa]] and continued to write articles on Vietnamese affairs for Vietnamese newspapers abroad.\n\nIn 2014, shortly before his death, he became a founding member of Vietnam Veterans for Factual History.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.vvfh.org/index.php/VVFH_History#Membership|accessdate=11 December 2017|title=VVFH History|publisher=Vietnam Veterans for Factual History}}</ref>\n\n== Parallel life to B\u00f9i T\u00edn ==\n\nIt is historically intriguing to compare T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n's life history with that of [[B\u00f9i T\u00edn]], Thien's neighbour, who also grew up in Hu\u1ebf, and whose father was also a Minister in the Imperial cabinet of [[Emperor of Vietnam|Emperor]] [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]].\n\nIn August 1945, they both went to [[Hanoi]].  While Thien served in the office of the President, the younger Bui Tin joined the [[Viet Minh]] as a soldier in the first unit of the newly formed army and at one point served as a guard at the presidential office in which Thien worked.\n\nB\u00f9i T\u00edn went on to serve the communist regime in the north of Vietnam as journalist, writer and government officer, much as Ton That Thien was serving in the south.\n\nUnited by common beginnings in the central and perhaps most traditional region of the country, for thirty years their two lives followed parallel paths on either side of the communist North \u2013 nationalist South political division of the country.\n\nWhen their life histories are considered together it is evident they singly or jointly were present at all of the major political and historic events of Vietnam's tumultuous history.\n\nThey were both present at the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] in [[Hanoi]] on 2 September 1945 and narrowly missed meeting again upon the [[Fall of Saigon]] on April 30, 1975, at which B\u00f9i T\u00edn took the surrender of [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]], then [[President of South Vietnam]].  Thien had departed shortly before.\n\nWhile T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n came to recognize and reject the aims of the  [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]]-led [[Viet Minh]] in early 1946, B\u00f9i T\u00edn did not begin to question Party orthodoxy until after the unification under communist rule in 1975.<ref>Bui Tin, ''From Cadre to Exile:  The Memoirs of a North Vietnamese Journalist'', p. 88</ref>\n\nWhen he claimed asylum in France in 1990 his life's path once again became conjoined with that of Ton That Thien in their common experience of exile and their shared political beliefs in [[multi-party democracy]],  individual freedoms and traditional cultural values.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn his personal life Thi\u1ec7n followed the Confucianist\u2013Western modernism which he adopted in his public life. In founding a family, he married a person with a clear Confucian background, ''L\u1ec7 V\u00e2n'' (Lovely Cloud), whose great grandfather was the well known Confucian scholar and mandarin Nguyen Trong Hiep.  Assigned by the emperor to negotiate with France after French troops had occupied the Imperial capital of Hu\u1ebf in 1883, he persuaded the French not to abolish the Nguy\u1ec5n monarchy and annex Vietnam, but to accept it as a protectorate instead.  L\u1ec7 V\u00e2n's grandmother was the daughter of a well-known poet, Cao Thi Ngoc Anh, herself daughter of a Confucian scholar, [[Cao Xu\u00e2n D\u1ee5c]], well known as a great Minister of Education in the Imperial Government of Vietnam, a contemporary of Nguyen Trong Hiep.\n\nUnlike many young women of her generation, L\u1ec7 V\u00e2n not only went to college, but was allowed to travel to France for further study.  Another \"modern\" side to this marriage: neither Thien nor L\u1ec7 V\u00e2n sought prior permission from their parents before their engagement. Another infringement of traditions was that they got married in Paris, in a simple ceremony with a small attendance instead of an elaborate and lavish wedding party involving a large gathering presided by the parents surrounded by all members of the two families.  When their daughter was born they usurped their parents' traditional prerogative by naming her themselves, ''Thu\u1ef3 Lan'' (Sweet Orchid).\n\nProfessor T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n died peacefully at home in Ottawa, Canada, surrounded by his family on October 3, 2014.\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n*Anne Blair, ''There to the Bitter End:  Ted Serong in Vietnam'', pp.&nbsp;183\u2013187, 224, 258, 273\n*Daniel Ellsberg, ''Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers'', p.&nbsp;176\n*Frances Fitzgerald, ''Fire in the Lake'', p.&nbsp;403\n*Gerald Hickey, ''Window On a War'', pp.&nbsp;210, 258, 259,\n*Ward Just, ''To What End'', pp.&nbsp;67, 87\n*Crispin C.

He played a significant though understated role in the nationalist attempt to preserve a non-communist Vietnam.\n\nThe website [http://www.tonthatthien.com T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n (1924-2014)] presents a complete bibliography and almost 400 collected articles, book excerpts, editorials, letters, interview transcripts and poetry.\n \nFrom 1945 to 1975 Thien was an active participant or a personal witness to almost all of the major historic events in Vietnam: the 1945 [[August Revolution]], the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]], division of the country and birth of the [[Republic of Vietnam]], the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|1963 coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] in Hu\u1ebf and the April 1975 [[Fall of Saigon]].\n\nHe knew or met virtually all of the significant actors among the North Vietnamese, South Vietnamese and American political and military leadership, as well as most foreign journalists who covered the conflict.\n\nIn 1968 he served as Minister of Information in the [[South Vietnam]]ese  government.

Described by [[Daniel Ellsberg]] as an \"outstanding Vietnamese journalist\",<ref>Daniel Ellsberg, ''A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers'', Penguin, 2003, p. 176</ref> he was a leading supporter of freedom of the press and vociferous in his belief that the most effective strategy in fighting the Communists was to counter their claim to be the true and only nationalists fighting for Vietnam's national independence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyThienTon.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref>  His life saw the span of cataclysmic political and social changes in Vietnam from titular imperial rule under French colonialism to nationalist republican government to eventual communist rule.\n\nIn his life and writings, Thi\u1ec7n upheld the ideals drawn from the old, essentially Confucian traditions of the country - service to society, rule of customs and laws and orderly government.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  At the same time, he advocated the western ideals of modernity, progress, freedom and democracy developed from his contact with western culture through his studies in Hu\u1ebf, London and Geneva. His conception of Viet Nam's post-colonial society echoed that of Phan Chu Trinh, a leading Vietnamese nationalist and Confucian scholar of the early 20th century who nevertheless supported modernization through unreserved westernization.\n\nA generation of domestic and foreign journalists in the 1950s and 1960s were influenced by Thi\u1ec7n's English-language critiques of the political crises in Vietnam, the political and social dynamics of the conflict and the consequent cultural impact.  As an independent political commentator after 1966 he could be equally critical of misguided South Vietnamese government policies and abuses and the heavy-handedness of U.S. intervention in Viet Nam. His writings on the Vietnamese communist threat and the negative impact of American cultural, economic and political interventions showed a balanced and analytical approach that was recognized as distinctive in its time.\n\nU.S. Ambassador [[Ellsworth Bunker]]'s assessment of Thi\u1ec7n upon his appointment to the South Vietnamese cabinet in 1968 established the stature he held in foreign and Vietnamese political and social circles:\n  \n<blockquote>The new Minister of Information, Ton That Thien, has been described as one of the best economists and one of the most articulate and intelligent of all Vietnamese in Saigon.  He has also been known as a well informed, articulate critic of both the U.S. and G.V.N; but he is a man of ability, energy, and patriotism, and is certainly not anti-American. He should be a very considerable improvement over his predecessor, Tran Van An, who has been ineffectual in this important post.<ref>Douglas Pike, editor, ''The Bunker Papers, Reports to the President from Vietnam 1967-1973'', 3 vol., Institute of East Asian Studies.  University of California at Berkeley, 1990. Volume 2, Page 453</ref>\n</blockquote>\n \nIn 1945-1946 Thi\u1ec7n personally witnessed the momentous events which were to mark Viet Nam's post-war history: the overthrow of French rule by the Japanese and Emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]]'s proclamation of the termination of the French protectorate over Viet Nam (March 1945), the formation of the first independent government of Viet Nam (April 1945), Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's abdication in Hu\u1ebf (August 1945) and Ho Chi Minh's declaration of independence in Hanoi (September 1945), the arrival of the Americans and the Chinese (September 1945), the return of the French (March 1946), and the breaking out of the Franco-Vietnamese war (December 1946). He served for a year in Ho's administration before quitting upon realizing the true communist nature of the Viet-Minh United Front government headed by Ho Chi Minh. He was one of the first few non-Communist Vietnamese to perceive the August Revolution as a [[Leninist]] cover for the introduction of communism to Viet Nam as a part of a world revolution.<ref>Ton That Thien, The Foreign Politics of The Communist Party of Vietnam:  A Study of Communist Tactics, p. 177</ref>\n\nIn 1947 he went to Europe to resume his studies. Although he distanced himself from the Ho-led Viet Minh government, he did not support the various B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i-led governments.  Like many other nationalists at that time he faced a dilemma in terms of where to direct support for Vietnamese independence. Supporting Ho would be to abet communism, and supporting B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i would be to prolong French colonialism. In his view, neither Ho nor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i were true nationalists.  As a result, he remained non-committed to either side throughout the war until Ngo Dinh Diem became Prime Minister of the State of Viet Nam in June 1954. He considered Mr. Diem a true nationalist.\n\nThien served as press aide to Ngo Dinh Diem, and was with him when he was overthrown in an American-condoned military coup on 1 November 1963.  Despite this close and loyal association, in the aftermath of the coup he was not persecuted by the coup leaders and the post-coup governments. In 1964 he voluntarily left government service to take up journalism, working for Vietnamese as well as foreign newspapers. In 1967, he accepted a professorship at Van Hanh University in Saigon. In 1968 he served briefly as Minister of Information during which time he enacted libertarian reforms that removed all government censorship.  In the same year he was awarded the Magsaysay Award in Manila for \"significant contributions\" to journalism, literature and creative communication arts in Asia.\n\nIn April 1975, just before the fall of Saigon to communist forces he went into exile in Quebec, Canada.  After a university teaching career at the University of Quebec, Trois Rivieres campus, he retired in Ottawa in 1992.  He continued to write on Vietnamese social and political issues, in particular on the necessity \u2013 first advocated by Phan Chu Trinh - of making the appropriate changes in culture to enable Vietnamese to acquire the values required for rapid development, the basic condition of the advancement of the Vietnamese people.\n\nContrary to many educated Vietnamese, in his writings Thi\u1ec7n considered development to be the primary objective of Vietnam, with independence as only a secondary objective.<ref name=\"Ton That Thien p. 60\">Ton That Thien, The Foreign Politics of The Communist Party of Vietnam:  A Study of Communist Tactics, p. 60</ref> In his view, it was this error in setting the priority of objectives which led to the costly and lengthy wars from 1945 to 1975.  He viewed these national traumas as unnecessary for the country to achieve freedom and independence, but indispensable for the Communists to secure and retain power.  He held the Communist Party accountable for this development and saw the consequence as the ruin of the country, the exhaustion of its people, and the establishment of a brutal dictatorship.<ref name=\"Ton That Thien p. 60\"/>\n\nThroughout the political upheavals from the 1945 August Revolution to his exile in 1975, T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n remained consistently committed to his political and nationalist convictions and active in the political discourse of South Viet Nam.  After the fall of the Ngo Dinh Diem administration he remained unattached to any political party or movement despite offers of government appointments.  The ''Viet Nam Guardian'', of which he was managing editor, maintained private ownership and an independent editorial policy.\n\n== Early life and education: 1924\u201345 ==\n\nBorn on September 22, 1924 in Hu\u1ebf, the imperial capital of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]], T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n was descended from a family with a long history of service to the state. His ancestry can be traced to Nguyen B\u1ea1c, a close adviser to Emperor [[\u0110inh Ti\u00ean Ho\u00e0ng]] (r. 968-979), a founder of independent Viet Nam in the 10th century; and to [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng]], founder of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, which ruled over most of Vietnam for almost four centuries (1600-1945).  His grandfather was a military officer (born in 1835, in the reign of Emperor [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]]) who served Emperor [[T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c]] (1847\u20131883), fought against the French in [[Cochinchina]] (1860), the battle of Thuan An (1883), and the failed coup staged by [[T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thuy\u1ebft]] against the French (1885), and ended his career as a general in the reign of Emperor [[Th\u00e0nh Th\u00e1i]] (1889\u20131907).  His father T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Qu\u1ea3ng (1883\u20131972) served for thirty years in the Imperial government, rising to the rank of Minister, in charge of Rites. He retired in 1942, only three years before the end of the Vietnamese monarchy, and was thus the last but one Minister of Rites Ministry of Rites in Vietnam's long history.  Thien was influenced by the Confucian philosophy followed by his father and the Buddhist beliefs of his mother.\n\nIn Hu\u1ebf he attended a \"franco-indig\u00e8ne\" \u2013 half Vietnamese, half French - elementary school, then a Catholic high school and the state-run Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh College. The last two establishments were \"modern\" schools which eliminated Chinese script and Confucian ideas and introduced a French education standard curriculum with French as the medium of instruction. Thien was thereby introduced to Western political and social ideas, graduating with a Baccalaureate of Philosophy in 1944.  Plans for medical studies in Hanoi were interrupted in March 1945 when the Japanese occupying forces took over control of the country from the French.  With no other transportation available he rode his bicycle the 400 miles from Hanoi to Hu\u1ebf.  Along the way he witnessed the terrible effects of a famine estimated to have killed over one million Vietnamese in 1944/45.  This traumatic experience convinced him to switch his course of studies from medicine to economics on the understanding he could thereby help more people.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Revolution and education: 1945\u201355 ==\n\nIn April 1945, after the French colonial administration was ended by a Japanese coup, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i set up the first independent government of Viet Nam led by Mr. [[Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim]]. A well known lawyer, Phan Anh was appointed Minister of Youth and Thien served as his personal secretary. This marked Thien's first introduction to Vietnamese politics, at the age of twenty-one.\n\nAfter the abdication of Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i in late August 1945, on the recommendation of Mr. Ta Quang Buu he was called to Hanoi to serve in the new Viet Minh National Front Government led by Ho Chi Minh. Fluent in English he was posted in the Foreign Relations section of the president's office headed by Mr. Buu. The latter had been his teacher of English and rated him as the best of the class. More noteworthy still, Mr. Buu was an assistant to [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] and had access to the top echelons of the leadership. Thien was thus placed close to the power center. This inclusion in the workings of the inner circle of the highest level of the Viet Minh leadership enabled him to observe at close quarters the core Viet Minh leadership in Hanoi including Ho Chi Minh, V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, [[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh]], [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]] as well as many of the foreign officials in Hanoi at the time including [[Archimedes Patti]] of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS). It also allowed him to understand the Communist Party of Vietnam's manipulation of the nationalist front as a means to secure power.  He was one of the first few non-Communist Vietnamese to have this understanding at that time.\n\nThien's work was varied.  He translated and typed government documents, and served as an announcer and commentator for Hanoi Radio's English language service \"The Voice of Viet Nam\", thereby becoming practically the first Vietnamese to address the English speaking world.  He also was a major contributor to the magazine of the Vietnamese-American Friendship Association (VAFA) launched by Ta Quang Buu and General Gallagher at a time when Ho Chi Minh was courting American support for the Viet Minh government and its continued independence from French colonial rule.\n\nDismissive of communist ideology from his economics studies and unable to support the radical political aims of Ho Chi Minh which included on-going systematic persecution of Vietnamese nationalists, he left Hanoi and returned to Hu\u1ebf in late 1946.  In 1947 he went abroad to study.  He continued to morally support the anti-French aims of the Viet Minh until 1950 when the Ho-led Viet Minh forces unreservedly turned to communist China for material and advisory support, and Ho Chi Minh publicly proclaimed Vietnam \"the forward post of socialism in South-east-Asia\" and the Vietnamese Communist Party re-emerged under the thin guise of the \"Lao Dong\" (Worker's) Party. From then on Thien distanced himself from the Viet Minh government, remained aloof from the various political formations, and concentrated on his studies. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics at the London School of Economics and a master's degree in Political Science at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in Geneva. He maintained his political neutrality until 1953. In October of that year, he met Mr. Ngo Dinh Diem in Paris and judged him to be a true nationalist leader.  He also learned that Mr. Diem was going to be appointed by B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i as the next Prime Minister of the non-communist State of Viet Nam.\n\n== Government service: 1954\u201364 ==\n\nIn May 1954, Thien joined the South Vietnamese delegation as an observer at the Geneva Conference. He then assisted at close quarters in the Vietnam-French negotiations in Paris regarding the transfer of control of major state organs to the new government.  In Saigon he served as press secretary and official interpreter for Prime Minister, then President, Ngo Dinh Diem. For a brief period in 1955-1956 he went abroad, serving at the Vietnamese embassy in Paris where he got married.  In the fall of 1955 he went to the U.S. where he was an instructor at Michigan State University which was initiating a major government contract to provide technical assistance to Ngo Dinh Diem's administration.  Upon returning to Saigon in May 1956, he resumed his former duties. In his capacity as presidential press officer, he was the first government point of contact for American journalists reporting on the new state. He came to know almost all foreign correspondents posted in Viet Nam in those years.\n\nIn October 1959, Thien returned to Geneva for doctoral studies, graduating in June 1963 with a Doctorate in Political Science.  While there, he was a member of the South Vietnamese delegation to the Geneva Conference on Laos in 1961 and 1962.  He returned to Saigon in mid-July 1963 as Director General of the Vietnam Press, a position he held until 1964.\n\nAs a close aide to Ngo Dinh Diem, he was with the President on 1 November 1963 when the South Vietnamese military successfully launched a coup d'\u00e9tat which was condoned by the U.S. government.  Ton That Thien witnessed the last meeting conducted between President Diem and Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] on the occasion of a courtesy call on the President by Admiral Harry Felt.  Thien observed that the Ambassador kept the President preoccupied in discussions from 10.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. The coup was initiated at 01.00 p.m.<ref>Michael Maclear, ''Vietnam'', p. 101</ref>\n\n== Journalism, teaching and government service: 1964\u201375 ==\n\nIn August 1964 Thien left government service to take up journalism.  He worked for the respected English language newspaper the ''Saigon Daily News'', then for the ''Viet Nam Guardian'', owned by a like-minded friend. As managing editor and columnist at both papers, he was stubbornly independent of government bias with often blunt commentary that offered constructive criticism.  Vietnamese and foreign journalists were attracted by his blunt candour, convictions and independent political analysis.  In December 1966 the ''Viet Nam Guardian'' was ordered by the government of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] to suspend publication for several months.  Thien learned that he was on a police blacklist and at one point escaped an assassination attempt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  During this time he was writing for a number of foreign publications including ''The Economist'', and ''The Far Eastern Economic Review''.\n\nIn 1967 he was asked by the Buddhist hierarchy to help establish a Faculty of Social Sciences at the Buddhist Van Hanh University, and was appointed Dean of that faculty although he was well known as an unrepentant close aide of the late President Diem.\n\nIn 1968, the war was brought home to Thi\u1ec7n personally and painfully during the \"Tet\" Vietnamese New Year.  Both Vietnamese warring sides had agreed to observe the customary one-week holiday ceasefire.  Although as a security precaution he usually avoided staying in Hu\u1ebf, on Tet's eve, Thi\u1ec7n and his elder brother Hanh flew from Saigon to visit his ailing father for a quick three-day visit.  On the night of the second day, the communist forces staged a surprise general offensive and succeeded in occupying almost the entire city including the area of Thi\u1ec7n's family home.  As a high-profile prisoner he risked execution or captivity in the North.  Fortunately, a quick counter offensive by U.S. Marines through his area diverted his captors and he was able to escape.  In later fighting in the area where Thi\u1ec7n's home was located, Thi\u1ec7n's mother, who had stayed behind, was wounded in the head by mortar shrapnel.  With the central hospital still under communist occupation, and no other medical service available she died of cerebral hemorrhage and had to be buried on the spot, on the lawn of the old French Resident's office adjacent to the Hu\u1ebf bridge. Thien's sister-in-law, Thu Ba (Hanh's wife) risked her life to get a coffin with money given to Thi\u1ec7n's family by an American journalist who happened to be in the area.  During the week he was stranded in Hu\u1ebf, he was a witness to the duplicity and brutality of the communists.  After the battle it was found that up to five thousand people had been executed, many of whom had been on prepared target lists.<ref>\"Hu\u1ebf Massacre of 1968 Goes Beyond Hearsay\": REED IRVINE Chairman, Accuracy in Media Washington, September 2, 1987.  Letter to the Editor, ''New York Times'' Published: Tuesday, September 22, 1987</ref>  This experience deepened his conviction that the communists could not be trusted. \n  \nIn April 1968, Thien was appointed Minister of Information by Prime Minister [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]].  His first act was to remove all censorship of the press although South Viet Nam was facing a widespread long standing insurgency and invasion from the North.  In his view the country's security and freedom would be strengthened by greater freedom of expression.\n\nIn August 1968, the Philippine-based Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation awarded him the prestigious Magsaysay Award for journalism, literature and creative communication in recognition of \"his enduring commitment to free inquiry and debate.\"  \nThe official citation read:\n\n<blockquote>Ton That Thien relentlessly has sought to digest the essence of Western scientific method and wed it to Vietnamese cultural values.  Freedom of thought and expression he found were essential to this pursuit.  His convictions led him to act with perceptive courage and staunch individualism as writer and editor, professor and government official.<ref name=\"rmaf.org.ph\"/></blockquote>\n\nAt the end of 1968, he resigned his post after President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] twice failed to honor a pledge on a major policy issue.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  From 1968 to 1975 he continued to work as a journalist, newspaper editor and professor.\n\n== Political and journalistic influences ==\n\nThi\u1ec7n's alternating roles as Presidential personal interpreter and press secretary, journalist and professor provided him with a platform for critical commentary on political events as well as the advocacy of the ideals he thought the country should uphold:  traditional Confucian values which he considered to have universal and perennial value and basic to the good functioning of a society, namely:  service to community, respect of traditions, honesty and faithfulness to recognized and honourable freely elected leaders.<ref>Quoted in [[Michael Maclear]], ''Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War'', p. 200-201</ref>\n\nThese roles also gave him reason for official or unofficial contact with a who's who of historic figures in that period of Viet Nam's history. These included, among government and political officials: Major Archimedes Patti, [[Edward Lansdale]], Wesley Fishel, Wolfe Ladejinsky, [[Ted Serong]], [[William Colby]], Chester Cooper, [[Daniel Ellsberg]], Douglas Pike, John Mecklin, [[Barry Zorthian]], Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]], Ambassador [[Ellsworth Bunker]], Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], General [[William Westmoreland]], Dr. [[Thomas Anthony Dooley III|Tom Dooley]] and Senator [[Mike Mansfield]].  In 1965 Don Luce, the International Volunteer Service (IVS) field director arranged a private meeting with Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] during a fact-finding trip to Viet Nam.\n\nAmong journalists he knew or met virtually the whole range of the Saigon foreign press corps over the course of twenty years, from 1954 to 1975.  He often served as a respected source of information and insight on Vietnamese cultural sensibilities and political traditions.  His press contacts included: [[Stanley Karnow]], Robert Shaplen, [[Homer Bigart]], [[Sol Sanders]], Keyes Beech, [[Bernard Kalb]], [[David Halberstam]], Malcom Browne, [[Charles Mohr]], [[Neil Sheehan]], [[Denis Warner]], [[Peter Arnett]], Joel Blocker, [[Fran\u00e7ois Sully]], [[Ward Just]], [[Marguerite Higgins]], [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]], Beverly Deepe, Elisabeth Pond, [[R. W. Apple]], [[Don Oberdorfer]], William Tuohy, Arthur Dommen, Michael Field, Bernard Crozier, [[Bernard Fall]], Olivier Todd, Richard Gwynn, Max Clos, and Fran\u00e7ois Nivolon.\n\nHe also was consulted by or became friends with several leading academics, including [[Joseph Buttinger]], Gerald Hickey, Patrick J. Honey, Denis Duncanson and [[George Tanham]].\n\n== Exile in Canada:  1975\u20132014 ==\n\nThien believed that without the leadership of President Diem, South Vietnam would be doomed and this conviction remained with him following the 1963 coup d'\u00e9tat.<ref>Ton That Thien, \"The Year of the Hare:  New Light on the Anti-Diem Coup\", in ''World Affairs'', Vol. 3, No. 4, October\u2013December 1999, p. 116\u2013117</ref>  By early 1975 as it became apparent that the anti-communist South's fall was inevitable, he knew too well that under communist rule a normal life - particularly one of independent political discourse \u2013 would be impossible.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  Communist practice would require him to write a \"confession\" stating that he had betrayed his country and his people, and this was an act he could not accept.  Due to his political background his daughter would not be allowed to access high school or university.  He would have to undergo \"socialist re-education\" and would be barred from his journalism and teaching professions.  Although assured by a man known to have connections with Hanoi that he would be \"welcomed by the Revolution\", the painful memories of Tet 1968 in Hu\u1ebf were still fresh in his mind and he made plans for an emergency evacuation.  At the same time, he felt it was his duty to fight on to keep South Vietnam free as long as possible and remained until the [[Fall of Saigon]] was imminent.\n\nAs the communist forces closed in on Saigon, Thien put his escape plan into effect: with the help of a foreign friend, he smuggled his family out of Vietnam to Paris.\n\nThere, thanks to the connections of a brother-in-law, he was able to get asylum.\n\nThe husband of a sister of his wife who had settled in Canada happened to be in Paris at that time and urged him to move there. Fluent in both French and English, with a good educational background and a great deal of professional experience, he had no difficulty finding employment and settling down in his new country.\n\nThi\u1ec7n became a professor in linguistics at the [[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]].\n\nIn these years he travelled extensively to academic conferences in Europe, [[Thailand]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Taiwan]], [[China]], the [[USSR]], and [[Australia]].\n\nHe also served as a visiting professor at the Graduate [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]], and a senior visiting fellow at the [[U.S. Naval War College]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].\n\nIn 1989 he wrote ''The Foreign Politics of the Communist Party of Vietnam: A Study of Communist Tactics'', published by Crane Russak, New York.\n\nIn 1990, a monograph was published in Singapore by the Information and Resource Centre titled ''\"Ho Chi Minh a Nationalist?  Ho Chi Minh and the Comintern\"''.  [[BBC Radio]] service occasionally invited him to make comments in the 1980s and 1990s as did BBC television for a documentary on [[Ho Chi Minh]].\n\nIn 1992, Thi\u1ec7n retired in [[Ottawa]] and continued to write articles on Vietnamese affairs for Vietnamese newspapers abroad.\n\nIn 2014, shortly before his death, he became a founding member of Vietnam Veterans for Factual History.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.vvfh.org/index.php/VVFH_History#Membership|accessdate=11 December 2017|title=VVFH History|publisher=Vietnam Veterans for Factual History}}</ref>\n\n== Parallel life to B\u00f9i T\u00edn ==\n\nIt is historically intriguing to compare T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n's life history with that of [[B\u00f9i T\u00edn]], Thien's neighbour, who also grew up in Hu\u1ebf, and whose father was also a Minister in the Imperial cabinet of [[Emperor of Vietnam|Emperor]] [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]].\n\nIn August 1945, they both went to [[Hanoi]].  While Thien served in the office of the President, the younger Bui Tin joined the [[Viet Minh]] as a soldier in the first unit of the newly formed army and at one point served as a guard at the presidential office in which Thien worked.\n\nB\u00f9i T\u00edn went on to serve the communist regime in the north of Vietnam as journalist, writer and government officer, much as Ton That Thien was serving in the south.\n\nUnited by common beginnings in the central and perhaps most traditional region of the country, for thirty years their two lives followed parallel paths on either side of the communist North \u2013 nationalist South political division of the country.\n\nWhen their life histories are considered together it is evident they singly or jointly were present at all of the major political and historic events of Vietnam's tumultuous history.\n\nThey were both present at the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] in [[Hanoi]] on 2 September 1945 and narrowly missed meeting again upon the [[Fall of Saigon]] on April 30, 1975, at which B\u00f9i T\u00edn took the surrender of [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]], then [[President of South Vietnam]].  Thien had departed shortly before.\n\nWhile T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n came to recognize and reject the aims of the  [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]]-led [[Viet Minh]] in early 1946, B\u00f9i T\u00edn did not begin to question Party orthodoxy until after the unification under communist rule in 1975.<ref>Bui Tin, ''From Cadre to Exile:  The Memoirs of a North Vietnamese Journalist'', p. 88</ref>\n\nWhen he claimed asylum in France in 1990 his life's path once again became conjoined with that of Ton That Thien in their common experience of exile and their shared political beliefs in [[multi-party democracy]],  individual freedoms and traditional cultural values.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn his personal life Thi\u1ec7n followed the Confucianist\u2013Western modernism which he adopted in his public life. In founding a family, he married a person with a clear Confucian background, ''L\u1ec7 V\u00e2n'' (Lovely Cloud), whose great grandfather was the well known Confucian scholar and mandarin Nguyen Trong Hiep.  Assigned by the emperor to negotiate with France after French troops had occupied the Imperial capital of Hu\u1ebf in 1883, he persuaded the French not to abolish the Nguy\u1ec5n monarchy and annex Vietnam, but to accept it as a protectorate instead.  L\u1ec7 V\u00e2n's grandmother was the daughter of a well-known poet, Cao Thi Ngoc Anh, herself daughter of a Confucian scholar, [[Cao Xu\u00e2n D\u1ee5c]], well known as a great Minister of Education in the Imperial Government of Vietnam, a contemporary of Nguyen Trong Hiep.\n\nUnlike many young women of her generation, L\u1ec7 V\u00e2n not only went to college, but was allowed to travel to France for further study.  Another \"modern\" side to this marriage: neither Thien nor L\u1ec7 V\u00e2n sought prior permission from their parents before their engagement. Another infringement of traditions was that they got married in Paris, in a simple ceremony with a small attendance instead of an elaborate and lavish wedding party involving a large gathering presided by the parents surrounded by all members of the two families.  When their daughter was born they usurped their parents' traditional prerogative by naming her themselves, ''Thu\u1ef3 Lan'' (Sweet Orchid).\n\nProfessor T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thi\u1ec7n died peacefully at home in Ottawa, Canada, surrounded by his family on October 3, 2014.\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n*Anne Blair, ''There to the Bitter End:  Ted Serong in Vietnam'', pp.&nbsp;183\u2013187, 224, 258, 273\n*Daniel Ellsberg, ''Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers'', p.&nbsp;176\n*Frances Fitzgerald, ''Fire in the Lake'', p.&nbsp;403\n*Gerald Hickey, ''Window On a War'', pp.&nbsp;210, 258, 259,\n*Ward Just, ''To What End'', pp.&nbsp;67, 87\n*Crispin C.
