The character made his debut in 2014's ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', where he serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He is an [[elf|elven]] outlaw [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]  operating outside of the edicts of the Chantry, the dominant religious organization in Thedas, the world setting of ''Dragon Age''. His primary interest is in the Fade, a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm that is tied to Thedas which is normally accessible only through dreaming.\n\nSolas sought out and joined the Inquisition shortly after a massive explosion at a peace conference killed everyone present, except for the protagonist, who was discovered emerging from a [[Portal (architecture)|dimensional rift]]. This is followed by the opening of the Breach, a massive dimensional tear in the sky that allows multitudes of demonic spirits to pass through into the physical world. Solas sets himself up as the Inquisition's expert on the Fade and its denizens; his knowledge and expertise proving instrumental in aiding the organisation's struggle to close the Breach and defend the world from invaders coming through Fade rifts.\n\nSolas vanishes shortly after the defeat of Corypheus; ''Inquisition's'' post-credit scene reveals his true identity. ''Trespasser'', the final [[downloadable content|DLC pack]] released for ''Inquisition'', provides further insight into his backstory and motives, as well as his involvement in the current world state of Thedas.\n\nSolas has been positively received as a complex and well-written character. He is voiced by Welsh actor [[Gareth David-Lloyd]].\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = left\n| quote = \"Solas professed to have spent his life as an apostate, living in the wilderness well away from the civilized world. He claimed that he mastered his magic without the help of tutors, spending years exploring the spirit realm of the Fade and coming to a rare understanding of its denizens. Although his skills are beyond doubt, it has been thus far impossible to verify the rest of his history as told.\"\n| source = \u2014Character Guide<ref name=\"Kits\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas presents himself as a self-taught hedge mage who wields powers developed outside of conventional teaching and who has no affiliation with the Chantry-sanctioned Circle of Magi or any Dalish clan. He spends much of his time dreaming in ancient ruins and learning all there is to learn about what lies beyond the Veil, a metaphysical barrier which normally prevents direct physical access between the physical Thedas and the Fade.<ref name=\"Memories\"/> Solas believes in cause and effect, wisdom as its own reward and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist. Solas concludes that the many current conflicts in Thedas, such as the Mage-Templar War or the racial tensions between elves and humans, are little more than the black-and-white reductionist dichotomies which have led to the many tragedies of history.\n\nSolas sometimes speaks in [[iambic pentameter]], and the Inquisitor will gain approval when replying in kind.<ref name=\"PAX\"/> This is a deliberate design choice, given his characterization and personality.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/><ref name=\"Sound\"/>\n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Gareth David-Lloyd by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Gareth David-Lloyd, the voice of Solas in ''Inquisition''. He appeared as [[Ianto Jones]] in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise.]]\n\nSolas was written by [[Patrick Weekes]], with heavy input from lead writer [[David Gaider]], although the character was originally conceived and named prior to Weekes joining the project.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> In an interview, Weekes said that Solas was initially based on [[David Tennant]]'s [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor Who]] performance to capture his humanity and ancient nature.<ref>{{Citation|last=BioFan|title=BioFan Interview Patrick Weekes BioWare Lead Writer for Dragon Age|date=2016-03-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj0m_eQtwXA|accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref> Weekes noted that writing a character with hidden depths like Solas provided a great deal of both difficulty and opportunity. The character is depicted within an in-game cutscene as disdaining tea.<ref name=\"Tea\"/> Besides the fact that tea, particularly caffeinated tea, is a stimulant which may hinder Solas from crossing into the Fade during sleep, the character's dislike of tea also reflects Weekes' personal dislike of tea.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/>\n\nOriginally, Solas was not available as a romance option in ''Inquisition''; according to Mike Laidlaw, BioWare redesigned him as a potential love interest for a female elven Inquisitor when they extended the game's development for a year.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Weekes noted that this was an opportunity to increase the basic sadness of the character.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> Solas will initiate the breakup of his relationship with the Inquisitor at the conclusion of the romance subplot, regardless of the player's choices.<ref name=\"Heartbreak\"/>\n\nIn a video uploaded on BioWare's official YouTube channel titled \"What Makes a Good Character?\", Weekes used [[Harry Potter]] as a metaphor to explain how Solas perceives himself as the hero of the story; he feels he is \"this luckless, unfortunate person who by an unpleasant destiny and the simple fact that no one else has the ability to do it, that it has to be him and that someone else would get it wrong\".<ref name=\"Good\"/>\n \nDuring a [[wikt:Q and A|Q&A]] session at the Phoenix Fan Fest 2015, Gareth David-Lloyd revealed that he recorded voice work for Solas over a period of two and a half years. He was provided with a simple outline and some lines on a screen to work with in lieu of a comprehensive backstory for Solas; he eventually developed a stronger idea of who the character is about three or four months after he started.<ref name=\"Phoenix\"/>\n\n===Visual design===\nSolas is envisioned by Weekes to be a middle-aged man in his early to mid-forties.<ref name=\"Weekes\"/> His appearance is reflective of a wandering nomad's lifestyle, who journeys from place to place without a set destination. BioWare's designers intended Solas to appear as if he is wearing all that he owns, and that his items of clothing are meant to look like homemade improvisations born from necessity.<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nConcept art displayed in ''The Art of Dragon Age Inquisition'' book shows the creative process for Solas as the team develops his look after many renditions to match the ideas provided by other creative teams. After exploring many different hairstyles, the final decision was made to design Solas with a bold, bald head. This is intended to evoke a sense of ageless wisdom required by his character.<ref name=\"Art\"/> His visage is subsequently associated with that of an egg by ''Dragon Age'' fandom,<ref name=\"Hate\"/><ref name=\"FanByte\"/><ref name=\"Gaider\"/> and he has been referred to as an [[egghead]].<ref name=\"Egghead\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Inquisition''===\nSolas is encountered at the beginning of the game, fighting demons alongside [[Varric Tethras]] and a few Inquisition personnel. It is revealed that right after the calamity began where the Breach opened, Solas approached the fledgling Inquisition's leadership. He claimed that he might be able to help the sole survivor of the Divine Conclave's explosion and the suspiciously glowing mark on their hand, and that he would not stand idly by when his knowledge of the arcane could mean the difference between salvation and utter destruction. He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result.\n\n===''Trespasser''===\nIn the midst of investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, two years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisitor encounters several elven ruins and learns that the elven pantheon of deities, the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to divine beings. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plot; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control.\n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel, who led a rebellion against the Evanuris after they became corrupt and abused their power. He created the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they murdered Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently, and in doing so dooming the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. Remorseful over his direct role in the downfall of his people, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, anticipating that the ancient darkspawn would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating him and his forces. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan.\n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace in Orlais, the Inquisitor either disbands the Inquisition or reforms the organization into a smaller peacekeeping force to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking weaker efforts against Solas or further infiltration in their ranks respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that many elven individuals across Thedas have disappeared. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote   =It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been mostly positively received. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything. He is a such a great character that I want to strangle that dude with my bare hands\".<ref name=\"Hate\"/> In her opinion piece published in response to Jackson's article about Solas, Angela D. Mitchell finds the character too complex, too trapped, and too tragic for her to despise. She noted that BioWare's ''Dragon Age'' universe \"inspires so many deep emotions because of the rich, complex characters that fans passionately love and hate.\" She further noted that nowhere is \"this level of emotional response more visible, however, than with the character of Solas, the ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' (DAI) companion who is ultimately revealed to be the elven god Fen'Harel and our unexpected adversary\".<ref name=\"Love\"/>\n\nAlison Bell from ''Videogamer.com'' believed that the potential romantic relationship between Solas and the Inquisitor is the best written romance in a video game so far, although she compared it to that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]]: \"histrionic, ruinous, and, in the long term, one or both of you is probably going to die.\"<ref name=\"Shakespeare\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the sixty-second trailer for the upcoming fourth installment of the ''Dragon Age'' series released in December 2018, Kat Brewster from ''[[IGN]]'' said \"...In true BioWare trickery, The Dread Wolf had been hiding in tapestries and lore all since ''[[Dragon Age: Origins|Origins]]''\". She called Solas \"the dear elven pal we love to hate and hate to love\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Since then, the character has been the focus for much of the media coverage pertaining to information released by BioWare about the [[Dragon Age#Dragon Age 4|upcoming fourth main entry]] of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Everything\"/><ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Characters of Dragon Age: Inquisition|Characters of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'']]\n*[[Elves in fiction]]\n*[[List of fictional tricksters]]\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Memories\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Inquisition |developer=BioWare |level=Haven/Skyhold |quote='''Solas''':  Some of my fondest memories were found in crumbling cities long picked dry by treasure seekers.

He is an [[elf|elven]] outlaw [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]  operating outside of the edicts of the Chantry, the dominant religious organization in Thedas, the world setting of ''Dragon Age''.

The character is depicted within an in-game cutscene as disdaining tea.<ref name=\"Tea\"/> Besides the fact that tea, particularly caffeinated tea, is a stimulant which may hinder Solas from crossing into the Fade during sleep, the character's dislike of tea also reflects Weekes' personal dislike of tea.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/>\n\nOriginally, Solas was not available as a romance option in ''Inquisition''; according to Mike Laidlaw, BioWare redesigned him as a potential love interest for a female elven Inquisitor when they extended the game's development for a year.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Weekes noted that this was an opportunity to increase the basic sadness of the character.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> Solas will initiate the breakup of his relationship with the Inquisitor at the conclusion of the romance subplot, regardless of the player's choices.<ref name=\"Heartbreak\"/>\n\nIn a video uploaded on BioWare's official YouTube channel titled \"What Makes a Good Character?\", Weekes used [[Harry Potter]] as a metaphor to explain how Solas perceives himself as the hero of the story; he feels he is \"this luckless, unfortunate person who by an unpleasant destiny and the simple fact that no one else has the ability to do it, that it has to be him and that someone else would get it wrong\".<ref name=\"Good\"/>\n \nDuring a [[wikt:Q and A|Q&A]] session at the Phoenix Fan Fest 2015, Gareth David-Lloyd revealed that he recorded voice work for Solas over a period of two and a half years. He was provided with a simple outline and some lines on a screen to work with in lieu of a comprehensive backstory for Solas; he eventually developed a stronger idea of who the character is about three or four months after he started.<ref name=\"Phoenix\"/>\n\n===Visual design===\nSolas is envisioned by Weekes to be a middle-aged man in his early to mid-forties.<ref name=\"Weekes\"/> His appearance is reflective of a wandering nomad's lifestyle, who journeys from place to place without a set destination. BioWare's designers intended Solas to appear as if he is wearing all that he owns, and that his items of clothing are meant to look like homemade improvisations born from necessity.<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nConcept art displayed in ''The Art of Dragon Age Inquisition'' book shows the creative process for Solas as the team develops his look after many renditions to match the ideas provided by other creative teams. After exploring many different hairstyles, the final decision was made to design Solas with a bold, bald head. This is intended to evoke a sense of ageless wisdom required by his character.<ref name=\"Art\"/> His visage is subsequently associated with that of an egg by ''Dragon Age'' fandom,<ref name=\"Hate\"/><ref name=\"FanByte\"/><ref name=\"Gaider\"/> and he has been referred to as an [[egghead]].<ref name=\"Egghead\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Inquisition''===\nSolas is encountered at the beginning of the game, fighting demons alongside [[Varric Tethras]] and a few Inquisition personnel. It is revealed that right after the calamity began where the Breach opened, Solas approached the fledgling Inquisition's leadership. He claimed that he might be able to help the sole survivor of the Divine Conclave's explosion and the suspiciously glowing mark on their hand, and that he would not stand idly by when his knowledge of the arcane could mean the difference between salvation and utter destruction. He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result.\n\n===''Trespasser''===\nIn the midst of investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, two years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisitor encounters several elven ruins and learns that the elven pantheon of deities, the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to divine beings. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plot; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control.\n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel, who led a rebellion against the Evanuris after they became corrupt and abused their power. He created the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they murdered Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently, and in doing so dooming the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. Remorseful over his direct role in the downfall of his people, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, anticipating that the ancient darkspawn would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating him and his forces. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan.\n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace in Orlais, the Inquisitor either disbands the Inquisition or reforms the organization into a smaller peacekeeping force to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking weaker efforts against Solas or further infiltration in their ranks respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that many elven individuals across Thedas have disappeared. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote   =It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been mostly positively received. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything. He is a such a great character that I want to strangle that dude with my bare hands\".<ref name=\"Hate\"/> In her opinion piece published in response to Jackson's article about Solas, Angela D. Mitchell finds the character too complex, too trapped, and too tragic for her to despise. She noted that BioWare's ''Dragon Age'' universe \"inspires so many deep emotions because of the rich, complex characters that fans passionately love and hate.\" She further noted that nowhere is \"this level of emotional response more visible, however, than with the character of Solas, the ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' (DAI) companion who is ultimately revealed to be the elven god Fen'Harel and our unexpected adversary\".<ref name=\"Love\"/>\n\nAlison Bell from ''Videogamer.com'' believed that the potential romantic relationship between Solas and the Inquisitor is the best written romance in a video game so far, although she compared it to that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]]: \"histrionic, ruinous, and, in the long term, one or both of you is probably going to die.\"<ref name=\"Shakespeare\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the sixty-second trailer for the upcoming fourth installment of the ''Dragon Age'' series released in December 2018, Kat Brewster from ''[[IGN]]'' said \"...In true BioWare trickery, The Dread Wolf had been hiding in tapestries and lore all since ''[[Dragon Age: Origins|Origins]]''\". She called Solas \"the dear elven pal we love to hate and hate to love\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Since then, the character has been the focus for much of the media coverage pertaining to information released by BioWare about the [[Dragon Age#Dragon Age 4|upcoming fourth main entry]] of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Everything\"/><ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Characters of Dragon Age: Inquisition|Characters of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'']]\n*[[Elves in fiction]]\n*[[List of fictional tricksters]]\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Memories\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Inquisition |developer=BioWare |level=Haven/Skyhold |quote='''Solas''':  Some of my fondest memories were found in crumbling cities long picked dry by treasure seekers.

The magazine ardently criticizes what they perceive as the rampant corruption and nepotism in the Islamic community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and often gives the platform to those who oppose Mufti Ceri\u0107 and his appointees. Due to its frequent criticism of Bosnian Muslim sympathy towards Arab volunteers who came to join the Bosnian Army following massacres on Bosnian Muslims by Serb and, to a lesser extent, Croat forces in the 1992-1995 [[Bosnian War]], it is seen by some as an [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] publication.\n\n==Notable columnists and journalists (in the past issues)==\n* [[Semezdin Mehmedinovi\u0107]]\n* [[Aleksandar Hemon]]\n* [[Miljenko Jergovi\u0107]]\n* Marko Ve\u0161ovi\u0107\n* \u017deljko Cvijanovi\u0107\n\n==Sister publications==\n*''[[Oslobo\u0111enje]]'' - daily newspaper\n* ''Auto Dani'' - a monthly car magazine supplement\n* ''Ljepota & Zdravlje'' - a monthly health and beauty magazine supplement\n* Biblioteka Dani - a book publishing house\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Newspapers in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bh Dani}}\n[[Category:1992 establishments in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:Magazines established in 1992]]\n[[Category:Political magazines]]\n[[Category:European news magazines]]\n[[Category:Media in Sarajevo]]\n[[Category:Weekly magazines]]\n", "name_user": "Gochuko33!", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_(magazine)"}

After starting his career with local clubs near his home town of [[Blackpool]], in 1932 he was signed by [[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], with whom he played his entire professional career.\n\nSwift broke into the Manchester City first team in 1933, taking part in the club's run to the [[1934 FA Cup Final]], where the club triumphed 2\u20131 against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. Three years later Swift won a [[English football champions|League Championship]] medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. War denied Swift several years of playing in his prime, though during wartime he was chosen to represent his country in international matches. After the war he made his competitive international debut, playing 19 internationals between 1946 and 1949.\n\nSwift retired in 1949, taking up a career in journalism as a football correspondent for the ''[[News of the World]]''. He died, aged 44, in the [[Munich air disaster]] after reporting on [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] match against [[Red Star Belgrade]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career and 1930s successes===\nBorn in [[Blackpool]], a coastal town in north-west England, Swift's first club was Blackpool Gas Works,<ref name=\"mre\">{{cite book |last=Penney |first=Ian |title=The Maine Road Encyclopedia |publisher=Mainstream |location=Edinburgh |year=1995 |isbn= 1-85158-710-1|pages=188}}</ref> where he worked as a [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]-keeper.<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Andrew |title=The Manchester City Story |publisher=Breedon|location=Derby |year=1984 |isbn=0-907969-05-4|pages=40}}</ref> A spell at nearby [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood]] followed, during which Swift attracted interest from a number of Football League clubs. Potential suitors included [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] (where Frank's elder brother Fred was the goalkeeper), [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]] and Manchester City.<ref name=\"hof68\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p. 68.</ref> The first to offer Swift a contract were Manchester City, who played in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], the highest level of English football. Initially signed as an amateur in October 1932, eighteen-year-old Swift turned professional the following month,<ref name=\"mre\"/> receiving a wage of ten shillings (50p) per week.<ref name=\"Ward\"/> The following December he was called up to the first team, having previously made only three reserve team appearances.<ref name=\"Ward\"/>\n\nAt this time, goalkeeper was an unsettled position for Manchester City. [[Len Langford]] had made over 100 appearances and had appeared in the [[1933 FA Cup Final]], which City lost 3\u20130 to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. He missed the final game of the [[1932\u201333 in English football|1932\u201333]] season and the opening match of [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334]], but went on to play 18 consecutive League games before injury on 16 December 1933 ended his time as City's first choice.<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=The Big Book Of City|publisher=James Ward |location=Halifax |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9558127-2-9|pages=73\u201374}}</ref> Langford's replacement for the following game was [[James Nicholls (footballer)|James Nicholls]], but he endured a torrid time as Manchester City lost 8\u20130 to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0|pages=344}}</ref> Consequently, Swift was given an opportunity for the Christmas double-header against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. He conceded four goals in his debut at the [[Baseball Ground]] on 25 December, but in the return match the next day, his 20th birthday, he kept a [[clean sheet]] in a 2\u20130 win. After making his debut, Swift played in every first team match for more than four seasons,<ref name=\"mre\"/> a run of more than 200 consecutive matches. His only absence prior to the suspension of football due to [[World War II]] was a single match in September 1938, where without Swift, Manchester City lost 6\u20131 at home to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 354.</ref>\n\nThough Swift quickly established himself as a fixture in the Manchester City first team line-up, his performances were not all positive. In one of his early matches, against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], Swift conceded seven goals.<ref name=\"Ward33\">Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p33</ref> This led Swift to believe he would not be picked again, but with Langford unavailable due to a knee injury, Swift kept his place.<ref>{{cite book | first=Gary | last=James| coauthors= | title=Manchester: The Greatest City | publisher=Polar | location=Leicester | year=2002 | editor= | isbn=1-899538-22-4|pages=140}}</ref>\n\nDespite inconsistency, Manchester City were one of the stronger sides of the 1930s, and in Swift's first season the club reached the [[FA Cup]] final for the second successive year. This period saw football match attendances reach an all-time high. During the cup run Swift played in front of 84,569 people for [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City's]] visit to [[Maine Road]], a record attendance for an English club ground which still stands today.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 90.</ref> Hillsborough's attendance record of 72,841 (receipts \u00a35,566) was also set by City during this Cup run.<ref>{{cite book | first=Gary | last=James| coauthors= | title=Manchester \u2013 The Greatest City: The Complete History Of Manchester City Football Club | publisher=Polar | location=Leicester | year=1997 | isbn=1-899538-09-7|pages=140\u2013143}}</ref> The semi-final, against cup favourites [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], ended in a 6\u20131 victory, a record for an FA Cup semi-final.<ref name=\"James, p46\">James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p46</ref>\n\nIn the final, Manchester City faced [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. Swift, the youngest and most inexperienced of the team, was nervous. As the playing surface was wet, he was unsure whether or not to wear gloves. Seeing Portsmouth goalkeeper [[Jock Gilfillan]] take to the field without gloves, he decided to follow suit.<ref name=\"hof72\">{{cite book |last= James|first= Gary| title= The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame |publisher= Hamlyn |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-600-61282-1|pages=72}}</ref> Portsmouth took the lead in the first half through a [[Septimus Rutherford]] shot. At half time Swift slumped in the dressing room, blaming himself and his decision not to wear gloves for the goal. Forward [[Fred Tilson]] attempted to improve Swift's spirits by telling him not to worry as he would \"plonk two in next half\".<ref name=\"cr117\">James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 117.</ref> Tilson duly scored two second half goals, the second with less than five minutes remaining.<ref name=\"cr117\"/> A tense finish followed, in which a photographer behind Swift's goal gave regular updates of the time remaining.<ref name=\"Ward33\"/> At the final whistle, Swift was so overcome with emotion that he fainted. He recovered in time to receive his winners' medal from [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], who sent a telegram enquiring about his condition on the following Monday.<ref name=\"hof72\"/>\n\nManchester City started the [[1936\u201337 in English football|1936\u201337]] season poorly, and were in the bottom half of the table until December.<ref name=\"Ward36\"/> The club were better known for goalscoring than solid defence, but frequently both eluded City; at one point the club gained just one win in twelve matches.<ref name=\"cr350\">James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 350.</ref> However, Christmas proved to be a turning point for the club. Swift conceded five goals in consecutive matches on 19 and 25 December, but a Boxing Day win against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] was the start of a long unbeaten run.<ref name=\"Ward36\">Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p. 36.</ref> By April City were second in the table, and faced a fixture against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], league leaders and the dominant club of the period.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p47</ref> [[Peter Doherty (footballer)|Peter Doherty]] inspired the team to a 2\u20130 win, and City reached the top of the table.<ref name=\"Ward36\"/> The unbeaten run continued until the end of the season, and City secured their first league championship with a 4\u20131 win over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. City's third goal in this match came as the result of a long clearance by Swift, who was noted for the distance he could propel the ball.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 120.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the championship win, the [[1937\u201338 in English football|1937\u201338]] season was one of disappointment. Manchester City achieved several high scoring wins, including two 7\u20131 scorelines, but frequently stuttered to defeat.<ref name=\"Ward38\">Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p. 38.</ref> On the final day of the season the club faced [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], and went into the match four places clear of the relegation zone. A 1\u20130 defeat, coupled with wins for all four of the teams immediately below meant reigning champions City were relegated to the Second Division despite scoring more goals than any other team.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 352.</ref>\n\n===Wartime and later career===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Swift continued to play regularly for City, making 134 wartime league appearances. He also joined the [[British Army]], and was one several professional footballers to enlist at the [[Army School of Physical Training]] as part of a scheme devised by the [[The Football Association|FA]]. The school was based near [[Aldershot F.C.]] leading Swift to become one of several notable players to guest for the club. Others included [[Matt Busby]], [[Jimmy Hagan]], [[Joe Mercer]], [[Stan Cullis]], [[Cliff Britton]] and [[Tommy Lawton]]. He also guested for several other clubs during the war including [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He also played for several representative sides. On 30 October 1943 at [[Ninian Park]], Swift played for a Western Command XI against a [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City XI]] which featured Lawton and Mercer as guests. The game was a fundraiser for [[Royal Artillery]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. In April 1944 in [[Edinburgh]] he played for a British Army XI that included [[Jack Rowley]], [[Leslie Compton]], Cullis, Mercer, Hagan and Lawton and against a [[Royal Air Force XI]] that included [[Peter Doherty (footballer)|Peter Doherty]], [[Stanley Matthews]] and [[Ted Drake]]. The Army won 4\u20130. On 9 September 1944 at [[Windsor Park]] he played for a Combined Services XI in an 8\u20134 win against [[Ireland national football team (1882-1950)|Ireland]]. This team was in effect a [[Great Britain XI]] and featured, among others, Busby, Matthews, Lawton, Mullen, [[Raich Carter]] and [[Stan Mortensen]]. In the same year he also represented an FA Services XI in games against [[France national football team|France]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. In May 1945 Swift also travelled with a British Army XI on a European tour.<ref>Anton Rippon ''Gas Masks for Goal Posts'' (2005)</ref><ref>''Who's Who Of Liverpool'' (2006): Tony Matthews</ref><ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng-warvic-intres.html England wartime results at Rsssf]</ref><ref>''Soccer at War \u2013 1939 \u2013 45'' (2005): Jack Rollin</ref>\n\nIn the first season after the Second World War, Manchester City won the Second Division championship to secure their return to the top flight. In the process Swift kept a club record 17 clean sheets in 35 appearances, a mark which was not surpassed until nearly 40 years later, when [[Alex Williams (footballer born 1961)|Alex Williams]] broke the record by keeping 20 clean sheets in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |title=Club records | work=Manchester City FC vs Wigan Athletic match programme | date=17 January 2009 |pages=19}}</ref>\n\nBy 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but was still performing well enough to maintain his place in the England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire at the end of the [[1948\u201349 in English football|1948\u201349]] season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on 7 May,<ref name=\"hof74\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p74</ref> which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club.<ref name=\"James, p46\"/> However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement [[Alec Thurlow]] fell ill with [[tuberculosis]], and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper.<ref name=\"Ward41\">Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p41</ref> Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United,<ref>{{cite book |last=Rowlands |first=Alan |title=Trautmann: The Biography |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2005 |isbn=1-85983-491-4|pages=89}}</ref> the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.<ref name=\"james160\">James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p160</ref>\n\n==After football==\nFollowing a period serving as a director of a local catering company, Swift took up a career in journalism, most notably with the ''[[News of the World]]''.<ref name=\"Clayton19\"/> He continued to be a regular visitor to Maine Road, and became the president of the Supporters' Club.<ref name=\"james160\"/>\n\nSwift died, aged 44, in the [[Munich air disaster]] after reporting on [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United's]] [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] match against [[Red Star Belgrade]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]] for the [[News of the World]]. On 6 February 1958, the flight back to Manchester carrying the Manchester United team and journalists made a refuelling stop at [[Munich-Riem Airport]] in poor weather. Two take-off attempts were abandoned due to engine problems, with the weather continuing to deteriorate. On the third attempt, slush on the runway prevented the aircraft from reaching the required speed for take-off. The plane veered off the runway and crashed into a house. One of 23 victims of the disaster, Swift was one of two journalists pulled alive from the wreckage but died on his way to hospital, as his seat belt had cut into his [[aorta]].<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester \u2013 A Football History |publisher=James Ward |location=Halifax |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-9558127-0-5|pages=213\u2013218}}</ref>\n\nSwift is widely regarded as one of the best English goalkeepers of all time<ref name=\"BBC001\">{{cite web || last = || first = || authorlink = || vauthors = || title = Legends List in Full || work = || publisher = [[BBC]] News || date = 5 August 1998 || url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/144986.stm || format = || doi = || accessdate = 28 October 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"SET001\">\n{{cite web| title =XI at 11: England's Best Goalkeepers| publisher =[[Setanta Sports|Setanta]] Sports| date =17 October 2007| url =http://sports.setanta.com/en/TV-and-Entertainment/The-XI-at-11/XI-at-11/XI-at-11-Englands-Best-Goalkeepers/| accessdate =28 October 2007| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071026033052/http://sports.setanta.com/en/TV-and-Entertainment/The-XI-at-11/XI-at-11/XI-at-11-Englands-Best-Goalkeepers/| archivedate =26 October 2007| df =dmy-all}}</ref> along with [[Gordon Banks]] and [[Peter Shilton]] and is frequently noted as one of the best players to have graced the English football league. His successor in the [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] team was fellow club and goalkeeping legend, [[Bert Trautmann]].\n\nSwift was named as one of the ''[[Football League 100 Legends]]'' in 1998 celebrating 100 seasons of league football in England, alongside other Manchester City players [[Billy Meredith]], [[Colin Bell]] and [[Bert Trautmann]].<ref name=\"BBC001\"/> He has also been inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame.\n\n==International career==\nSwift's first international call-ups came in the Second World War; he made 14 wartime appearances for England. The first official England international after the war took place on 28 September 1946 against [[Ireland national football team (1882-1950)|Ireland]], and Swift retained his place to make his full debut in a 7\u20132 victory.<ref name=\"Clayton18\"/> Swift became a fixture in the England side of the late 1940s, playing 17 consecutive matches. This run included the famous 1948 victory against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in Turin, where he became the first goalkeeper since Alexander Morten in 1873 to captain the side,<ref name=\"Clayton18\"/> leading him to describe the match as the greatest day of his career.<ref name=\"hof71\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p71</ref> Later that year he lost his place to [[Ted Ditchburn]], despite keeping a clean sheet in his previous appearance.<ref name=\"Clayton18\"/> He was restored to the line-up the following match, a [[British Home Championship]] decider against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. After announcing his retirement from football, he made a farewell appearance against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] in May 1949 to take his number of caps to 19, after which the goalkeeper's jersey was taken by [[Bert Williams (footballer, born 1920)|Bert Williams]].<ref name=\"Clayton19\">Clayton, ''Manchester City's Cult Heroes'', p19</ref> Swift also represented [[United Kingdom national football team|Great Britain]] in a 1947 match against a \"[[Europe XI|Rest of Europe]]\" team, played to celebrate the return of the Home Nations to [[FIFA]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Goldblatt |first=David |title=The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football |publisher=Penguin|location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-101582-8|pages=332}}</ref>\n\n==Playing style==\n[[Raich Carter]] once said of Frank Swift that he looked so big in goal that as a forward it often seemed that trying to score against him was like trying to put the ball into a matchbox.

After starting his career with local clubs near his home town of [[Blackpool]], in 1932 he was signed by [[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], with whom he played his entire professional career.\n\nSwift broke into the Manchester City first team in 1933, taking part in the club's run to the [[1934 FA Cup Final]], where the club triumphed 2\u20131 against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. Three years later Swift won a [[English football champions|League Championship]] medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. War denied Swift several years of playing in his prime, though during wartime he was chosen to represent his country in international matches. After the war he made his competitive international debut, playing 19 internationals between 1946 and 1949.\n\nSwift retired in 1949, taking up a career in journalism as a football correspondent for the ''[[News of the World]]''. He died, aged 44, in the [[Munich air disaster]] after reporting on [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] match against [[Red Star Belgrade]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career and 1930s successes===\nBorn in [[Blackpool]], a coastal town in north-west England, Swift's first club was Blackpool Gas Works,<ref name=\"mre\">{{cite book |last=Penney |first=Ian |title=The Maine Road Encyclopedia |publisher=Mainstream |location=Edinburgh |year=1995 |isbn= 1-85158-710-1|pages=188}}</ref> where he worked as a [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]-keeper.<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Andrew |title=The Manchester City Story |publisher=Breedon|location=Derby |year=1984 |isbn=0-907969-05-4|pages=40}}</ref> A spell at nearby [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood]] followed, during which Swift attracted interest from a number of Football League clubs. Potential suitors included [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] (where Frank's elder brother Fred was the goalkeeper), [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]] and Manchester City.<ref name=\"hof68\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p. 68.</ref> The first to offer Swift a contract were Manchester City, who played in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], the highest level of English football. Initially signed as an amateur in October 1932, eighteen-year-old Swift turned professional the following month,<ref name=\"mre\"/> receiving a wage of ten shillings (50p) per week.<ref name=\"Ward\"/> The following December he was called up to the first team, having previously made only three reserve team appearances.<ref name=\"Ward\"/>\n\nAt this time, goalkeeper was an unsettled position for Manchester City. [[Len Langford]] had made over 100 appearances and had appeared in the [[1933 FA Cup Final]], which City lost 3\u20130 to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. He missed the final game of the [[1932\u201333 in English football|1932\u201333]] season and the opening match of [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334]], but went on to play 18 consecutive League games before injury on 16 December 1933 ended his time as City's first choice.<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=The Big Book Of City|publisher=James Ward |location=Halifax |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9558127-2-9|pages=73\u201374}}</ref> Langford's replacement for the following game was [[James Nicholls (footballer)|James Nicholls]], but he endured a torrid time as Manchester City lost 8\u20130 to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0|pages=344}}</ref> Consequently, Swift was given an opportunity for the Christmas double-header against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. He conceded four goals in his debut at the [[Baseball Ground]] on 25 December, but in the return match the next day, his 20th birthday, he kept a [[clean sheet]] in a 2\u20130 win. After making his debut, Swift played in every first team match for more than four seasons,<ref name=\"mre\"/> a run of more than 200 consecutive matches. His only absence prior to the suspension of football due to [[World War II]] was a single match in September 1938, where without Swift, Manchester City lost 6\u20131 at home to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 354.</ref>\n\nThough Swift quickly established himself as a fixture in the Manchester City first team line-up, his performances were not all positive. In one of his early matches, against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], Swift conceded seven goals.<ref name=\"Ward33\">Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p33</ref> This led Swift to believe he would not be picked again, but with Langford unavailable due to a knee injury, Swift kept his place.<ref>{{cite book | first=Gary | last=James| coauthors= | title=Manchester: The Greatest City | publisher=Polar | location=Leicester | year=2002 | editor= | isbn=1-899538-22-4|pages=140}}</ref>\n\nDespite inconsistency, Manchester City were one of the stronger sides of the 1930s, and in Swift's first season the club reached the [[FA Cup]] final for the second successive year. This period saw football match attendances reach an all-time high. During the cup run Swift played in front of 84,569 people for [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City's]] visit to [[Maine Road]], a record attendance for an English club ground which still stands today.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 90.</ref> Hillsborough's attendance record of 72,841 (receipts \u00a35,566) was also set by City during this Cup run.<ref>{{cite book | first=Gary | last=James| coauthors= | title=Manchester \u2013 The Greatest City: The Complete History Of Manchester City Football Club  | publisher=Polar | location=Leicester | year=1997 | isbn=1-899538-09-7|pages=140\u2013143}}</ref> The semi-final, against cup favourites [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], ended in a 6\u20131 victory, a record for an FA Cup semi-final.<ref name=\"James, p46\">James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p46</ref>\n\nIn the final, Manchester City faced [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. Swift, the youngest and most inexperienced of the team, was nervous. As the playing surface was wet, he was unsure whether or not to wear gloves. Seeing Portsmouth goalkeeper [[Jock Gilfillan]] take to the field without gloves, he decided to follow suit.<ref name=\"hof72\">{{cite book |last= James|first= Gary| title= The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame |publisher= Hamlyn |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-600-61282-1|pages=72}}</ref> Portsmouth took the lead in the first half through a [[Septimus Rutherford]] shot. At half time Swift slumped in the dressing room, blaming himself and his decision not to wear gloves for the goal. Forward [[Fred Tilson]] attempted to improve Swift's spirits by telling him not to worry as he would \"plonk two in next half\".<ref name=\"cr117\">James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 117.</ref> Tilson duly scored two second half goals, the second with less than five minutes remaining.<ref name=\"cr117\"/> A tense finish followed, in which a photographer behind Swift's goal gave regular updates of the time remaining.<ref name=\"Ward33\"/> At the final whistle, Swift was so overcome with emotion that he fainted. He recovered in time to receive his winners' medal from [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], who sent a telegram enquiring about his condition on the following Monday.<ref name=\"hof72\"/>\n\nManchester City started the [[1936\u201337 in English football|1936\u201337]] season poorly, and were in the bottom half of the table until December.<ref name=\"Ward36\"/> The club were better known for goalscoring than solid defence, but frequently both eluded City; at one point the club gained just one win in twelve matches.<ref name=\"cr350\">James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 350.</ref> However, Christmas proved to be a turning point for the club. Swift conceded five goals in consecutive matches on 19 and 25 December, but a Boxing Day win against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] was the start of a long unbeaten run.<ref name=\"Ward36\">Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p. 36.</ref> By April City were second in the table, and faced a fixture against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], league leaders and the dominant club of the period.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p47</ref> [[Peter Doherty (footballer)|Peter Doherty]] inspired the team to a 2\u20130 win, and City reached the top of the table.<ref name=\"Ward36\"/> The unbeaten run continued until the end of the season, and City secured their first league championship with a 4\u20131 win over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. City's third goal in this match came as the result of a long clearance by Swift, who was noted for the distance he could propel the ball.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 120.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the championship win, the [[1937\u201338 in English football|1937\u201338]] season was one of disappointment. Manchester City achieved several high scoring wins, including two 7\u20131 scorelines, but frequently stuttered to defeat.<ref name=\"Ward38\">Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p. 38.</ref> On the final day of the season the club faced [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], and went into the match four places clear of the relegation zone. A 1\u20130 defeat, coupled with wins for all four of the teams immediately below meant reigning champions City were relegated to the Second Division despite scoring more goals than any other team.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p. 352.</ref>\n\n===Wartime and later career===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Swift continued to play regularly for City, making 134 wartime league appearances. He also joined the [[British Army]], and was one several professional footballers to enlist at the [[Army School of Physical Training]] as part of a scheme devised by the [[The Football Association|FA]]. The school was based near [[Aldershot F.C.]] leading Swift to become one of several notable players to guest for the club. Others included [[Matt Busby]], [[Jimmy Hagan]], [[Joe Mercer]], [[Stan Cullis]], [[Cliff Britton]] and [[Tommy Lawton]]. He also guested for several other clubs during the war including [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He also played for several representative sides. On 30 October 1943 at [[Ninian Park]], Swift played for a Western Command XI against a [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City XI]] which featured Lawton and Mercer as guests. The game was a fundraiser for  [[Royal Artillery]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. In April 1944 in [[Edinburgh]] he played for a British Army XI that included [[Jack Rowley]], [[Leslie Compton]], Cullis, Mercer, Hagan and Lawton and against a [[Royal Air Force XI]] that included [[Peter Doherty (footballer)|Peter Doherty]], [[Stanley Matthews]] and [[Ted Drake]]. The Army won 4\u20130. On 9 September 1944 at [[Windsor Park]] he played for a Combined Services XI in an 8\u20134 win against [[Ireland national football team (1882-1950)|Ireland]]. This team was in effect a [[Great Britain XI]] and featured, among others, Busby, Matthews, Lawton, Mullen, [[Raich Carter]] and [[Stan Mortensen]]. In the same year he also represented an FA Services XI in games against [[France national football team|France]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. In May 1945 Swift also travelled with a British Army XI on a European tour.<ref>Anton Rippon ''Gas Masks for Goal Posts'' (2005)</ref><ref>''Who's Who Of Liverpool'' (2006): Tony Matthews</ref><ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng-warvic-intres.html England wartime results at Rsssf]</ref><ref>''Soccer at War \u2013 1939 \u2013 45'' (2005): Jack Rollin</ref>\n\nIn the first season after the Second World War, Manchester City won the Second Division championship to secure their return to the top flight. In the process Swift kept a club record 17 clean sheets in 35 appearances, a mark which was not surpassed until nearly 40 years later, when [[Alex Williams (footballer born 1961)|Alex Williams]] broke the record by keeping 20 clean sheets in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |title=Club records | work=Manchester City FC vs Wigan Athletic match programme | date=2009-01-17 |pages=19}}</ref>\n\nBy 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but was still performing well enough to maintain his place in the England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire at the end of the [[1948\u201349 in English football|1948\u201349]] season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on 7 May,<ref name=\"hof74\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p74</ref> which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club.<ref name=\"James, p46\"/> However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement [[Alec Thurlow]] fell ill with [[tuberculosis]], and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper.<ref name=\"Ward41\">Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p41</ref> Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United,<ref>{{cite book |last=Rowlands |first=Alan |title=Trautmann: The Biography |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2005 |isbn=1-85983-491-4|pages=89}}</ref> the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.<ref name=\"james160\">James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p160</ref>\n\n==After football==\nFollowing a period serving as a director of a local catering company, Swift took up a career in journalism, most notably with the ''[[News of the World]]''.<ref name=\"Clayton19\"/> He continued to be a regular visitor to Maine Road, and became the president of the Supporters' Club.<ref name=\"james160\"/>\n\nSwift died, aged 44, in the [[Munich air disaster]] after reporting on [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United's]] [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] match against [[Red Star Belgrade]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]] for the [[News of the World]]. On 6 February 1958, the flight back to Manchester carrying the Manchester United team and journalists made a refuelling stop at [[Munich-Riem Airport]] in poor weather. Two take-off attempts were abandoned due to engine problems, with the weather continuing to deteriorate. On the third attempt, slush on the runway prevented the aircraft from reaching the required speed for take-off. The plane veered off the runway and crashed into a house. One of 23 victims of the disaster, Swift was one of two journalists pulled alive from the wreckage but died on his way to hospital, as his seat belt had cut into his [[aorta]].<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester \u2013 A Football History |publisher=James Ward |location=Halifax |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-9558127-0-5|pages=213\u2013218}}</ref>\n\nSwift is widely regarded as one of the best English goalkeepers of all time<ref name=\"BBC001\">\n{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | vauthors =\n  | title = Legends List in Full\n  | work =\n  | publisher = [[BBC]] News\n  | date = 1998-08-05\n  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/144986.stm\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2007-10-28 }}</ref><ref name=\"SET001\">\n{{cite web| title =XI at 11: England's Best Goalkeepers| publisher =[[Setanta Sports|Setanta]] Sports| date =2007-10-17| url =http://sports.setanta.com/en/TV-and-Entertainment/The-XI-at-11/XI-at-11/XI-at-11-Englands-Best-Goalkeepers/| accessdate =2007-10-28| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071026033052/http://sports.setanta.com/en/TV-and-Entertainment/The-XI-at-11/XI-at-11/XI-at-11-Englands-Best-Goalkeepers/| archivedate =26 October 2007| df =dmy-all}}</ref> along with [[Gordon Banks]] and [[Peter Shilton]] and is frequently noted as one of the best players to have graced the English football league. His successor in the [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] team was fellow club and goalkeeping legend, [[Bert Trautmann]].\n\nSwift was named as one of the ''[[Football League 100 Legends]]'' in 1998 celebrating 100 seasons of league football in England, alongside other Manchester City players [[Billy Meredith]], [[Colin Bell]] and [[Bert Trautmann]].<ref name=\"BBC001\"/> He has also been inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame.\n\n==International career==\nSwift's first international call-ups came in the Second World War; he made 14 wartime appearances for England. The first official England international after the war took place on 28 September 1946 against [[Ireland national football team (1882-1950)|Ireland]], and Swift retained his place to make his full debut in a 7\u20132 victory.<ref name=\"Clayton18\"/> Swift became a fixture in the England side of the late 1940s, playing 17 consecutive matches. This run included the famous 1948 victory against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in Turin, where he became the first goalkeeper since Alexander Morten in 1873 to captain the side,<ref name=\"Clayton18\"/> leading him to describe the match as the greatest day of his career.<ref name=\"hof71\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p71</ref> Later that year he lost his place to [[Ted Ditchburn]], despite keeping a clean sheet in his previous appearance.<ref name=\"Clayton18\"/> He was restored to the line-up the following match, a [[British Home Championship]] decider against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. After announcing his retirement from football, he made a farewell appearance against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] in May 1949 to take his number of caps to 19, after which the goalkeeper's jersey was taken by [[Bert Williams (footballer, born 1920)|Bert Williams]].<ref name=\"Clayton19\">Clayton, ''Manchester City's Cult Heroes'', p19</ref> Swift also represented [[United Kingdom national football team|Great Britain]] in a 1947 match against a \"[[Europe XI|Rest of Europe]]\" team, played to celebrate the return of the Home Nations to [[FIFA]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Goldblatt |first=David |title=The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football |publisher=Penguin|location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-101582-8|pages=332}}</ref>\n\n==Playing style==\n[[Raich Carter]] once said of Frank Swift that he looked so big in goal that as a forward it often seemed that trying to score against him was like trying to put the ball into a matchbox.

In spring 2001, Memory Stick attained 25% market share (against [[CompactFlash]]'s 40% and [[SmartMedia]]'s 32%), up from 7% a year earlier. By May 2001, total shipment of Memory Stick units surpassed 10 million.<ref name=\"simmtester.com\"/>\n\nHowever the [[SD card]], jointly developed by [[Toshiba]], [[Panasonic]] and [[SanDisk]], became widely popular among companies and soon became the most popular flash format - by November 2003 it held 42% market share in the United States, ahead of CompactFlash's 26% and Memory Stick with 16%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/02/business/technology-memory-evolution-survival-of-the-smallest.html|title=TECHNOLOGY; Memory Evolution: Survival of the Smallest|first=Eric A.|last=Taub|website=nytimes.com}}</ref> Eventually Sony itself became the only company to support the format. Sony was often criticized for the Memory Stick, as they were deemed to be expensive compared to other formats.<ref>https://www.economist.com/node/3738979</ref>\n\n{{as of|2010|01}}, it appeared that Sony had begun to combine support for [[Secure Digital card|SD]]/[[Secure Digital High-Capacity|SDHC]] and Memory Stick formats in their products.

For example, Sony [[Digital camera|digital compact cameras]] use Memory Stick for storing image files. With a Memory Stick-capable [[Memory card reader]] a user can copy the pictures taken with the Sony digital camera to a computer. Sony typically included Memory Stick reader hardware in its first-party consumer electronics, such as digital cameras, [[digital audio player|digital music players]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[mobile phone|cellular phones]], the [[VAIO]] line of laptop computers, TV sets under the WEGA and Bravia names, and Sony's handheld gaming device, the [[PlayStation Portable]].\n\nA special Memory Stick can be inserted in the hindquarters<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/08/19/48hours/main59024.shtml |title=CBS News, 48 Hours \u2013 AIBO, The Digital Wonder Dog: Sony Spends Millions On Robotic Canine |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> of Sony's [[AIBO]] robot pet, to enable the use of Aiboware\u2014software intended for use on AIBOs.

Only 8&nbsp;MB and 16&nbsp;MB versions are available.\n\n== Formats and form factors ==\nMemory Sticks include a wide range of actual formats, including three different form factors.\n\n=== Memory Stick  ===\n[[File:Memory Stick Front and Back.jpg|thumb|The original Memory Stick]]\n[[File:MSG-128A.jpg|thumb|Sony Memory Stick with MagicGate]]\nThe original Memory Stick is approximately the size and thickness of a stick of chewing gum. It was available in capacities from 4&nbsp;MB to 128&nbsp;MB. It was available both with and without MagicGate support. The MagicGate-capable memory sticks were white-colored, while the standard version was purple. The original Memory Stick is no longer manufactured.\n\n=== Memory Stick Select ===\n[[File:Memory Stick Select.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Lexar]] 256&nbsp;MB Memory Stick Select with memory switch.]]\nIn response to the storage limitations of the original Memory Stick, Sony introduced the '''Memory Stick Select''' at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2003 on January 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/articles/8431534296/mspro|title=Sony Memory Stick Pro and Select|website=dpreview.com}}</ref> The Memory Stick Select contained two separate 128&nbsp;MB partitions which the user could switch between using a physical switch on the card. This solution was fairly unpopular, but it did give users of older Memory Stick devices more capacity. Its physical size remained the same as the original Memory Stick.\n\n=== Memory Stick PRO ===\nThe '''Memory Stick PRO''', introduced on January 9, 2003 as a joint effort between Sony and [[SanDisk]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/200306/03-0617E// |title=Sony.net |publisher=Sony.net |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> would be the longer-lasting solution to the space problem. Most devices that use the original Memory Sticks support both the original and PRO sticks since both formats have identical form factors. Some readers that were not compatible could be upgraded to Memory Stick PRO support via a [[firmware]] update. Memory Stick PROs have a marginally higher transfer speed and a maximum theoretical capacity of 32&nbsp;GB{{clarify|1000^3 B or 1024^3 B?|date=February 2020}}, although it appears capacities higher than 4&nbsp;GB are only available in the PRO Duo form factor. High Speed Memory Stick PROs are available, and newer devices support this high speed mode, allowing for faster file transfers. All Memory Stick PROs larger than 1&nbsp;GB support this High Speed mode, and High Speed Memory Stick Pros are backwards-compatible with devices that don't support the High Speed mode. High capacity memory Sticks such as the 4&nbsp;GB versions are expensive compared to other types of flash memory such as SD cards and CompactFlash. According to Sony, the Memory Stick PRO has a maximum theoretical size of 2&nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]]{{clarify|1000^4 B or 1024^4 B?|date=February 2020}}.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nikkei Electronics Asia |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090108/163799/ |title=Nikkeibp.co.jp |publisher=Techon.nikkeibp.co.jp |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Memory Stick Duo ===\nThe '''Memory Stick Duo''' was developed in response to Sony's need for a smaller flash memory card for pocket-sized digital cameras, cell phones and the [[PlayStation Portable]]. It is slightly smaller than the competing [[Secure Digital]] (SD) format and roughly two thirds the length of the standard Memory Stick form factor, but costs more. Memory Stick Duos are available with the same features as the larger standard Memory Stick, available with and without high speed mode, and with and without [[MagicGate]] support. The Memory Stick PRO Duo has replaced the Memory Stick Duo due to its 128&nbsp;MB size limitation, but has kept the same form factor as the Duo.\n\n[[File:Memory Stick Duo Adaptor.jpg|thumbnail|right|Memory Stick Duo Adaptor and Memory Stick PRO Duo.]]\nA simple adapter allows Memory Stick Duo to be used in devices designed to accept the original Memory Stick form factor.\n\n=== Memory Stick PRO Duo ===\n[[File:MS-PRO-DUO.JPG|thumb|left|A Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo (2GB)]]\nThe '''Memory Stick PRO Duo (MSPD)''' quickly replaced the Memory Stick Duo due to the Duo's size limitation of 128&nbsp;MB and slow transfer speed. Memory Stick PRO Duos are available in all the same variants as the larger Memory Stick PRO, with and without High Speed mode, and with and without MagicGate support.\n\nSony has released different versions of Memory Stick PRO Duo.

While only serial and 4-bit parallel interfaces are supported in the Memory Stick PRO format, an 8-bit parallel interface was added to the Memory Stick PRO-HG format. Also, the maximum interface clock frequency was increased from 40&nbsp;MHz to 60&nbsp;MHz. With these enhancements, a theoretical transfer rate of 480&nbsp;Mbit/s (60&nbsp;Mbyte/s) is achieved, which is three times faster than the Memory Stick PRO format.\n\n=== Memory Stick Micro (M2) ===\n[[File:Sony Memory Stick Micro M2 - 1GB-0423.jpg|alt=|thumb|90x90px|Memory Stick Micro.]]\nIn a joint venture with [[SanDisk]], Sony released a new Memory Stick format on February 6, 2006. The '''Memory Stick Micro''' ('''M2''') measures 15 \u00d7 12.5 \u00d7 1.2&nbsp;mm (roughly one-quarter the size of the Duo) with 64&nbsp;MB, 128&nbsp;MB, 256&nbsp;MB, 512&nbsp;MB, 1&nbsp;GB, 2&nbsp;GB, 4&nbsp;GB, 8&nbsp;GB, and 16&nbsp;GB capacities available. The format has a theoretical limit of 32&nbsp;GB and maximum transfer speed of 160&nbsp;Mbit/s. However, as with the ''PRO Duo'' format, it has been expanded through the ''XC'' series as ''Memory Stick XC Micro'' and ''Memory Stick XC-HG Micro'', both with the theoretical maximum capacity of 2&nbsp;TB.<ref name=\"sonyinsider\" />\n\nThe M2 comes with an adapter, much like the Duo Sticks, to ensure physical compatibility with Memory Stick PRO devices. However, not all devices with a PRO slot are compatible with the M2/Adapter combination, as the firmware of older devices don't support the higher capacity of some M2 cards. One example is certain [[Sony CLI\u00c9]] [[PDA]]s which don't support cards larger than 2&nbsp;GB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sony-asia.com/microsite/memorystick/comp_chart/Clie_Handhelds.html |title=Sony Compatibility Chart \u2013 Clie Handhelds |publisher=Sony-asia.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSony announced on June 1, 2009, that M2 support in [[Sony Ericsson]] phones would be dropped in favor of [[microSD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/Exclusive--Sony-Ericsson-Dropping-Memory-Stick-Micro |title=Trusted Review \u2013 Sony Ericsson Dropping Memory Stick Micro |publisher=Trustedreviews.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Sony DSC-RX0 Mark II made a revived usage of M2 slots.\n\n=== Memory Stick XC ===\nOn January 7, 2009, [[SanDisk]] and Sony announced the Memory Stick XC format (tentatively named \"Memory Stick Format Series for Extended High Capacity\" at the time).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sandisk.com/about-sandisk/press-room/press-releases/2009/2009-01-07-sandisk-and-sony-to-expand-%E2%80%9Cmemory-stick-pro%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cmemory-stick-micro%E2%80%9D-formats\n|title=Sandisk and Sony to expand \"Memory stick pro\" and \"Memory stick micro\" formats\n|publisher=SanDisk\n|date=January 7, 2009\n|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}\n</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher MacManus |url=http://www.sonyinsider.com/2009/08/05/sony-finalizes-backwards-compatible-memory-stick-xc-with-2tb-maximum-capacity/ |title=Sonyinsider.com |publisher=Sonyinsider.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> The Memory Stick XC has a maximum 2&nbsp;TB capacity, 64 times larger than that of the Memory Stick PRO DUO which is limited to 32&nbsp;GB.

In spring 2001, Memory Stick attained 25% market share (against [[CompactFlash]]'s 40% and [[SmartMedia]]'s 32%), up from 7% a year earlier. By May 2001, total shipment of Memory Stick units surpassed 10 million.<ref name=\"simmtester.com\"/>\n\nHowever the [[SD card]], jointly developed by [[Toshiba]], [[Panasonic]] and [[SanDisk]], became widely popular among companies and soon became the most popular flash format - by November 2003 it held 42% market share in the United States, ahead of CompactFlash's 26% and Memory Stick with 16%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/02/business/technology-memory-evolution-survival-of-the-smallest.html|title=TECHNOLOGY; Memory Evolution: Survival of the Smallest|first=Eric A.|last=Taub|website=nytimes.com}}</ref> Eventually Sony itself became the only company to support the format.

For example, Sony [[Digital camera|digital compact cameras]] use Memory Stick for storing image files. With a Memory Stick-capable [[Memory card reader]] a user can copy the pictures taken with the Sony digital camera to a computer. Sony typically included Memory Stick reader hardware in its first-party consumer electronics, such as digital cameras, [[digital audio player|digital music players]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[mobile phone|cellular phones]], the [[VAIO]] line of laptop computers, TV sets under the WEGA and Bravia names, and Sony's handheld gaming device, the [[PlayStation Portable]].\n\nA special Memory Stick can be inserted in the hindquarters<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/08/19/48hours/main59024.shtml |title=CBS News, 48 Hours \u2013 AIBO, The Digital Wonder Dog: Sony Spends Millions On Robotic Canine |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> of Sony's [[AIBO]] robot pet, to enable the use of Aiboware\u2014software intended for use on AIBOs.

Only 8&nbsp;MB and 16&nbsp;MB versions are available.\n\n== Formats and form factors ==\nMemory Sticks include a wide range of actual formats, including three different form factors.\n\n=== Memory Stick  ===\n[[File:Memory Stick Front and Back.jpg|thumb|The original Memory Stick]]\n[[File:MSG-128A.jpg|thumb|Sony Memory Stick with MagicGate]]\nThe original Memory Stick is approximately the size and thickness of a stick of chewing gum. It was available in capacities from 4&nbsp;MB to 128&nbsp;MB. It was available both with and without MagicGate support. The MagicGate-capable memory sticks were white-colored, while the standard version was purple. The original Memory Stick is no longer manufactured.\n\n=== Memory Stick Select ===\n[[File:Memory Stick Select.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Lexar]] 256&nbsp;MB Memory Stick Select with memory switch.]]\nIn response to the storage limitations of the original Memory Stick, Sony introduced the '''Memory Stick Select''' at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2003 on January 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/articles/8431534296/mspro|title=Sony Memory Stick Pro and Select|website=dpreview.com}}</ref> The Memory Stick Select contained two separate 128&nbsp;MB partitions which the user could switch between using a physical switch on the card. This solution was fairly unpopular, but it did give users of older Memory Stick devices more capacity. Its physical size remained the same as the original Memory Stick.\n\n=== Memory Stick PRO ===\nThe '''Memory Stick PRO''', introduced on January 9, 2003 as a joint effort between Sony and [[SanDisk]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/200306/03-0617E// |title=Sony.net |publisher=Sony.net |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> would be the longer-lasting solution to the space problem. Most devices that use the original Memory Sticks support both the original and PRO sticks since both formats have identical form factors. Some readers that were not compatible could be upgraded to Memory Stick PRO support via a [[firmware]] update. Memory Stick PROs have a marginally higher transfer speed and a maximum theoretical capacity of 32&nbsp;GB{{clarify|1000^3 B or 1024^3 B?|date=February 2020}}, although it appears capacities higher than 4&nbsp;GB are only available in the PRO Duo form factor. High Speed Memory Stick PROs are available, and newer devices support this high speed mode, allowing for faster file transfers. All Memory Stick PROs larger than 1&nbsp;GB support this High Speed mode, and High Speed Memory Stick Pros are backwards-compatible with devices that don't support the High Speed mode. High capacity memory Sticks such as the 4&nbsp;GB versions are expensive compared to other types of flash memory such as SD cards and CompactFlash. According to Sony, the Memory Stick PRO has a maximum theoretical size of 2&nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]]{{clarify|1000^4 B or 1024^4 B?|date=February 2020}}.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nikkei Electronics Asia |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090108/163799/ |title=Nikkeibp.co.jp |publisher=Techon.nikkeibp.co.jp |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Memory Stick Duo ===\nThe '''Memory Stick Duo''' was developed in response to Sony's need for a smaller flash memory card for pocket-sized digital cameras, cell phones and the [[PlayStation Portable]]. It is slightly smaller than the competing [[Secure Digital]] (SD) format and roughly two thirds the length of the standard Memory Stick form factor, but costs more. Memory Stick Duos are available with the same features as the larger standard Memory Stick, available with and without high speed mode, and with and without [[MagicGate]] support. The Memory Stick PRO Duo has replaced the Memory Stick Duo due to its 128&nbsp;MB size limitation, but has kept the same form factor as the Duo.\n\n[[File:Memory Stick Duo Adaptor.jpg|thumbnail|right|Memory Stick Duo Adaptor and Memory Stick PRO Duo.]]\nA simple adapter allows Memory Stick Duo to be used in devices designed to accept the original Memory Stick form factor.\n\n=== Memory Stick PRO Duo ===\n[[File:MS-PRO-DUO.JPG|thumb|left|A Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo (2GB)]]\nThe '''Memory Stick PRO Duo (MSPD)''' quickly replaced the Memory Stick Duo due to the Duo's size limitation of 128&nbsp;MB and slow transfer speed. Memory Stick PRO Duos are available in all the same variants as the larger Memory Stick PRO, with and without High Speed mode, and with and without MagicGate support.\n\nSony has released different versions of Memory Stick PRO Duo.

While only serial and 4-bit parallel interfaces are supported in the Memory Stick PRO format, an 8-bit parallel interface was added to the Memory Stick PRO-HG format. Also, the maximum interface clock frequency was increased from 40&nbsp;MHz to 60&nbsp;MHz. With these enhancements, a theoretical transfer rate of 480&nbsp;Mbit/s (60&nbsp;Mbyte/s) is achieved, which is three times faster than the Memory Stick PRO format.\n\n=== Memory Stick Micro (M2) ===\n[[File:Sony Memory Stick Micro M2 - 1GB-0423.jpg|alt=|thumb|90x90px|Memory Stick Micro.]]\nIn a joint venture with [[SanDisk]], Sony released a new Memory Stick format on February 6, 2006. The '''Memory Stick Micro''' ('''M2''') measures 15 \u00d7 12.5 \u00d7 1.2&nbsp;mm (roughly one-quarter the size of the Duo) with 64&nbsp;MB, 128&nbsp;MB, 256&nbsp;MB, 512&nbsp;MB, 1&nbsp;GB, 2&nbsp;GB, 4&nbsp;GB, 8&nbsp;GB, and 16&nbsp;GB capacities available. The format has a theoretical limit of 32&nbsp;GB and maximum transfer speed of 160&nbsp;Mbit/s. However, as with the ''PRO Duo'' format, it has been expanded through the ''XC'' series as ''Memory Stick XC Micro'' and ''Memory Stick XC-HG Micro'', both with the theoretical maximum capacity of 2&nbsp;TB.<ref name=\"sonyinsider\" />\n\nThe M2 comes with an adapter, much like the Duo Sticks, to ensure physical compatibility with Memory Stick PRO devices. However, not all devices with a PRO slot are compatible with the M2/Adapter combination, as the firmware of older devices don't support the higher capacity of some M2 cards. One example is certain [[Sony CLI\u00c9]] [[PDA]]s which don't support cards larger than 2&nbsp;GB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sony-asia.com/microsite/memorystick/comp_chart/Clie_Handhelds.html |title=Sony Compatibility Chart \u2013 Clie Handhelds |publisher=Sony-asia.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSony announced on June 1, 2009, that M2 support in [[Sony Ericsson]] phones would be dropped in favor of [[microSD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/Exclusive--Sony-Ericsson-Dropping-Memory-Stick-Micro |title=Trusted Review \u2013 Sony Ericsson Dropping Memory Stick Micro |publisher=Trustedreviews.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Sony DSC-RX0 Mark II made a revived usage of M2 slots.\n\n=== Memory Stick XC ===\nOn January 7, 2009, [[SanDisk]] and Sony announced the Memory Stick XC format (tentatively named \"Memory Stick Format Series for Extended High Capacity\" at the time).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sandisk.com/about-sandisk/press-room/press-releases/2009/2009-01-07-sandisk-and-sony-to-expand-%E2%80%9Cmemory-stick-pro%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cmemory-stick-micro%E2%80%9D-formats\n|title=Sandisk and Sony to expand \"Memory stick pro\" and \"Memory stick micro\" formats\n|publisher=SanDisk\n|date=January 7, 2009\n|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}\n</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher MacManus |url=http://www.sonyinsider.com/2009/08/05/sony-finalizes-backwards-compatible-memory-stick-xc-with-2tb-maximum-capacity/ |title=Sonyinsider.com |publisher=Sonyinsider.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> The Memory Stick XC has a maximum 2&nbsp;TB capacity, 64 times larger than that of the Memory Stick PRO DUO which is limited to 32&nbsp;GB.

Although they FA claimed that the reason for the ban was to \"protect\" women, who they saw as not physically able to play football, it was widely purported that they felt the popularity of the team threatened the men's game. The crowds at the Dick, Kerr Ladies matches were often bigger than men's games being played on the same day. Less than a year after a match played before 53,000 fans packed into [[Goodison Park]], the Dick, Kerr Ladies, as well as all the other women's teams that had been established in England, lost their official recognition by the FA.\n\nThe resolution passed by the FA's Consultative Committee read:\n\n{{Quote|text=5. Women's Football Matches. The following Resolution was adopted:<br/>\nComplaints having been made as to football being played by women, Council felt impelled to express the strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.<br/>\nComplaints have also been made as to the conditions under which some of the matches have been arranged and played, and the appropriation of receipts to other than charitable objects.

The grounds that were under the FA's governance were the only ones that held enough capacity to meet the demand of the women's games in the early 1920s.

The team drew strong crowds from the beginning; Dick, Kerr beat Arundel Coulthard Factory 4\u20130 in front of a crowd of 10,000 on Christmas Day 1917 at [[Deepdale]].<ref name=guardian/>\n\nDick, Kerr played in charity fixtures against similar teams around the country and raised money for injured servicemen during and after the war. The ''Daily Post'' wrote, \"Dick, Kerr were not long in showing that they suffered less than their opponents from stage fright, and they had a better all-round understanding of the game. Their forward work, indeed, was often surprisingly good, one or two of the ladies showing quite admirable ball control.\" Players were paid 10 shillings a game by [[Dick, Kerr & Co.]] to cover their expenses.<ref name=guardian/><ref name=gainey />\n\n==International play begins (1920)==\nThe team played the first women's international in 1920 against France.

The first match was played at [[Deepdale]], where the squad won 2\u20130. The second match at Stockport was won by the Dick, Kerr Ladies 5\u20132 followed by the third game in Manchester which drew 1\u20131.

Although they FA claimed that the reason for the ban was to \"protect\" women, who they saw as not physically able to play football, it was widely purported that they felt the popularity of the team threatened the men's game. The crowds at the Dick, Kerr Ladies matches were often bigger than men's games being played on the same day. Less than a year after a match played before 53,000 fans packed into [[Goodison Park]], the Dick, Kerr Ladies, as well as all the other women's teams that had been established in England, lost their official recognition by the FA.\n\nThe resolution passed by the FA's Consultative Committee read:\n\n{{Quote|text=5. Women's Football Matches. The following Resolution was adopted:<br/>\nComplaints having been made as to football being played by women, Council felt impelled to express the strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.<br/>\nComplaints have also been made as to the conditions under which some of the matches have been arranged and played, and the appropriation of receipts to other than charitable objects. The Council are further of the opinion that an excessive proportion of the receipts are absorbed in expenses and an inadequate percentage devoted to charitable objects. <br/>\nFor these reasons the Council requests the Clubs belonging to the Association refuse the use of their grounds for such matches.|sign=FA Consultative Committee|source=<ref name=williamson_belles/>}}\n\nThe FA ban would stay in place for fifty years&nbsp;\u2013 finally being rescinded in 1971&nbsp;\u2013 and would ultimately become a major setback for the women's game in England. The grounds that were under the FA's governance were the only ones that held enough capacity to meet the demand of the women's games in the early 1920s. Because of the ban, women's games were relegated to smaller capacity fields with less resources and exposure.<ref name=williamson_belles>{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=David J.|title=Belles of the Ball|year=1991|publisher=R&D Associates|location=Devon, England|isbn=0951751204}}</ref>  The FA finally recognised women's football in July 1971, 50 years after they had banned the game and six years after the team folded.<ref name=fa_history /> The later Preston North End W.F.C., now [[Fylde Ladies F.C.|Fylde Ladies]], is unrelated to this team.\n\nThe women's game in England  was left on its own until 1993 when the FA took over its administration and funding.<ref name=fa_history /><ref>{{cite news|title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/women/4603149.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 July 2013|date=3 June 2005}}</ref><ref name=fa_ban>{{cite web|title=Let's Discuss the FA Ban|url=http://www.dickkerrladies.com/page7.htm|publisher=Dick Kerr Ladies|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==American Tour (1922)==\n[[File:Dick, Kerr's Ladies kiss.jpg|thumb|left|The team [[Captain (association football)|captains]] kiss]]\n{{\ncentered pull quote|The team will continue to play, if the organisers of charity matches will provide grounds, even if we have to play on ploughed fields.\n|author=Alfred \"Pop\" Frankland, Dick, Kerr's Ladies manager\n|source=''Belles of the Ball'' (1991), p. 75.\n}}\n\nDespite the FA ban, the team continued to play on non-FA grounds.
