Under the name \"Chicago Orchestra,\" the orchestra played its first concert October 16, 1891 at the [[Auditorium Theater]]. It is one of the oldest orchestras in the United States, along with the [[New York Philharmonic]], the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n[[Symphony Center|Orchestra Hall]], now a component of the Symphony Center complex, was designed by Chicago architect [[Daniel H. Burnham]] and completed in 1904. Maestro Thomas served as music director for thirteen years until his death shortly after the orchestra's newly built residence was dedicated December 14, 1904. The orchestra was renamed \"Theodore Thomas Orchestra\" in 1905 and today, Orchestra Hall still has \"Theodore Thomas Orchestra Hall\" inscribed in its fa\u00e7ade.\n\nIn 1905, [[Frederick Stock]] became music director, a post he held until his death in 1942. The orchestra was renamed the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1913.\n\nSubsequent music directors have included [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Defauw]], [[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]], [[Rafael Kubel\u00edk]], [[Fritz Reiner]], [[Jean Martinon]], [[Georg Solti]], and [[Daniel Barenboim]].\n\nOn May 5, 2008, the CSO Association's president [[Deborah Rutter]] announced that the orchestra had named [[Riccardo Muti]] as its 10th music director, starting with the 2010\u20132011 season, for an initial contract of 5 years.<ref name=\"Wakin\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/arts/music/06muti.html?ref=arts%26pagewanted=all| title= And the Brass Ring Goes to Chicago Symphony: Riccardo Muti Says Yes | work=[[The New York Times]]| first=Daniel J.| last=Wakin| date=5 May 2008| accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>  His contract has been renewed for another five years, through the 2020 season.<ref name=\"Patner\">{{cite news |url=http://voices.suntimes.com/arts-entertainment/the-daily-sizzle/riccardo-muti-renews-contract-with-chicago-symphony-orchestra |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Andrew |last=Patner |date=3 February 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2015 |title=Chicago - Chicago : News : Politics : Things To Do : Sports |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205085753/http://voices.suntimes.com/arts-entertainment/the-daily-sizzle/riccardo-muti-renews-contract-with-chicago-symphony-orchestra/ |archivedate=5 February 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe orchestra has also hosted many distinguished guest conductors, including [[Thomas Beecham]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[Morton Gould]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Erich Kunzel]], [[Erich Leinsdorf]], [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[Eugene Ormandy]], [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Leonard Slatkin]], [[Leopold Stokowski]], [[James Levine]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[George Szell]], [[Klaus Tennstedt]], [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], [[Bruno Walter]], and [[John Williams]]. Many of these guests have also recorded with the orchestra. [[Carlos Kleiber]] made his only symphonic guest appearances in America with the CSO in October 1978 and June 1983.\n\nThe three principal guest conductors of the orchestra have been [[Carlo Maria Giulini]], [[Claudio Abbado]], and [[Pierre Boulez]].\n\nThe CSO holds an annual fundraiser, originally known as the Chicago Symphony Marathon, more recently as \"Radiothon\" and \"Symphonython,\" in conjunction with Chicago radio station [[WFMT]]. As part of the event, from 1986 through 2008, the orchestra released tracks from their broadcast archives on double LP/CD collections, as well as two larger sets of broadcasts and rarities (CSO: The First 100 Years, 12 CDs, 1991; CSO in the 20th Century: Collector's Choice, 10 CDs, 2000).\n\n==Ravinia Festival==\n\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra maintains a summer home at the [[Ravinia Festival]] in [[Highland Park, Illinois]]. The CSO first performed there during Ravinia Park's second season on November 20, 1905<ref>https://csoarchives.wordpress.com/2016/03/10/125-moments-054-ravinia-park/</ref>, and continued to appear there on and off through August 1931, after which the Park fell dark due to the [[Great Depression]]. The CSO helped to inaugurate the first season of the [[Ravinia Festival]] on July 3, 1936<ref>https://csoarchives.wordpress.com/2016/04/12/125-moments-064-ravinia-festival/</ref>, and has been in residence at the Festival every summer since.\n\nMany conductors have made their debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at Ravinia, and several have gone on to become music director for the festival, including [[Seiji Ozawa]] (1964\u201368), James Levine (1973\u201393), and [[Christoph Eschenbach]] (1995\u20132003). [[James Conlon]], held the title from 2005 until 2015.<ref>https://csoarchives.wordpress.com/2016/09/20/125-moments-116-james-conlon/</ref> [[Marin Alsop]] served as the festival's first artistic curator from 2018 until 2019, and she will begin her tenure as chief conductor and curator in 2020.\n\nThe Ravinia Festival created an honorific title for James Levine\u2014\"Conductor Laureate\"\u2014and signed him to a five-year renewable contract beginning in 2018. On December 4, 2017, after Levine was accused of sexually abusing four males, the Ravinia Festival severed all ties with Levine, and terminated his five-year contract to lead the Chicago Symphony there.<ref>[http://www.berkshireeagle.com/stories/boston-symphony-management-to-industry-reflect-upon-reports-of-sexual-misconduct,526379]</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\nThe Chicago Symphony has amassed an extensive discography. Recordings by the CSO have earned 62 Grammy Awards from the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]. These include several Classical Album of the Year awards, awards in Best Classical Performance in vocal soloist, choral, instrumental, engineering and orchestral categories.\n\nOn May 1, 1916, Frederick Stock and the orchestra recorded the Wedding March from [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s music to ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' for [[Columbia Records]]. Stock and the CSO made numerous recordings for Columbia and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]/[[RCA Victor]].  The Chicago Symphony's first electrical recordings were made for Victor in December 1925, including a performance of [[Karl Goldmark]]'s ''In Springtime'' overture.  These early electrical recordings were made in Victor's Chicago studios; within a couple of years Victor began recording the CSO in Orchestra Hall. Stock continued recording for Columbia and RCA Victor until his death in 1942.\n\nIn 1951, [[Rafael Kubel\u00edk]] made the first modern high fidelity recordings with the orchestra, in Orchestra Hall, for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]].  Like the very first electrical recordings, these performances were made with a single microphone.  [[Philips]] has reissued these performances on compact disc with the original Mercury label and liner notes.\n\n[[File:Sir George Solti 6 Allan Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Georg Solti]]\nIn March 1954, [[Fritz Reiner]] made the first stereophonic recordings with the CSO, again in Orchestra Hall, for RCA Victor, including  performances of two symphonic poems by [[Richard Strauss]]: ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' and ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]''.  Reiner and the orchestra continued to record for RCA Victor through 1963.  These were mostly recorded in RCA Victor's triple-channel \"Living Stereo\" process.  RCA has digitally remastered the recordings and released them on CD and SACD.  [[Jean Martinon]] also recorded with the CSO for RCA Victor during the 1960s, producing performances that have been reissued on CD.\n\n[[Sir Georg Solti]] recorded with the CSO primarily for [[Decca Records]]. These [[Georg Solti discography|Solti recordings]] were issued in the U.S. on the London label and include a highly acclaimed [[Mahler]] series, recorded, in part, in the historic [[Medinah Temple]]\u2014some installments were recorded in the Krannert Center in the [[University of Illinois]] (Urbana, IL), as well as in the [[Sofiensaal]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].  Many of the recordings with [[Daniel Barenboim]] were released on [[Teldec]].\n\nIn 2007, the Chicago Symphony formed its own recording label, [[CSO Resound]]\u00a9. After an agreement was reached with the Orchestra's musicians, arrangements were made for new recordings to be released digitally at online outlets and on compact disc.<ref name=\"2007Recordings\"/> The first CSO Resound CD, a recording of Haitink's rendition of Mahler's Third Symphony, was released in the spring of 2007. Releases that followed included Bruckner's Seventh Symphony, Mahler's Sixth Symphony, and Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony (Grammy winner), all conducted by Haitink; Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony led by [[Myung-Whun Chung]]; \"Traditions and Transformations: Sounds of Silk Road Chicago\" with the Orchestra's Judson and Joyce Green Creative Consultant [[Yo-Yo Ma]] (Grammy winner); and recordings of Verdi's [[Verdi Requiem|Requiem]] (Grammy winner) and [[Otello]], under the direction of Muti.\n\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus have recorded the music for two movies: ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' conducted by James Levine and ''[[Lincoln (2012 film)]]'' conducted by John Williams. Selections from the Orchestra and Chorus's recording of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', conducted by Sir Georg Solti, were used in the movie ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''.\n\n==Broadcasts==\nThe Chicago Symphony first broadcast on the radio in 1925.  Though often sporadic, there have been broadcasts ever since. With the 1965-1966 season, Chicago radio station WFMT began regular tape-delayed stereo broadcasts of CSO concerts, running through the 1968-1969 season. They resumed from 1976 through the 2000-2001 season before ceasing due to lack of sponsorship. In 2007, the broadcasts once again resumed with a 52-week series.  The broadcasts were originally sponsored by [[BP]] and air on 98.7 [[WFMT]] in Chicago and the [[WFMT]] Radio Network.  They consist of 39 weeks of recordings of live concerts, as well as highlights from the CSO's vast discography.<ref name=\"2007Recordings\">{{cite press release| title= Chicago Symphony Orchestra Announces Major Radio and Recording Initiaves| publisher=Chicago Symphony Orchestra| date=2006-11-30| accessdate= 2013-09-18| url=http://www.wfmt.com/main.taf?p=7,4,1,1,1,13}}</ref>\n\nThe CSO appeared in a series of telecasts on [[WGN-TV]], beginning in 1953.  The early 1960s saw the videotaped telecast series ''Music from Chicago'', conducted by Fritz Reiner and guest conductors including [[Arthur Fiedler]], [[George Szell]], [[Pierre Monteux]], and [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]].  Many of these televised concerts, from 1953 to 1963, have since been released to DVD by [[VAI Distribution]].\n\nSir [[Georg Solti]] also conducted a series of concerts with the Chicago Symphony that were recorded for the European firm Unitel and were broadcast in the 1970s on [[PBS]].  They have subsequently been reissued by Decca Video on DVD.\n\n== Civic Orchestra of Chicago ==\n[[Frederick Stock]] founded the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, the first training orchestra in the United States affiliated with a major symphony orchestra, in 1919.  Its goal is to recruit pre-professional musicians and train them as high-level orchestra players.  Many alumni have gone on to play for the CSO or other major orchestras.  It is currently the only training orchestra sponsored by a major orchestra in North America.\n\nThe Civic Orchestra performs half a dozen orchestral concerts and a chamber music series annually in Symphony Center and in other venues throughout the Chicago area free of charge to the public.\n\n== Music directors, conductors ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n===Music directors===\n* 1891\u20131905 [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]]\n* 1905\u20131942 [[Frederick Stock]]\n* 1943\u20131947 [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Defauw]]\n* 1947\u20131948 [[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]]\n* 1950\u20131953 [[Rafael Kubel\u00edk]]\n* 1953\u20131962 [[Fritz Reiner]]\n* 1962\u20131963 [[Fritz Reiner]] (musical advisor)\n* 1963\u20131968 [[Jean Martinon]]\n* 1968\u20131969 [[Irwin Hoffman]] (acting music director)\n* 1969\u20131991 Sir [[Georg Solti]]\n* 1991\u20132006 [[Daniel Barenboim]]\n* 2010\u2013present [[Riccardo Muti]]\n\n===Titled Conductors===\n* 1969\u20131972 [[Carlo Maria Giulini]] \u2013 Principal Guest Conductor\n* 1982\u20131985 [[Claudio Abbado]] \u2013 Principal Guest Conductor\n* 1991\u20131997 Sir [[Georg Solti]] - Music Director Laureate\n* 1995\u20132006 [[Pierre Boulez]] \u2013 Principal Guest Conductor\n* 2006\u20132016 [[Pierre Boulez]] \u2013 Helen Regenstein Conductor Emeritus\n* 2006-2010 [[Bernard Haitink]] \u2013 Principal Conductor\n\n===Composers-in-Residence===\n* 1987\u20131990 [[John Corigliano]]\n* 1990\u20131997 [[Shulamit Ran]]\n* 1997\u20132006 [[Augusta Read Thomas]]\n* 2006-2010 [[Osvaldo Golijov]]\n* 2006-2010 [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Anna Clyne]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Mason Bates]]\n* 2015\u20132018 [[Elizabeth Ogonek]]\n* 2015\u20132018 [[Samuel Adams (composer)|Samuel Adams]]\n* 2018-present [[Missy Mazzoli]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n===Assistant / Associate Conductors===\n* [[Arthur Mees]] \u2013 Assistant 1896\u20131898\n* [[Frederick Stock]] \u2013 Assistant 1899\u20131905\n* [[Eric DeLamarter]] \u2013 Assistant 1918\u20131933, Associate 1933\u20131936\n* [[Hans Lange]] \u2013 Associate 1936\u20131943, Conductor 1943\u20131946\n* [[Tauno Hannikainen]] \u2013 Assistant 1947\u20131949, Associate 1949\u20131950\n* [[George Schick]] \u2013 Assistant 1950\u20131952, Associate 1952\u20131956\n* [[Walter Hendl]] \u2013 Associate 1958\u20131964\n* [[Irwin Hoffman]] \u2013 Assistant 1964\u20131965, Associate 1965\u20131968, Conductor 1969\u20131970\n* [[Henry Mazer]] \u2013 Associate 1970\u20131986\n* [[Kenneth Jean]] \u2013 Associate 1986\u20131993\n* [[Michael Morgan (conductor)|Michael Morgan]] \u2013 Assistant 1986\u20131993\n* [[Yaron Traub]] \u2013 Assistant 1995\u20131998, Associate 1998\u20131999\n* [[William Eddins]] \u2013 Assistant 1995\u20131998, Associate 1998\u20131999, Resident 1999\u20132004\n\n===Ravinia Festival===\n* 1959-1963 [[Walter Hendl]] \u2013 Artistic Director\n* 1964-1968 [[Seiji Ozawa]] - Music Director\n* 1969 Seiji Ozawa - Principal Conductor\n* 1970-1972 [[Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz (conductor)|Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz]] - Principal Conductor\n* 1973-1993 [[James Levine]] - Music Director\n* 1995-2003 [[Christoph Eschenbach]] - Music Director\n* 2005\u20132015 [[James Conlon]] - Music Director\n* 2018-2019 [[Marin Alsop]] - Artistic Curator\n* 2020- Marin Alsop - Chief Conductor and Curator\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Honors and awards==\n{{main article|List of awards received by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra}}\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra was voted the best orchestra in the United States and the fifth best orchestra in the world by editors of the British classical music magazine ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in November, 2008.<ref name=\"huizenga\">{{cite episode| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97291390| title=Chicago Symphony Tops U.S. Orchestras| first=Tom| last=Huizenga| network=[[NPR]]| series=[[Morning Edition]]| airdate=21 November 2008| accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref> The same was said by a panel of critics polled by the classical music website [[bachtrack]] in September, 2015.<ref name=\"pullinger\">{{citation| url=https://bachtrack.com/worlds-best-orchestra-best-conductor-critics-choice-september-2015| title=Chailly and the Berliner Philharmoniker: the critics\u2019 choice for World's Best Conductor and Orchestra| first=Mark| last=Pullinger| date=3 September 2015| accessdate=2015-11-30}}</ref>\n\n===Grammy Awards===\n[[File:Riccardo Muti.jpg|thumb|Riccardo Muti]]\nRecordings by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra have earned sixty-two [[Grammy Awards]] from the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]].\n\n[[Riccardo Muti]], music director, has won two Grammy Awards, both with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, for the recording of Verdi's ''Messa da Requiem'' on the CSO Resound label.

The orchestra was renamed the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1913.\n\nSubsequent music directors have included [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Defauw]], [[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]], [[Rafael Kubel\u00edk]], [[Fritz Reiner]], [[Jean Martinon]], [[Georg Solti]], and [[Daniel Barenboim]].\n\nOn May 5, 2008, the CSO Association's president [[Deborah Rutter]] announced that the orchestra had named [[Riccardo Muti]] as its 10th music director, starting with the 2010\u20132011 season, for an initial contract of 5 years.<ref name=\"Wakin\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/arts/music/06muti.html?ref=arts%26pagewanted=all| title= And the Brass Ring Goes to Chicago Symphony: Riccardo Muti Says Yes | work=[[The New York Times]]| first=Daniel J.| last=Wakin| date=5 May 2008| accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>  His contract has been renewed for another five years, through the 2020 season.<ref name=\"Patner\">{{cite news |url=http://voices.suntimes.com/arts-entertainment/the-daily-sizzle/riccardo-muti-renews-contract-with-chicago-symphony-orchestra |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Andrew |last=Patner |date=3 February 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2015 |title=Chicago - Chicago : News : Politics : Things To Do : Sports |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205085753/http://voices.suntimes.com/arts-entertainment/the-daily-sizzle/riccardo-muti-renews-contract-with-chicago-symphony-orchestra/ |archivedate=5 February 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe orchestra has also hosted many distinguished guest conductors, including [[Thomas Beecham]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[Morton Gould]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Erich Kunzel]], [[Erich Leinsdorf]], [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[Eugene Ormandy]], [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Leonard Slatkin]], [[Leopold Stokowski]], [[James Levine]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[George Szell]], [[Klaus Tennstedt]], [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], [[Bruno Walter]], and [[John Williams]]. Many of these guests have also recorded with the orchestra. [[Carlos Kleiber]] made his only symphonic guest appearances in America with the CSO in October 1978 and June 1983.\n\nThe three principal guest conductors of the orchestra have been [[Carlo Maria Giulini]], [[Claudio Abbado]], and [[Pierre Boulez]].\n\nThe CSO holds an annual fundraiser, originally known as the Chicago Symphony Marathon, more recently as \"Radiothon\" and \"Symphonython,\" in conjunction with Chicago radio station [[WFMT]]. As part of the event, from 1986 through 2008, the orchestra released tracks from their broadcast archives on double LP/CD collections, as well as two larger sets of broadcasts and rarities (CSO: The First 100 Years, 12 CDs, 1991; CSO in the 20th Century: Collector's Choice, 10 CDs, 2000).\n\n==Ravinia Festival==\n\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra maintains a summer home at the [[Ravinia Festival]] in [[Highland Park, Illinois]]. The CSO first performed there during Ravinia Park's second season on November 20, 1905<ref>https://csoarchives.wordpress.com/2016/03/10/125-moments-054-ravinia-park/</ref>, and continued to appear there on and off through August 1931, after which the Park fell dark due to the [[Great Depression]]. The CSO helped to inaugurate the first season of the [[Ravinia Festival]] on July 3, 1936<ref>https://csoarchives.wordpress.com/2016/04/12/125-moments-064-ravinia-festival/</ref>, and has been in residence at the Festival every summer since.\n\nMany conductors have made their debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at Ravinia, and several have gone on to become music director for the festival, including [[Seiji Ozawa]] (1964\u201368), James Levine (1973\u201393), and [[Christoph Eschenbach]] (1995\u20132003). [[James Conlon]], held the title from 2005 until 2015.<ref>https://csoarchives.wordpress.com/2016/09/20/125-moments-116-james-conlon/</ref> [[Marin Alsop]] served as the festival's first artistic curator from 2018 until 2019, and she will begin her tenure as chief conductor and curator in 2020.\n\nThe Ravinia Festival created an honorific title for James Levine\u2014\"Conductor Laureate\"\u2014and signed him to a five-year renewable contract beginning in 2018. On December 4, 2017, after Levine was accused of sexually abusing four males, the Ravinia Festival severed all ties with Levine, and terminated his five-year contract to lead the Chicago Symphony there.<ref>[http://www.berkshireeagle.com/stories/boston-symphony-management-to-industry-reflect-upon-reports-of-sexual-misconduct,526379]</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\nThe Chicago Symphony has amassed an extensive discography. Recordings by the CSO have earned 62 Grammy Awards from the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]. These include several Classical Album of the Year awards, awards in Best Classical Performance in vocal soloist, choral, instrumental, engineering and orchestral categories.\n\nOn May 1, 1916, Frederick Stock and the orchestra recorded the Wedding March from [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s music to ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' for [[Columbia Records]]. Stock and the CSO made numerous recordings for Columbia and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]/[[RCA Victor]].  The Chicago Symphony's first electrical recordings were made for Victor in December 1925, including a performance of [[Karl Goldmark]]'s ''In Springtime'' overture.  These early electrical recordings were made in Victor's Chicago studios; within a couple of years Victor began recording the CSO in Orchestra Hall. Stock continued recording for Columbia and RCA Victor until his death in 1942.\n\nIn 1951, [[Rafael Kubel\u00edk]] made the first modern high fidelity recordings with the orchestra, in Orchestra Hall, for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]].  Like the very first electrical recordings, these performances were made with a single microphone.  [[Philips]] has reissued these performances on compact disc with the original Mercury label and liner notes.\n\n[[File:Sir George Solti 6 Allan Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Georg Solti]]\nIn March 1954, [[Fritz Reiner]] made the first stereophonic recordings with the CSO, again in Orchestra Hall, for RCA Victor, including  performances of two symphonic poems by [[Richard Strauss]]: ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' and ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]''.  Reiner and the orchestra continued to record for RCA Victor through 1963.  These were mostly recorded in RCA Victor's triple-channel \"Living Stereo\" process.  RCA has digitally remastered the recordings and released them on CD and SACD.  [[Jean Martinon]] also recorded with the CSO for RCA Victor during the 1960s, producing performances that have been reissued on CD.\n\n[[Sir Georg Solti]] recorded with the CSO primarily for [[Decca Records]]. These [[Georg Solti discography|Solti recordings]] were issued in the U.S. on the London label and include a highly acclaimed [[Mahler]] series, recorded, in part, in the historic [[Medinah Temple]]\u2014some installments were recorded in the Krannert Center in the [[University of Illinois]] (Urbana, IL), as well as in the [[Sofiensaal]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].  Many of the recordings with [[Daniel Barenboim]] were released on [[Teldec]].\n\nIn 2007, the Chicago Symphony formed its own recording label, [[CSO Resound]]\u00a9. After an agreement was reached with the Orchestra's musicians, arrangements were made for new recordings to be released digitally at online outlets and on compact disc.<ref name=\"2007Recordings\"/> The first CSO Resound CD, a recording of Haitink's rendition of Mahler's Third Symphony, was released in the spring of 2007. Releases that followed included Bruckner's Seventh Symphony, Mahler's Sixth Symphony, and Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony (Grammy winner), all conducted by Haitink; Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony led by [[Myung-Whun Chung]]; \"Traditions and Transformations: Sounds of Silk Road Chicago\" with the Orchestra's Judson and Joyce Green Creative Consultant [[Yo-Yo Ma]] (Grammy winner); and recordings of Verdi's [[Verdi Requiem|Requiem]] (Grammy winner) and [[Otello]], under the direction of Muti.\n\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus have recorded the music for two movies: ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' conducted by James Levine and ''[[Lincoln (2012 film)]]'' conducted by John Williams. Selections from the Orchestra and Chorus's recording of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', conducted by Sir Georg Solti, were used in the movie ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''.\n\n==Broadcasts==\nThe Chicago Symphony first broadcast on the radio in 1925.  Though often sporadic, there have been broadcasts ever since. With the 1965-1966 season, Chicago radio station WFMT began regular tape-delayed stereo broadcasts of CSO concerts, running through the 1968-1969 season. They resumed from 1976 through the 2000-2001 season before ceasing due to lack of sponsorship. In 2007, the broadcasts once again resumed with a 52-week series.  The broadcasts are sponsored by [[BP]] and air on 98.7 [[WFMT]] in Chicago and the [[WFMT]] Radio Network.  They consist of 39 weeks of recordings of live concerts, as well as highlights from the CSO's vast discography.<ref name=\"2007Recordings\">{{cite press release| title= Chicago Symphony Orchestra Announces Major Radio and Recording Initiaves| publisher=Chicago Symphony Orchestra| date=2006-11-30| accessdate= 2013-09-18| url=http://www.wfmt.com/main.taf?p=7,4,1,1,1,13}}</ref>\n\nThe CSO appeared in a series of telecasts on [[WGN-TV]], beginning in 1953.  The early 1960s saw the videotaped telecast series ''Music from Chicago'', conducted by Fritz Reiner and guest conductors including [[Arthur Fiedler]], [[George Szell]], [[Pierre Monteux]], and [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]].  Many of these televised concerts, from 1953 to 1963, have since been released to DVD by [[VAI Distribution]].\n\nSir [[Georg Solti]] also conducted a series of concerts with the Chicago Symphony that were recorded for the European firm Unitel and were broadcast in the 1970s on [[PBS]].  They have subsequently been reissued by Decca Video on DVD.\n\n== Civic Orchestra of Chicago ==\n[[Frederick Stock]] founded the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, the first training orchestra in the United States affiliated with a major symphony orchestra, in 1919.  Its goal is to recruit pre-professional musicians and train them as high-level orchestra players.  Many alumni have gone on to play for the CSO or other major orchestras.  It is currently the only training orchestra sponsored by a major orchestra in North America.\n\nThe Civic Orchestra performs half a dozen orchestral concerts and a chamber music series annually in Symphony Center and in other venues throughout the Chicago area free of charge to the public.\n\n== Music directors, conductors ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n===Music directors===\n* 1891\u20131905 [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]]\n* 1905\u20131942 [[Frederick Stock]]\n* 1943\u20131947 [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Defauw]]\n* 1947\u20131948 [[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]]\n* 1950\u20131953 [[Rafael Kubel\u00edk]]\n* 1953\u20131962 [[Fritz Reiner]]\n* 1962\u20131963 [[Fritz Reiner]] (musical advisor)\n* 1963\u20131968 [[Jean Martinon]]\n* 1968\u20131969 [[Irwin Hoffman]] (acting music director)\n* 1969\u20131991 Sir [[Georg Solti]]\n* 1991\u20132006 [[Daniel Barenboim]]\n* 2010\u2013present [[Riccardo Muti]]\n\n===Titled Conductors===\n* 1969\u20131972 [[Carlo Maria Giulini]] \u2013 Principal Guest Conductor\n* 1982\u20131985 [[Claudio Abbado]] \u2013 Principal Guest Conductor\n* 1991\u20131997 Sir [[Georg Solti]] - Music Director Laureate\n* 1995\u20132006 [[Pierre Boulez]] \u2013 Principal Guest Conductor\n* 2006\u20132016 [[Pierre Boulez]] \u2013 Helen Regenstein Conductor Emeritus\n* 2006-2010 [[Bernard Haitink]] \u2013 Principal Conductor\n\n===Composers-in-Residence===\n* 1987\u20131990 [[John Corigliano]]\n* 1990\u20131997 [[Shulamit Ran]]\n* 1997\u20132006 [[Augusta Read Thomas]]\n* 2006-2010 [[Osvaldo Golijov]]\n* 2006-2010 [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Anna Clyne]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Mason Bates]]\n* 2015\u20132018 [[Elizabeth Ogonek]]\n* 2015\u20132018 [[Samuel Adams (composer)|Samuel Adams]]\n* 2018-present [[Missy Mazzoli]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n===Assistant / Associate Conductors===\n* [[Arthur Mees]] \u2013 Assistant 1896\u20131898\n* [[Frederick Stock]] \u2013 Assistant 1899\u20131905\n* [[Eric DeLamarter]] \u2013 Assistant 1918\u20131933, Associate 1933\u20131936\n* [[Hans Lange]] \u2013 Associate 1936\u20131943, Conductor 1943\u20131946\n* [[Tauno Hannikainen]] \u2013 Assistant 1947\u20131949, Associate 1949\u20131950\n* [[George Schick]] \u2013 Assistant 1950\u20131952, Associate 1952\u20131956\n* [[Walter Hendl]] \u2013 Associate 1958\u20131964\n* [[Irwin Hoffman]] \u2013 Assistant 1964\u20131965, Associate 1965\u20131968, Conductor 1969\u20131970\n* [[Henry Mazer]] \u2013 Associate 1970\u20131986\n* [[Kenneth Jean]] \u2013 Associate 1986\u20131993\n* [[Michael Morgan (conductor)|Michael Morgan]] \u2013 Assistant 1986\u20131993\n* [[Yaron Traub]] \u2013 Assistant 1995\u20131998, Associate 1998\u20131999\n* [[William Eddins]] \u2013 Assistant 1995\u20131998, Associate 1998\u20131999, Resident 1999\u20132004\n\n===Ravinia Festival===\n* 1959-1963 [[Walter Hendl]] \u2013 Artistic Director\n* 1964-1968 [[Seiji Ozawa]] - Music Director\n* 1969 Seiji Ozawa - Principal Conductor\n* 1970-1972 [[Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz (conductor)|Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz]] - Principal Conductor\n* 1973-1993 [[James Levine]] - Music Director\n* 1995-2003 [[Christoph Eschenbach]] - Music Director\n* 2005\u20132015 [[James Conlon]] - Music Director\n* 2018-2019 [[Marin Alsop]] - Artistic Curator\n* 2020- Marin Alsop - Chief Conductor and Curator\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Honors and awards==\n{{main article|List of awards received by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra}}\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra was voted the best orchestra in the United States and the fifth best orchestra in the world by editors of the British classical music magazine ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in November, 2008.<ref name=\"huizenga\">{{cite episode| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97291390| title=Chicago Symphony Tops U.S. Orchestras| first=Tom| last=Huizenga| network=[[NPR]]| series=[[Morning Edition]]| airdate=21 November 2008| accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref> The same was said by a panel of critics polled by the classical music website [[bachtrack]] in September, 2015.<ref name=\"pullinger\">{{citation| url=https://bachtrack.com/worlds-best-orchestra-best-conductor-critics-choice-september-2015| title=Chailly and the Berliner Philharmoniker: the critics\u2019 choice for World's Best Conductor and Orchestra| first=Mark| last=Pullinger| date=3 September 2015| accessdate=2015-11-30}}</ref>\n\n===Grammy Awards===\n[[File:Riccardo Muti.jpg|thumb|Riccardo Muti]]\nRecordings by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra have earned sixty-two [[Grammy Awards]] from the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]].\n\n[[Riccardo Muti]], music director, has won two Grammy Awards, both with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, for the recording of Verdi's ''Messa da Requiem'' on the CSO Resound label.
