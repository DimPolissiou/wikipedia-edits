In 1872, the partnership of Leopold Schlesinger and David Mayer began after their immigration from Bavaria. In 1881 Schlesinger and Mayer had moved their dry-goods store into the Bowen Building that was on the corner of State and Madison. In 1890, Schlesinger and Mayer hired Adler and Sullivan to prepare plans for the removal of the Bowen Building's attic story and the addition of two stories across the Bowen Building and the adjacent four-story structure to the south. The facades were added to match the bottom stories of the building and the building was painted white.\n\nIn 1892, Schlesinger and Mayer hired Adler and Sullivan to do further remodeling and add a new entrance to the corner of State and Madison. In 1896, Sullivan, no longer working with Adler, was asked back by Schlesinger and Mayer to redesign the fa\u00e7ade and add two stories to the newly leased four-story building on Wabash avenue, as well as connecting it to the State Street store. That never happened because Schlesinger and Mayer changed their minds to make it a ten-story building, which also never happened. It eventually got painted white and then a bridge was added that connected the second story of the building to the elevated railroad. In 1898, Schlesinger and Mayer decided to remove the original building located on State and Madison replace it with a new building designed by Sullivan. Sullivan had both a nine and twelve-story proposal made up for this new building. They eventually started with a nine-story portion of the building that was made on the Madison Street side next to the original portion of the Adler and Sullivan renovations.\n\nIn 1902 Schlesinger and Mayer came back to Sullivan wanting a twenty-story building on State and Madison, eventually settling for the final twelve stories. The Madison Street portion that was added earlier did not structurally support twelve stories so it was left as is. Sullivan came up with a three-stage plan to finish the new building and allow Schlesinger and Mayer to keep their business running during the Christmas season.<ref name=\"siry\">{{cite book| title=Carson Pirie Scott: Louis Sullivan and the Chicago Department Store| url=https://www.amazon.com/Carson-Pirie-Scott-Department-Architecture/dp/0226761371#reader_0226761371| author=Joseph Siry| pages=3, 65| publisher=University of Chicago Press| place=Chicago| year=1988| isbn=0-226-76136-3}}</ref>\n\nThe building is remarkable for its steel-framed structure, which allowed a dramatic increase in window area created by bay-wide windows, which in turn allowed for the greatest amount of daylight into the building interiors. This steel framed structure uses the post-and-lintel technique to provide a strong, light, and fireproof steel skeleton. The exterior of the building consists of a grid of piers and spandrels that reveals the post-and-lintel technique that supports the building.<ref>http://www.architecture.org/learn/resources/buildings-of-chicago/building/sullivan-center/</ref> The design was the first use of what became known as the [[Chicago window]]. At street level, the broad expanses of glass allowed for larger displays of merchandise to outside pedestrian traffic creating the idea of the sidewalk showcase.  In between the windows were bands of terra cotta, replacing an earlier plan for white Georgia marble, to save cost and weight and to avoid delays arising from a stonecutter's strike.<ref>Siry, p.97</ref> The design featured bronze-plated cast-iron ornamental work above the rounded tower.  The project also included a fire suppression sprinkler system, supplied from a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} water tower on the roof.\n\n[[File:Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building 1 South State Street entrance.jpg|left|thumb|267px|The building's northwest entrance]]\n\nSullivan designed the corner entry to be seen from both State and Madison.  The attractive ornamentation above the entrance would give the store an elegant and unique persona important to the building's competition with neighboring stores.<ref>Siry, pp.3,65,77\u201379,82,88,90\u201393,101</ref> The building is one of the classic structures of the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago school]].

This addition was the pedestrian bridge that connected the train station, behind the store on Wabash Avenue, to the second floor of the Sullivan Center. This too was coated in elaborate metalwork and provided a sense of special entry to those who used it.<ref>Siry, pp.77\u201379</ref>\n\nIn February 2006, the first phase of a multi-year restoration of the building's upper facade was completed.  In addition to cleaning, the cornice and supporting columns were recreated on the 12th floor.<ref name=\"cornice\"/>  A 2001 report put the budget at $68.9 million for this renovation.\n\nIn August 2006 the parent company of Carson Pirie Scott, ([[The Bon-Ton|Bon-Ton Stores Inc.]]), announced that after the 2006 Christmas season, the department store in the building would close.

In 1872, the partnership of Leopold Schlesinger and David Mayer began after their immigration from Bavaria. In 1881 Schlesinger and Mayer had moved their dry-goods store into the Bowen Building that was on the corner of State and Madison. In 1890, Schlesinger and Mayer hired Adler and Sullivan to prepare plans for the removal of the Bowen Building's attic story and the addition of two stories across the Bowen Building and the adjacent four-story structure to the south. The facades were added to match the bottom stories of the building and the building was painted white.\n\nIn 1892, Schlesinger and Mayer hired Adler and Sullivan to do further remodeling and add a new entrance to the corner of State and Madison. In 1896, Sullivan, no longer working with Adler, was asked back by Schlesinger and Mayer to redesign the fa\u00e7ade and add two stories to the newly leased four-story building on Wabash avenue, as well as connecting it to the State Street store. That never happened because Schlesinger and Mayer changed their minds to make it a ten-story building, which also never happened. It eventually got painted white and then a bridge was added that connected the second story of the building to the elevated railroad. In 1898, Schlesinger and Mayer decided to remove the original building located on State and Madison replace it with a new building designed by Sullivan. Sullivan had both a nine and twelve-story proposal made up for this new building. They eventually started with a nine-story portion of the building that was made on the Madison Street side next to the original portion of the Adler and Sullivan renovations.\n\nIn 1902 Schlesinger and Mayer came back to Sullivan wanting a twenty-story building on State and Madison, eventually settling for the final twelve stories. The Madison Street portion that was added earlier did not structurally support twelve stories so it was left as is. Sullivan came up with a three-stage plan to finish the new building and allow Schlesinger and Mayer to keep their business running during the Christmas season.<ref name=\"siry\">{{cite book| title=Carson Pirie Scott: Louis Sullivan and the Chicago Department Store| url=https://www.amazon.com/Carson-Pirie-Scott-Department-Architecture/dp/0226761371#reader_0226761371| author=Joseph Siry| pages=3, 65| publisher=University of Chicago Press| place=Chicago| year=1988| isbn=0-226-76136-3}}</ref>\n\nThe building is remarkable for its steel-framed structure, which allowed a dramatic increase in window area created by bay-wide windows, which in turn allowed for the greatest amount of daylight into the building interiors. This steel framed structure uses the post-and-lintel technique to provide a strong, light, and fireproof steel skeleton. The exterior of the building consists of a grid of piers and spandrels that reveals the post-and-lintel technique that supports the building. <ref>http://www.architecture.org/learn/resources/buildings-of-chicago/building/sullivan-center/</ref>. The design was the first use of what became known as the [[Chicago window]]. At street level, the broad expanses of glass allowed for larger displays of merchandise to outside pedestrian traffic creating the idea of the sidewalk showcase.  In between the windows were bands of terra cotta, replacing an earlier plan for white Georgia marble, to save cost and weight and to avoid delays arising from a stonecutter's strike.<ref>Siry, p.97</ref> The design featured bronze-plated cast-iron ornamental work above the rounded tower.  The project also included a fire suppression sprinkler system, supplied from a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} water tower on the roof.\n\n[[File:Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building 1 South State Street entrance.jpg|left|thumb|267px|The building's northwest entrance]]\n\nSullivan designed the corner entry to be seen from both State and Madison.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that, Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself, \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...[H]e had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

It's a tremendous preparation for the boardinghouse ... and the terrible walk of George Minafer when he gets his comeuppance. And without that, there wasn't any plot.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that, Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself, \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...[H]e had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare.

And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

It has been Conservative since 2019.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1974\u20131983''': The County Borough of Teesside wards of Coatham, Eston Grange, Kirkleatham, Ormesby, Redcar, and South Bank.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The Borough of Langbaurgh wards of Bankside, Church Lane, Coatham, Dormanstown, Eston, Grangetown, Kirkleatham, Newcomen, Normanby, Ormesby, Overfields, Redcar, South Bank, Teesville, and West Dyke.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Langbaurgh-on-Tees wards of Coatham, Dormanstown, Eston, Grangetown, Kirkleatham, Longbeck, Newcomen, Normanby, Ormesby, Redcar, St Germain's, South Bank, Teesville, and West Dyke.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Borough of Redcar and Cleveland wards of Coatham, Dormanstown, Eston, Grangetown, Kirkleatham, Longbeck, Newcomen, Normanby, Ormesby, St Germain's, South Bank, Teesville, West Dyke, and Zetland.\n\nThe Redcar constituency on the Cleveland coast is formed from parts of the [[Redcar and Cleveland]] district.\n\nIt takes its name from the coastal resort of [[Redcar]] although much of the population lives in the traditionally solid Labour areas between Redcar and [[Middlesbrough]] (such as [[Grangetown, North Yorkshire|Grangetown]], [[Eston]], [[Normanby, Redcar and Cleveland|Normanby]], [[Ormesby]] and [[South Bank, Middlesbrough|South Bank]]).  It also includes [[Dormanstown]], [[Kirkleatham]] and [[Marske-by-the-Sea]]. Once held by the former [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Mo Mowlam]], the seat was gained by the Liberal Democrats in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] on a massive 21.8% swing from Labour, the largest swing in England since the Second World War outside of by-elections. In [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], however, the sitting MP [[Ian Swales]] did not seek re-election, and Labour regained the seat on another huge swing of 18.9% away from the Liberal Democrats, who polled just ahead of [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] with the Conservatives in fourth. In [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]], the seat was one of a number of long standing Labour seats in the north of England which fell to the Conservatives.<ref name=\"Jennings2019\">{{cite news |last1=Jennings |first1=Will |title=General election: The map of British politics has been redrawn |url=https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-the-map-of-british-politics-has-been-redrawn-11885274 |accessdate=17 January 2020 |publisher=Sky News |date=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Constituency profile==\nThe constituency had a slightly higher unemployment at the end of 2012 than the North-East average.

It also includes [[Dormanstown]], [[Kirkleatham]] and [[Marske-by-the-Sea]]. Once held by the former [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Mo Mowlam]], the seat was gained by the Liberal Democrats in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] on a massive 21.8% swing from Labour, the largest swing in England since the Second World War outside of by-elections. In [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], however, the sitting MP [[Ian Swales]] did not seek re-election, and Labour regained the seat on another huge swing of 18.9% away from the Liberal Democrats, who polled just ahead of [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] with the Conservatives in fourth. In [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]], the seat was one of a number of long standing Labour seats in the north of England which fell to the Conservatives.<ref name=\"Jennings2019\">{{cite news |last1=Jennings |first1=Will |title=General election: The map of British politics has been redrawn |url=https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-the-map-of-british-politics-has-been-redrawn-11885274 |accessdate=17 January 2020 |publisher=Sky News |date=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Constituency profile==\nThe constituency had a slightly higher unemployment at the end of 2012 than the North-East average.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some of Chicago's most prominent families attended this church. It is renowned for its interior, completely redone in the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] style after a disastrous fire in 1900. The sanctuary is one of America's best examples of an unaltered Arts and Crafts church interior, fully embodying that movement's principles of simplicity, hand craftsmanship, and unity of design.

From 1851 until 1871, the congregation worshipped in a church at the northeast corner of Wabash Avenue and Washington Street in downtown Chicago. Known as the spotted church because of the tar deposits in its limestone blocks, this building was designed by the noted eastern architect, [[James Renwick, Jr.]] Renwick later designed [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in [[New York City]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution Building|original building]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Already in the late 1860s, downtown Chicago was becoming more commercial and less residential, and Second Presbyterian's leaders prepared plans to follow its membership to the near [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]]. Just a few weeks before the [[Great Chicago Fire]] in October 1871, which destroyed the spotted church, the congregation had merged with another congregation and had relocated to the South Side.\n\nMany wealthy Chicago residents attended Second Presbyterian, including members of the [[George Pullman]], [[Silas B. Cobb]], [[Timothy Blackstone]], and George Armour families. These were men who moved to Chicago from New England or New York State in the mid-nineteenth century to make their fortunes and build a new metropolis on the prairie. Proud of their adopted city, they endowed cultural institutions like the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], the [[Abraham Lincoln|president's]] son, was also a church trustee. When the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] emerged in the 1870s as the city's premier residential neighborhood, the business elite built imposing houses on South [[Prairie Avenue]], South [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], South Calumet Avenue and other streets.<ref name=\"poole\">{{cite book| last=Poole| first=Ernest| year=1943| title=Giants Gone: Men Who Made Chicago| publisher=Whittlesey House| location=}}</ref>\n\n==Original appearance of the church==\nFor its new building on South [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] at 20th Street (now Cullerton), the congregation again turned to James Renwick. Renwick designed a church based on early [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] examples, with a high-pitched gable roof, a [[rose window]] in the east wall, and a corner bell tower. The exterior is clad in limestone with sandstone trim. Sculpture on the exterior is limited; the [[Four Evangelists]] and the head of Jesus appear on the entry wall on Michigan and [[gargoyle]]s loom from the bell tower. The interior was also thoroughly Gothic, with pointed arches leading to the side aisles, slender iron columns supporting the balcony, and extensive stenciling adorning the walls. The sanctuary in the new building was dedicated in 1874.\n\nIn March 1900, fire gutted the sanctuary. The church turned to one of its members, [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]], for the rebuilding. Shaw, 31 at the time, was a graduate of [[Yale University]] and the architecture program of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. After working briefly in the office of Chicago's skyscraper pioneer [[William Le Baron Jenney]], Shaw established his own practice. Shaw also had traveled extensively in Britain and was familiar with the work of [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] architects like [[Philip Webb]] and [[C.F.A. Voysey]].<ref name=\"greene\">{{cite book| last=Greene| first=Virginia A.| year=1999| title=The Architecture of Howard Van Doren Shaw| page=24| publisher=Chicago Review Press| isbn=978-1556522864}}</ref>\n\n==The remodeled interior==\n[[File:Sanctuary 1902.jpg|thumb|left|225px|View of the remodeled sanctuary, c. 1902]]\n\nShaw, working with his friend, the painter [[Frederic Clay Bartlett]], and several other designers and craftsmen, gave Second Presbyterian a sanctuary firmly rooted in [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] principles. Abandoning the original neo-Gothic approach, Shaw lowered the pitch of the roof and moved the support columns closer to the side walls to visually increase the width of the space, and used warm stained oak and plaster panels throughout. He planned an auditorium-style sanctuary, with no central aisle. This was appropriate for a congregation that emphasized preaching and musical worship. For the same reason, the pews are gently curved, providing good sight lines to the pulpit. The decorative program of the interior is rich, but subdued, emphasizing brown, buff, dusky crimson, and dull gold.\n\nThe church's figurative art, with dozens of angels in glass, wood, and plaster, and two brightly colored saints in the lobby windows, is perhaps surprising for a Presbyterian congregation. This congregation, however, was culturally sophisticated and well-traveled. Many members had seen the great cathedrals of Europe and wanted their home church to make an equivalent artistic statement.\n\nIn line with the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] ethos, Shaw and Bartlett designed every element of the new interior to work together to create a restful and harmonious whole. Attention was paid to every detail of pew carving, plaster casting, and fixture design. Leading Chicago area designers and craftsmen were employed for elements like the seven-armed electric candelabra flanking the pulpit (William Lau) and the four stately heralding angels standing atop the organ case (Beil & Mauch). Electric lighting was used throughout the sanctuary, and Shaw embraced the naked bulbs as design elements in the circular chandeliers and the fixtures hanging over the side aisles.\n\nA number of recurring motifs tie the various interior elements together. The most obvious is that of the angel. Some 175 grace the interior, including the four heralding angels above the organ loft and those carved into the brackets from which the chandeliers hang. Another recurring motif is the grapevine, found in the pew ends, the light screen at the sanctuary's rear, many of Bartlett's murals, and the dull gold of the screen concealing the organ pipes.<ref name=\"robie\"/>  The congregation installed a Hutchins-Votey organ following the 1900 fire.<ref name=\"minutes\">{{cite journal| title=Minutes of the Board of Trustees| publisher=Second Presbyterian Church| date=23 March 1903}}</ref>  The [[Austin Organs|Austin Organ Co.]] reworked the instrument in 1917 as its Opus 767, providing it with a two-manual console and ten ranks.<ref name=\"austin\">{{cite web| title=Organs in the Midwest| url= http://www.austinorgans.com/aoisearchableopusmidwest.html| publisher=Austin Organs, Inc.| accessdate=2013-10-29}}</ref>  The organ today has 43 ranks and 2,600 pipes.\n\nSecond Presbyterian Church occupies a prominent place in Chicago's social and industrial history and its artistic heritage. Its glorious interior is now being seen by a wider audience after decades of semi-obscurity. Tours featuring the art and architecture of the building are offered on a regular schedule.

Bartlett| work=[[House Beautiful]]| pages=8\u201310}}</ref>  From a well-to-do Chicago family, Bartlett had studied painting at [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich|Munich's Royal Academy]] and with masters in [[Paris]]. For Second Presbyterian, Bartlett sought inspiration in the work of medieval church painters. He consciously rejected the post-Renaissance artistic tradition, with its emphasis on perspective and verisimilitude. Bartlett preferred to focus on expressiveness and spirituality, which he found in the flat and serene figures painted on the walls of medieval Italian churches. Bartlett painted directly on the dry plaster of the sanctuary's vertical walls. The paintings in the ceilings of the arches were done on canvas in his studio and then mounted in the church. Bartlett's figures have bold outlines and sumptuous robes of muted blue, crimson, and green. He used gold leaf extensively and supplied relief to features like haloes with a plaster technique known as [[pargeting]].<ref name=\"waggoner\">{{cite news| last=Waggoner| first=J.

Above that is a celestial orchestra in medieval robes. Bartlett's care in blending decoration to the sanctuary's architecture is evident; his rainbow echoes the curve of the ceiling. Bartlett's work in the twelve bays of the balcony centers on the themes of praise, abundance, and sacred music. Texts from scripture are painted on the walls below the figures.<ref name=\"robie\"/>\n\n===Windows===\n\nWhen the sanctuary was rededicated in 1901, many of its arched openings contained simple windows with small, stylized floral designs by [[Howard Van Doren Shaw|Shaw]] and executed by the firm of Gianini and Hilgart. Soon the bays began to be filled with specially commissioned memorial windows. Now, only the last bay on the north side of the church displays [[Howard Van Doren Shaw|Shaw's]] work. Members of the congregation gave the other windows in memory of departed loved ones. Nine of the windows are by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]]\u2019s firm and display many of the innovative glass-working techniques that he pioneered. Tiffany looked to get artistic effects from the character of the glass itself rather than by painting on the glass. He used folded glass, confetti glass, striated glass, and multiple layers of glass. The windows portray a variety of Biblical scenes, landscapes, and ornamental designs. In the east end of the church is a boldly colored representation of the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], designed by William Fair Kline. Below it are the five scourges or ''[[Arma Christi]]'' of Jesus.<ref name=\"frueh\">{{cite book| last1=Frueh| first1= Erne R.| first2=Florence| last2=Frueh| date=October 1983| title=Chicago Stained Glass| url=https://archive.org/details/chicagostainedgl0000frue| url-access=registration| publisher=Loyola University Press| pages=[https://archive.org/details/chicagostainedgl0000frue/page/94 94\u2013104]| isbn=978-0829404357}}</ref>  Other sanctuary windows were designed by Louis J.

Burne-Jones was a close associate of [[William Morris]], founder of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] in Britain. [[Morris and Co.]] crafted these two windows from the designs of Burne-Jones. The subjects are [[Margaret the Virgin|St. Margaret of Antioch]], in robes of rich crimson, and [[Saint Cecilia|St. Cecilia]], in blue robes, a portable organ in her arms. These windows were displayed in the William Morris Memorial Room of Chicago's Tobey Furniture Co. before being purchased by the Franklin Darius Gray family and made into memorials. Burne-Jones windows are rare in the United States; these are the only ones known outside of the East Coast.<ref name=\"frueh\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chicago Landmark]]\n*[[List of Registered Historic Places in Chicago]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Second Presbyterian Church (Chicago, Illinois)}}\n*[http://www.2ndpresbyterianfriends.org/ Friends of Historic Second Church]\n*[http://www.2ndpresbyterian.org/ Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060205113849/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/S/SecondPresbyterian.html Chicago Landmarks, Second Presbyterian]\n*[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=205845 Emporis Buildings, Second Presbyterian]\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\t\n{{Chicago Landmark places of worship}}\n\n[[Category:19th-century Presbyterian church buildings in the United States]]\n[[Category:Churches in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Howard Van Doren Shaw church buildings]]\n[[Category:National Historic Landmarks in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Presbyterian churches in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1874]]\n[[Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NRHP | name =Second Presbyterian Church\n| nrhp_type = NHL\n| image = Second Presbyterian Church Chicago IL.jpg\n| image_size = 275px\n| caption = (2010)\n| location= 1936 South Michigan Avenue<br>[[Chicago, Illinois]]\n| designated_other1_name= Chicago Landmark\n| designated_other1_date= September 28, 1977\n| designated_other1_abbr= CL\n| designated_other1_link= Chicago Landmark\n| designated_other1_color= #aaccff\n| designated_nrhp_type= February 27, 2013\n| coordinates = {{coord|41|51|21|N|87|37|28|W|display=inline,title}}\n| locmapin = United States Chicago Central\n| map_label = Second Presbyterian Church\n| label_position = right\n| map_caption = Location in central Chicago\n| area =\n| built =1874\n| architect= Renwick & Sands; Shaw, Howard Van Doren\n| architecture= Late Gothic Revival, Other\n| added = December 27, 1974\n| governing_body = Private\n| refnum=74000754<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Second Presbyterian Church''' is a landmark [[Gothic Revival]] church located on South [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].

Bartlett preferred to focus on expressiveness and spirituality, which he found in the flat and serene figures painted on the walls of medieval Italian churches. Bartlett painted directly on the dry plaster of the sanctuary's vertical walls. The paintings in the ceilings of the arches were done on canvas in his studio and then mounted in the church. Bartlett's figures have bold outlines and sumptuous robes of muted blue, crimson, and green. He used gold leaf extensively and supplied relief to features like haloes with a plaster technique known as [[pargeting]].<ref name=\"waggoner\">{{cite news| last=Waggoner| first=J.

Above that is a celestial orchestra in medieval robes. Bartlett's care in blending decoration to the sanctuary's architecture is evident; his rainbow echoes the curve of the ceiling. Bartlett's work in the twelve bays of the balcony centers on the themes of praise, abundance, and sacred music. Texts from scripture are painted on the walls below the figures.<ref name=\"robie\"/>\n\n===Windows===\n\nWhen the sanctuary was rededicated in 1901, many of its arched openings contained simple windows with small, stylized floral designs by [[Howard Van Doren Shaw|Shaw]] and executed by the firm of Gianini and Hilgart. Soon the bays began to be filled with specially commissioned memorial windows. Now, only the last bay on the north side of the church displays [[Howard Van Doren Shaw|Shaw's]] work. Members of the congregation gave the other windows in memory of departed loved ones. Nine of the windows are by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]]\u2019s firm and display many of the innovative glass-working techniques that he pioneered. Tiffany looked to get artistic effects from the character of the glass itself rather than by painting on the glass. He used folded glass, confetti glass, striated glass, and multiple layers of glass. The windows portray a variety of Biblical scenes, landscapes, and ornamental designs. In the east end of the church is a boldly colored representation of the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], designed by William Fair Kline. Below it are the five scourges or ''[[Arma Christi]]'' of Jesus.<ref name=\"frueh\">{{cite book| last1=Frueh| first1= Erne R.| first2=Florence| last2=Frueh| date=October 1983| title=Chicago Stained Glass| url=https://archive.org/details/chicagostainedgl0000frue| url-access=registration| publisher=Loyola University Press| pages=[https://archive.org/details/chicagostainedgl0000frue/page/94 94\u2013104]| isbn=978-0829404357}}</ref>  Other sanctuary windows were designed by Louis J.

Burne-Jones was a close associate of [[William Morris]], founder of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] in Britain. [[Morris and Co.]] crafted these two windows from the designs of Burne-Jones. The subjects are [[Margaret the Virgin|St. Margaret of Antioch]], in robes of rich crimson, and [[Saint Cecilia|St. Cecilia]], in blue robes, a portable organ in her arms. These windows were displayed in the William Morris Memorial Room of Chicago's Tobey Furniture Co. before being purchased by the Franklin Darius Gray family and made into memorials. Burne-Jones windows are rare in the United States; these are the only ones known outside of the East Coast.<ref name=\"frueh\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chicago Landmark]]\n*[[List of Registered Historic Places in Chicago]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Second Presbyterian Church (Chicago, Illinois)}}\n*[http://www.2ndpresbyterianfriends.org/ Friends of Historic Second Church]\n*[http://www.2ndpresbyterian.org/ Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060205113849/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/S/SecondPresbyterian.html Chicago Landmarks, Second Presbyterian]\n*[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=205845 Emporis Buildings, Second Presbyterian]\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\t\n{{Chicago Landmark places of worship}}\n\n[[Category:19th-century Presbyterian church buildings in the United States]]\n[[Category:Churches in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Howard Van Doren Shaw church buildings]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Chicago]]\n[[Category:National Historic Landmarks in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Presbyterian churches in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1874]]\n[[Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Presbyterian_Church_(Chicago)"}

According to the professor, the surname Roslin originated from Henry Sinclair of the [[Clan Sinclair]], baron of [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] who accompanied [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] in the 1096 [[First Crusade|Crusade]] to [[Jerusalem]]. Chookaszian\u2019s hypothesis is based on the assumption that like most prominent Crusaders of the time,<ref>Godfrey\u2019s brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] married [[Arda of Armenia]], his successor [[Baldwin of Bourcq]] married [[Morphia of Melitene]], [[Joscelin I, Count of Edessa|Joscelin I]] married Beatrice etc. See: {{cite book\n  | last = Sirarpie\n  | first = Der Nersessian\n  | title =  L'Art Armenien des origines au XVIIe siecle \n  | publisher = Arts et Methiers Graphiques\n  | location=Paris\n  | year = 1977\n  | page = 135|language=fr}}</ref> Sinclair married an Armenian.<ref name=\"Chookbio\"/>\n\nThe approximate dates of Roslin's birth and death can be determined using the dates of his manuscripts. Based on the following it can be assumed that Roslin was at least 30 in 1260.<ref name=\"Azarian2\"/> At the time one could only achieve the level of mastery displayed in the ''Zeytun Gospel of 1256'' no earlier than in their mid twenties. In the colophon of the ''Gospel of 1260'', Roslin mentions that he has a son, indicating that he was likely a priest since a monk would have no children while a member of the laity would likely not have been an illuminated manuscript painter. By the time of the ''Gospel of 1265'', Roslin already had his own apprentices. Roslin painted two portraits of prince Levon, the earliest of which was executed in 1250<ref>The miniature decorates a parchment folio currently within MS No. 8321 in Matenadaran.

The manuscript was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for the young prince and future king [[Hethum II, King of Armenia|Hethum]].<ref>Der Nersessian, 53-54</ref> In the colophons of the manuscript Roslin describes the brutal sack of the [[Principality of Antioch]] by the [[Mamluk]] Sultan [[Baibars]]: \"...at this time great Antioch was captured by the wicked king of Egypt, and many were killed and became his prisoners, and a cause of anguish to the holy and famous temples, houses of God, which are in it; the wonderful elegance of the beauty of those which were destroyed by fire is beyond the power of words.\"<ref>Hazard, 137</ref>\n\n===Canon tables and ornaments===\nThe principal innovation of Roslin in regards to ornaments within [[canon tables]] is the addition of bust portraits.<ref name=\"DN\">Der Nersessian, 75</ref> In the Gospel of 1262 (MS No. 2660), [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] and Carpianus are represented as full figures standing in the outer margins of the Letter of Eusebius. Roslin also represented prophets such as [[David]], [[Moses]] and [[John the Baptist]].<ref>Der Nersessian, 64</ref> This system was highly unusual for canon table decoration, for although portraits of prophets had been represented next to canon tables as early as the 6th-century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Rabbula Gospels]], their relationship to the gospels was not made explicit through the quotation of their messianic prophecies.<ref>Der Nersessian, 65</ref> New [[zoomorphic]] creatures are also added to the usual repertoire of winged sphinxes and sirens such as dog or goat headed men carrying branches of flowers along with various quadrupeds and birds.<ref name=\"DN\"/> On the first page of each gospel and the beginning of [[pericopes]] floral as well as zoomorphic letters are formed utilizing peacocks or other creatures.<ref>Der Nersessian, 76</ref>\n\n===Attributions===\n[[File:Leo III of Armenia.jpeg|thumb|left|The Portrait of Prince Levon, Yerevan, Matenadaran, No. 8321]]\nSeveral contemporary manuscripts from the 13th century, devoid of colophons have sometimes been attributed to Roslin.<ref name=\"Sir1\"/> MS 8321, the mutilated remains of which were formerly at [[Nor Nakhichevan]] and now in Yerevan, was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for his godchild prince Levon. Prince Levon's portrait was bound by mistake in MS 7690 and was returned to its original place. A dedicatory inscription which faced the portrait has been lost. The portrait shows the prince in his teens wearing a blue tunic decorated with lions [[Attitude (heraldry)|passant]] in gold roundels with a jeweled gold band at the hem. Two angels, in light blue and pink draperies, hold their rhipidia (liturgical fans) above the prince's head. Stylistically these pieces are much closer to the ones painted by Roslin than those of other artists at Hromkla who were still active in the 1250s.<ref>Der Nersessian, 54</ref> Another mutilated manuscript, MS 5458 located in Yerevan is often assigned to Roslin. Thirty-eight vellum leaves from the [[Gospel of John]] have been incorporated into the manuscript in the late 14th or early 15th century in [[Vaspurakan]].\n\nThe priest Hovhannes who salvaged the remains of the old manuscript reports in one of the colophons that he had suffered seeing the old manuscript fall into the hands of the \"infidels\" like \"a lamb delivered to wolves\" and that he renovated it so that the \"royal memorial written in it might not be lost\". Part of the original colophons, the \"royal memorial\" reports that the manuscript was written in the see of Hromkla in 1266 for the king Hethum. The uncials are identical to that of MS 539 and similar marginal ornaments adorn both.<ref>Der Nersessian, 55</ref> Yet another manuscript attributed to Roslin and his assistants is MS 32.18 currently located at the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The colophons are lost but the name of the sponsor, Prince Vassak (brother of king Hethum I) is written on the marginal medallion on page 52: \"Lord bless the baron Vassak\" and again on the upper band of the frame around the [[Raising of Lazarus]]: \"Lord have mercy on Vassak, Thy servant, the owner of this, Thy holy Gospel\". The uncials and the ornaments match those of MS 539 and MS 5458.<ref>Der Nersessian, 55-56</ref> Prince Vassak was sent to [[Cairo]] by his brother in 1268 to pay ransom and obtain the release of prince Levon and thousands of other hostages captured after the disastrous [[Battle of Mari]]. They returned home on June 24, 1268. At this time Roslin had already completed the copy and illustrations of MS 10675 and his chief patron, Catholicos Constantine I having died, Roslin would have been free to work for another patron such as prince Vassak who had a reason to celebrate.<ref>Der Nersessian, 56</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\nAmong Roslin's various miniatures on the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|theme of the Nativity]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] scene of the Gospel of 1260 (MS No. 251) stands out the most. Mary and the Child are presented seated on the throne near a grotto combined with in the lower angle with the portrait of [[Matthew the Evangelist]], in reverse proportional correlation. The combination of the two scenes was originally developed in [[Constantinople]] during the [[Komnenos dynasty|Comnenian era]] and reinterpreted by Roslin.<ref name=\"ChookNat\">{{cite web\n |last        = Chookaszian\n |first       = Levon\n |title       = Toros Roslin: Iconography - Nativity\n |publisher   = Armenian Studies Program, California State University\n |url         = http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/ArmeniaDigitalProject/iconography/nativity/Nativity.html#3\n |accessdate  = 2008-09-27\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006142516/http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/ArmeniaDigitalProject/iconography/nativity/Nativity.html#3\n |archivedate = 2008-10-06\n}}</ref> Another unique attribute of this composition is seen in the top right corner where the bodyguards of the [[Magi]], who are mentioned in [[apocryphal]] gospel accounts as soldiers who accompanied the Magi, are represented as [[Mongols]].

According to the professor, the surname Roslin originated from Henry Sinclair of the [[Clan Sinclair]], baron of [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] who accompanied [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] in the 1096 [[First Crusade|Crusade]] to [[Jerusalem]].

In the colophon of the ''Gospel of 1260'', Roslin mentions that he has a son, indicating that he was likely a priest since a monk would have no children while a member of the laity would likely not have been an illuminated manuscript painter. By the time of the ''Gospel of 1265'', Roslin already had his own apprentices. Roslin painted two portraits of prince Levon, the earliest of which was executed in 1250<ref>The miniature decorates a parchment folio currently within MS No. 8321 in Matenadaran.

Roslin also represented prophets such as [[David]], [[Moses]] and [[John the Baptist]].<ref>Der Nersessian, 64</ref> This system was highly unusual for canon table decoration, for although portraits of prophets had been represented next to canon tables as early as the 6th-century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Rabbula Gospels]], their relationship to the gospels was not made explicit through the quotation of their messianic prophecies.<ref>Der Nersessian, 65</ref> New [[zoomorphic]] creatures are also added to the usual repertoire of winged sphinxes and sirens such as dog or goat headed men carrying branches of flowers along with various quadrupeds and birds.<ref name=\"DN\"/> On the first page of each gospel and the beginning of [[pericopes]] floral as well as zoomorphic letters are formed utilizing peacocks or other creatures.<ref>Der Nersessian, 76</ref>\n\n===Attributions===\n[[File:Leo III of Armenia.jpeg|thumb|left|The Portrait of Prince Levon, Yerevan, Matenadaran, No. 8321]]\nSeveral contemporary manuscripts from the 13th century, devoid of colophons have sometimes been attributed to Roslin.<ref name=\"Sir1\"/> MS 8321, the mutilated remains of which were formerly at [[Nor Nakhichevan]] and now in Yerevan, was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for his godchild prince Levon. Prince Levon's portrait was bound by mistake in MS 7690 and was returned to its original place. A dedicatory inscription which faced the portrait has been lost. The portrait shows the prince in his teens wearing a blue tunic decorated with lions [[Attitude (heraldry)|passant]] in gold roundels with a jeweled gold band at the hem. Two angels, in light blue and pink draperies, hold their rhipidia (liturgical fans) above the prince's head. Stylistically these pieces are much closer to the ones painted by Roslin than those of other artists at Hromkla who were still active in the 1250s.<ref>Der Nersessian, 54</ref> Another mutilated manuscript, MS 5458 located in Yerevan is often assigned to Roslin. Thirty-eight vellum leaves from the [[Gospel of John]] have been incorporated into the manuscript in the late 14th or early 15th century in [[Vaspurakan]].\n\nThe priest Hovhannes who salvaged the remains of the old manuscript reports in one of the colophons that he had suffered seeing the old manuscript fall into the hands of the \"infidels\" like \"a lamb delivered to wolves\" and that he renovated it so that the \"royal memorial written in it might not be lost\". Part of the original colophons, the \"royal memorial\" reports that the manuscript was written in the see of Hromkla in 1266 for the king Hethum. The uncials are identical to that of MS 539 and similar marginal ornaments adorn both.<ref>Der Nersessian, 55</ref> Yet another manuscript attributed to Roslin and his assistants is MS 32.18 currently located at the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The colophons are lost but the name of the sponsor, Prince Vassak (brother of king Hethum I) is written on the marginal medallion on page 52: \"Lord bless the baron Vassak\" and again on the upper band of the frame around the [[Raising of Lazarus]]: \"Lord have mercy on Vassak, Thy servant, the owner of this, Thy holy Gospel\". The uncials and the ornaments match those of MS 539 and MS 5458.<ref>Der Nersessian, 55-56</ref> Prince Vassak was sent to [[Cairo]] by his brother in 1268 to pay ransom and obtain the release of prince Levon and thousands of other hostages captured after the disastrous [[Battle of Mari]]. They returned home on June 24, 1268. At this time Roslin had already completed the copy and illustrations of MS 10675 and his chief patron, Catholicos Constantine I having died, Roslin would have been free to work for another patron such as prince Vassak who had a reason to celebrate.<ref>Der Nersessian, 56</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\nAmong Roslin's various miniatures on the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|theme of the Nativity]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] scene of the Gospel of 1260 (MS No. 251) stands out the most. Mary and the Child are presented seated on the throne near a grotto combined with in the lower angle with the portrait of [[Matthew the Evangelist]], in reverse proportional correlation. The combination of the two scenes was originally developed in [[Constantinople]] during the [[Komnenos dynasty|Comnenian era]] and reinterpreted by Roslin.<ref name=\"ChookNat\">{{cite web\n |last        = Chookaszian\n |first       = Levon\n |title       = Toros Roslin: Iconography - Nativity\n |publisher   = Armenian Studies Program, California State University\n |url         = http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/ArmeniaDigitalProject/iconography/nativity/Nativity.html#3\n |accessdate  = 2008-09-27\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006142516/http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/ArmeniaDigitalProject/iconography/nativity/Nativity.html#3\n |archivedate = 2008-10-06\n}}</ref> Another unique attribute of this composition is seen in the top right corner where the bodyguards of the [[Magi]], who are mentioned in [[apocryphal]] gospel accounts as soldiers who accompanied the Magi, are represented as [[Mongols]].

R. Crown Hall''', designed by the German-American [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], is the home of the College of Architecture at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].\n\n==History==\nMies van der Rohe designed several dozen buildings for the southern side Illinois Institute of Technology. Most of these structures employ a brick and glass infill system within an exposed steel frame. When he was given the opportunity to design Crown Hall in 1950, Mies deviated from the norm and built a totally different structure which no one had seen before.\n\nWidely regarded as one of Mies van der Rohe's masterpieces, Crown Hall, completed in 1956, is one of the most architecturally significant buildings of the 20th century Modernist movement. Crown Hall is considered architecturally significant because Mies van der Rohe refined the basic steel and glass construction style, beautifully capturing simplicity and openness for endless new uses. Creating this openness was achieved by the building having a suspended roof, without the need for interior columns. This created a universal space that could be endlessly adapted to new uses. Typically, older buildings up to 1956 had columns to support the roof from caving in, but Crown Hall does not require them. While designing Crown Hall, Mies stayed true to his famous words, \"less is more\" and he considered the building to be the best embodiment of the maxim. At the time of being built, the idea of providing a single large room for the school of architecture and city planning's 300 students was to be particularly workable, and for the student to not be isolated from others who may be further or less advanced in the course then he/she. Although, shortly after being built, Architects began to question the relevancy of Mie\u2019s work. Many architects depicted Crown Hall as, \"slipping beneath the waves of Lake Michigan to a watery grave.\" After a number of years, Crown Hall was seen as such a successful icon of modern architecture that it served as the foil for Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman's 1978 satirical collage titled \u201cThe Titanic\u201d. \n <ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0327.html|title=\nMies van der Rohe Dies at 83; Leader of Modern Architecture|author=ALDEN WHITMAN|date=August 19, 1969|accessdate=July 9, 2014|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}</ref> Mies once described his creation as being \"almost nothing.\" With World War II and the Great Depression leaving a large break in construction, Mies reconstructed curriculum to appreciate minimalism and to focus on using only what was necessary; an approach not yet favorable in most architecture schools of the time.\n\n[[File:Crown Hall 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Entrance]]\nCentrally located on the campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology, two miles south of downtown Chicago, Illinois, the building houses IIT's school of architecture, city planning, and the department of design. The two-level building is configured as a pure rectangular form, 220&nbsp;ft. by 120&nbsp;ft. by 18&nbsp;ft. tall. The substructure is reinforced concrete, and is independent of the superstructure. The enclosed space is column-free with four six ft. steel plate girders welded to eight H-columns. These girders suspend the roof in a single plane to form a primary structure. While the lower level consists of compartmentalized rooms, the upper level occupies almost  50% of the total area of the building, but only includes one large, open classroom.\n\nOn March 27, 2012, Mies van der Rohe's 126th birthday, Google honored the architect and this icon of his achievement with a poetic doodle of Crown Hall.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/mies-van-der-rohe-google-doodle-celebrates-german-architects-crowning-achievement/2012/03/26/gIQAOoiJdS_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Michael | last=Cavna | title=LUDWIG MIES VAN DER ROHE: Google Doodle celebrates German architect's crowning achievement | date=March 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Landmark status and renovation==\nS.R.
