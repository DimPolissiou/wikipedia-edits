Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the highest-ranking official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|vice chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee.

The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people.

the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[President of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the highest-ranking official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|vice chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee.

The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people.

It is loosely based on [[L. Frank Baum]]'s second Oz [[novel]], ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' (1904), although Baum received no screen credit. \n\nThe film was not a hit in theaters, but did well on television, premiering on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on December 5, 1976.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Animated TV Specials: The Complete Directory to the First Twenty-Five Years, 1962-1987 |date=1989 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-2198-2 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool/page/228/mode/2up |pages=228-230}}</ref>\n\nFor television broadcast, Filmation produced live-action segments with a celebrity playing [[Wizard of Oz (character)|the Wizard]], flying in his balloon with a parrot and two [[Munchkins]], Sprig and Twig. The first version featured [[Bill Cosby]]. Filmation only contracted with Cosby for two airings, so when the film aired in syndication later, the company reshot the live segments with [[Milton Berle]].<ref name=Scheimer>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UROrDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA107&dq=Journey+Back+to+Oz&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5yZLZ37rTAhWN14MKHbVrCWoQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&q=Journey%20Back%20to%20Oz&f=false|title=Lou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation|last=Scheimer|first=Lou|last2=Mangels|first2=Andy|date=2012-01-01|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn=9781605490441|language=en|pages=107-108}}</ref>\n\n==Production history==\nThe movie began production in 1962, but ran out of money and was halted for nearly eight years. It was only after the [[Filmation]] studio had made profits on their numerous television series that it was able to finish the project, copyrighted 1971, released in 1972 in the UK and 1974 in the U.S. It features [[Liza Minnelli]] voicing [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] (played in the 1939 film by her mother [[Judy Garland]], and in what would have been her first major role had the film been released as originally intended). Other voices were by [[Ethel Merman]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Paul Lynde]], [[Herschel Bernardi]], [[Paul Ford]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] (also from the 1939 film, but now playing [[Aunt Em]] rather than the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], who died in the earlier film), and opera singer [[Ris\u00eb Stevens]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch]].\n\nFor the film's U.S. release, Filmation partnered with a company called Seymour Borde and distributed it through a process called [[four wall distribution]], whereupon the studio rented venues to show it and kept all of the box-office revenue.<ref name=beck>{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|chapter=Journey Back to Oz|page=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/132 132]|isbn=1-55652-591-5|year=2005|publisher=Chicago Reader Press|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/132}}</ref> Outside the United States and Canada, Warner Bros. distributed the film.<ref name=Scheimer/>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a tornado in [[Kansas]] causes a loose gate to knock [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] unconscious, she re-appears in the Land of Oz with [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]], and encounters a talking Signpost (voiced by [[Jack E. Leonard]]), whose three signs point in different directions, all marked \"[[Emerald City]]\". They later meet [[Jack Pumpkinhead|Pumpkinhead]] (voiced by [[Paul Lynde]]), the unwilling servant of antagonist [[Mombi]] \u2013 cousin of the deceased [[Wicked Witch of the East|Wicked Witches of the East]] and [[Wicked Witch of the West|West]]. Toto chases a cat to a small cottage where Dorothy is captured by Mombi's pet [[crow]] (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]) and Mombi (voiced by [[Ethel Merman]]) herself. Pumpkinhead sneaks into the house in Mombi's absence, and discovers her creation of green [[elephant]]s, to use as her army to conquer the Emerald City. Pumpkinhead frees Dorothy, and they flee. After finding Dorothy gone, Mombi threatens that their warning the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] will not help when her green elephants \"come crashing through the gate\".\n\nDorothy and Pumpkinhead acquire Woodenhead Stallion III (voiced by [[Herschel Bernardi]]), a former merry-go-round horse (a combination of the [[Sawhorse]] from ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' and the title character of the last Oz book of all, ''[[Merry Go Round in Oz]]''), who takes them to the Emerald City, where Dorothy warns the Scarecrow (voiced by [[Mickey Rooney]]) about Mombi's green elephants. Mombi arrives moments later, and Toto and the Scarecrow are captured. Dorothy, Pumpkinhead, and Woodenhead flee to Tinland to convince the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]] (voiced by [[Danny Thomas]], who spoke, and [[Larry Storch]], who sang) to help them. He declines upon being afraid of the green elephants and suggests that they ask the [[Cowardly Lion]] (voiced by [[Milton Berle]]), who promises to slay the elephants, but suggests consulting [[Glinda the Good Witch]] (voiced by [[Rise Stevens]]), who appears to them with a \"Glinda Bird\" that uses its Tattle Tail to show what is occurring at the palace. She then gives Dorothy a little silver box, to open only in the Emerald City, and only in a dire emergency.\n\nMombi, having seen their progress in her [[crystal ball]], brings the nearby trees to life; whereupon Glinda sends a golden [[hatchet]] to Pumpkinhead. One of the trees snatches it from him, but changes its fellows and itself into [[gold]] and turns them from bad to good. Woodenhead carries Dorothy and Pumpkinhead back to the Emerald City, where Mombi's elephants surprise them. When Dorothy opens Glinda's box, [[mouse|mice]] emerge, scaring the elephants. Mombi brews a potion to shrink Toto to mouse-size so she can feed him to her cat; but when startled, miniaturizes her crow and cat instead. Thereafter Mombi disguises herself as a rose with poisonous thorns, which the elephants trample over and themselves disappear, prompting the Scarecrow to explain that Mombi's magic has died with her. Unfortunately, Pumpkinhead, another product of Mombi, also dies; however, he is revived by one of Dorothy's tears.\n\nThe Scarecrow makes Woodenhead the head of the Oz cavalry and knights Pumpkinhead; and Dorothy and Toto leave Oz by another tornado (created by Pumpkinhead and Glinda), promising to return.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Don Messick]] as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]\n* [[Paul Lynde]] as [[Jack Pumpkinhead|Pumpkinhead]]\n* [[Herschel Bernardi]] as Charelsworth Pinto \"Woodenhead\" Stallion III\n* [[Ethel Merman]] as [[Mombi]]\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]]\n* [[Danny Thomas]] as the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]] \n* [[Milton Berle]] as the [[Cowardly Lion]] \n* [[Ris\u00eb Stevens]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]]\n* [[Jack E.

The arrangements and some of the film's [[film music|score]] was by [[Walter Scharf]].  The original songs (which were featured on a soundtrack album released around the time of the film's television release) include the following:\n\n# \"A Faraway Land\" - Dorothy\n# \"Signpost Song\" - The Signpost\n# \"Keep a Happy Thought\" - Dorothy\n# \"The Horse on the Carousel\" - Woodenhead\n# \"B-R-A-N-E\" (sic) - Scarecrow\n# \"An Elephant Never Forgets\" - Mombi\n# \"H-E-A-R-T\" - Tin Man\n# \"N-E-R-V-E\" - Cowardly Lion\n# \"You Have Only You\" - Glinda\n# \"If You're Gonna Be a Witch - Be a Witch\" - Mombi\n# \"Return to the Land of Oz March\" - Dorothy\n# \"That Feeling for Home\" - Dorothy\n\nHowever, a majority of the film contains [[library music]] from other sources. One particular piece of music, heard in the opening titles, is ''The Awakening'', a [[Johnny Pearson]] composition that was recorded in 1967 (three years after production on this film began). While largely familiar to U.S. audiences for its use in this film, it is otherwise known to British viewers as the theme for [[ITN]]'s ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]''. Coincidentally, another well-known Pearson composition, \"[[Heavy Action]]\" (also known as the theme of ''[[Monday Night Football]]''), served as the theme to the [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[SFM Holiday Network]], which ran this film for many years.\n\n==Television version==\n\nWhile the film was a failure in its theatrical release, it would find its audience in its television showings.  Filmation sold the broadcast rights to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1976.  By this time, [[Bill Cosby]] was in the midst of his success with Filmation's TV series ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', as well as starring in a new, but short-lived TV series for ABC.  Filmation decided to expand and reformat the film to a [[Christmas television special]].  The film's theatrical running time was extended to include new live-action connecting segments with Cosby as the Wizard, a character otherwise not seen in the original theatrical release.  The live-action subplot was to get two lost children home to spend Christmas with Dorothy, while helping to move the plot along.  This extended TV version would later air in a successful syndication run via the aforementioned SFM Holiday Network.  The last known airing of this version was in 1984 and it has not been available since then.

It is loosely based on [[L. Frank Baum]]'s second Oz [[novel]], ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' (1904), although Baum received no screen credit. \n\nThe film was not a hit in theaters, but did well on television, premiering on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on December 5, 1976.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Animated TV Specials: The Complete Directory to the First Twenty-Five Years, 1962-1987 |date=1989 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-2198-2 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool/page/228/mode/2up |pages=228-230}}</ref>\n\nFor television broadcast, Filmation produced live-action segments with a celebrity playing [[Wizard of Oz (character)|the Wizard]], flying in his balloon with a parrot and two [[Munchkins]], Sprig and Twig.

It was only after the [[Filmation]] studio had made profits on their numerous television series that it was able to finish the project, copyrighted 1971, released in 1972 in the UK and 1974 in the U.S. It features [[Liza Minnelli]] voicing [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] (played in the 1939 film by her mother [[Judy Garland]], and in what would have been her first major role had the film been released as originally intended). Other voices were by [[Ethel Merman]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Paul Lynde]], [[Herschel Bernardi]], [[Paul Ford]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] (also from the 1939 film, but now playing [[Aunt Em]] rather than the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], who died in the earlier film), and opera singer [[Ris\u00eb Stevens]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch]].\n\nFor the film's U.S. release, Filmation partnered with a company called Seymour Borde and distributed it through a process called [[four wall distribution]], whereupon the studio rented venues to show it and kept all of the box-office revenue.<ref name=beck>{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|chapter=Journey Back to Oz|page=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/132 132]|isbn=1-55652-591-5|year=2005|publisher=Chicago Reader Press|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/132}}</ref> Outside the United States and Canada, Warner Bros. distributed the film.<ref name=Scheimer/>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a tornado in [[Kansas]] causes a loose gate to knock [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] unconscious, she re-appears in the Land of Oz with [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]], and encounters a talking Signpost (voiced by [[Jack E. Leonard]]), whose three signs point in different directions, all marked \"[[Emerald City]]\". They later meet [[Jack Pumpkinhead|Pumpkinhead]] (voiced by [[Paul Lynde]]), the unwilling servant of antagonist [[Mombi]] \u2013 cousin of the deceased [[Wicked Witch of the East|Wicked Witches of the East]] and [[Wicked Witch of the West|West]]. Toto chases a cat to a small cottage where Dorothy is captured by Mombi's pet [[crow]] (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]) and Mombi (voiced by [[Ethel Merman]]) herself. Pumpkinhead sneaks into the house in Mombi's absence, and discovers her creation of green [[elephant]]s, to use as her army to conquer the Emerald City. Pumpkinhead frees Dorothy, and they flee. After finding Dorothy gone, Mombi threatens that their warning the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] will not help when her green elephants \"come crashing through the gate\".\n\nDorothy and Pumpkinhead acquire Woodenhead Stallion III (voiced by [[Herschel Bernardi]]), a former merry-go-round horse (a combination of the [[Sawhorse]] from ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' and the title character of the last Oz book of all, ''[[Merry Go Round in Oz]]''), who takes them to the Emerald City, where Dorothy warns the Scarecrow (voiced by [[Mickey Rooney]]) about Mombi's green elephants. Mombi arrives moments later, and Toto and the Scarecrow are captured. Dorothy, Pumpkinhead, and Woodenhead flee to Tinland to convince the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]] (voiced by [[Danny Thomas]], who spoke, and [[Larry Storch]], who sang) to help them. He declines upon being afraid of the green elephants and suggests that they ask the [[Cowardly Lion]] (voiced by [[Milton Berle]]), who promises to slay the elephants, but suggests consulting [[Glinda the Good Witch]] (voiced by [[Rise Stevens]]), who appears to them with a \"Glinda Bird\" that uses its Tattle Tail to show what is occurring at the palace. She then gives Dorothy a little silver box, to open only in the Emerald City, and only in a dire emergency.\n\nMombi, having seen their progress in her [[crystal ball]], brings the nearby trees to life; whereupon Glinda sends a golden [[hatchet]] to Pumpkinhead. One of the trees snatches it from him, but changes its fellows and itself into [[gold]] and turns them from bad to good. Woodenhead carries Dorothy and Pumpkinhead back to the Emerald City, where Mombi's elephants surprise them. When Dorothy opens Glinda's box, [[mouse|mice]] emerge, scaring the elephants. Mombi brews a potion to shrink Toto to mouse-size so she can feed him to her cat; but when startled, miniaturizes her crow and cat instead.
