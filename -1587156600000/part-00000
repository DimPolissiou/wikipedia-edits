After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], translations of the term in different languages were adopted by [[Communist]]s worldwide. However, due to its common usage in stereotypical portrayals of the Soviet Union in Cold War films and books, the term became most strongly associated in public consciousness with [[Communism]] as known in the Soviet Union, even though many other socialists would continue to use ''Comrade'' among themselves (e.g., German and Austrian social-democrats and, to this day, members of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn the early years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks used {{lang|ru-Latn|Tovarisch}} when addressing or referring to people assumed sympathetic to the revolution and to the Soviet state, such as members of the Communist party (and originally of other pro-revolution leftist formations such as the [[Left SR]]) and people from the \"working masses\". The more neutral republican form of address would translate as ''Citizen''.

It was used both as a noun and as a title for basically anyone in [[mainland China]] after the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded. For example, women were ''n\u00fc tongzhi'' (female comrade), children were ''xiao tongzhi'' (little comrade) and seniors were ''lao tongzhi'' (old comrade). However, after the 1980s and the onset of China's market-oriented reforms, this term has been moving out of such daily usage. It remains in use as a respectful term of public address among middle-aged Chinese and members of the Communist Party of China. Within the Communist Party, failure to address a fellow member as ''t\u00f3ng zh\u00ec'' is seen as a subtle but unmistakable sign of disrespect and enmity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAt party or civil meetings, the usage of the term has been retained. Officials often address each other as ''Tongzhi'', and thus the usage here is not limited to Communist Party members alone.

It translates as friend or colleague. In Communist times, it was the general form of address, also used in reference to schoolteachers etc.\n*In [[Catalan language|Catalan]], the word for comrade is ''company'' for males, ''companya'' for females. It is still in widespread use among communist and anarchist organisations, but it also occurs often in everyday speech to refer to neutral relationships such as classmates or flatmates with no political connotation.\n*In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the word \u540c\u5fd7 (pinyin: T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec) is used. The meaning of the word refers to a like-minded person. It is, through usage, associated with Communism, however, it may be used as a friendly epithet between friends or colleagues, mostly of the older generation. It is still currently used in Chinese state media to address top party and state leaders such as [[Xi Jinping]] as well as within the [[People\u2019s Liberation Army]] to address soldiers and officers.\n*The [[Croatian language|Croatian]] equivalent to comrade is ''drug'' for males and ''drugarica'' for females. In the period between World War II and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s death in socialist [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] it was applied to almost everybody: teachers, officials, etc. Today it is not used commonly. It may be used with the meaning of ''friend'' as in Serbian, but this use is far less frequent in Croatian. It is still used among far left organization members, and calling someone ''drug/drugarica'' may also be used ironically to denote someone's perceived radical leftism.\n*The [[Czech language|Czech]] word for comrade is ''soudruh'' (m.) and ''soudru\u017eka'' (f.). In 19th century Czech, it was a poetic word, meaning \"fellow\". As elsewhere in Europe, the term was originally introduced by the Czech Social Democrats and subsequently carried over to Czech Communists as well when these split off from the Social Democrats. After the Communist Party gained power in 1948, the word displaced all prior titles like ''pan'', ''pan\u00ed'' (\"Mister\", \"Madam\") and became the title used generally for everyone. Nowadays, it is used only in (actual or, more often, ironic) Communist context. After the [[Velvet Revolution]], an attempt was made in the [[Czech Social Democratic Party]] to replace ''soudruh'' with ''p\u0159\u00edtel'' (\"friend\") as a form of an address, but it didn't catch on.<!--see refs in Czech wiki article--> A cognate to English word \"comrade\", ''kamar\u00e1d'', means \"friend\" in Czech.

In the latter case, when used in writing, it is often abbreviated to ''K-do''. It is the preferred form of address among members of [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]].

Communists and socialists, especially party members of the [[Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands|SED]] and [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]] use the word ''Genosse'' (fem. ''Genossin'') (ie. \"partner\", in the sense of a fellow member of a [[co-operative]]) with the socialist association that 'comrade' has in English.\n*The [[Greek language|Greek]] word is ''\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2'' (syntrophos, m.) and ''\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1'' (syntrophissa, f.), used by communists, socialists and other left-wing groups. Other meanings of this word are: mate, pal, friend, companion, even partner or associate etc.\n* The [[Hebrew]] equivalent is ''Chaver'' (\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8), a word which can mean both \"friend\" and \"member\" (of a group or organization). During the time of [[Socialist Zionist]] political and ideological dominance of the 1930s to the 1960s, the word in a sense similar to English \"comrade\" was in widespread use, in the [[Kibbutz]] movement, the [[Histadrut]] trade unions, the driver-owned bus companies etc. At present, its political use is considered old-fashioned, mainly restricted to Israeli Communists; the same word exists also in [[Yiddish]], which is one possible origin of the colloquial [[Australia]]n word \"[[wikt:cobber|cobber]]\".) The Hebrew ''Chaver'' and the female ''Chavera'' are still widely used in a non-political sense, as meaning simply \"friend\" (in certain contexts also meaning \"boyfriend/girlfriend\").\n* The [[Hindi]] equivalent for comrade or \"Saghave\" is ''kaamred'' (\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0930\u0947\u0921) or ''saathi'' (\u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940). It is widely used among all leftist (communist) parties of India, e.g., [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], [[Communist Party of India]], [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)]], [[Forward Bloc]] and others.\n*The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word for comrade is ''elvt\u00e1rs''. ''elv'' means \"[[principle]]\" or \"[[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]\" while ''t\u00e1rs'' means \"fellow\". As the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] gradually gained power after the [[Second World War]], the word displaced all prior titles like ''\u00far'' (\"Mister\") and became the title used generally for everyone except for people who were obviously not \"tenet fellows\" e.g. those who committed [[political crime]] against the socialist state. After the democratic transition the word became obsolete and it is used derogatorily to address politicians on the [[political left]].\n*The [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word for comrade is ''f\u00e9lagi''. It is used as a less intimate alternative to ''vinur'' (friend). It is also the word used for a \"member\" of club or association. When used as a title to precede a name (i.e., ''f\u00e9lagi T\u00edt\u00f3'' or ''f\u00e9lagi Dimitroff'') it has a communist implication.\n*In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the words ''Komrad'', ''Kawan'', or ''Kamerad'' are used by [[Communist Party of Indonesia|communist]], socialist, and nationalist political parties.\n*In [[Irish Language|Irish]] the word for comrade is ''comr\u00e1da\u00ed'', with ''a chara'' (friend) used as a term of address. Both expressions are used largely by [[Irish Republicans]], [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalism]], [[:Category:Communism in Ireland|Communists]], and [[:Category:Socialism in Ireland|Socialists]].\n*The [[Italian language|Italian]] word for comrade is ''compagno'' (male) or ''compagna'' (female), meaning \"companion\". This word is in widespread use among left-wing circles, including not just communists but also many socialists. The literal translation of the word comrade is ''camerata'', with the specific meaning of \"comrade-in-arms\" or \"fellow soldier\": it is used by nationalist and militarist right-wing groups. Using one word or the other is a quick way to announce one's political views.\n*The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for comrade is \"{{lang|ja|\u540c\u5fd7}} (''d\u014dshi'')\", using the same Han characters as in Chinese.  The word is used to refer to like-minded persons and the usage is not necessarily limited to Communists, though the word is to some extent associated with Communism.  The word should not be confused with a homonym \"{{lang|ja|\u540c\u58eb}}\", which is a more commonly used postfix to show people sharing a certain property.\n*In [[Kannada]], the word \u0c97\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0cc6\u0caf\u0cb0\u0cc7, \u0c97\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0cc6\u0caf (Geleya) is used among communist people's while addressing its people.\n*In [[Khmer people|Khmer]], the word \"comrade\" ({{lang-km|\u179f\u1798\u1798\u17b7\u178f\u17d2\u178f}} ''Samakmit'') was used by members of the [[Khmer Rouge]] during the [[Democratic Kampuchea|communist rule]] of [[Pol Pot]] in 1975\u20131979 and by the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] during the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] era. \n*In [[Korean language|Korean]], a good equivalent of the word would be \"\ub3d9\ubb34\" (''tongmu'') or \"\ub3d9\uc9c0\" (''tongji'', senior comrade). Although the word was originally used by Korean people all over the [[Korean Peninsula]], people living south of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]] began avoiding using the word after a [[communist state]] was set up in the north. In [[North Korea]], the word ''tongmu'' replaced all prior social titles and earned a new meaning as \"a fellow man fighting for the revolution\". The word originally meant \u201cfriend\u201d. On the other hand, the word \u201c\ub3d9\uc9c0\u201d (''tongji'') is frequently used in North Korean state media to address senior state and party leaders such as [[Kim Jong-un]]. \n*In [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], the word ''[[Heval]]'' (\"friend\" or \"companion on a long journey\") is widely used among Kurdish political parties and organizations.\n*In [[Latvian language|Latvian]], the word is ''biedrs'' for males and ''biedre'' or ''biedrene'' for females.\n*In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], the word is ''draugas'' for males and ''draug\u0117'' for females; both of which originally meant \"friend\".\n*In [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], the word is \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440 (''drugar'') for males and \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440ka (''drugarka'') for females.\n*In [[Malay language|Malay]], the words ''Komrad'', ''Kawan'' and ''Sahabat'' are used among socialist organizations.\n*In [[Malayalam]],  the word \u0d38\u0d16\u0d3e\u0d35\u0d4d (''sakhavu'') is used among communist organizations while addressing fellow members.\n*In [[Mexico]], the word is ''camarada'' (''camrade'') and ''compa\u00f1ero'' can be (and often is) used with no political connotation.\n*In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the word is ''\u043d\u04e9\u0445\u04e9\u0440'' (n\u00f6kh\u00f6r). It is still in use but less than before.\n*The [[Nepali language|Nepali]] equivalent for comrade is ''kaamred'' (\u0915\u092e\u0930\u0947\u0921) or ''saathi'' (\u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940) as in Hindi. It is used by communists in Nepal such as the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist)]], [[Janamorcha Nepal]] and others.\n*In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the word is ''kamerat''. It can be associated with communist usage, but more commonly refers simply to an associate, a co-worker (''arbeidskamerat''), or a classmate in school (''klassekamerat'' or ''skolekamerat''). In everyday use, the word ''kamerat'' on its own is considered a masculine term, referring to boys/men. For girls/women, the term ''venninne'' (female form of ''venn'' friend) is used instead. When joined with other words, such as ''klassekamerat'', the word is gender neutral. (Although Norwegians would understand what is meant by ''klassevenninne'', it would also sound awkward and somewhat archaic.)\n*In the [[Philippines]], communist and left-leaning activists prefer the term ''kasama'' (roughly, companion), and the short form, ''Ka'' before the name (e.g. [[Crispin Beltran|''Ka'' Bel]]). [[Protestantism in the Philippines|Protestant]] (usually [[Evangelical Protestantism|Evangelical]]) clerics and members of the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] also use ''Ka'' before names or [[nicknames]], but as a contraction of ''kapat\u00edd'' (\"brother\"/\"sister\"), denoting spiritual brotherhood. Practitioners of law informally use the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] term ''compa\u00f1ero''/''compa\u00f1era'' when referring to each other, albeit without any socio-political connotation.\n*In the [[Pashto language]], the word for comrade is ''malgury''. It is used by and refers to communists, socialists, or supporters of the communist system across the [[Durand Line]] (i.e. in Afghanistan and Pakistan) by Pashto speakers. For the last decade or so it has also been used by the nationalists. The word is also used by common people both male and female for a very close friend.\n*In [[Poland]], the word is ''[[towarzysz]]'', which has the same origin as the Russian word. In non-political sense, it means \"companion\".\n*In [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]], the word is ''camarada'', now being commonly employed to refer to communists or supporters of the communist system (result of the overusage of the term in the [[Carnation Revolution|post-revolutionary]] society). It is also prevalent in the army, and has been gaining popularity among nationalist movements. The term used among socialist activists nowadays tends to be ''companheiro'' / ''companheira'' although in Portugal ''camarada'' is still commonly used. Brazilian president Lula is widely known for addressing his political mates and supporters as ''companheiro'', however this decreased during the last years of his presidential term, while it was very popular during the elections, often imitated by comedians who satirized Lula's idiosyncratic manners. The terms ''camarada'' and ''companheiro(s)''/''companheira(s)'' are also used without political connotations, meaning ''mate'', ''partner'', ''fella''.\n*In the [[Punjabi language]] the word for comrade is ''Saathi'' (\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a25\u0a40). However, the word \"Comrade\" itself, or \u0a15\u0a3e\u0a2e\u0a30\u0a47\u0a21, is used to refer to a communist or communist party member, and is often used as a more linguistically acceptable replacement for the word \"communist,\" with the communist party often being called \"The Comrades\" or communist thought being called \"''Comrade Sochni.\"''\n*In the [[Romani language]] the word for comrade is ''Dosti'' as seen in the phrase ''Te vestinel o dosti Tito, te vestinena o jugoslovenske manusha'' or ''Long live comrade Tito and long live the Yugoslav people''.\n*In [[Romanian language|Romanian]] the exact translation is ''camarad'', a [[neologism]] introduced from [[French language|French]] in the 19th century,  which does not bear a political connotation, referring mainly to wartime allies and friends. During the communist era an older term, ''tovar\u0103\u0219'', derived from a Slavic source, was used to convey the political meaning.\n*The [[Serbian language|Serbian]] word for comrade is ''drug'' (\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433) for males and ''drugarica'' (\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430) for females; it's also a regular word for 'friend'. However, during the period of [[Josip Broz Tito]] ruled [[SFR Yugoslavia]], the leading [[Yugoslav Communist League]] promoted the use of the term between the members and generally among the society. It was not unusual to hear political leaders referring to their audience as \"''drugarice i drugovi''\" a tendency kept during the era of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] later during the 1980s and 1990s. Its intention was to emphasize empathy and equalty, and it is still used by the most fervocious adherents of leftist ideologies.\n*The [[Slovak language|Slovak]] word for comrade is ''s\u00fadruh'' (m.) and ''s\u00fadru\u017eka'' (f.). The term ''kamar\u00e1t'' is used too, but it is normally translated as friend.\n*The [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] word for comrade is ''tovari\u0161'' (m.) and ''tovari\u0161ica'' (f.), first attested in the 16th century. After the Second World War it was also colloquially used for 'teacher' (as an elliptical form of the official ''tovari\u0161 u\u010ditelj'' (m.), ''tovari\u0161ica u\u010diteljica'' (f.) 'comrade teacher'). After 1991 it rapidly fell out of use as a general term of address, but is still used when expressing ''comradeship'' among individuals.\n*The [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] word for comrade is ''Sangat'' '''\u0633\u0646\u06af\u062a'''; it is normally translated as friend.\n*The [[Somali language|Somali]] word for comrade is ''jaalle''; it is normally translated as friend. It was widely used by the erstwhile [[Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (1969-1991). The word fell out of use after the fall of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party.\n*In [[Spain]], the word is ''compa\u00f1ero'' / ''compa\u00f1era'' (\"companion\"); the term ''camarada'' (\"comrade\") has also been used, but it is more associated with the communist and [[Falange]] tradition. In [[Spain]] the word ''compa\u00f1ero'' can be (and often is) used with no political connotation.\n**The standard form in [[Cuba]] is ''compa\u00f1ero'' / ''compa\u00f1era'', as it was in socialist [[Nicaragua]] and [[Chile]]. In some parts of Latin America, ''camarada'' is the more frequent word, except in [[Peru]], where the term is commonly associated with the [[nom de guerre]] of members of [[far left]] groups ''[[Shining Path]]'' and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], while members of the social-democrat party [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] as well as other left parties or left-leaning organizations employ ''compa\u00f1ero'' to refer to fellow members. The term ''camarada'' is the more normal among [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Spanish Communists]].\n* In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], the word is \u0dc3\u0dc4\u0ddd\u0daf\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dcf saho\u00f0arayaa, which means brother. It is also a condescending term used by the elite (usually academics) to lure the underprivileged into the cause.\n*In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the equivalent word is ''ndugu'' for brother-in-arms, or ''dada'' for a female comrade. The word ''ndugu'' is still used in formerly socialist Tanzania as a way of showing (political) solidarity.\n*The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word is ''kamrat''. Although it can be associated with communist usage, it can equally well refer simply to a friend, a co-worker (''arbetskamrat''), or a classmate in school (''klasskamrat'' or ''skolkamrat''). Unlike the corresponding [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word, the term is commonly used for both boys and girls in non-communist usage. See also [[Idrottsf\u00f6reningen Kamraterna]]\n*The [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word for comrade is ''Thozhar'' (\u0ba4\u0bcb\u0bb4\u0bb0\u0bcd) and is a regular word for 'friend'.\n*In [[Tetum|Tetun]], the national language of Timor Leste, the word ''camarada'' is used&nbsp;\u2013 a direct loan from the language of the former colonial power, Portugal. During the '70s the word was a common term of address within the left leaning Fretilin party, and after the Indonesian invasion, continued to be used by the Fretilin associated guerillas waging a war of resistance in the jungle. Though largely falling out of use since 1999 Fretilin politicians and veterans of the guerillas struggle continue to use the term to refer to each other.\n*The [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''sahai'' (\u0e2a\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22) was used in the communist movement.\n*The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''Yolda\u015f'' (literally co-traveller) has become used within the communist movement, 'yol' meaning 'way' and 'cause'. [[Janissaries]] used to call each other ''yolda\u015f'' (''comrade'') or ''yolda\u015f\u00e2n'' (''pl. 'comrades' '').<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tarihtarih.com/?Syf=26&Syz=381889 | title=Garp Ocaklar\u0131nda T\u00fcrk Varl\u0131\u011f\u0131 / Prof. Dr. Atilla \u00c7etin}}</ref> Turkish communists, being morally affected by [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] values of the older era, adopted this term. In the climate of harsh anticommunist repression the word largely disappeared from common usage. \"Yolda\u015f\" is also a male name in Turkish.\n*In [[Ukraine]] ''comrade'' was still the standard form of address in the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine|armed forces]] and [[National Police of Ukraine|police]] until in October 2018 it was changed by law into (the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] word) ''\u043f\u0430\u043d'' (pan; translated: \"sir\").<ref>[https://www.unian.info/politics/10285848-ukraine-s-parliament-approves-new-army-police-greeting.html Ukraine's parliament approves new army, police greeting], [[UNIAN]] (4 October 2018)</ref><ref>[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/535728.html Rada approves salute 'Glory to Ukraine' in Ukrainian army], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (4 October 2018)</ref>\n*In the [[United Kingdom]], political use of the term ''comrade'' is strongly associated with both Communism and, historically, Fascism. However it is still used as an informal form of address among some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members, and in a more serious manner by many smaller parties of the left. Use of the term is generally restricted to people with whom the speaker agrees politically. It is usually written in full, the abbreviation \"Cde\" being associated with southern African usage. The honorific terms \"sister\" and \"brother\", also declining in usage, are more politically inclusive, encompassing everyone from the centre-left to the far-left, without necessarily indicating complete political agreement. All three terms are occasionally used in a mocking or patronising manner by political opponents. On the far right, \"comrade\" was the standard form of address between members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] and featured widely in their publications and marching songs.\n*In the [[United States]], the word \"comrade\" carries a strong connotation with Communism, [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], and the former Soviet Union. Especially during the [[Cold War]], to address someone as \"comrade\" marked either the speaker, person addressed, or both as suspected communist sympathizers. It is frequently used ironically in that way. In addition, it is still used in its generic context{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} by some American socialists.  Despite this, it has been adopted into the U.S. Army Soldier's Creed in the statement \"I will never leave a fallen comrade\".  It is also used at meetings of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to address a fellow member.\n*The [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] word is ''\u0111\u1ed3ng ch\u00ed'', which is derived from Chinese \u540c\u5fd7. Due to the influence of Chinese revolutionary groups during the early 20th century on the Vietnamese independence movement, its usage was first seen among members of the KMT-backed [[VNQD\u0110|Vietnamese Nationalist Party]] and then later spread to members of the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]]. It is still being used openly in public to address state and Communist Party leaders as well as among soldiers and military officers in the [[Vietnam People\u2019s Army]].\n\n== In literature ==\n\nIn [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'', the animals all refer to each other as comrade, as the story is a satirical look at the Russian Revolution. Also in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', party members in [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] refer to each other as comrade.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |title = The Soldiers Creed and Army Values |url = http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/recruiting/rr_army/values/default.aspx |work=Rhode Island National Guard |publisher=Rhode Island National Guard |accessdate = 2011-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100404045913/http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/recruiting/rr_army/values/default.aspx |archivedate = 2010-04-04 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n[[Category:Political terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Term meaning friend, colleague or ally, with political connotations}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2015}}\n[[File:\"I summon you to comradeship in the Red Cross\" - Woodrow Wilson LCCN2002712070.tif|thumb|[[World War I]] poster in the [[Library of Congress]]]]\nThe term '''''comrade''''' is used to mean 'mate', 'colleague', or 'ally', and derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term {{lang|es|camarada}},<ref>[http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/generic/cherche.exe?15;s=785465025;; Camarade - Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> literally meaning 'chamber mate', from Latin {{lang|la|camera}}, meaning 'chamber' or 'room'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=comrade|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}</ref> Political use of the term was inspired by the [[French Revolution]], after which it grew into a [[form of address]] between socialists and workers.

For instance, one might be referred to as ''Tovarisch Plekhanov'' or ''Tovarisch Chairman'', or simply as ''Tovarisch''. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], translations of the term in different languages were adopted by [[Communist]]s worldwide. However, due to its common usage in stereotypical portrayals of the Soviet Union in Cold War films and books, the term became most strongly associated in public consciousness with [[Communism]] as known in the Soviet Union, even though many other socialists would continue to use \"Comrade\" among themselves (e.g., German and Austrian social-democrats and, to this day, members of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn the early years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks used \"Tovarisch\" when addressing or referring to people assumed sympathetic to the revolution and to the Soviet state, such as members of the Communist party (and originally of other pro-revolution leftist formations such as the [[Left SR]]) and people from the \"working masses\". The more neutral republican form of address would translate as \"Citizen\".

Still, the original meaning partly re-surfaced in some contexts: criminals and suspects were only addressed as \"Citizens\" and not as \"Tovarischi\", and expressly refusing to address someone as \"Tovarisch\" would generally be perceived as a hostile act or, in [[Stalinist]] times, even as an accusation of being \"[[Anti-Soviet]]\".<ref>\u0412\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0418.\u0421. \u041e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0435 / \u0418.\u0421.\u0412\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 // \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f: \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b: \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f 200-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044e \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 (\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c, 4-6 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2004 \u0433.): \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434\u044b \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b: / \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u0449. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u041a.\u0420.\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430.\u2013 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2004.\u2013 C.211-212.[http://www.ksu.ru/f10/publications/2004/articles_1_1.php?id=8&num=9000000]</ref>\n\nThe term \"Comrade\" is not used in Russian society, and the term \"Tovarisch\" is not often used in contemporary society, but it is still the standard form of address in the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|armed forces]] and [[Russian Police|police]], where officers and soldiers are normally addressed as \"Tovarisch Colonel\", \"Tovarisch General\", \"Tovarisch Sergeant\", or the like.

It was used both as a noun and as a title for basically anyone in [[mainland China]] after the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded. For example, women were ''n\u00fc tongzhi'' (female comrade), children were ''xiao tongzhi'' (little comrade) and seniors were ''lao tongzhi'' (old comrade). However, after the 1980s and the onset of China's market-oriented reforms, this term has been moving out of such daily usage. It remains in use as a respectful term of public address among middle-aged Chinese and members of the Communist Party of China. Within the Communist Party, failure to address a fellow member as ''t\u00f3ng zh\u00ec'' is seen as a subtle but unmistakable sign of disrespect and enmity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAt party or civil meetings, the usage of the term has been retained.

The meaning of the word refers to a like-minded person. It is, through usage, associated with Communism, however, it may be used as a friendly epithet between friends or colleagues, mostly of the older generation. It is still currently used in Chinese state media to address top party and state leaders such as [[Xi Jinping]] as well as within the [[People\u2019s Liberation Army]] to address soldiers and officers.\n*The [[Croatian language|Croatian]] equivalent to comrade is ''drug'' for males and ''drugarica'' for females. In the period between World War II and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s death in socialist [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] it was applied to almost everybody: teachers, officials, etc. Today it is not used commonly. It may be used with the meaning of ''friend'' as in Serbian, but this use is far less frequent in Croatian. It is still used among far left organization members, and calling someone ''drug/drugarica'' may also be used ironically to denote someone's perceived radical leftism.\n*The [[Czech language|Czech]] word for comrade is ''soudruh'' (m.) and ''soudru\u017eka'' (f.). In 19th century Czech, it was a poetic word, meaning \"fellow\". As elsewhere in Europe, the term was originally introduced by the Czech Social Democrats and subsequently carried over to Czech Communists as well when these split off from the Social Democrats. After the Communist Party gained power in 1948, the word displaced all prior titles like ''pan'', ''pan\u00ed'' (\"Mister\", \"Madam\") and became the title used generally for everyone. Nowadays, it is used only in (actual or, more often, ironic) Communist context. After the [[Velvet Revolution]], an attempt was made in the [[Czech Social Democratic Party]] to replace ''soudruh'' with ''p\u0159\u00edtel'' (\"friend\") as a form of an address, but it didn't catch on.<!--see refs in Czech wiki article--> A cognate to English word \"comrade\", ''kamar\u00e1d'', means \"friend\" in Czech.

Since 'Kamerad' is the usual term for a fellow soldier in German military language, the word is associated with right-wing rather than left-wing groups. Communists and socialists, especially party members of the [[Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands|SED]] and [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]] use the word ''Genosse'' (fem. ''Genossin'') (ie. \"partner\", in the sense of a fellow member of a [[co-operative]]) with the socialist association that 'comrade' has in English.\n*The [[Greek language|Greek]] word is ''\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2'' (syntrophos, m.) and ''\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1'' (syntrophissa, f.), used by communists, socialists and other left-wing groups. Other meanings of this word are: mate, pal, friend, companion, even partner or associate etc.\n* The [[Hebrew]] equivalent is ''Chaver'' (\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8), a word which can mean both \"friend\" and \"member\" (of a group or organization). During the time of [[Socialist Zionist]] political and ideological dominance of the 1930s to the 1960s, the word in a sense similar to English \"comrade\" was in widespread use, in the [[Kibbutz]] movement, the [[Histadrut]] trade unions, the driver-owned bus companies etc. At present, its political use is considered old-fashioned, mainly restricted to Israeli Communists; the same word exists also in [[Yiddish]], which is one possible origin of the colloquial [[Australia]]n word \"[[wikt:cobber|cobber]]\".) The Hebrew ''Chaver'' and the female ''Chavera'' are still widely used in a non-political sense, as meaning simply \"friend\" (in certain contexts also meaning \"boyfriend/girlfriend\").\n* The [[Hindi]] equivalent for comrade or \"Saghave\" is ''kaamred'' (\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0930\u0947\u0921) or ''saathi'' (\u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940). It is widely used among all leftist (communist) parties of India, e.g., [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], [[Communist Party of India]], [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)]], [[Forward Bloc]] and others.\n*The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word for comrade is ''elvt\u00e1rs''. ''elv'' means \"[[principle]]\" or \"[[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]\" while ''t\u00e1rs'' means \"fellow\". As the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] gradually gained power after the [[Second World War]], the word displaced all prior titles like ''\u00far'' (\"Mister\") and became the title used generally for everyone except for people who were obviously not \"tenet fellows\" e.g. those who committed [[political crime]] against the socialist state. After the democratic transition the word became obsolete and it is used derogatorily to address politicians on the [[political left]].\n*The [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word for comrade is ''f\u00e9lagi''. It is used as a less intimate alternative to ''vinur'' (friend). It is also the word used for a \"member\" of club or association. When used as a title to precede a name (i.e., ''f\u00e9lagi T\u00edt\u00f3'' or ''f\u00e9lagi Dimitroff'') it has a communist implication.\n*In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the words ''Komrad'', ''Kawan'', or ''Kamerad'' are used by [[Communist Party of Indonesia|communist]], socialist, and nationalist political parties.\n*In [[Irish Language|Irish]] the word for comrade is ''comr\u00e1da\u00ed'', with ''a chara'' (friend) used as a term of address. Both expressions are used largely by [[Irish Republicans]], [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalism]], [[:Category:Communism in Ireland|Communists]], and [[:Category:Socialism in Ireland|Socialists]].\n*The [[Italian language|Italian]] word for comrade is ''compagno'' (male) or ''compagna'' (female), meaning \"companion\". This word is in widespread use among left-wing circles, including not just communists but also many socialists. The literal translation of the word comrade is ''camerata'', with the specific meaning of \"comrade-in-arms\" or \"fellow soldier\": it is used by nationalist and militarist right-wing groups. Using one word or the other is a quick way to announce one's political views.\n*The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for comrade is \"{{lang|ja|\u540c\u5fd7}} (''d\u014dshi'')\", using the same Han characters as in Chinese.  The word is used to refer to like-minded persons and the usage is not necessarily limited to Communists, though the word is to some extent associated with Communism.  The word should not be confused with a homonym \"{{lang|ja|\u540c\u58eb}}\", which is a more commonly used postfix to show people sharing a certain property.\n*In [[Kannada]], the word \u0c97\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0cc6\u0caf\u0cb0\u0cc7, \u0c97\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0cc6\u0caf (Geleya) is used among communist people's while addressing its people.\n*In [[Khmer people|Khmer]], the word \"comrade\" ({{lang-km|\u179f\u1798\u1798\u17b7\u178f\u17d2\u178f}} ''Samakmit'') was used by members of the [[Khmer Rouge]] during the [[Democratic Kampuchea|communist rule]] of [[Pol Pot]] in 1975\u20131979 and by the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] during the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] era. \n*In [[Korean language|Korean]], a good equivalent of the word would be \"\ub3d9\ubb34\" (''tongmu'') or \"\ub3d9\uc9c0\" (''tongji'', senior comrade). Although the word was originally used by Korean people all over the [[Korean Peninsula]], people living south of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]] began avoiding using the word after a [[communist state]] was set up in the north. In [[North Korea]], the word ''tongmu'' replaced all prior social titles and earned a new meaning as \"a fellow man fighting for the revolution\". The word originally meant \u201cfriend\u201d. On the other hand, the word \u201c\ub3d9\uc9c0\u201d (''tongji'') is frequently used in North Korean state media to address senior state and party leaders such as [[Kim Jong-un]]. \n*In [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], the word ''[[Heval]]'' (\"friend\" or \"companion on a long journey\") is widely used among Kurdish political parties and organizations.\n*In [[Latvian language|Latvian]], the word is ''biedrs'' for males and ''biedre'' or ''biedrene'' for females.\n*In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], the word is ''draugas'' for males and ''draug\u0117'' for females; both of which originally meant \"friend\".\n*In [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], the word is \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440 (''drugar'') for males and \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440ka (''drugarka'') for females.\n*In [[Malay language|Malay]], the words ''Komrad'', ''Kawan'' and ''Sahabat'' are used among socialist organizations.\n*In [[Malayalam]],  the word \u0d38\u0d16\u0d3e\u0d35\u0d4d (''sakhavu'') is used among communist organizations while addressing fellow members.\n*In [[Mexico]], the word is ''camarada'' (''camrade'') and ''compa\u00f1ero'' can be (and often is) used with no political connotation.\n*In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the word is ''\u043d\u04e9\u0445\u04e9\u0440'' (n\u00f6kh\u00f6r). It is still in use but less than before.\n*The [[Nepali language|Nepali]] equivalent for comrade is ''kaamred'' (\u0915\u092e\u0930\u0947\u0921) or ''saathi'' (\u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940) as in Hindi. It is used by communists in Nepal such as the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist)]], [[Janamorcha Nepal]] and others.\n*In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the word is ''kamerat''. It can be associated with communist usage, but more commonly refers simply to an associate, a co-worker (''arbeidskamerat''), or a classmate in school (''klassekamerat'' or ''skolekamerat''). In everyday use, the word ''kamerat'' on its own is considered a masculine term, referring to boys/men. For girls/women, the term ''venninne'' (female form of ''venn'' friend) is used instead. When joined with other words, such as ''klassekamerat'', the word is gender neutral. (Although Norwegians would understand what is meant by ''klassevenninne'', it would also sound awkward and somewhat archaic.)\n*In the [[Philippines]], communist and left-leaning activists prefer the term ''kasama'' (roughly, companion), and the short form, ''Ka'' before the name (e.g. [[Crispin Beltran|''Ka'' Bel]]). [[Protestantism in the Philippines|Protestant]] (usually [[Evangelical Protestantism|Evangelical]]) clerics and members of the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] also use ''Ka'' before names or [[nicknames]], but as a contraction of ''kapat\u00edd'' (\"brother\"/\"sister\"), denoting spiritual brotherhood. Practitioners of law informally use the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] term ''compa\u00f1ero''/''compa\u00f1era'' when referring to each other, albeit without any socio-political connotation.\n*In the [[Pashto language]], the word for comrade is ''malgury''. It is used by and refers to communists, socialists, or supporters of the communist system across the [[Durand Line]] (i.e. in Afghanistan and Pakistan) by Pashto speakers. For the last decade or so it has also been used by the nationalists. The word is also used by common people both male and female for a very close friend.\n*In [[Poland]], the word is ''[[towarzysz]]'', which has the same origin as the Russian word. In non-political sense, it means \"companion\".\n*In [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]], the word is ''camarada'', now being commonly employed to refer to communists or supporters of the communist system (result of the overusage of the term in the [[Carnation Revolution|post-revolutionary]] society). It is also prevalent in the army, and has been gaining popularity among nationalist movements. The term used among socialist activists nowadays tends to be ''companheiro'' / ''companheira'' although in Portugal ''camarada'' is still commonly used. Brazilian president Lula is widely known for addressing his political mates and supporters as ''companheiro'', however this decreased during the last years of his presidential term, while it was very popular during the elections, often imitated by comedians who satirized Lula's idiosyncratic manners. The terms ''camarada'' and ''companheiro(s)''/''companheira(s)'' are also used without political connotations, meaning ''mate'', ''partner'', ''fella''.\n*In the [[Punjabi language]] the word for comrade is ''Saathi'' (\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a25\u0a40). However, the word \"Comrade\" itself, or \u0a15\u0a3e\u0a2e\u0a30\u0a47\u0a21, is used to refer to a communist or communist party member, and is often used as a more linguistically acceptable replacement for the word \"communist,\" with the communist party often being called \"The Comrades\" or communist thought being called \"''Comrade Sochni.\"''\n*In the [[Romani language]] the word for comrade is ''Dosti'' as seen in the phrase ''Te vestinel o dosti Tito, te vestinena o jugoslovenske manusha'' or ''Long live comrade Tito and long live the Yugoslav people''.\n*In [[Romanian language|Romanian]] the exact translation is ''camarad'', a [[neologism]] introduced from [[French language|French]] in the 19th century,  which does not bear a political connotation, referring mainly to wartime allies and friends. During the communist era an older term, ''tovar\u0103\u0219'', derived from a Slavic source, was used to convey the political meaning.\n*The [[Serbian language|Serbian]] word for comrade is ''drug'' (\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433) for males and ''drugarica'' (\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430) for females; it's also a regular word for 'friend'. However, during the period of [[Josip Broz Tito]] ruled [[SFR Yugoslavia]], the leading [[Yugoslav Communist League]] promoted the use of the term between the members and generally among the society. It was not unusual to hear political leaders referring to their audience as \"''drugarice i drugovi''\" a tendency kept during the era of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] later during the 1980s and 1990s. Its intention was to emphasize empathy and equalty, and it is still used by the most fervocious adherents of leftist ideologies.\n*The [[Slovak language|Slovak]] word for comrade is ''s\u00fadruh'' (m.) and ''s\u00fadru\u017eka'' (f.). The term ''kamar\u00e1t'' is used too, but it is normally translated as friend.\n*The [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] word for comrade is ''tovari\u0161'' (m.) and ''tovari\u0161ica'' (f.), first attested in the 16th century. After the Second World War it was also colloquially used for 'teacher' (as an elliptical form of the official ''tovari\u0161 u\u010ditelj'' (m.), ''tovari\u0161ica u\u010diteljica'' (f.) 'comrade teacher'). After 1991 it rapidly fell out of use as a general term of address, but is still used when expressing ''comradeship'' among individuals.\n*The [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] word for comrade is ''Sangat'' '''\u0633\u0646\u06af\u062a'''; it is normally translated as friend.\n*The [[Somali language|Somali]] word for comrade is ''jaalle''; it is normally translated as friend. It was widely used by the erstwhile [[Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (1969-1991). The word fell out of use after the fall of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party.\n*In [[Spain]], the word is ''compa\u00f1ero'' / ''compa\u00f1era'' (\"companion\"); the term ''camarada'' (\"comrade\") has also been used, but it is more associated with the communist and [[Falange]] tradition. In [[Spain]] the word ''compa\u00f1ero'' can be (and often is) used with no political connotation.\n**The standard form in [[Cuba]] is ''compa\u00f1ero'' / ''compa\u00f1era'', as it was in socialist [[Nicaragua]] and [[Chile]]. In some parts of Latin America, ''camarada'' is the more frequent word, except in [[Peru]], where the term is commonly associated with the [[nom de guerre]] of members of [[far left]] groups ''[[Shining Path]]'' and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], while members of the social-democrat party [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] as well as other left parties or left-leaning organizations employ ''compa\u00f1ero'' to refer to fellow members. The term ''camarada'' is the more normal among [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Spanish Communists]].\n* In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], the word is \u0dc3\u0dc4\u0ddd\u0daf\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dcf saho\u00f0arayaa, which means brother. It is also a condescending term used by the elite (usually academics) to lure the underprivileged into the cause.\n*In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the equivalent word is ''ndugu'' for brother-in-arms, or ''dada'' for a female comrade. The word ''ndugu'' is still used in formerly socialist Tanzania as a way of showing (political) solidarity.\n*The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word is ''kamrat''. Although it can be associated with communist usage, it can equally well refer simply to a friend, a co-worker (''arbetskamrat''), or a classmate in school (''klasskamrat'' or ''skolkamrat''). Unlike the corresponding [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word, the term is commonly used for both boys and girls in non-communist usage. See also [[Idrottsf\u00f6reningen Kamraterna]]\n*The [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word for comrade is ''Thozhar'' (\u0ba4\u0bcb\u0bb4\u0bb0\u0bcd) and is a regular word for 'friend'.\n*In [[Tetum|Tetun]], the national language of Timor Leste, the word ''camarada'' is used&nbsp;\u2013 a direct loan from the language of the former colonial power, Portugal. During the '70s the word was a common term of address within the left leaning Fretilin party, and after the Indonesian invasion, continued to be used by the Fretilin associated guerillas waging a war of resistance in the jungle. Though largely falling out of use since 1999 Fretilin politicians and veterans of the guerillas struggle continue to use the term to refer to each other.\n*The [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''sahai'' (\u0e2a\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22) was used in the communist movement.\n*The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''Yolda\u015f'' (literally co-traveller) has become used within the communist movement, 'yol' meaning 'way' and 'cause'. [[Janissaries]] used to call each other ''yolda\u015f'' (''comrade'') or ''yolda\u015f\u00e2n'' (''pl. 'comrades' '').<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tarihtarih.com/?Syf=26&Syz=381889 | title=Garp Ocaklar\u0131nda T\u00fcrk Varl\u0131\u011f\u0131 / Prof. Dr. Atilla \u00c7etin}}</ref> Turkish communists, being morally affected by [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] values of the older era, adopted this term. In the climate of harsh anticommunist repression the word largely disappeared from common usage. \"Yolda\u015f\" is also a male name in Turkish.\n*In [[Ukraine]] ''comrade'' was still the standard form of address in the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine|armed forces]] and [[National Police of Ukraine|police]] until in October 2018 it was changed by law into (the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] word) ''\u043f\u0430\u043d'' (pan; translated: \"sir\").<ref>[https://www.unian.info/politics/10285848-ukraine-s-parliament-approves-new-army-police-greeting.html Ukraine's parliament approves new army, police greeting], [[UNIAN]] (4 October 2018)</ref><ref>[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/535728.html Rada approves salute 'Glory to Ukraine' in Ukrainian army], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (4 October 2018)</ref>\n*In the [[United Kingdom]], political use of the term ''comrade'' is strongly associated with both Communism and, historically, Fascism. However it is still used as an informal form of address among some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members, and in a more serious manner by many smaller parties of the left. Use of the term is generally restricted to people with whom the speaker agrees politically. It is usually written in full, the abbreviation \"Cde\" being associated with southern African usage. The honorific terms \"sister\" and \"brother\", also declining in usage, are more politically inclusive, encompassing everyone from the centre-left to the far-left, without necessarily indicating complete political agreement. All three terms are occasionally used in a mocking or patronising manner by political opponents. On the far right, \"comrade\" was the standard form of address between members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] and featured widely in their publications and marching songs.\n*In the [[United States]], the word \"comrade\" carries a strong connotation with Communism, [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], and the former Soviet Union. Especially during the [[Cold War]], to address someone as \"comrade\" marked either the speaker, person addressed, or both as suspected communist sympathizers. It is frequently used ironically in that way. In addition, it is still used in its generic context{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} by some American socialists.  Despite this, it has been adopted into the U.S. Army Soldier's Creed in the statement \"I will never leave a fallen comrade\".  It is also used at meetings of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to address a fellow member.\n*The [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] word is ''\u0111\u1ed3ng ch\u00ed'', which is derived from Chinese \u540c\u5fd7. Due to the influence of Chinese revolutionary groups during the early 20th century on the Vietnamese independence movement, its usage was first seen among members of the KMT-backed [[VNQD\u0110|Vietnamese Nationalist Party]] and then later spread to members of the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]]. It is still being used openly in public to address state and Communist Party leaders as well as among soldiers and military officers in the [[Vietnam People\u2019s Army]].\n\n== In literature ==\n\nIn [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'', the animals all refer to each other as comrade, as the story is a satirical look at the Russian Revolution. Also in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', party members in [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] refer to each other as comrade.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |title = The Soldiers Creed and Army Values |url = http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/recruiting/rr_army/values/default.aspx |work=Rhode Island National Guard |publisher=Rhode Island National Guard |accessdate = 2011-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100404045913/http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/recruiting/rr_army/values/default.aspx |archivedate = 2010-04-04 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n[[Category:Political terminology]]\n", "name_user": "OwenBlacker", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRussian and Soviet usage:Language tagging; transliterated and translated Russian ref; linked \"Soviet Union\" toSoviet Union, rather thanRSFSR", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comrade"}
