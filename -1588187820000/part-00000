Watson]]. As founding chairman of the LEED Steering Committee,  Watson led a broad-based consensus process until 2007, bringing together non-profit organizations, government agencies, architects, engineers, developers, builders, product manufacturers and other industry leaders. The LEED initiative was supported by a strong USGBC Board of Directors, chaired by Steven Winter from 1999 to 2003, and very active staff, including Nigel Howard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dev1.usgbc.org/organizations/steven-winter-associates-inc?view=overview |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724215822/http://dev1.usgbc.org/organizations/steven-winter-associates-inc?view=overview |archivedate=2015-07-24 |df= }}</ref> At that time, USGBC\u2019s Senior Vice President of LEED, Scot Horst, became chair of the LEED Steering Committee before joining USGBC staff. Early LEED committee members also included USGBC co-founder Mike Italiano, architects Bill Reed and Sandy Mendler, builders Gerard Heiber and Myron Kibbe, and engineer Richard Bourne. As interest in LEED grew, in 1996, engineers Tom Paladino and Lynn Barker co-chaired the newly formed LEED technical committee.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2015, LEED grew from one standard for new construction to a comprehensive system of interrelated standards covering aspects from the design and construction to the maintenance and operation of buildings. LEED also has grown from six volunteers on one committee to 119,924 staff, volunteers and professionals.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbc.org/profile |title=LEED Projects Directory |accessdate=27 February 2014 |publisher=US Green Building Council |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301131026/http://www.usgbc.org/profile |archivedate=1 March 2014 |df= }}</ref> LEED standards have been applied to approximately 83,452 registered and certified LEED projects worldwide, covering around 13.8 billion square feet (1.28 billion square meters).<ref>{{Cite web|title = About LEED {{!}} U.S. Green Building Council|url = http://www.usgbc.org/articles/about-leed|website = www.usgbc.org|accessdate = 2015-11-21|url-status=live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160114171952/http://www.usgbc.org/articles/about-leed|archivedate = 2016-01-14|df = }}</ref>\n\nMany U.S. federal agencies, states, and local governments require or reward LEED certification.

This energy model must follow the modeling methodologies outlined in Appendix G of the [[ASHRAE 90.1]] building energy standard.  The guidelines in Appendix G require that the team make two energy models: one representing the building as designed, and a second \u201cbaseline\u201d building.  The baseline building must be modeled in the same location, and have the same geometry and occupancy as the design building.  Depending on location (climate) and building size, the standard provides requirements for HVAC system type, and wall and window definitions.  The goal of this methodology is to provide a baseline building to use as a reference point to compare the design building against. It is a way to standardize the baseline, while putting weight on important factors that heavily influence building energy consumption (e.g., location, geometry, and occupancy patterns).  The number of points achieved in this credit is correlated with the percent predicted energy cost savings demonstrated by the difference between the design and baseline energy models.\n\nThis method of energy modeling has been criticized for inaccurately predicting actual energy usage of LEED-certified buildings. The USGBC admits that \"current information indicates that most buildings do not perform as well as design metrics indicate. As a result, building owners might not obtain the benefits promised.\"<ref name=\"http\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs3402.pdf|title=A National Green Building Research Agenda|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220808/http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs3402.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-12|df=}}</ref>\n\n===LEED for Homes Rating System===\nToday, increasing demand towards environmental safety forces LEED certification to play major role.

The Provider and the Green Rater do not certify the project, but rather assist in the certification process.\n\n==LEED Performance==\nResearch papers provide most of what is known about the performance and effectiveness of LEED in two credit category areas \u2013 energy and indoor environment quality.  In one study of 953 NYC office buildings, 21 LEED certified buildings collectively showed no energy savings compared with non-LEED buildings, although LEED Gold buildings \"outperformed other NYC office buildings by 20%\".<ref name=2013scofield />  IEQ-related studies provide two contrasting results - the first used occupant survey results in 65 LEED buildings and 79 non-LEED buildings and it concluded that occupants of LEED certified buildings have equal satisfaction with the building overall and with the workspace than occupants of non-LEED rated buildings<ref name=Schiavon /> and the second used occupant interviews and physical site measurements at 12 LEED buildings to report superior indoor environment performance compared with similar 12 conventional buildings (non-LEED).<ref name=Newsham /> Buildings certified under LEED do not have to prove energy or water efficiency in practice to receive LEED certification points, but instead LEED uses modeling software to predict future energy use based on intended use.

There may be a lack of abundant availability of manufactured building components that meet LEED specifications. Pursuing LEED certification for a project is an added cost in itself as well. This added cost comes in the form of USGBC correspondence, LEED design-aide consultants, and the hiring of the required [[Building commissioning|Commissioning Authority]] (CxA)\u2014all of which would not necessarily be included in an environmentally responsible project, unless it also sought a LEED rating.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nHowever, these higher initial costs can be effectively mitigated by the savings incurred over time due to the lower-than-industry-standard operational costs typical of a LEED certified building. This [[Whole-life cost|Life cycle costing]] is a method for assessing the total cost of ownership, taking into account all costs of acquiring, owning and operating, and the eventual disposal of a building.

It is also not yet climate-specific, although the newest version hopes to address this weakness partially. Because of this, designers may make materials or design choices that garner a LEED point, even though they may not be the most site- or climate-appropriate choice available. On top of this, LEED is also not energy-specific. Since it only measures the overall performances, builders are free to choose how to achieve points under various categories. A ''USA Today'' review showed that 7,100 certified commercial building projects targeted easy and cheap green points, such as creating healthy spaces and providing educational displays in the building.<ref>{{cite news | title=In U.S. building industry, is it too easy to be green? | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/24/green-building-leed-certification/1650517/ | work=USA Today | date=2012-10-24 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128203601/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/24/green-building-leed-certification/1650517/ | archivedate=2013-11-28 | df= }}</ref> Few builders would really adopt renewable energy because the generators for those energy resources, such as solar [[photovoltaic]], are costly. Builders game the rating system and use certain performances to compensate for the others, making energy conservation the weakest part in the overall evaluation.\n\nLEED is a measurement tool for [[green building]] in the [[United States]] and it is developed and continuously modified by workers in the green building industry, especially in the ten largest metro areas in the U.S.; however, LEED certified buildings have been slower to penetrate small and mid-major markets.<ref>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.wheatland.com/wheatland-standard/is-leed-certification-worth-it/ | title=Is LEED Certification Worth It? | first=Marvin | last=Phillips | work=wheatland.com | date=October 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.zekelman.com/zekelman-perspective/4-advantages-of-specifying-steel-construction-for-a-leed-project/ | title=4 Advantages of Specifying Steel Construction for A LEED Project | first=Jelani | last=Rucker | work=Zekelman | date=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Also, some criticism suggests that the LEED rating system is not sensitive and does not vary enough with regard to local environmental conditions. For instance, a building in [[Maine]] would receive the same credit as a building in [[Arizona]] for water conservation, though the principle is more important in the latter case. Another complaint is that its certification costs require money that could be used to make the building in question even more sustainable. Many critics have noted that compliance and certification costs have grown faster than staff support from the USGBC.\n\nFor existing buildings LEED has developed LEED-EB. Research has demonstrated that buildings that can achieve LEED-EB equivalencies can generate a tremendous ROI{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. In a 2008 white paper by the Leonardo Academy comparing LEED-EB buildings vs. data from BOMA's Experience Exchange Report 2007 demonstrated LEED-EB certified buildings achieved superior operating cost savings in 63% of the buildings surveyed ranging from $4.94 to $15.59 per square foot of floor space, with an average valuation of $6.68 and a median valuation of $6.07.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leonardoacademy.org/download/Economics%20of%20LEED-EB%2020090222.pdf |title=Cost Analysis of LEED-EB |accessdate=2014-02-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330221114/http://www.leonardoacademy.org/download/Economics%20of%20LEED-EB%2020090222.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn addition the overall cost of LEED-EB implementation and certification ranged from $0.00 to $6.46 per square\nfoot of floor space, with an average of $2.43 per square foot demonstrating that implementation is not expensive, especially in comparison to cost savings. These costs should be significantly reduced if automation and technology are integrated into the implementation.\n\n==Incentive programs==\nMany federal, state, and local governments and school districts have adopted various types of LEED initiatives and incentives.

Owen points out that \"no bus is as green as an elevator.\"<ref>Owen, pp.232-33.</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Walkable City'', city planner Jeff Speck provides another example of \"LEED brain\": the federal [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] relocated its Region 7 Headquarters from downtown [[Kansas City, Missouri]], to a LEED-certified building 20 miles away in the suburb of [[Lenexa, Kansas]], causing many of the agency's 627 employees to drive additional miles to and from work.  Kaid Benfield of the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] estimated that the carbon emissions associated with the additional miles driven were almost three times higher than before, a change from 0.39 metric tons per person per month to 1.08 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per month.

Watson]]. As founding chairman of the LEED Steering Committee,  Watson led a broad-based consensus process until 2007, bringing together non-profit organizations, government agencies, architects, engineers, developers, builders, product manufacturers and other industry leaders.

Early LEED committee members also included USGBC co-founder Mike Italiano, architects Bill Reed and Sandy Mendler, builders Gerard Heiber and Myron Kibbe, and engineer Richard Bourne. As interest in LEED grew, in 1996, engineers Tom Paladino and Lynn Barker co-chaired the newly formed LEED technical committee.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2015, LEED grew from one standard for new construction to a comprehensive system of interrelated standards covering aspects from the design and construction to the maintenance and operation of buildings.

All of the LEED credits in each rating system are assigned to either the design application or the construction application.

The GBCI also utilizes LEED Online to conduct their reviews.\n\n===LEED energy modeling===\nDesign teams have the option of achieving points under the Optimize Energy Performance credit by building an energy model.  This energy model must follow the modeling methodologies outlined in Appendix G of the [[ASHRAE 90.1]] building energy standard.  The guidelines in Appendix G require that the team make two energy models: one representing the building as designed, and a second \u201cbaseline\u201d building.  The baseline building must be modeled in the same location, and have the same geometry and occupancy as the design building.  Depending on location (climate) and building size, the standard provides requirements for HVAC system type, and wall and window definitions.  The goal of this methodology is to provide a baseline building to use as a reference point to compare the design building against. It is a way to standardize the baseline, while putting weight on important factors that heavily influence building energy consumption (e.g., location, geometry, and occupancy patterns).  The number of points achieved in this credit is correlated with the percent predicted energy cost savings demonstrated by the difference between the design and baseline energy models.\n\nThis method of energy modeling has been criticized for inaccurately predicting actual energy usage of LEED-certified buildings. The USGBC admits that \"current information indicates that most buildings do not perform as well as design metrics indicate. As a result, building owners might not obtain the benefits promised.\"<ref name=\"http\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs3402.pdf|title=A National Green Building Research Agenda|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220808/http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs3402.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-12|df=}}</ref>\n\n===LEED for Homes Rating System===\nToday, increasing demand towards environmental safety forces LEED certification to play major role.

The Provider and the Green Rater do not certify the project, but rather assist in the certification process.\n\n==LEED Performance==\nResearch papers provide most of what is known about the performance and effectiveness of LEED in two credit category areas \u2013 energy and indoor environment quality.  In one study of 953 NYC office buildings, 21 LEED certified buildings collectively showed no energy savings compared with non-LEED buildings, although LEED Gold buildings \"outperformed other NYC office buildings by 20%\".<ref name=2013scofield />  IEQ-related studies provide two contrasting results - the first used occupant survey results in 65 LEED buildings and 79 non-LEED buildings and it concluded that occupants of LEED certified buildings have equal satisfaction with the building overall and with the workspace than occupants of non-LEED rated buildings<ref name=Schiavon /> and the second used occupant interviews and physical site measurements at 12 LEED buildings to report superior indoor environment performance compared with similar 12 conventional buildings (non-LEED).<ref name=Newsham /> Buildings certified under LEED do not have to prove energy or water efficiency in practice to receive LEED certification points, but instead LEED uses modeling software to predict future energy use based on intended use. This has led to criticism of LEED\u2019s ability to accurately determine the efficiency of buildings.

There may be a lack of abundant availability of manufactured building components that meet LEED specifications. Pursuing LEED certification for a project is an added cost in itself as well. This added cost comes in the form of USGBC correspondence, LEED design-aide consultants, and the hiring of the required [[Building commissioning|Commissioning Authority]] (CxA)\u2014all of which would not necessarily be included in an environmentally responsible project, unless it also sought a LEED rating.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nHowever, these higher initial costs can be effectively mitigated by the savings incurred over time due to the lower-than-industry-standard operational costs typical of a LEED certified building. This [[Whole-life cost|Life cycle costing]] is a method for assessing the total cost of ownership, taking into account all costs of acquiring, owning and operating, and the eventual disposal of a building.  Additional economic payback may come in the form of employee productivity gains incurred as a result of working in a healthier environment. Studies suggest that an initial up-front investment of 2% extra yields over ten times that initial investment over the life cycle of the building.<ref>{{cite web|author = Greg Kats|author2 = Leon Alevantis|author3 = Adam Berman|author4 = Evan Mills|author5 = Jeff Perlman|title = The Costs and Financial Benefits of Green Buildings: A Report to California's Sustainable Building Task Force|year = 2003|url = http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/MediaArchive/607_Kats_AB184.pdf|accessdate = 2008-10-30|url-status=live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151001160646/http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/MediaArchive/607_Kats_AB184.pdf|archivedate = 2015-10-01|df = |author-link = Greg Kats}}</ref>\n\nFurther, the USGBC has stated support for the [[2030 Challenge|Architecture 2030]], an effort that has set a goal of using no fossil-fuel, greenhouse-gas-emitting energy to operate by 2030.<ref>{{cite web|title = The 2030 Challenge|publisher = Architecture2030.org|url = http://architecture2030.org/2030_challenges/2030-challenge/|url-status=live|archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151123024452/http://architecture2030.org/2030_challenges/2030-challenge/|archivedate = 2015-11-23|df = }}</ref>\n\nIn the progression of sustainable design from simply meeting local buildings codes to USGBC LEED<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19 |title=U.S. Green Building Council &#124; U.S. Green Building Council |publisher=Usgbc.org |accessdate=2013-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401184623/http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19 |archivedate=2013-04-01 |df= }}</ref> (Certified, Silver, Gold and Platinum) to the Architecture 2030 Challenge,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.architecture2030.org/2030_challenge/the_2030_challenge |title=The 2030 Challenge |publisher=Architecture 2030 |accessdate=2013-10-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016084514/http://www.architecture2030.org/2030_challenge/the_2030_challenge |archivedate=2013-10-16 |df= }}</ref> the [[Living Building Challenge]] is currently the most stringent sustainable design protocol.

It is also not yet climate-specific, although the newest version hopes to address this weakness partially. Because of this, designers may make materials or design choices that garner a LEED point, even though they may not be the most site- or climate-appropriate choice available. On top of this, LEED is also not energy-specific. Since it only measures the overall performances, builders are free to choose how to achieve points under various categories. A ''USA Today'' review showed that 7,100 certified commercial building projects targeted easy and cheap green points, such as creating healthy spaces and providing educational displays in the building.<ref>{{cite news | title=In U.S. building industry, is it too easy to be green? | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/24/green-building-leed-certification/1650517/ | work=USA Today | date=2012-10-24 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128203601/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/24/green-building-leed-certification/1650517/ | archivedate=2013-11-28 | df= }}</ref> Few builders would really adopt renewable energy because the generators for those energy resources, such as solar [[photovoltaic]], are costly. Builders game the rating system and use certain performances to compensate for the others, making energy conservation the weakest part in the overall evaluation.\n\nLEED is a measurement tool for [[green building]] in the [[United States]] and it is developed and continuously modified by workers in the green building industry, especially in the ten largest metro areas in the U.S.; however, LEED certified buildings have been slower to penetrate small and mid-major markets.<ref>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.wheatland.com/wheatland-standard/is-leed-certification-worth-it/ | title=Is LEED Certification Worth It? | first=Marvin | last=Phillips | work=wheatland.com | date=October 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.zekelman.com/zekelman-perspective/4-advantages-of-specifying-steel-construction-for-a-leed-project/ | title=4 Advantages of Specifying Steel Construction for A LEED Project | first=Jelani | last=Rucker | work=Zekelman | date=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Also, some criticism suggests that the LEED rating system is not sensitive and does not vary enough with regard to local environmental conditions. For instance, a building in [[Maine]] would receive the same credit as a building in [[Arizona]] for water conservation, though the principle is more important in the latter case. Another complaint is that its certification costs require money that could be used to make the building in question even more sustainable. Many critics have noted that compliance and certification costs have grown faster than staff support from the USGBC.\n\nFor existing buildings LEED has developed LEED-EB. Research has demonstrated that buildings that can achieve LEED-EB equivalencies can generate a tremendous ROI{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. In a 2008 white paper by the Leonardo Academy comparing LEED-EB buildings vs. data from BOMA's Experience Exchange Report 2007 demonstrated LEED-EB certified buildings achieved superior operating cost savings in 63% of the buildings surveyed ranging from $4.94 to $15.59 per square foot of floor space, with an average valuation of $6.68 and a median valuation of $6.07.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leonardoacademy.org/download/Economics%20of%20LEED-EB%2020090222.pdf |title=Cost Analysis of LEED-EB |accessdate=2014-02-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330221114/http://www.leonardoacademy.org/download/Economics%20of%20LEED-EB%2020090222.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn addition the overall cost of LEED-EB implementation and certification ranged from $0.00 to $6.46 per square\nfoot of floor space, with an average of $2.43 per square foot demonstrating that implementation is not expensive, especially in comparison to cost savings. These costs should be significantly reduced if automation and technology are integrated into the implementation.\n\n==Incentive programs==\nMany federal, state, and local governments and school districts have adopted various types of LEED initiatives and incentives.

Kaid Benfield of the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] estimated that the carbon emissions associated with the additional miles driven were almost three times higher than before, a change from 0.39 metric tons per person per month to 1.08 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per month.
