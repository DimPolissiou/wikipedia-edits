Nodoka suffered from a respiratory condition so her parents decided to move to help her recovery. Nodoka takes in her new surroundings, eager to help out and meet new people. While relaxing in the park, Nodoka suddenly witnesses a monster attack and upon hearing of a dog in trouble, goes off to find it. Nodoka finds the dog along with three Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran. The Animals explain that the dog is named Princess Latte and that they all come from the Healing Garden, a place in the center of the Earth that helps keep the planet healthy. However the garden is under a threat from the Bj\u00f6gens, who wants to infect the world with disease. The Bj\u00f6gen General Daruizen created the monster, known as a MegaBj\u00f6gen, by infecting an elemental spirit. The Animals were asked by Latte's mother, Queen Tiatine, to find those destined to be their partners and become the Legendary Precure and fight the Bj\u00f6gens. Latte is sensitive to the monster attacks and becomes sick when one appears. However, Nodoka's feelings of wanting to help resonate with Rabirin and allow her to transform into Cure Grace. Cure Grace then defeats the MegaBj\u00f6gen and purifies the Flower spirit, making Latte healthy again.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = No Longer Partners!?

The next day Nodoka goes to her first day at school, the Animals come with her in the hope of finding partners for Pegitan and Nyatoran. Nodoka discovers she is in the same class as Chiyu Sawaizumi and Hinata Hiramitsu, two girls she met the previous day. After school, Nodoka is asked if she wants to join one of the sports clubs. While enthusiastic about it, Nodoka soon reveals she is poorly unskilled at everything, much to Rabirin's dismay. Thinking Nodoka is unfit to be a Precure, Rabirin breaks off their partnership and runs off, with Pegitan pursuing her. Nodoka returns home hoping to find Rabirin, but when Latte falls ill, she returns to school to find Daruizen has created another MegaBj\u00f6gen. Nodoka attempts to fight the MegaBj\u00f6gen on her own but is easily overpowered. Latte calls out and draws Rabirin and Pegitan back to her. Rabirin asks why Nodoka is so determined, at which she reveals to Rabirin about her illness when she was younger, and that renders her unable to participate in sports. Hoping to make up for her lost time, Nodoka wants to help protect the world as a Precure. Rabirin realizes she was wrong about Nodoka and apologizes; the two reconcile.

Meanwhile, Nyatoran leaves Pegitan to look after Latte while he tries to find a partner, but Latte sneaks off leaving Pegitan to find her. Latte manages to reach the school where she is found by Chiyu, who returns her to Nodoka. Chiyu once again tries to question Nodoka about her involvement with the monster attacks but Nodoka again evades her. Chiyu decides to drop the interrogation and invites Nodoka to her home. Chiyu's family own an inn with a hot spring and she allows Nodoka to use it freely. However another Bj\u00f6gen General, Shindoine, infects the water source to create a MegaBj\u00f6gen. Chiyu goes to investigate and witnesses Nodoka transforming into Cure Grace. Cure Grace battles the MegaBj\u00f6gen but is injured protecting Chiyu. Chiyu then spots Pegitan and asks him if she can use his power to help Nodoka, revealing she overhead him saying he felt useless despite wanting to help when he was in the hot spring earlier.

Nodoka expresses her concern to her mother, who gives Nodoka a set of tickets to the Aqaurium so the three girls can spent time together. At the Aquarium, Chiyu and Hinata start to get on well together but things take a turn when Pegitan goes missing and is mistaken for an escaped Penguin.

To mask their presence from the native humans, all non-human fables have to purchase an enchantment known as a \"glamour\" which allows them to appear human, or be relocated to a rural community known as \"The Farm\".\n\n===Characters===\n{{see also|List of Fables characters}}\nThe protagonist of ''The Wolf Among Us'' is Bigby Wolf ([[Adam Harrington (voice actor)|Adam Harrington]]), formerly the [[Big Bad Wolf]]. He is the sheriff of Fabletown, currently working at the \"Business Office\" under corrupt interim mayor [[Ichabod Crane]] ([[Roger L. Jackson]]), aided by [[Snow White (Fables)|Snow White]] ([[Erin Yvette]]) and the [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] ([[Gavin Hammon]]) in his investigation along with the help of Bufkin the [[Winged monkeys|winged monkey]] (Chuck Kourouklis) that manages Fabletown's records. Aristocrat [[Bluebeard]] ([[Dave Fennoy]]) also works at the Office though his motives are unclear. Bigby resides at the Woodlands apartments where Colin (Brian Sommer), one of the [[Three Little Pigs]], occasionally crashes at his place. [[Beauty and the Beast]] ([[Melissa Hutchison]] and Gavin Hammon) are also residents of the Woodlands, though currently struggling with a troubled marriage. One of the Fables that Bigby frequently contacts is [[Mr. Toad]] (Chuck Kourouklis) and his son TJ (Toad Jr.), who live in a run-down apartment building nearby.\n\nIn the first episode, the player is introduced to [[Little Red Riding Hood|The Woodsman]] (Adam Harrington), who lives in the same building as Mr. Toad. Standing in Bigby's way are [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|Dee and Dum Tweedle]] (Gavin Hammon), twin private investigators and criminals. Bigby also encounters Holly (Janet Lipsey), a [[Troll]] who runs the Trip Trap bar, and  barfly [[Grendel]] ([[Kid Beyond]]). The second episode introduces trickster and thief [[Jack Horner (comics)|Jack Horner]] (Colin Benoit), [[Georgie Porgie]] ([[Kevin Howarth]]), a pimp and the owner of the Pudding & Pie strip club, along with prostitute Nerissa (Molly Benson), the former [[The Little Mermaid|Little Mermaid]], Vivian (Sandy Delonga), and [[Clever Hans (fairy tale)|Clever Hans]] (Ben Knoll), the club's bouncer. The third episode introduces the janitor [[Flycatcher (comics)|Flycatcher]] (Dustin Rubin), [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]] ([[Kathryn Cressida]]) as a minion of [[There Was a Crooked Man|the Crooked Man]] (Philip Banks), and Aunty Greenleaf ([[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]), a rogue witch who illegally sells cheap black-market glamours to Fables. The fourth episode introduces the [[Jersey Devil]] (Bobby Vickers), the manager of the Lucky Pawn shop and [[Rub-a-dub-dub|Johann the butcher]] ([[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]]), the former owner of the Cut Above butcher shop who has been forced out of his business by the Crooked Man's henchmen.\n\n===Plot===\nThis is a broad overview of the plot. Certain decisions made by the player will alter details of specific events.\n\nBigby Wolf, formerly the Big Bad Wolf, is the Sheriff of Fabletown, a hidden community of fairytale characters located in 1980s New York City. Receiving a call from Mr. Toad, Bigby protects a prostitute from an intoxicated Woodsman. Before she departs, she tells him he is not as bad as everyone says he is.\n\nLater that night, Bigby and Snow White find the woman's head left on the Woodlands doorstep. Clues left with the head identify her as Faith, a Fable from ''[[Allerleirauh]]''. Deputy Mayor Ichabod Crane orders him and Snow to investigate her death. They head to the apartment she shared with her husband Prince Lawrence and find the [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|Tweedles]], Dee and Dum, snooping through it. They learn that Lawrence and Faith struggled to make ends meet and Faith took up prostitution to help pay the bills. Bigby leaves Snow at the Woodlands while he continues to trace leads. When he returns, he finds the Woodlands surrounded by police, Snow's head sitting on the building's steps.\n\nBigby is taken in for questioning by the mundy police, but Crane uses a spell to wipe the incident from the police's minds. When they return, they are surprised to find Snow still alive; the head is shown to be disguised by a black-market glamour, a spell that non-human Fables use, and belongs instead to a troll named Lily. Bigby tracks Lily's connections to the Pudding & Pie, a strip club run by Georgie Porgie, but Georgie claims innocence. One of his other prostitutes, Nerissa, cryptically directs Bigby to a nearby hotel room. There he finds Lily's blood on the bed, and photographic evidence of Crane engaging in sexual acts with Lily glamoured to look like Snow. He informs Snow of this, and they race back to the Woodlands to find Crane gone, and the Magic Mirror, which could have revealed his location, shattered with one shard missing.\n\nBigby follows a trail of clues to Crane's whereabouts to the apartment of Aunty Greenleaf, one of the witches that makes the black-market glamours. Along the way, Bigby discovers that Crane has been embezzling money from Fabletown over the years to pay off a loan shark known as the Crooked Man. Greenleaf points the two back to the Pudding & Pie. Storming the club, they find Crane trying to extract information out of the prostitutes to prove his innocence. Snow realizes Crane's actions are not that of a murderer, and he is arrested for his embezzlement. Leaving the club, they are attacked by the Crooked Man and his henchmen, the Tweedles and Bloody Mary. Mary and the Tweedles goad Bigby into his werewolf form, and a fight breaks out. When Mary critically wounds Bigby with a silver bullet, Snow steps in to stop the fight and willingly gives up Crane to the Crooked Man to save Bigby's life.\n\nBack at the Woodlands, Bigby struggles to find clues when Nerissa appears. He realizes the ribbon she wears prevents her from speaking the truth, that Faith wore an identical ribbon, and that she died when the ribbon was removed. He follows another trail of clues, and finds evidence of the black-market glamour ring in the Cut Above butcher shop, a pawn shop called the Lucky Pawn where the Crooked Man distributes his loans to Fables owned by Jersey Devil, another henchman of the Crooked Man, and Crane's presence, as well as the missing Mirror Shard. The Mirror reveals Mary putting Crane onto an overseas flight to Paris to keep him from talking, as well as the next location of the door to the Crooked Man's lair, which moves around the city.\n\nBigby enters the Crooked Man's lair alone, meeting him and his agents. The Crooked Man reveals Georgie as Faith and Lily's killer and claims he misunderstood his orders to deal with them, but Georgie asserts the Crooked Man told him to kill the women. A fight ensues and the Crooked Man and a fatally stabbed Georgie escape. When Bigby pursues Georgie and his lover Vivian to the Pudding & Pie, she explains that the Crooked Man and Georgie were acting to stop a plot spearheaded by Faith with the other prostitutes to escape their forced servitude. Vivian is revealed to be the girl with the ribbon around her neck and, having made copies of her ribbon, trapped women like Faith, Lily, and Nerissa for Georgie whilst guaranteeing their silence. Regretting her actions, Vivian undoes her ribbon, breaking the spell but severing her head.\n\nBigby then finds the Crooked Man hiding in an old foundry, and after turning into his true wolf form to kill Bloody Mary, corners him in an office, where he demands a fair trial at the Woodlands. Bigby returns to the Witching Well at the Business Office to recount events to the assembled Fables of the Woodlands, where he and Snow are forced to defend their actions against claims from the Fables. Bigby recounts Vivian's and Georgie's confessions regarding the Crooked Man's involvement, but his word is deemed untrustworthy. Nerissa appears and testifies that she and five other women heard the Crooked Man order the murders. Their testimonies are considered sufficient to believe what Bigby did was right.\n\nIn the epilogue, Snow becomes the new Deputy Mayor and deals with the fallout of the Crooked Man's actions, while Bigby sees off the Fables being taken back to the Farm. Afterward, he encounters Nerissa, who is moving on with her life. She admits that Faith concocted a plan with her and Lily to blackmail Georgie and the Crooked Man for their freedom, using a picture of Lily and Crane together, but Georgie killed the two women when she panicked and revealed their plot to him. Nerissa left Faith's head at the Woodlands to get Bigby involved, and gave false testimony to have the Crooked Man punished, knowing that he was the one who ordered their deaths. Leaving, she comments that Bigby is not as bad as everyone says he is, causing Bigby to recall Faith saying the same before her death. Several past conversations with Faith and Nerissa play out in Bigby's head, leading him to question the true identity of Nerissa.\n\n==Episodes==\nEpisodic releases for the Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, OS X and PlayStation 3 platforms were released near-simultaneously within the same week; the iOS and PlayStation Vita episodic releases were expected to trail these by about a month or so.\n{{Episode table|background=#142F26|overall=|title=|director=|writer=|airdate=|released=y\n|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Faith\n |DirectedBy = Nick Herman and Dennis Lenart\n |WrittenBy = Pierre Shorette\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|10|11}}\n |ShortSummary = The first murder of a Fable in several years leads Bigby on the trail of a killer.\n |LineColor = 142F26\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Smoke and Mirrors\n |DirectedBy = Jason Latino\n |WrittenBy = [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]], Adam Hines, and Nicole Martinez\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|2|4}}\n |ShortSummary = Bigby continues investigating for the 'serial killer' walking the streets of Fabletown.

To mask their presence from the native humans, all non-human fables have to purchase an enchantment known as a \"glamour\" which allows them to appear human, or be relocated to a rural community known as \"The Farm\".\n\n===Characters===\n{{see also|List of Fables characters}}\nThe protagonist of ''The Wolf Among Us'' is Bigby Wolf ([[Adam Harrington (voice actor)|Adam Harrington]]), formerly the [[Big Bad Wolf]]. He is the sheriff of Fabletown, currently working at the \"Business Office\" under corrupt interim mayor [[Ichabod Crane]] ([[Roger L. Jackson]]), aided by [[Snow White (Fables)|Snow White]] ([[Erin Yvette]]) and the [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] ([[Gavin Hammon]]) in his investigation along with the help of Bufkin the [[Winged monkeys|winged monkey]] (Chuck Kourouklis) that manages Fabletown's records. Aristocrat [[Bluebeard]] ([[Dave Fennoy]]) also works at the Office though his motives are unclear. Bigby resides at the Woodlands apartments where Colin (Brian Sommer), one of the [[Three Little Pigs]], occasionally crashes at his place. [[Beauty and the Beast]] ([[Melissa Hutchison]] and Gavin Hammon) are also residents of the Woodlands, though currently struggling with a troubled marriage. One of the Fables that Bigby frequently contacts is [[Mr. Toad]] (Chuck Kourouklis) and his son TJ (Toad Jr.), who live in a run-down apartment building nearby.\n\nIn the first episode, the player is introduced to [[Little Red Riding Hood|The Woodsman]] (Adam Harrington), who lives in the same building as Mr. Toad. Standing in Bigby's way are [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|Dee and Dum Tweedle]] (Gavin Hammon), twin private investigators and criminals. Bigby also encounters Holly (Janet Lipsey), a [[Troll]] who runs the Trip Trap bar, and  barfly [[Grendel]] ([[Kid Beyond]]). The second episode introduces trickster and thief [[Jack Horner (comics)|Jack Horner]] (Colin Benoit), [[Georgie Porgie]] ([[Kevin Howarth]]), a pimp and the owner of the Pudding & Pie strip club, along with prostitute Nerissa (Molly Benson), the former [[The Little Mermaid|Little Mermaid]], Vivian (Sandy Delonga), and [[Clever Hans (fairy tale)|Clever Hans]] (Ben Knoll), the club's bouncer. The third episode introduces the janitor [[Flycatcher (comics)|Flycatcher]] (Dustin Rubin), [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]] ([[Kathryn Cressida]]) as a minion of [[There Was a Crooked Man|the Crooked Man]] (Philip Banks), and Aunty Greenleaf ([[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]), a rogue witch who illegally sells cheap black-market glamours to Fables. The fourth episode introduces the [[Jersey Devil]] (Bobby Vickers), the manager of the Lucky Pawn shop and [[Rub-a-dub-dub|Johann the butcher]] ([[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]]), the former owner of the Cut Above butcher shop who has been forced out of his business by the Crooked Man's henchmen.\n\n===Plot===\nThis is a broad overview of the plot. Certain decisions made by the player will alter details of specific events.\n\nBigby Wolf, formerly the Big Bad Wolf, is the Sheriff of Fabletown, a hidden community of fairytale characters located in 1980s New York City. Receiving a call from Mr. Toad, Bigby protects a prostitute from an intoxicated Woodsman. Before she departs, she tells him he is not as bad as everyone says he is.\n\nLater that night, Bigby and Snow White find the woman's head left on the Woodlands doorstep. Clues left with the head identify her as Faith, a Fable from ''[[Allerleirauh]]''. Deputy Mayor Ichabod Crane orders him and Snow to investigate her death. They head to the apartment she shared with her husband Prince Lawrence and find the [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|Tweedles]], Dee and Dum, snooping through it. They learn that Lawrence and Faith struggled to make ends meet and Faith took up prostitution to help pay the bills. Bigby leaves Snow at the Woodlands while he continues to trace leads. When he returns, he finds the Woodlands surrounded by police, Snow's head sitting on the building's steps.\n\nBigby is taken in for questioning by the mundy police, but Crane uses a spell to wipe the incident from the police's minds. When they return, they are surprised to find Snow still alive; the head is shown to be disguised by a black-market glamour, a spell that non-human Fables use, and belongs instead to a troll named Lily. Bigby tracks Lily's connections to the Pudding & Pie, a strip club run by Georgie Porgie, but Georgie claims innocence. One of his other prostitutes, Nerissa, cryptically directs Bigby to a nearby hotel room. There he finds Lily's blood on the bed, and photographic evidence of Crane engaging in sexual acts with Lily glamoured to look like Snow. He informs Snow of this, and they race back to the Woodlands to find Crane gone, and the Magic Mirror, which could have revealed his location, shattered with one shard missing.\n\nBigby follows a trail of clues to Crane's whereabouts to the apartment of Aunty Greenleaf, one of the witches that makes the black-market glamours. Along the way, Bigby discovers that Crane has been embezzling money from Fabletown over the years to pay off a loan shark known as the Crooked Man. Greenleaf points the two back to the Pudding & Pie. Storming the club, they find Crane trying to extract information out of the prostitutes to prove his innocence. Snow realizes Crane's actions are not that of a murderer, and he is arrested for his embezzlement. Leaving the club, they are attacked by the Crooked Man and his henchmen, the Tweedles and Bloody Mary. Mary and the Tweedles goad Bigby into his werewolf form, and a fight breaks out. When Mary critically wounds Bigby with a silver bullet, Snow steps in to stop the fight and willingly gives up Crane to the Crooked Man to save Bigby's life.\n\nBack at the Woodlands, Bigby struggles to find clues when Nerissa appears. He realizes the ribbon she wears prevents her from speaking the truth, that Faith wore an identical ribbon, and that she died when the ribbon was removed. He follows another trail of clues, and finds evidence of the black-market glamour ring in the Cut Above butcher shop, a pawn shop called the Lucky Pawn where the Crooked Man distributes his loans to Fables owned by Jersey Devil, another henchman of the Crooked Man, and Crane's presence, as well as the missing Mirror Shard. The Mirror reveals Mary putting Crane onto an overseas flight to Paris to keep him from talking, as well as the next location of the door to the Crooked Man's lair, which moves around the city.\n\nBigby enters the Crooked Man's lair alone, meeting him and his agents. The Crooked Man reveals Georgie as Faith and Lily's killer and claims he misunderstood his orders to deal with them, but Georgie asserts the Crooked Man told him to kill the women. A fight ensues and the Crooked Man and a fatally stabbed Georgie escape. When Bigby pursues Georgie and his lover Vivian to the Pudding & Pie, she explains that the Crooked Man and Georgie were acting to stop a plot spearheaded by Faith with the other prostitutes to escape their forced servitude. Vivian is revealed to be the girl with the ribbon around her neck and, having made copies of her ribbon, trapped women like Faith, Lily, and Nerissa for Georgie whilst guaranteeing their silence. Regretting her actions, Vivian undoes her ribbon, breaking the spell but severing her head.\n\nBigby then finds the Crooked Man hiding in an old foundry, and after turning into his true wolf form to kill Bloody Mary, corners him in an office, where he demands a fair trial at the Woodlands. Bigby returns to the Witching Well at the Business Office to recount events to the assembled Fables of the Woodlands, where he and Snow are forced to defend their actions against claims from the Fables. Bigby recounts Vivian's and Georgie's confessions regarding the Crooked Man's involvement, but his word is deemed untrustworthy. Nerissa appears and testifies that she and five other women heard the Crooked Man order the murders. Their testimonies are considered sufficient to believe what Bigby did was right.\n\nIn the epilogue, Snow becomes the new Deputy Mayor and deals with the fallout of the Crooked Man's actions, while Bigby sees off the Fables being taken back to the Farm. Afterward, he encounters Nerissa, who is moving on with her life. She admits that Faith concocted a plan with her and Lily to blackmail Georgie and the Crooked Man for their freedom, using a picture of Lily and Crane together, but Georgie killed the two women when she panicked and revealed their plot to him. Nerissa left Faith's head at the Woodlands to get Bigby involved, and gave false testimony to have the Crooked Man punished, knowing that he was the one who ordered their deaths.

If this is in the middle of a movement after the brain has sent out a movement to complete, the eye will see the movement being performed. That movement being perceived will be sent back to the eye, and the brain will perceive what action was completed and will compensate to fit the actual movement desired. This is called [[Efference copy|corollary discharge]],<ref name=\":0\" /> and it is one of the mechanisms of the cortical areas of the brain in the cerebral cortex to account for spatially accurate vision. Many areas of the brain help with this function, including the frontal eye fields, where neurons are active before the saccade is discharged, which brings the second point of focus into the visual field. This presaccadic shift<ref name=\":0\" /> in the neuron\u2019s receptive field excites the neuron before the eye even moves onto the next site. The [[superior colliculus]] is important for visual processing. The pre-striate area, V4, and the parietal reach regions are all also important for this.\n\n[[File:3D Medical Animation Eye Structure.jpg|thumb|3D Medical Animation Eye Structure]]\nHowever, the most important region of the brain for this type of processing would be the lateral intraparietal area, that has been studied in relation to attention and intention,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=ME|last2=Bisley|first2=JW|last3=Powel|first3=KD|last4=Gottlieb|first4=J|date=2006|title=Saccades, salience and attention: the role of the lateral intraparietal area in visual behavior.|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612306550101?via%3Dihub|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=155|pages=157-175|via=Science Direct}}</ref> as well as the processing in the brain of those saccadic eye movements.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lateral intraparietal area, the LIP, is associated with attention in the visual space and saccades.<ref name=\":1\" /> The LIP acts like a priority map,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Bisley|first=JW|last2=Goldberg|first2=ME|date=2010|title=Attention, Intention, and Priority in the Parietal Lobe|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-neuro-060909-152823?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|volume=33|pages=1-21|via=}}</ref> with each stimulus being represented according to their priority as part of the behavior that is going to be performed, usually as part of corollary discharge;<ref name=\":0\" /> the higher priority the task, the more activity in the LIP.<ref name=\":2\" /> This priority map has both [[Pattern recognition (psychology)|top-down and bottom-up]] influences; the top-down influences come from a drive from behavioral and task demands, as well as reward.<ref name=\":2\" /> This top-down influence can specifically be seen in the high activity in the LIP when a distractor is introduced into the receptive field of a monkey that is in the process of planning a memory-guide saccade, a saccade driven toward a remembered object or point in the receptive field from a previous visual stimulus.<ref name=\":1\" /> If a task-irrelevant stimulus, a distractor, is flashed in the receptive field of the monkey during its time to plan that memory-guided saccade, the monkey will target the eye the move first towards the distractor, then back to the target of the memory-guided saccade.<ref name=\":1\" /> The specific top-down influence will be the eye\u2019s movement back to the target of that memory-guided saccade. The activity in the LIP predicts the center of attention, such as how the memory-guided saccade elicits a more robust response in the LIP than the distractor and is particularly active during the time in which the eye moves from the distractor back to the target of the memory-guided saccade.\n\n[[File:Gibraltar Barbary Macaque.jpg|thumb|Gibraltar Barbary Macaque commonly used as an animal model for complex brain processing|alt=|left]]\nThe priority, or [[Saliency map|salience map]],<ref name=\":1\" /> is interpreted by the oculomotor system to determine where the center of attention should be focused, as well as where the goal of the saccade is. The bottom-up influence is seen simply when the LIP neurons elicit a rapid response when that distractor is flashed quickly into the visual field, and the eye moves towards the distractor, instead of following to the target of the memory-guided saccade.<ref name=\":2\" /> Bottom-up processing primarily consists of the brain processing that there is an object in the receptive field, with no understanding of what that object is. Most background and irrelevant stimuli shows low activity in the LIP. This priority map receives input from both the [[Two-streams hypothesis|dorsal and ventral streams of processing]], which process moving visual stimuli and recognize objects. Areas including V2, V3, V3a, V4, all part of visual processing, and MT and MST, which specifically respond to moving stimuli<ref name=\":2\" /> are all also important in visual processing. The LIP drives saccades, attention, and gathers evidence about the environment in order to properly discharge movement. Psychophysical evidence has also suggested two ways in which space is represented in the brain during corollary discharge: a retinotopic representation, which is rapid and driven by the position of the eye, and a craniotopic representation, which is slower due to the processing of the receptive field within the brain.<ref name=\":0\" /> How space is represented within the brain, in relation to attention and movement, is a complex process that is still being studied currently. \n\n=== Publications ===\nThis is a list of the highlights of his publications by year, Michael E.

If this is in the middle of a movement after the brain has sent out a movement to complete, the eye will see the movement being performed. That movement being perceived will be sent back to the eye, and the brain will perceive what action was completed and will compensate to fit the actual movement desired. This is called [[Efference copy|corollary discharge]],<ref name=\":0\" /> and it is one of the mechanisms of the cortical areas of the brain in the cerebral cortex to account for spatially accurate vision. Many areas of the brain help with this function, including the frontal eye fields, where neurons are active before the saccade is discharged, which brings the second point of focus into the visual field. This presaccadic shift<ref name=\":0\" /> in the neuron\u2019s receptive field excites the neuron before the eye even moves onto the next site. The [[superior colliculus]] is important for visual processing. The pre-striate area, V4, and the parietal reach regions are all also important for this.\n\n[[File:3D Medical Animation Eye Structure.jpg|thumb|3D Medical Animation Eye Structure]]\nHowever, the most important region of the brain for this type of processing would be the lateral intraparietal area, that has been studied in relation to attention and intention,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=ME|last2=Bisley|first2=JW|last3=Powel|first3=KD|last4=Gottlieb|first4=J|date=2006|title=Saccades, salience and attention: the role of the lateral intraparietal area in visual behavior.|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612306550101?via%3Dihub|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=155|pages=157-175|via=Science Direct}}</ref> as well as the processing in the brain of those saccadic eye movements.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lateral intraparietal area, the LIP, is associated with attention in the visual space and saccades.<ref name=\":1\" /> The LIP acts like a priority map,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Bisley|first=JW|last2=Goldberg|first2=ME|date=2010|title=Attention, Intention, and Priority in the Parietal Lobe|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-neuro-060909-152823?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|volume=33|pages=1-21|via=}}</ref> with each stimulus being represented according to their priority as part of the behavior that is going to be performed, usually as part of corollary discharge;<ref name=\":0\" /> the higher priority the task, the more activity in the LIP.<ref name=\":2\" /> This priority map has both [[Pattern recognition (psychology)|top-down and bottom-up]] influences; the top-down influences come from a drive from behavioral and task demands, as well as reward.<ref name=\":2\" /> This top-down influence can specifically be seen in the high activity in the LIP when a distractor is introduced into the receptive field of a monkey that is in the process of planning a memory-guide saccade, a saccade driven toward a remembered object or point in the receptive field from a previous visual stimulus.<ref name=\":1\" /> If a task-irrelevant stimulus, a distractor, is flashed in the receptive field of the monkey during its time to plan that memory-guided saccade, the monkey will target the eye the move first towards the distractor, then back to the target of the memory-guided saccade.<ref name=\":1\" /> The specific top-down influence will be the eye\u2019s movement back to the target of that memory-guided saccade. The activity in the LIP predicts the center of attention, such as how the memory-guided saccade elicits a more robust response in the LIP than the distractor and is particularly active during the time in which the eye moves from the distractor back to the target of the memory-guided saccade.\n\n[[File:Gibraltar Barbary Macaque.jpg|thumb|Gibraltar Barbary Macaque commonly used as an animal model for complex brain processing|alt=|left]]\nThe priority, or [[Saliency map|salience map]],<ref name=\":1\" /> is interpreted by the oculomotor system to determine where the center of attention should be focused, as well as where the goal of the saccade is. The bottom-up influence is seen simply when the LIP neurons elicit a rapid response when that distractor is flashed quickly into the visual field, and the eye moves towards the distractor, instead of following to the target of the memory-guided saccade.<ref name=\":2\" /> Bottom-up processing primarily consists of the brain processing that there is an object in the receptive field, with no understanding of what that object is. Most background and irrelevant stimuli shows low activity in the LIP. This priority map receives input from both the [[Two-streams hypothesis|dorsal and ventral streams of processing]], which process moving visual stimuli and recognize objects. Areas including V2, V3, V3a, V4, all part of visual processing, and MT and MST, which specifically respond to moving stimuli<ref name=\":2\" /> are all also important in visual processing. The LIP drives saccades, attention, and gathers evidence about the environment in order to properly discharge movement. Psychophysical evidence has also suggested two ways in which space is represented in the brain during corollary discharge: a retinotopic representation, which is rapid and driven by the position of the eye, and a craniotopic representation, which is slower due to the processing of the receptive field within the brain.<ref name=\":0\" /> How space is represented within the brain, in relation to attention and movement, is a complex process that is still being studied currently. \n\n=== Publications ===\nThis is a list of all his publications by year, Michael E.

It represented an important transition in Indian art from use of wood to stone. It was a royal art patronized by Mauryan kings especially Ashoka. Pillars, Stupas, caves are the most prominent examples.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Elephant-sculpture-dhauli.JPG|thumb|The stone elephant at [[Dhauli]].]]\nAccording to [[Niharranjan Ray]], the sum total of the Mauryan treasury of art include the remains of the royal palace and the city of [[Pataliputra]], a monolithic rail at [[Sarnath]], the ''Bodhimandala'' or the altar resting on four pilars at [[Bodhgaya]], the excavated Chaitya-halls in the Barabar and Nagarjuni hills of Gaya including the Sudama cave bearing the inscription dated the 12th regnal year of [[Ashoka]], the non-edict bearing and edict bearing pillars, the animal sculptures crowning the pillars with animal and vegetal reliefs decorating the abaci of the capitals and the front half of the representation of an elephant carved out in the round from a live rock at Dhauli.<ref>Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). ''Ancient India'', New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}}, p.348</ref>\n\n[[Ananda Coomaraswamy|Coomaraswamy]] argued that the Mauryan art may be said to exhibit three main phases. The first phase was the continuation of the Pre-Mauryan tradition, which is found in some instances to the representation of the Vedic deities (the most significant examples are the reliefs of [[Surya]] and [[Indra]] at the [[Bhaja Caves]].) The second phase was the court art of [[Ashoka]], typically found in the monolithic columns on which his edicts are inscribed and the third phase was the beginning of brick and stone architecture, as in the case of the original [[stupa]] at [[Sanchi]], the small monolithic rail at Sanchi and the Lomash Rishi cave in the [[Barabar Caves]], with its ornamentated facade, reproducing the forms of wooden structure.<ref>Coomaraswamy, Ananda K. (1999). ''Introduction to Indian Art'', New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, {{ISBN|81-215-0389-2}}, p.26</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Lomas_Rishi_entrance.jpg|thumb|200px|Mauryan architecture in the [[Barabar Mounts]]. Grottoe of Lomas Rishi. 3rd century BCE.]]\n\nWhile the period marked a second transition to use of brick and stone, wood was still the material of choice. [[Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]] advises the use of brick and stone for their durability. Yet he devotes a large section to safeguards to be taken against conflagrations in wooden buildings indicating their popularity.\n\n[[File:Kumhrar Maurya level ASIEC 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of the 80-columns pillared hall in [[Kumhrar]].]]\n[[Megasthenes]] mentions that the capital city of [[Pataliputra]] was encircled by a massive timber-palisade, pierced by loopholes through which archers could shoot. It had sixty-four gates and 570 towers.<ref>Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). ''Ancient India'', New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}}, p.281</ref> According to [[Strabo]], the gilded pillars of the palace were adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The palace stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds. It was furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs. Excavations carried out by Spooner and Waddell have brought to light remains of huge wooden palisades at [[Bulandi Bagh]] in [[Pataliputra]]. The remains of one of the buildings, an 80 pillared hall at [[Kumrahar]] are of particular significance. Out of 80 stone columns, that once stood on a wooden platform and supported a wooden roof, Spooner was able to discover the entire lower part of at least one in almost perfect conditions. It is more or less similar to an Ashokan pillar, smooth, polished and made of grey [[Chunar stone|Chunar sandstone]].<ref name=Mahajan>Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). ''Ancient India'', New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}}, p.349</ref>\n\nMany stupas like those at [[Sanchi]], [[Sarnath]] and probably [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] were originally built as brick and masonry mounds during the reign of [[Ashoka]]. Unfortunately they were renovated many times, which leaves us with hardly a clue of the original structures.\n\n==Sculpture==\n[[File:Rampurva bull capital detail.jpg|thumb|[[Rampurva|Rampurva bull capital]], detail of the [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]], with two [[palmette|\"flame palmettes\"]] framing a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] surrounded by small [[rosette (design)|rosette]] flowers.]]\n{{see also|Mauryan polish}}\nThis period marked an imaginative and impressive step forward in Indian stone sculpture; much previous sculpture was probably in wood and has not survived.  The elaborately carved animal capitals surviving on from some [[Pillars of Ashoka]] are the best known works, and among the finest, above all the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] from [[Sarnath]] that is now the [[National Emblem of India]]. [[Ananda Coomaraswamy|Coomaraswamy]] distinguishes between court art and a more popular art during the Mauryan period. Court art is represented by the pillars and their capitals. Popular art is represented by the works of the local sculptors like ''chauri'' (whisk)-bearer from Didarganj.<ref name=Thapar>Thapar, Romila (2001).

It has been described as [[Persia|Perso]]-[[Ionic order|Iionic]], with a strong [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] stylistic influence, including [[volute]], [[bead and reel]], [[Meander (art)|meander]] or [[Palmette|honeysuckle]] designs.

These pillars were carved in two types of stone. Some were of the spotted red and white sandstone from the region of [[Mathura]], the others of buff-coloured fine grained hard sandstone usually with small black spots quarried in the [[Chunar]] near [[Varanasi]]. The uniformity of style in the pillar capitals suggests that they were all sculpted by craftsmen from the same region. It would therefore seem, that stone transported from Mathura and Chunar to the various sites where the pillars have been found and here the stone was cut and carved by craftsmen<ref name=\"Thapar\"/> They were given a fine polish characteristic of Mauryan sculpture. These pillars were mainly erected in the [[Gangetic plains]]. They were inscribed with edicts of Ashoka on [[Dhamma]] or righteousness. The animal capital as a finely carved lifelike representation, noteworthy are the lion capital of [[Sarnath]], the bull capital of [[Rampurva]] and the lion capital of [[Lauria Nandangarh]]. Much speculation has been made about the similarity between these capitals and [[Achaemenid]] works.\n\n===Examples of popular art===\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n[[File:Patna Yashas photos drawings and inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The two monumental [[Yaksha]]s discovered in [[Patna]] (photos and drawings, size: 2 meters tall), and thought to be 3rd century BCE.

Right statue inscription: \"Yakhe Sanatananda\".<ref>Report of a tour in Bihar and Bengal, p.3 [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_gW8IAAAAQAAJ]</ref>]]\nThe work of local sculptors illustrates the popular art of the Mauryan period. This consisted of sculpture which probably was not commissioned by the emperor. The patrons of the popular art were the local governors and the more well-to-do subjects. It is represented by figures such as the female figure of Besnagar, the male figure of Parkham and the [[Didarganj Yakshi|whisk-bearer from Didarganj]] (although its age is debated). Technically they are fashioned with less skill than the pillar capitals. They express a considerable earthiness and physical vitality.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>\n\nThe stone elephant at [[Dhauli]] was also probably carved by local craftsmen and not by the special craftsmen who were responsible for the animal capitals. The image of the elephant emerging from the rock is a most impressive one, and its purpose was probably to draw attention to the inscription nearby.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>\n\nTerracotta objects of various sizes have been found at Mauryan sites. A continuation of the tradition of making mother-goddesses in clay, which dates back to the prehistoric period is revealed by the discovery of these objects at Mauryan levels during the excavations at Ahicchatra. They are found more commonly from [[Pataliputra]] to [[Taxila]]. Many have stylized forms and technically they are more accomplished, in that they have a well-defined shape and clear ornamenation. Some appear to have been made from moulds, yet there is little duplication. Terracotas from Taxila consists of primitive idols, votive reliefs with deities, toys dice, ornaments and beads. Among the ornaments were round medallions, similar to the ''bullae'' worn by Roman boys.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/> Ringstones probably associated with a fertility cult have also been found in some quantity. Terracotta images of folk gods and goddesses which have been found having an earthy charm.\n[[File:MauryanRingstone.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Mauryan ringstone, with standing goddess. Northwest Pakistan. 3rd Century BCE]]\n\n== Pottery ==\nUse of the potters wheel became universal. The pottery associated with the Mauryan period consists of many types of ware. But the most highly developed technique is seen in a special type of pottery known as the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] (NBP), which was the hallmark of the preceding and early Mauryan periods.  The NBP ware is made of finely levigated alluvial clay, which when seen in section is usually of a grey and sometimes of a red hue. It has a brilliantly burnished dressing of the quality of a glaze which ranges from a jet black to a deep grey or a metallic steel blue. Occasionally small red-brown patches are apparent on the surface. It can be distinguished from other polished or graphite-coated red wares by its peculiar lustre and brilliance. This ware was used largely for dishes and small bowls. It is found in abundance in the [[Ganges]] valley. Although NBP was not very rare, it was obviously a more expensive ware than the other varieties, since potsherds of NBP were occasionally found riveted with copper pins indicating that even a cracked vessel in NBP ware had its value.<ref name=Romila>Thapar, Romila (2001). ''{{IAST|A\u015boka}} and the Decline of the Mauryas'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564445-X}}, pp.239-49</ref>\n\n==Coins==\n[[File:MauryanCoin.JPG|thumb|Silver [[Punch marked coins|punch marked coin]] of the [[Mauryan empire]], with symbols of wheel and elephant (3rd century BCE)]]\nThe coins issued by the Mauryans are mostly silver and a few copper pieces of metal in various shapes, sizes and weights and which have one or more symbols punched on them. The most common symbols are the elephant, the tree in railing symbol and the mountain. The technique of producing such coins was generally that the metal was cut first and then the device was punched.<ref name=\"Romila\"/> These symbols are said to have either represented the Royal insignia or the symbol of the local guild that struck the coin. Some coins had ''Shroff'' ([[money changer]]) marks on them indicating that older coins were often re-issued. The alloy content closely resembles that specified in the Arthashastra. Based on his identification of the symbols on the punch-marked coins with certain Mauryan rulers, [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|Kosambi]] argued that the Mauryan punch-marked ''[[Karshapana]]'' after Chandragupta has the same weight as its predecessor, but much more copper, cruder fabric, and such a large variation in weight that the manufacture must have been hasty. This evidence of stress and unsatisfied currency demand is accompanied by debasement (inflation) plus vanishing of the reverse marks which denoted the ancient trade guilds.<ref>Kosambi, D.D. (1988). ''The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India in Historical Outline'', New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House, {{ISBN|0-7069-4200-0}}, p.164</ref> This in his opinion indicated that there was a fiscal crisis in the later Mauryan period. However his method of analysis and the chronological identification has been questioned.<ref>Thapar, Romila (2001). ''{{IAST|A\u015boka}} and the Decline of the Mauryas'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564445-X}}, p.289</ref>\n\n== Painting ==\nWhile we can be sure of Mauryan proficiency in this field based on the descriptions of [[Megasthenes]], unfortunately no proper representative has been found to date.  Many centuries later, the paintings of the [[Ajanta Caves]], the oldest significant body of Indian painting, show there was a well-developed tradition, which may well stretch back to Mauryan times.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Lohanipur torso.jpg|thumb|The [[Lohanipur torso]].\nFile:Female figure, northern India, Maurya period, c. 320-200 BCE, terracotta, HAA.JPG|Female [[terracotta]] figure, northern India, c. 320-200 BCE\nFile:Mauryan head.jpg|Head from [[Sarnath]],\nFile:Indian - Head of an Indian Village Deity - Walters 2563.jpg|Head of an Indian Village Deity, terracotta, 3rd century BCE\nFile:Statue of Matrikas found near Agam Kuan, Patna, 1895.jpg|Statue of [[Matrikas]] found near [[Agam Kuan]], [[Patna]]\nFile:MauryanStatuette2ndCenturyBCE.jpg|2nd-century statuette\nFile:Sarnath1.jpg|Dharmek Stupa at [[Sarnath]]\nImage:6thPillarOfAshoka.JPG|Fragment of the 6th Pillar [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict of Ashoka]] (238 BCE), in [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]], sandstone, [[British Museum]]\nImage:AsokaKandahar.jpg|[[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) by king [[Ashoka]], from [[Kandahar]].

The elaborately carved animal capitals surviving on from some [[Pillars of Ashoka]] are the best known works, and among the finest, above all the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] from [[Sarnath]] that is now the [[National Emblem of India]]. Coomaraswamy distinguishes between court art and a more popular art during the Mauryan period. Court art is represented by the pillars and their capitals,<ref name=Thapar>Thapar, Romila (2001). ''{{IAST|A\u015boka}} and the Decline of the Mauryas'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564445-X}}, pp.267-70</ref> and surviving popular art by some stone pieces, and many smaller works in [[terracotta]]. \n\nThe highly polished surface of court sculpture is often called [[Mauryan polish]]. However this seems not to be entirely reliable as a diagnostic tool for a Mauryan date, as some works from considerably later periods also have it.  The [[Didarganj Yakshi]], now most often thought to be from the 2nd century CE, is an example.  \n\n===Pillars and their capitals===\n{{see also|Pillars of Ashoka}}\n[[File:Pataliputra capital, Bihar Museum, Patna, 3rd century BCE.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pataliputra capital]], showing both Achaemenid and [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Greek influence]],  with [[volute]], [[bead and reel]], [[Meander (art)|meander]] and [[Palmette|honeysuckle]] designs.

It has been described as [[Persia|Perso]]-[[Ionic order|Iionic]], with a strong [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] stylistic influence, including [[volute]], [[bead and reel]], [[Meander (art)|meander]] or [[Palmette|honeysuckle]] designs.

These pillars were carved in two types of stone. Some were of the spotted red and white sandstone from the region of [[Mathura]], the others of buff-coloured fine grained hard sandstone usually with small black spots quarried in the [[Chunar]] near [[Varanasi]]. The uniformity of style in the pillar capitals suggests that they were all sculpted by craftsmen from the same region. It would therefore seem, that stone transported from Mathura and Chunar to the various sites where the pillars have been found and here the stone was cut and carved by craftsmen<ref name=\"Thapar\"/> They were given a fine polish characteristic of Mauryan sculpture. \n\nThese pillars were mainly erected in the [[Gangetic plains]]. They were inscribed with edicts of Ashoka on [[Dhamma]] or righteousness. The animal capital as a finely carved lifelike representation, noteworthy are the lion capital of [[Sarnath]], the bull capital of [[Rampurva]] and the lion capital of [[Lauria Nandangarh]]. Much speculation has been made about the similarity between these capitals and [[Achaemenid]] works.\n\n===\"Popular\" sculpture===\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n[[File:Patna Yakshas and inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The two monumental [[Yaksha]]s discovered in [[Patna]] (size: 2 meters tall), and thought to be 3rd century BCE.

This consisted of sculpture which probably was not commissioned by the emperor. The patrons of the popular art were the local governors and the more well-to-do subjects. It is represented by figures such as the female figure of Besnagar, the male figure of Parkham and the [[Didarganj Yakshi|whisk-bearer from Didarganj]] (although its age is debated). Technically they are fashioned with less skill than the pillar capitals. They express a considerable earthiness and physical vitality.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>\n\nThe stone elephant at [[Dhauli]] was also probably carved by local craftsmen and not by the court-based artists who were responsible for the animal capitals. The image of the elephant emerging from the rock is a most impressive one, and its purpose was probably to draw attention to the inscription nearby.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>\n\n===Terracottas===\nPopular [[terracotta]] objects of various sizes have been found at Mauryan sites, and elsewhere, and are probably the most numerous Mauryan works of art.  Made by local people who may not have been specialists, but for example potters with a sideline, they are very difficult to date if not recorded as coming from an identifiable archaeological context.  Many are regarded as pre-Mauryan, but a continuation of the tradition of making mother-goddesses in clay, which dates back to the prehistoric period is revealed by the discovery of these objects at Mauryan levels during the excavations at Ahicchatra. \n\nThey are found more commonly from [[Pataliputra]] to [[Taxila]]. Many have stylized forms and technically they are more accomplished, in that they have a well-defined shape and clear ornamentation. Some appear to have been made from moulds, yet there is little duplication. Terracotas from Taxila consists of deity figures, votive reliefs with deities, toys, dice, ornaments and beads. Among the ornaments were round medallions, similar to the ''bullae'' worn by Roman boys.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>  Terracotta images of folk gods and goddesses often have an earthy charm (some of them are perhaps dolls).  Many animal figures are probably toys for children.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Female figure, northern India, Maurya period, c. 320-200 BCE, terracotta, HAA.JPG|Female [[terracotta]] figure, northern India, c. 320-200 BCE\nFile:Indian - Head of an Indian Village Deity - Walters 2563 (cropped).jpg|Head of an Indian Village Deity, terracotta, 3rd century BCE\nFile:Indian - A Votive Figurine - Walters 25249 - Three Quarter Left (cropped).jpg|Mother goddess (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Elephant LACMA AC1994.233.2.jpg|Elephant (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Forepart of an Animal LACMA AC1994.233.1.jpg|Forepart of an animal (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Mathura, epoca maurya-sunga, scimmia, III-II sec ac. 02.JPG|Monkey (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd-2nd century BCE\n</gallery>\n\n===Ringstones===\n[[File:Ringstone MET DT9196.jpg|thumb|\"Ringstone with Four Goddesses and Four Date Palms\", [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York)<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 50, their no. 2</ref>]]\n[[File:MET 1987 142 374 O (cropped).jpg|thumb|Broken section with \"goddess\" flanked by birds, probably geese, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York)<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 50, their no. 4</ref>]]\n{{main|Ringstone}}\nThe ringstone is a distinctive type of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]] and miniature sculpture made in India during the approximate period of the Mauryan Empire and the following [[Sunga Empire]] (187-78 BCE).  They are usually dated to the 3rd or 2nd centuries BCE.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48; Bennett (2017); V&A</ref>  They are shaped like a [[doughnut]], but with straighter sides, and flat and plain on the bottom.  They are in stone, with the top side very finely carved in [[relief]] with several circular zones of decoration running around the hole in the centre.  When complete, they are about 2.5 to 4 inches across.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48-50; V&A. They may also be called \"ring stones\" or \"ring-stones\"</ref> \n\nThe designs vary, but all examples are finely carved, despite their small size.  A number of components appear in a variety of variations. Typically the innermost zone, which runs down the sloping sides of the hole, has standing female figures, often nude or nearly so, but with jewellery and elaborate hairstyles, with trees in between them.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48</ref>  These may be called \"goddesses\", or \"mother goddesses\", and the trees, apparently of various species, as the [[tree of life]], but these interpretations are not universally accepted.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48; V&A; Bennett (2017)</ref>\n\nTheir purpose, and any practical function, remains unclear and \"enigmatic\".  They may have a specific religious purpose, or a more general one promoting fertility, or been used to make jewellery by hammering metal foil over the designs.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48 (quoted); Bennett (2019), 99; V&A</ref>  About 70 have been found, many only as fragments, with a 2014 find in [[Thailand]] the first from outside the Indian subcontinent; it is assumed this was imported from India.<ref>Bennett (2019), 95</ref>\n\n== Painting ==\nWhile we can be sure of Mauryan proficiency in this field based on the descriptions of [[Megasthenes]], unfortunately no proper representative has been found to date.  Many centuries later, the paintings of the [[Ajanta Caves]], the oldest significant body of Indian painting, show there was a well-developed tradition, which may well stretch back to Mauryan times.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Lomas_Rishi_entrance.jpg|thumb|[[Lomas Rishi Cave]] in the [[Barabar Caves]], 3rd century BCE.]]\nWhile the period marked a second transition to use of brick and stone, wood was still the material of choice. [[Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]] advises the use of brick and stone for their durability. Yet he devotes a large section to safeguards to be taken against conflagrations in wooden buildings indicating their popularity.\n\n[[File:Kumhrar Maurya level ASIEC 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|Plan of the 80-columns pillared hall in [[Kumhrar]].]]\nThe Greek ambassador [[Megasthenes]] mentions that the capital city of [[Pataliputra]] was encircled by a massive timber-palisade, perforated by holes or slits through which archers could shoot. It had sixty-four gates and 570 towers.<ref>Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). ''Ancient India'', New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}}, p.281</ref> According to [[Strabo]], the gilded pillars of the palace were adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The palace stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds. It was furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs. Excavations carried out by Spooner and Waddell have brought to light remains of huge wooden palisades at [[Bulandi Bagh]] in [[Pataliputra]]. The remains of one of the buildings, an 80 pillared hall at [[Kumrahar]] are of particular significance. Out of 80 stone columns, that once stood on a wooden platform and supported a wooden roof, Spooner was able to discover the entire lower part of at least one in almost perfect conditions. It is more or less similar to an Ashokan pillar, smooth, polished and made of grey [[Chunar stone|Chunar sandstone]].<ref name=Mahajan>Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). ''Ancient India'', New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}}, p.349</ref>\n\nMany stupas like those at [[Sanchi]], [[Sarnath]] and probably [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] were originally built as brick and masonry mounds during the reign of [[Ashoka]]. Unfortunately they were renovated many times, which leaves us with hardly a clue of the original structures.\n\n== Pottery ==\nUse of the potters wheel became universal. The pottery associated with the Mauryan period consists of many types of ware. But the most highly developed technique is seen in a special type of pottery known as the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] (NBP), which was the hallmark of the preceding and early Mauryan periods.  The NBP ware is made of finely levigated alluvial clay, which when seen in section is usually of a grey and sometimes of a red hue. It has a brilliantly burnished dressing of the quality of a glaze which ranges from a jet black to a deep grey or a metallic steel blue. Occasionally small red-brown patches are apparent on the surface. It can be distinguished from other polished or graphite-coated red wares by its peculiar lustre and brilliance. \n\nThis ware was used largely for dishes and small bowls. It is found in abundance in the [[Ganges]] valley. Although NBP was not very rare, it was obviously a more expensive ware than the other varieties, since potsherds of NBP were occasionally found riveted with copper pins indicating that even a cracked vessel in NBP ware had its value.<ref name=Romila>Thapar, Romila (2001). ''{{IAST|A\u015boka}} and the Decline of the Mauryas'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564445-X}}, pp.239-49</ref>\n\n==Coins==\n[[File:MauryanCoin.JPG|thumb|Silver [[Punch marked coins|punch marked coin]] of the [[Mauryan empire]], with symbols of wheel and elephant (3rd century BCE)]]\nThe coins issued by the Mauryans are mostly silver and a few copper pieces of metal in various shapes, sizes and weights and which have one or more symbols punched on them. The most common symbols are the elephant, the tree in railing symbol and the mountain. The technique of producing such coins was generally that the metal was cut first and then the device was punched.<ref name=\"Romila\"/> These symbols are said to have either represented the Royal insignia or the symbol of the local guild that struck the coin. Some coins had ''Shroff'' ([[money changer]]) marks on them indicating that older coins were often re-issued. \n\nThe alloy content closely resembles that specified in the Arthashastra. Based on his identification of the symbols on the punch-marked coins with certain Mauryan rulers, [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|Kosambi]] argued that the Mauryan punch-marked ''[[Karshapana]]'' after Chandragupta has the same weight as its predecessor, but much more copper, cruder fabric, and such a large variation in weight that the manufacture must have been hasty. This evidence of stress and unsatisfied currency demand is accompanied by debasement (inflation) plus vanishing of the reverse marks which denoted the ancient trade guilds.<ref>Kosambi, D.D. (1988). ''The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India in Historical Outline'', New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House, {{ISBN|0-7069-4200-0}}, p.164</ref> This in his opinion indicated that there was a fiscal crisis in the later Mauryan period. However his method of analysis and the chronological identification has been questioned.<ref>Thapar, Romila (2001).

Their aim was to unify the British horological industry and trades in the face of large numbers of imports of clocks and watches from abroad. The Institute was an immediate success and within a year it had founded its own museum and library; it also began to offer evening classes in clock- and watch-making.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bhi.co.uk/about-us/history-of-the-bhi/|title=BHI History|publisher=British Horological Institute|accessdate=2019-05-22}}</ref>\n\nThe journal of the Institute is the ''Horological Journal'', which has been published monthly since September 1858. It is claimed to be the oldest continuously-published technical journal in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bhi.co.uk/hj/|title=Horological Journal|publisher=British Horological Institute|accessdate=2019-05-22}}</ref>\n\n==Upton Hall==\nThe current premises of the BHI are at [[Upton Hall]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]]. Its primary role is that of education, providing a standardised set of examinations for training horologists. It also maintains a list of members<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bhi.co.uk/repairer/|title=BHI Accredited Repairers|publisher=British Horological Institute|accessdate=2019-05-22}}</ref> whom it considers sufficiently qualified to repair [[Clock|clocks]] and [[watches]], and who adhere to a strict code of practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bhi.co.uk/code-of-practice/|title=BHI Code of Practice|publisher=British Horological Institute|accessdate=2019-05-22}}</ref>\nUpton Hall is also home to the charitable Museum of Timekeeping at the British Horological Institute, which includes the original BHI Museum and Library.\n\n==Membership==\nThe Institute offers a number of different kinds of membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bhi.co.uk/about-us/individual-members/|title=BHI Membership|publisher=British Horological Institute|accessdate=2019-05-22}}</ref> These include:\n;Associate Membership :Any individual with an interest in horology may subscribe as a member.\n;<nowiki>Accredited: Member of the BHI (MBHI)</nowiki>\n\nBHI members can gain accredited Member-level status by passing the BHI examinations at Level 4. Accredited members at this level may use the postnominals     MBHI.\n\n'''Accredited: Fellow of the BHI (FBHI)'''\n\nThe next level of BHI accreditation is Fellowship. This can be gained by passing the BHI examinations at Level 5 or by making a successful application to the BHI  based upon outstanding career achievements. Accredited members at this level may use the postnominals FBHI.\n\nCorporate membership and business partnership are also available.\n\n==Museum of Timekeeping==\n[[File:Post Office No.2 Speaking Clock.jpg|thumb|A Post Office [[speaking clock]] machine, on display at the museum]]\nThe Museum of Timekeeping is also housed at the home of the British Horological Institute.\n\nThe Museum of Timekeeping is an independent charitable Museum (Registered Charity Number 1176495), established in 1994 to hold in trust the collection and library, brought together by BHI members since its founding in 1858.\n\nThe Museum includes a collection of clocks, watches and timepieces and associated clock and watchmaking tools and ephemera. It can be visited during seasonal opening hours, plus a range of special events, or by booking a private group visit.\n\nThe Museum of Timekeeping Library is one of very few existing specialised libraries dealing primarily with horology.  It is open to researchers by appointment, and its holding includes a number of rare documents, papers, letters and books, particularly dealing with the high points of British horology in the 18th and early 19th century, but its catalogue contains comparatively few titles published in the last several decades.\n\n==BHI Gold Medal==\nThe institute's gold medal for an outstanding contribution to horology has been awarded to:\n*1928 [[Frank Watson Dyson]] - Astronomer Royal who introduced [[Greenwich Time Signal|Greenwich pips]].\n*1930 [[Charles \u00c9douard Guillaume]] - developed [[Invar]] and [[Elinvar]]\n*1931 [[William Hamilton Shortt]] (1881-1971) - noted horologist who devised the [[Shortt\u2013Synchronome clock]]\n*1946 [[Frank Hope-Jones]] (1867\u20131950) - developed electrical timekeeping, including [[Shortt-Synchronome clock|Synchronome system]]\n*1947 [[Rupert Gould]] - restored [[John Harrison]]'s [[chronometer watch|chronometer]]\n*1947 [[Warren Marrison|Warren Alvin Marrison]] - developed the [[quartz clock|quartz crystal clock]]\n*1948 [[Harold Spencer Jones]] - Astronomer Royal\n*1957 [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] - invented the [[self-winding watch|self-winding wristwatch]]\n*1981 [[George Daniels (watchmaker)|George Daniels]] - developed the [[co-axial escapement]] now used by the [[Omega SA|Omega]] watch company.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Upton Hall]] - the headquarters of the BHI.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bhi.co.uk Home page of the BHI]\n* [https://www.museumoftimekeeping.org.uk/ Museum of Timekeeping]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/nottingham/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8555000/8555958.stm BBC interview with Viscount Alan Midleton, curator of the British Horological Institute]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/nottingham/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8552000/8552500.stm BBC pictures of the British Horological Institute]\n\n{{coord|53.082672|-0.904158|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1858]]\n[[Category:Time in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Horological organizations]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Nottinghamshire]]\n[[Category:Professional associations based in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Museums in Nottinghamshire]]\n[[Category:Horological museums in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1858 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Dania.Sheldon", "label": "safe", "comment": "One sentence added to the Museum of Timekeeping section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Horological_Institute"}
