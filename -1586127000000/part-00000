It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546-547}} The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=547}}</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546}}  Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=556}}</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=548}}</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=549}}</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p= 549-550}} \n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the ''Juntong'', working together with the Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone.<ref name=FJp356>{{harvnb|Fenby|2004|p=356}}</ref><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=552}}</ref> The ''Juntong'' favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=551}}</ref> Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring hundreds of thousands of civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551/> Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In October 1938, [[Tang Shaoyi]], a former prime minister of the Republic of China who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed at his home when a ''Juntong'' assassin posing as an antique dealer used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550>\n{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=550}} </ref> As the Japanese had no idea of who the ''Juntong'' assassins were, they restored to lashing out by executing at random innocent people who had nothing to do with the assassinations.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nOn Chinese New Year (18 February 1939), four ''Juntong'' agents assassinated Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the [[Wang Jingwei]] puppet government as he paying respects to his ancestors in his mansion in the French Concession of Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Led by the ''Juntong'' ace assassin Liu Geqing, he and three others entered Chen's mansion as two of his bodyguards let them in, machine-gunned Chen down as he paying his respects before the family shrine, and then draped over his corpse a scroll reading \"Death to Collaborators! Long Live Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Fu Xiaoan, the banker and shipping tycoon who had long been an enemy of the Kuomintang and had thrown in his lot with the Japanese, becoming the collaborating mayor of Shanghai, was hacked to death with a meat chopper in his bed by his cook who was secretly a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In 1939, a banquet to celebrate the friendship between Japan and the [[Wang Jingwei]] regime attended by senior Japanese officers and Chinese collaborators in Shanghai were ruined when the cooks, many of whom were working for the ''Juntong'' poisoned the food, and only prompt medical attention that required pumping the stomachs of the guests prevented hundreds of deaths.<ref name=FJp357>{{harvnb|Fenby|2004|p=357}}</ref> Later in 1939, a train that carrying various Japanese officers and officials of the Wang Jingwei regime from Shanghai to Nanking for a ceremony marking a new treaty that was meant to cement Wang's regime in its place in the \"New Order in Asia\" was blown up by ''Juntong'' agents, killing 74 and wounding hundreds more.<ref name=FJp357/>\n\nThe chief enemy of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai were not the Japanese, most of whom did not speak Mandarin and even those who did speak Mandarin did so with a Japanese accent that betrayed where they were from, but rather the secret service loyal to the Wang regime that was based in the Huxi \"badlands\" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected over to the ''Juntong'' before going over to the Japanese.<ref name=FJp357/><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's \"Little Tokyo\" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of \"a gang of local thugs and bullies\" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the \"muscle\" for the No. 76 organization.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=553}}</ref> Li boosted in a speech \"With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nAs both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese;

On Christmas Eve 1939, Chen Mingchu, a former ''Juntong'' agent who had joined the No. 76 organization was assassinated by the ''Juntong'' agents at the Huierdeng nightclub in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> Chen and his twenty bodyguards were celebrating Christmas on the floor of the nightclub when a group of ''Juntong'' agents armed with machine-guns burst in to gun down Chen and his bodyguards.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> On 8 September 1940, Zhou Guangshi, the chief of ''Juntong'' operations in occupied China was captured by the ''Kempeital'' who tortured and executed him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> By late 1941, most of the ''Juntong'' agents operating in the major cities occupied by Japan were either killed or captured.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nVarious \"guerrilla command\" and \"traffic police\" groups under the NBIS carried out a wide range of covert espionage and counterintelligence activities against the Japanese and Japanese collaborators. In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3, 000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 111.</ref> Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: \"If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents\".<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 pages 111-112.</ref> The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] to contact the [[Dalai Lama]] as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.<ref name=PNATp112>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 112.</ref> China which regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China, greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.<ref name=PNATp112/> From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.\n\n=== Chinese Civil War period ===\nIn August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5c40}}). [[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.\n\n=== After 1949 in mainland China ===\nAfter Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment.

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48,

Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 546</ref> Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair:

agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese

Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref

ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 549-550</ref>\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel.

[[Nonbuilding structure|Non-building structures]], such as [[tower]]s, are not included in this list (see [[list of tallest buildings and structures]]).\n\nHistorically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids]] of Giza in [[Egypt]], which held the position for over 3,800 years until the construction of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] in England in 1311. Until the completion of the [[Washington Monument]] in 1884 the world's tallest buildings were churches and cathedrals, Christian places of worship, in Europe. The early skyscraper was pioneered in [[Chicago]], forming the basis for which the United States would hold the position of the world's tallest building for much of the 20th century until 1998, when the [[Petronas Towers]] were completed. Since then only two more buildings have held the title: [[Taipei 101]] and [[Burj Khalifa]].\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, [[Western Asia]], [[China]], and [[Southeast Asia]] has had a boom in skyscraper construction.\n\n== Ranking criteria and alternatives ==\nThe international non-profit organization [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \"The World's Tallest Building\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world.<ref name=\"CTBUH top 100\">{{cite web |url=http://skyscrapercenter.com/buildings |title=100 tallest completed buildings in the world |publisher=[[CTBUH]] |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref> The organization currently ranks [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai as the tallest at {{cvt|828|m|ft|0}}.{{r|CTBUH top 100}} However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.\n\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the [[Petronas Towers]] or the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] was taller,<ref name=PetronasSears>{{cite web |author1=Lynn S.

The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers' lower roofs and lower highest point.\n\nUntil 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae. This led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the [[Chrysler Building]]. The [[40 Wall Street|Bank of Manhattan Building]] (i.e. 40 Wall Street) employed only a short spire and was {{cvt|282.5|m|ft}} tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large {{cvt|38.1|m|ft}} spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of {{cvt|318.9|m|ft}}, although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.\n\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, [[Shreve, Lamb & Harmon|Shreve & Lamb]], the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor, at {{cvt|255|m|ft}}. They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly {{cvt|30|m|ft}} above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Binder |first1=Georges |title=101 of the world's tallest buildings |date=August 2006 |publisher=Images Pub. |isbn=978-1864701739 |page=102}}</ref>\n\nAt present, the Burj Khalifa tops the list by some margin, regardless of which criterion is applied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/Journal/InNumbers/TBINVanityHeight/tabid/5837/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=Tall Buildings In Numbers Vanity Height |publisher=Ctbuh.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117120309/http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/Journal/InNumbers/TBINVanityHeight/tabid/5837/language/en-US/Default.aspx |archive-date=2013-11-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/design/2013/09/most-worlds-tallest-buildings-game-system-vanity-height/6822/ |title=Most of the World's Tallest Buildings Game the System With 'Vanity Height' - Jenny Xie |publisher=The Atlantic Cities |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref>\n\n== Tallest buildings in the world ==\n<!--   ************************************************************************\n       *                            EDITING NOTES                             *\n       *                                                                      *\n       * 1.

measurements ==\n\n=== Height to pinnacle (highest point) ===\n[[File:Tallest Buildings in the World by pinnacle height.png|thumb|400px|Tallest buildings by pinnacle height, including all masts, poles, antennae, etc. in 2014]]\nThis measurement disregards distinctions between architectural and non-architectural extensions, and simply measures to the highest point. This measurement is useful for [[air traffic obstacle]] determinations, and is also a wholly objective measure. However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.\n\nThis measurement only recently came into use, when the [[Petronas Towers]] passed the Sears Tower (now named [[Willis Tower]]) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter's antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.\n\nIf the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers were still standing today they would occupy numbers 12 (North Tower at {{cvt|526.7|m|ft}})<ref>{{ctbuh|id=200|title=One World Trade Center}}</ref> and 37 on the list (or 11 and 36, for it can be assumed the rebuilt One World Trade Center would have never been built).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|align=center style=\"background-color:#9FC\"|\u2020\n|Denotes building with pinnacle height higher than architectural\n|}\n{{row indexer|<nowiki>{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background: #ececec;\"\n!

[[Nonbuilding structure|Non-building structures]], such as [[tower]]s, are not included in this list (see [[list of tallest buildings and structures]]).\n\nHistorically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids]] of Giza in [[Egypt]], which held the position for over 3,800 years until the construction of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] in England in 1311. Until the completion of the [[Washington Monument]] in 1884 the world's tallest buildings were churches and cathedrals, Christian places of worship, in Europe. The early skyscraper was pioneered in [[Chicago]], forming the basis for which the United States would hold the position of the world's tallest building for much of the 20th century until 1998, when the [[Petronas Towers]] were completed. Since then only two more buildings have held the title: [[Taipei 101]] and [[Burj Khalifa]].\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, [[Western Asia]], [[China]], as well as [[Southeast Asia]] have seen a boom in skyscraper construction.\n\n== Ranking criteria and alternatives ==\nThe international non-profit organization [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \"The World's Tallest Building\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world.<ref name=\"CTBUH top 100\">{{cite web |url=http://skyscrapercenter.com/buildings |title=100 tallest completed buildings in the world |publisher=[[CTBUH]] |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref> The organization currently ranks [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai as the tallest at {{cvt|828|m|ft|0}}.{{r|CTBUH top 100}} However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.\n\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the [[Petronas Towers]] or the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] was taller,<ref name=PetronasSears>{{cite web |author1=Lynn S.

The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers' lower roofs and lower highest point.\n\nUntil 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae. This led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the [[Chrysler Building]]. The [[40 Wall Street|Bank of Manhattan Building]] (i.e. 40 Wall Street) employed only a short spire and was {{cvt|282.5|m|ft}} tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large {{cvt|38.1|m|ft}} spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of {{cvt|318.9|m|ft}}, although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.\n\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, [[Shreve, Lamb & Harmon|Shreve & Lamb]], the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor, at {{cvt|255|m|ft}}. They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly {{cvt|30|m|ft}} above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Binder |first1=Georges |title=101 of the world's tallest buildings |date=August 2006 |publisher=Images Pub. |isbn=978-1864701739 |page=102}}</ref>\n\nAt present, the Burj Khalifa tops the list by some margin, regardless of which criterion is applied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/Journal/InNumbers/TBINVanityHeight/tabid/5837/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=Tall Buildings In Numbers Vanity Height |publisher=Ctbuh.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117120309/http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/Journal/InNumbers/TBINVanityHeight/tabid/5837/language/en-US/Default.aspx |archive-date=2013-11-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/design/2013/09/most-worlds-tallest-buildings-game-system-vanity-height/6822/ |title=Most of the World's Tallest Buildings Game the System With 'Vanity Height' - Jenny Xie |publisher=The Atlantic Cities |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref>\n\n== Tallest buildings in the world ==\n<!--   ************************************************************************\n       *                            EDITING NOTES                             *\n       *                                                                      *\n       * 1.

measurements ==\n\n=== Height to pinnacle (highest point) ===\n[[File:Tallest Buildings in the World by pinnacle height.png|thumb|400px|Tallest buildings by pinnacle height, including all masts, poles, antennae, etc. in 2014]]\nThis measurement disregards distinctions between architectural and non-architectural extensions, and simply measures to the highest point. This measurement is useful for [[air traffic obstacle]] determinations, and is also a wholly objective measure. However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.\n\nThis measurement only recently came into use, when the [[Petronas Towers]] passed the Sears Tower (now named [[Willis Tower]]) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter's antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.\n\nIf the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers were still standing today they would occupy numbers 12 (North Tower at {{cvt|526.7|m|ft}})<ref>{{ctbuh|id=200|title=One World Trade Center}}</ref> and 37 on the list (or 11 and 36, for it can be assumed the rebuilt One World Trade Center would have never been built).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|align=center style=\"background-color:#9FC\"|\u2020\n|Denotes building with pinnacle height higher than architectural\n|}\n{{row indexer|<nowiki>{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background: #ececec;\"\n!

The suburb comprises a [[seaport]], industrial complex (one of the largest in Australia), a small harbour foreshore [[nature reserve]], and a small commercial sector. It is situated on the tip of [[Red Point (Port Kembla)|Red Point]], first European sighting by Captain [[James Cook]] in 1770. The name \"Kembla\" is [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning \"plenty [of] wild fowl\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55185386 |title=PLACE NAMES. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=13 May 1964 |accessdate=22 February 2011 |page=61 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBefore Port Kembla was an [[industrial suburb]] of Wollongong, it was a town with a remarkably self-sufficient society, a growing commercial centre, and a vibrant civic life. Town subdivision began in 1908, and by 1921 there were 1622 residents.<ref>Commonwealth Census of Australia, 1921</ref> Economic expansion propelled further population growth. Port Kembla derives its name from its proximity to [[Mount Kembla]].\n\n===Industrial change===\nA copper smelter and refinery, the Electrolytic Refinery and Smelting Company of Australia, began production in 1908, followed by the opening of Metal Manufactures in 1917 and finally the arrival of the Hoskins Iron and Steel Works in 1927. The works became Australian Iron and Steel the following year.\n\nBy 1947 the town's population had increased to 4,960 with smaller satellite suburbs such as Cringila and Lake Heights, mushrooming on its fringes.<ref>Commonwealth Census of Australia, 1947</ref> That year, 1947,  marked the climax of a local campaign for municipal autonomy which was ultimately thwarted by the creation of a Greater City of Wollongong. In the post-Second World War period there was an inexorable decline of a 'Port Kembla' society as local town boundaries were slowly but surely absorbed into a more Wollongong-focused or regional identity.<ref>See Erik Eklund, Steel Town: the making and breaking of Port Kembla, pp.131-136</ref>\n\n===Cultural diversity===\nDespite the decline from the heyday of the 1920s, the town experienced major social and demographic change in the 1950s and 1960s. Waves of migrants, mostly from the United Kingdom, Italy, Macedonia and Germany, moved to the town. During this period, Port Kembla was on the cusp of changes affecting Australian society generally as new ethnic and cultural influences found a place in local society.<ref>Erik Eklund, Steel Town: the making and breaking of Port Kembla, pp. 158-171</ref> With its long migration history accommodating waves of migrant workers and their families, Port Kembla is still one of the most culturally diverse suburbs in New South Wales.\n\n===Hill 60===\nPort Kembla's highest point, Hill 60, overlooks the [[Five Islands Nature Reserve|Five Islands]] and Red Point. Hill 60, originally the site of an Aboriginal settlement, was used by the army during World War II to make a coastal gun emplacement known as [[Illowra Battery]]. In September 1942, Aboriginal inhabitants were forcibly evicted from the area.<ref>See Erik Eklund, 'Steel Town: the making and breaking of Port Kembla', MUP, Melbourne, 2002, pp. 114-130</ref> It has remained in the army's ownership and is now a public lookout reserve, despite a vigorous campaign to return some of the land to its Aboriginal owners. Although not technically open to tourists, the tunnels are open, and can be explored by foot. The entrance to the tunnels is located almost under the coastguard tower on Hill 60, and can be seen down the left when standing at the information board, facing southeast.<ref>[http://www.michaelorgan.org.au/hill60.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120101604/http://www.michaelorgan.org.au/hill60.htm |date=20 November 2009 }}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Illowra Battery 1944 AWM 081445.jpeg|Dated: 1944 No. 2 gun [[Illowra Battery]], Showing its original [[BL 6 inch Mk XI naval gun|BL 6 inch Mk XI gun]]\nFile:Illowra battery aka hill 60.jpg|Gun position No. 2 at [[Illowra Battery]], which formed part of the Kembla Fortress defences in World War II\n</gallery>\n\n===HMAS Adele loss===\nOn 7 May 1943, [[Australian steamer Adele]] struck the breakwater at Port Kembla and was subsequently declared a total loss.<ref name=NSW>{{cite web |url=http://oceans1.customer.netspace.net.au/nsw-main.html |title=NEW SOUTH WALES SHIPWRECKS |publisher=Encyclopedia of Australian Shipwrecks |accessdate=10 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002083826/http://oceans1.customer.netspace.net.au/nsw-main.html |archivedate=2 October 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The wreck of ''Adele'' is protected under the New South Wales Heritage Act, 1977.<ref name=Wreck>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?55205 |title=Adele (+1943) |publisher=Wrecksite |accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Union Protests ===\nPort Kembla was the site of the [[Dalfram dispute of 1938|Dalfram Dispute in 1938]], where unionised dockworkers refused to load pig iron onto a ship heading for Japan after the [[Nanjing Massacre|Nanking Massacre]].

Port Kembla Primary School was once located adjacent to it but was closed down due to pollution problems from the chimney including lead contaminated soil, [[acid rain]] and soot. A warning alarm was fitted to warn of high toxin levels. In November 2008, the Port Kembla stack was inspected and confirmed to have [[concrete cancer]].<ref>''[[Illawarra Mercury]]'', 26 November 2008.</ref> The stack was planned to be demolished in early 2010 at a cost of A$10 million.\n\nBy 6 September 2010, plans to knock down the stack had been revised by the NSW Department of Planning. These plans included demolition of the existing Port Kembla Copper structures surrounding the chimney, excluding the locally heritage listed Precious Metals Mill Chimney and the Assay Offices. The work was due to start in the middle of 2011 with a team of 30 workers, under supervision by NSW Police, NSW WorkCover and relevant emergency services at a cost of A$8 million with an expected time frame of 16 months.<ref>http://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/DesktopModules/MediaCentre/getdocument.aspx?mid=449</ref>\n\nOn 2 August 2013, it was announced that the stack would be demolished on Friday 6 September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Humphries |first=Glen |url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/1678338/demolition-day-named-for-port-kembla-stack/ |title=Demolition day named for Port Kembla stack |publisher=Illawarra Mercury |date=2013-08-02 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> Due to asbestos concerns, the demolition was delayed.

The suburb comprises a [[seaport]], industrial complex (one of the largest in Australia), a small harbour foreshore [[nature reserve]], and a small commercial sector. It is situated on the tip of [[Red Point (Port Kembla)|Red Point]], first European sighting by Captain [[James Cook]] in 1770. The name \"Kembla\" is [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning \"plenty [of] wild fowl\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55185386 |title=PLACE NAMES. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=13 May 1964 |accessdate=22 February 2011 |page=61 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBefore Port Kembla was an [[industrial suburb]] of Wollongong, it was a town with a remarkably self-sufficient society, a growing commercial centre, and a vibrant civic life. Town subdivision began in 1908, and by 1921 there were 1622 residents.<ref>Commonwealth Census of Australia, 1921</ref> Economic expansion propelled further population growth. Port Kembla derives its name from its proximity to [[Mount Kembla]].\n\n===Industrial change===\nA copper smelter and refinery, the Electrolytic Refinery and Smelting Company of Australia, began production in 1908, followed by the opening of Metal Manufactures in 1917 and finally the arrival of the Hoskins Iron and Steel Works in 1927. The works became Australian Iron and Steel the following year.\n\nBy 1947 the town's population has increased to 4,960 with smaller satellite suburbs such as Cringila and Lake Heights, mushrooming on its fringes.<ref>Commonwealth Census of Australia, 1947</ref> That year, 1947,  marked the climax of a local campaign for municipal autonomy which was ultimately thwarted by the creation of a Greater City of Wollongong. In the post-Second World War period there was an inexorable decline of a 'Port Kembla' society as local town boundaries were slowly but surely absorbed into a more Wollongong-focused or regional identity.<ref>See Erik Eklund, Steel Town: the making and breaking of Port Kembla, pp.131-136</ref>\n\n===Cultural diversity===\nDespite the decline from the heyday of the 1920s, the town experienced major social and demographic change in the 1950s and 1960s. Waves of migrants, mostly from the United Kingdom, Italy, Macedonia and Germany, moved to the town. During this period, Port Kembla was on the cusp of changes affecting Australian society generally as new ethnic and cultural influences found a place in local society.<ref>Erik Eklund, Steel Town: the making and breaking of Port Kembla, pp. 158-171</ref> With its long migration history accommodating waves of migrant workers and their families, Port Kembla is still one of the most culturally diverse suburbs in New South Wales.\n\n===Hill 60===\nPort Kembla's highest point, Hill 60, overlooks the [[Five Islands Nature Reserve|Five Islands]] and Red Point. Hill 60, originally the site of an Aboriginal settlement, was used by the army during World War II to make a coastal gun emplacement known as [[Illowra Battery]]. In September 1942, Aboriginal inhabitants were forcibly evicted from the area.<ref>See Erik Eklund, 'Steel Town: the making and breaking of Port Kembla', MUP, Melbourne, 2002, pp. 114-130</ref> It has remained in the army's ownership and is now a public lookout reserve, despite a vigorous campaign to return some of the land to its Aboriginal owners. Although not technically open to tourists, the tunnels are open, and can be explored by foot. The entrance to the tunnels is located almost under the coastguard tower on Hill 60, and can be seen down the left when standing at the information board, facing southeast.<ref>[http://www.michaelorgan.org.au/hill60.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120101604/http://www.michaelorgan.org.au/hill60.htm |date=20 November 2009 }}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Illowra Battery 1944 AWM 081445.jpeg|Dated: 1944 No. 2 gun [[Illowra Battery]], Showing its original [[BL 6 inch Mk XI naval gun|BL 6 inch Mk XI gun]]\nFile:Illowra battery aka hill 60.jpg|Gun position No. 2 at [[Illowra Battery]], which formed part of the Kembla Fortress defences in World War II\n</gallery>\n\n===HMAS Adele loss===\nOn 7 May 1943, [[Australian steamer Adele]] struck the breakwater at Port Kembla and was subsequently declared a total loss.<ref name=NSW>{{cite web |url=http://oceans1.customer.netspace.net.au/nsw-main.html |title=NEW SOUTH WALES SHIPWRECKS |publisher=Encyclopedia of Australian Shipwrecks |accessdate=10 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002083826/http://oceans1.customer.netspace.net.au/nsw-main.html |archivedate=2 October 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The wreck of ''Adele'' is protected under the New South Wales Heritage Act, 1977.<ref name=Wreck>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?55205 |title=Adele (+1943) |publisher=Wrecksite |accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Union Protests ===\nPort Kembla was the site of the [[Dalfram dispute of 1938|Dalfram Dispute in 1938]], where unionised dockworkers refused to load pig iron onto a ship heading for Japan after the [[Nanjing Massacre|Nanking Massacre]].

He was raised in the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|borough of Greenwich]] (Thamesmead), where he began [[performing arts]] at an early age of 8, meanwhile writing songs in his spare time. Fahd eventually focused on music & acting from he's a long-existing list of talents such as dancing, singing, sprinting and basketball. Before engaging in music, his primary school appointed him to weekly trumpet lessons. After a prolonged trip to [[Liverpool]], Fahd's family relocated to the county of [[Greater Manchester]] in a town called [[Wythenshawe]].\n\nKing-Fahd attended St Mary's, a catholic [[Independent school|private school]] in Ibn, and, later, Linton Mead Primary School in [[Thamesmead]]. Following the move to [[Manchester]], he transferred from The Halley Academy ([[The Halley Academy|Corelli College)]] to [[Manchester Enterprise Academy]], where he studies sports, musical theatre and business, while also representing his school in all school plays and few basketball & football games.\n\n==Music Career==\nFahd made his debut appearance on an [[Instagram]] freestyle called 'Run the streets down'. After reaching a respectable point of his old channel, Fahd made a new brand channel focusing on all his musical content. Fahd was expected to release a debut [[freestyle]] throughout 2019 \u2018Original Ends (0EnDs)\u2019 as he explained but instead released 2 [[Single (music)|singles]] on he\u2019s YouTube channel. A Christmas special \u2018Wishlist\u2019 and own version of SJ\u2019s \u2018Youngest In Charge\u2019 which both did well in terms of views but in terms of positive feedback, not so well. Shortly the singles were unavailable, deleted. His rebranded himself, changing his professional name from FahdHilfiger to Fahd. Fahd's debut single 'Left on read' blew up around his local area back in [[Wythenshawe]], where he gained attention for the [[Manchester|Mancunian]] youths, talent pages and young stars. 'Left on read' was a very controversial single, some saying it was good for a debut single, some claiming it's too repetitive and annoyingly catchy. The \u2018Left On Read\u2019 meme cooled down mid-February, currently looking to release a debut [[Extended play|EP]] before August 2020.\n\nEarly April Fahd's classmate and peer in [[drill music]] Dxxgz aimed at a rapper in he's [[KSI (entertainer)|Ksi]] #poppinchallenge verse saying, 'You can't rap', 'You man are a couple of p***ks' and 'You chat on snap'.

Standing on the east bank of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]], it looks across to the low hills between the Derwent and [[River Wye, Derbyshire|Wye]] valleys. The house is set in expansive parkland and backed by wooded, rocky hills rising to heather moorland. It contains major collections of paintings, furniture, [[Old Master]] drawings, [[neoclassical sculpture]]s, books and other artefacts.

They enclosed the first park at Chatsworth and built a house on the high ground in what is now the south-eastern part of the garden. In 1549 they sold all their property in the area to Sir [[William Cavendish (courtier)|William Cavendish]], [[Treasurer of the Chamber|Treasurer of the King's Chamber]] and the husband of [[Bess of Hardwick]], who had persuaded him to sell his property in Suffolk and settle in her native county.\n\nBess began to build the new house in 1553. She selected a site near the river, which was drained by digging a series of reservoirs, which doubled as fish ponds. Sir William died in 1557, but Bess finished the house in the 1560s and lived there with her fourth husband, [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]]. In 1568 Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and brought his prisoner to Chatsworth several times from 1570 onwards. She lodged in the apartment now known as the Queen of Scots rooms, on the top floor above the great hall, which faces onto the inner courtyard. An accomplished [[needlework|needlewoman]], Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the [[Oxburgh Hangings]].<ref name=\"Digby\">{{Cite book |last=Digby |first=George Wingfield |date=1964 |title=Elizabethan Embroidery |publisher=Thomas Yoseloff |pages=58\u201363 |asin=B0042KP67G}}</ref> Bess died in 1608 and Chatsworth was passed to her eldest son, [[Henry Cavendish (politician)|Henry]]. The estate was purchased from Henry by his brother [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire]], for \u00a310,000.\n\n===17th century===\n[[File:Birdseye view of Chatsworth in 1699.jpg|thumb|This engraving by [[Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff|Kip and Knyff]] shows Chatsworth part way through the 1st Duke's alterations.

The baroque garden has been laid out, but only the first, smaller version of the Cascade has been built, and the Canal Pond has not been dug. The 1st Duke's stables are to the left of the house]]\nFew changes were made at Chatsworth until the mid-17th century. [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire]] was a staunch Royalist and expelled from the House of Lords in 1642. He left England for the safety of the continent and his estates were sequestrated.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{Cite DNB |wstitle=Cavendish, William (1617-1684)}}</ref> Chatsworth was occupied by both sides during the Civil War, and the 3rd Earl did not return to the house until the restoration of the monarchy. He reconstructed the principal rooms in an attempt to make them more comfortable, but the Elizabethan house was outdated and unsafe.\n\nThe [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|4th Earl of Devonshire]], who was to become the 1st Duke in 1694 for helping to put William of Orange on the English throne, was an advanced [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and forced to retire to Chatsworth during the reign of [[James II of England|King James II]]. This called for a rebuilding of the house, which began in 1687. Cavendish initially planned to reconstruct only the south wing with the State Apartments, and so he decided to retain the Elizabethan courtyard plan, though this layout was becoming increasingly unfashionable. He enjoyed building and reconstructed the East Front, which included the Painted Hall and Long Gallery, followed by the West Front from 1699 to 1702. The North Front was completed in 1707 just before he died. The 1st Duke also had large [[parterre]] gardens designed by [[George London (landscape architect)|George London]] and [[Henry Wise (gardener)|Henry Wise]], who was later appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] as Royal Gardner at [[Kensington Palace]].\n\nIn 1774, [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]], married [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Georgiana Spencer]] famous as a socialite who gathered around her a large circle of literary and political friends. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds would paint her; the Gainsborough painting would be disposed of by the 5th Duke and be recovered much later, after many vicissitudes. Georgiana was the great-great-great-great aunt of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. Their lives, centuries apart, have been compared in tragedy.[3] The movie [[The Duchess (film)]] portrayed their life together.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:ChatsworthMarlow.JPG|thumb|This late 18th-century oil painting by William Marlow emphasises the [[Romanticism|romantic]] aspect of Chatsworth's setting on the edge of the [[Peak District]]]]\n[[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire]], and [[William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire]], made no changes to the house and gardens, but both contributed greatly to the collection found at Chatsworth to this date. Connoisseur of the arts the collection include paintings, Old Master drawings and prints, ancient coins and carved Greek and Roman sculptures. Palladian furniture designed by [[William Kent]] was commissioned by the 3rd Duke when he had [[Devonshire House]] in London rebuilt following a fire in 1733. Upon the sale and demolition of Devonshire House in 1924 the furniture was transferred to Chatsworth.\n\nThe 4th Duke made great changes to the house and gardens. He decided the approach to the house should be from the west and had the old stables and offices as well as parts of Edensor village pulled down so they were not visible from the house. He also replaced the 1st Duke's formal gardens with a more natural look, designed by Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown, which he helped bring into fashion.\n\nIn 1748, the 4th Duke married [[Charlotte Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Lady Charlotte Boyle]], the sole surviving heiress of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]]. Lord Burlington was an accomplished architect in his own right with many works to his name including [[Chiswick House]]. With his death, his important collection of architectural drawings and Inigo Jones masque designs, Old Master paintings and William Kent designed furniture were transferred to the Dukes of Devonshire. This inheritance also brought many estates to the family.\n\n===19th century===\nThe [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke]] (known as 'the Bachelor Duke') was a passionate traveller, builder, gardener and collector who transformed Chatsworth. In 1811 he inherited the title and eight major estates; Chatsworth and [[Hardwick Hall]] in Derbyshire, Devonshire House, [[Burlington House]] and [[Chiswick House]] in London, [[Bolton Abbey]] and [[Londesborough Hall]] in Yorkshire, and [[Lismore Castle]] in Ireland. These estates covered {{convert|200000|acre|km2}} of land in England and Ireland.\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Dining room.jpg|thumb|left|The 6th Duke's dining room]]\nThe Duke was a great collector especially of sculpture and books. When he built the North Wing to the designs of [[Sir Jeffry Wyatville]], it included a purpose built Sculpture Gallery to house his collection, and he repurposed several rooms in the house to contain the entire libraries he would purchase at auction. The 6th Duke loved to entertain, and the early 19th century saw a rise in popularity of country house parties. In addition to a sculpture gallery, the new north wing housed an orangery, a theatre, a Turkish bath, a dairy, a vast new kitchen and numerous servants rooms. In 1830 the Duke increased the guest accommodation  by converting suites of rooms into individual guest bedrooms. People invited to stay at Chatsworth spent their days hunting, riding, reading and playing billiards. In the evening formal dinners would take place, followed by music, charades and billiards or conversation in the smoking room for the men. Women would return to their bedroom many times during the day to change their outfits. The guest bedrooms on the east front at Chatsworth are the most complete set of bedrooms from the period to survive with their original furnishings.<ref name=\"yourguide\"/>{{rp|52}} There is much eastern influence in the decoration including hand-painted Chinese wallpapers and fabrics which are typical of Regency taste, which developed during the reign of [[George IV]] (1762\u20131830). People who have stayed at Chatsworth include [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Charles Dickens]].\n\n[[File:Chatsworth from Morris's Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen (1880).JPG|thumb|A view of Chatsworth from the south-west circa 1880. The stables can be seen behind the house and the Hunting Tower is visible in Stand Wood]]\nIn October 1832, Princess Victoria (later Queen Victoria) and her mother, the [[Viktoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], visited Chatsworth where she had her first formal adult dinner, at the age of 13, in the new dining room. The 6th Duke had another opportunity to welcome Victoria in 1843 when the Queen and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] returned to be entertained by a large array of illuminated fountains. The Duke spent 47 years transforming the house and gardens. A [[Latin]] inscription over the fireplace in the Painted Hall translates as, \"William Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, inherited this most beautiful house from his father in the year 1811, which had been begun in the year of English liberty 1688, and completed it in the year of his bereavement 1840\". 1688 was the year of the [[Glorious Revolution]], supported by the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dynasties including the Cavendishes. The year 1840 saw the death of the Duke's beloved niece Blanche, who was married to his heir, the future [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th Duke]]. In 1844 he published a book called ''Handbook to Chatsworth and Hardwick''.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, a colour postcard sent from Liverpool to Navsari, India in 1913.jpg|thumbnail|Chatsworth, c. 1913.]]\nIn the early 20th century social change and taxes began to affect the Devonshires' lifestyle. When the [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|8th Duke]] died in 1908 over \u00a3500,000 of death duties became due. This was a small charge compared to what followed forty-two years later, but the estate was already burdened with debt from the 6th Duke's extravagances, the failure of the 7th Duke's business ventures at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], and the depression in British agriculture that had been apparent since the 1870s. In 1912 the family sold 25 books printed by [[William Caxton]] and a collection of 1,347 volumes of plays acquired by the 6th Duke, including four [[Shakespeare]] [[Folio (printing)|folios]] and 39 Shakespeare [[quarto]]s, to the [[Huntington Library]] in California. Tens of thousands of acres of land in [[Somerset]], [[Sussex]] and Derbyshire were also sold during, and immediately after, World War I.\n\nIn December 1904, [[Carlos I of Portugal|King Charles I of Portugal]] and [[Am\u00e9lie of Orl\u00e9ans|Queen Maria Am\u00e9lia]] stayed at Chatsworth House during their visit to [[Great Britain]]. It snowed almost constantly while they were there, and the King reportedly started a [[snowball fight]] (in which the assembled ladies enthusiastically joined) when he met the [[Lu\u00eds Pinto de Soveral, 1st Marquis of Soveral|Marquis of Soveral]], the Portuguese [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the [[Court of St James's]].<ref>{{Cite journal |editor-last=Chaves |editor-first=Jos\u00e9 Joubert |date=5 December 1904 |title=Viagem Real&nbsp;\u2014 Os Reis de Portugal Sob a Nevada em Chatsworth |trans-title=Royal Trip&nbsp;\u2014 The King and Queen of Portugal under the Snow in Chatsworth |url=http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/IlustracaoPort/1904/N57/N57_item1/P7.html |language=Portuguese |journal=Illustra\u00e7\u00e3o Portugueza |location=Lisbon |accessdate=7 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035903/http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/IlustracaoPort/1904/N57/N57_item1/P7.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the family's London mansion, Devonshire House, which occupied a {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on [[Piccadilly]], was sold to developers and demolished. Much of the contents of Devonshire House was moved to Chatsworth and a much smaller house at 2 Carlton Gardens near [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] was acquired. The Great [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]] in the garden at Chatsworth was demolished as it needed 10 men to run it, huge quantities of coal to heat it, and all the plants had died during the war when no coal had been available for non-essential purposes. To further reduce running costs, there was also talk of pulling down the 6th Duke's north wing, which was then regarded as having no aesthetic or historical value, but nothing came of it. Chiswick House\u2014the celebrated [[Palladian]] villa in the suburbs of West London that the Devonshires inherited when the [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|4th Duke]] married [[Lord Burlington]]'s daughter\u2014was sold to [[Brentford]] Council in 1929.\n\nNonetheless, life at Chatsworth continued much as before. The household was run by a [[comptroller]] and domestic staff were still available, although more so in the country than in the cities. The staff at Chatsworth at this time consisted of a butler, under butler, groom of the chambers, valet, three footmen, a housekeeper, the Duchess's maid, 11 housemaids, two sewing women, a cook, two kitchen maids, a vegetable maid, two or three scullery maids, two stillroom maids, a dairy maid, six laundry maids and the Duchess's secretary. All of these 38 or 39 people lived in the house. Daily staff included the odd man, upholsterer, scullery-maid, two scrubbing women, laundry porter, steam boiler man, coal man, two porter's lodge attendants, two night firemen, night porter, two window cleaners, and a team of joiners, plumbers and electricians. The Clerk of Works supervised the maintenance of the house and other properties on the estate. There were also grooms, chauffeurs and gamekeepers. The number of garden staff was somewhere between the 80 of the 6th Duke's time and the 20 or so of the early 21st century. There was also a librarian, Francis Thompson, who wrote the first book-length account of Chatsworth since the 6th Duke's handbook.\n\nMost of the UK's country houses were put to institutional use during World War II. Some of those used as barracks were badly damaged, but the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th Duke]], anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, arranged for Chatsworth to be occupied by [[Rydal Penrhos|Penrhos College]], a girls' [[Public School (UK)|public school]] in [[Colwyn Bay]], Wales. The contents of the house were packed away in 11 days and, in September 1939, 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.\n\nIn May 1944 [[Kathleen Kennedy Cavendish|Kathleen Kennedy]], sister of [[John F. Kennedy]], married [[William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington|William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington]], the elder son of the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th Duke of Devonshire]]. However, he was killed in action in Belgium in September 1944, and Kathleen died in a plane crash in 1948. His younger brother Andrew became the [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th Duke]] in 1950. He was married to [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah Mitford]], one of the [[Mitford family|Mitford girls]] and sister to [[Nancy Mitford]], [[Diana Mitford]], [[Pamela Mitford]], [[Unity Mitford]] and [[Jessica Mitford]]\n\n[[File:Chatsworth Cascade.jpg|thumb|Chatsworth House viewed from the top of the Cascade]]\nThe modern history of Chatsworth begins in 1950. The family had not yet moved back after the war and, although the 10th Duke had transferred his assets to his son during his lifetime in the hope of avoiding [[death duties]], he died a few weeks too early for the lifetime exemption to apply, and tax was charged at 80% on the whole estate. The amount due was \u00a37&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|7000000|1950|r=-4}}}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}. Some of the family's advisors considered the situation to be irretrievable, and there was a proposal to transfer Chatsworth to the nation as a [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] of [[Northern England]]. Instead, the Duke decided to retain his family's home if he could. He sold tens of thousands of acres of land, transferred Hardwick Hall to the National Trust in lieu of tax, and sold some major works of art from Chatsworth. The family's Sussex house, Compton Place was lent to a school. The effect of the death duties was mitigated to some extent by the historically low value of art during the post-war years and the increase in land values, subsequent to 1950, during the post-war agricultural revival, and, on the face of it, the losses were considerably less than 80% in terms of physical assets. In Derbyshire {{convert|35000|acre|km2}} were retained out of {{convert|83000|acre|km2}}. The Bolton Abbey estate in Yorkshire and the Lismore Castle estate in Ireland remained in the family. Nonetheless, it took 17 years to complete negotiations with the [[Inland Revenue]], interest being due in the meantime. The Chatsworth Estate is now managed by the Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, which was established in 1946.\n[[File:View of Chatsworth House, England.jpg|thumb|left|A modern view of the house]]\nThe 10th Duke was pessimistic about the future of houses like Chatsworth, and made no plans to move back in after the war. After Penrhos College left in 1945 the only people who slept in the house were two housemaids, but over the winter of 1948\u201349 the house was cleaned and tidied for reopening to the public by two Hungarian women who had been Kathleen Kennedy's cook and housemaid in London and a team of their compatriots. The house was Grade I listed in 1951, following the passing of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]].<ref name=\"NHLE1373871\" />\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th Duke]] and Duchess began to think about moving into the house. The pre-war house had relied entirely on a large staff for its comforts, and lacked modern facilities. The building was rewired, the plumbing and heating were overhauled, and six self-contained staff flats were created to replace the small staff bedrooms and communal servants' hall. Including those in the staff flats, 17 bathrooms were added to the existing handful. The 6th Duke's cavernous kitchen was abandoned and a new one was created closer to the family dining room. The family rooms were repainted, carpets were brought out of store, and curtains were repaired or replaced. The Duke and Duchess and their three children moved across the park from Edensor House in 1959.\n\nIn 1981, the trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, owners of the house, created a new charitable trust, The Chatsworth House Trust. The intention was to preserve the house and its setting for \"the benefit of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.peakdistrictonline.co.uk/the-chatsworth-house-trust-c100228.html Peak District Online] Retrieved 24 September 2014.</ref> The new trust was granted a 99-year lease; this covered the house, its principal contents, grounds, precincts and adjacent forestry, a total of {{convert|1822|acre|km2}}. To legalise the arrangement, the Chatsworth House Trust pays a token rent of \u00a31 a year. To facilitate this arrangement and establish a sufficient multimillion-pound endowment fund, the trustees sold works of art, mostly old master drawings, which had not been on regular display. The family is represented on the House Trust's Council of Management, but the majority of directors are non-family members. The duke pays a market rent for the use of his private apartments in the house. The cost of running the house and grounds is around \u00a34&nbsp;million a year.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Chatsworth House 6 March 2011 4.JPG|thumb|Renovation of Chatsworth House, 2011]]\nThe 11th Duke died in 2004 and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke, [[Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire]]. The 11th Duke's widow, the [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Dowager Duchess of Devonshire]], died on 24 September 2014. Up until her death she was very active in promoting the estate and increasing its visitor income. She was responsible for many additions to the gardens, including the maze, the kitchen, the cottage gardens and several commissions of modern sculpture. She also wrote seven books about different aspects of Chatsworth and its estate.\n\nA structural survey in 2004 showed that major renovation to the house was required. A \u00a332 million programme of works was subsequently undertaken, including the restoration of stonework, statues, paintings, tapestries and water features. The work, the most extensive for 200 years, took ten years and was completed in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-43501436 |title=Chatsworth House \u00a332m restoration unveiled |date=24 March 2018 |first= |last= |accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nChatsworth House is built on sloping ground, lower on the north and west sides than on the south and east sides. The original Tudor mansion was built in the 1560s by [[Bess of Hardwick]] in a quadrangle layout, approximately {{convert|170|ft|m|-1}} from north to south and {{convert|190|ft|m|-1}} from east to west, with a large central courtyard. The main entrance was on the west front, which was embellished with four towers or turrets, and the [[great hall]] in the medieval tradition was on the east side of the courtyard, where the Painted Hall remains the focus of the house to this day.\n\nThe south and east fronts were rebuilt under the order of [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] and were completed by 1696 for [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]]. The 1st Duke's Chatsworth was a key building in the development of [[English Baroque]] architecture. According to the architectural historian Sir [[John Summerson]], \"It inaugurates an artistic revolution which is the counterpart of the political revolution in which the Earl was so prominent a leader.\" The design of the south front was revolutionary for an English house, with no attics or hipped roof, but instead two main stories supported by a [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] basement. The facade is dramatic and sculptural with [[Ionic order|ionic]] pilasters and a heavy [[entablature]] and [[balustrade]]. The existing heavy and angular stone stairs from the first floor down to the garden are a 19th-century replacement of an elegant curved double staircase. The east front is the quietest of the four on the main block. Like the south front it is unusual in that it has an even number of bays and no centrepiece. The emphasis is placed on the end bays, each highlighted by double pairs of pilasters, of which the inner pairs project outwards.\n\n[[File:Chatsworth - west front from Vitruvius Britannicus.jpg|thumb|left|The West Front of Chatsworth from [[Colen Campbell]]'s ''Vitruvius Britannicus'']]The west and north fronts may have been the work of [[Thomas Archer]], possibly in collaboration with the Duke himself. The west front has nine wide bays with a central pediment supported by four columns and [[pilaster]]s to the other bays. Due to the slope of the site this front is taller than the south front. It is also large, with many other nine-bay three-storey facades little more than half as wide and tall. The west front is very lively with much carved stonework, and the window frames are highlighted with gold leaf, which catches the setting sun. The north front was the last to be built. It presented a challenge, as the north end of the west front projected nine feet (3 m) further than the north end of the east front. This problem was overcome by building a slightly curved facade to distract the eye. The attic windows on this side are the only ones visible on the exterior of the house and are set into the main facade, rather than into a visible roof. Those in the curved section were originally oval, but are now rectangular like those in the end sections. The north front was altered in the 19th century when [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]], along with the architect [[Jeffry Wyatville]], built the North Wing, doubling the size of the house. Most of this wing only has two storeys, compared to the three of the main block. It is attached to the north-east corner of the house, and is around 400 feet (120 m) long. At the end of the North Wing is the North, or Belvedere, Tower. The work was carried out in an [[Italianate]] style that blends smoothly with the elaborate finish of the baroque house.\n\nThe 6th Duke built a gatehouse at this end of the house with three gates. The central and largest gate led to the North Entrance, then the main entrance to the house. This is now the entrance used by visitors. The north gate led to the service courtyard, and the matching south gate led to the original front door in the west front, which was relegated to secondary status in the Duke's time, but is now the family's private entrance once again.\n\nThe facades to the central courtyard were also rebuilt by the 1st Duke. The courtyard was larger than it is now, as there were no corridors on the western side and the northern and southern sides only had enclosed galleries on the first floor with open galleries below. In the 19th century, new accommodation was built on these three sides on all three levels. The only surviving baroque facade is that on the eastern side, where five bays of the original seven remain, and are largely as built. There are carved trophies by [[Samuel Watson (sculptor)|Samuel Watson]], a [[Derbyshire]] craftsman who did a lot of work at Chatsworth in stone, marble and wood.\n\n==Interiors==\nThe 1st and 6th Dukes both inherited an old house, and tried to adapt to the lifestyle of their time without changing the fundamentals of its layout, making Chatsworth's layout unique, full of irregularities and the interiors a collection of different styles. Many of the rooms are recognisable of one main period, but in nearly every case, they have been altered more often than might be supposed at first glance.\n\n===State apartments===\n[[File:Chatsworth main hallway.jpg|Painted Hall with murals completed 1694 by [[Louis Laguerre]]|left|thumb]]\n[[File:Chatsworth bedroom.jpg|State Bedroom completed 1694|right|thumb]]\n[[File:Chatsworth House library.JPG|thumb|Library 1694\u20131700 plaster work by Edward Goudge, ceiling paintings by James Thornhill, bookcases and fireplace by Jeffry Wyatville 1824]]\nThe 1st Duke created a richly appointed Baroque suite of [[state rooms]] across the south front in anticipation of a visit by [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] that never occurred. The State Apartments are accessed from the Painted Hall, decorated with murals showing scenes from the life of [[Julius Caesar]] by [[Louis Laguerre]], and ascending the cantilevered Great Stairs to the [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms that would control how far a person could progress into the presence of the King and Queen.\n\nThe Great Chamber is the largest room in the State Apartments, followed by the State Drawing Room, the Second Withdrawing Room, the State Bedroom and finally the State Closet with each room being more private and ornate than the last. The Great Chamber includes a painted ceiling of a classical scene by [[Antonio Verrio]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Tomlinson|first=Lucy|title=Inside Chatsworth House|magazine=Britain Magazine|date=11 October 2012}}</ref> The Second Withdrawing Room was renamed the State Music Room by the 6th Duke when he brought the violin door here from Devonshire House in London. The door features a very convincing [[trompe l'oeil]] of a violin and bow \"hanging\" on a silver knob, painted around 1723 by [[Jan van der Vaart (painter)|Jan van der Vaart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housederby_chatsworth.htm#text|title=Chatsworth House|last=Anon|work=tour K|publisher=Just Tour Ltd|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chatsworth.org/learning/photolibrary_images.htm |title=Chatsworth&nbsp;\u2013 photo library |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705013815/http://www.chatsworth.org/learning/photolibrary_images.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAround the time [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] decided that [[Hampton Court]], with its state apartments in the same style, was uninhabitable, the 6th Duke wrote that he was tempted to demolish the State Apartments to make way for new bedrooms. However, sensitive to his family's heritage, he left the rooms largely untouched, making additions rather than change the existing spaces of the house. Changes to the main baroque interiors were restricted to details such as stamped leather hangings on the walls of the State Music Room and State Bedroom, and a wider and shallower, but less elegant staircase in the Painted Hall, which was itself later replaced. The contents of the State Apartments were rearranged in 2010 to reflect the way they would have looked in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dorment|first=Richard|title=Chatsworth House: a masterpiece in every room|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===18th-century alterations===\nIn the 1760s, [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire]] redirected the approach to Chatsworth. He converted the kitchen in the centre of the north front into an entrance hall from which guests would walk through an open colonnade in the courtyard, through a passage past the cook's bedroom and the back stairs and into the Painted Hall. He then built an neoclassical service wing for his kitchens that were a forerunner of the 6th Duke's north wing. [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]] had some of the family's private rooms redecorated and some partition walls were moved, but there are few traces of the mid- and late 18th century in the public rooms.\n\n===19th-century alterations===\n[[File:Venus supported by Iris, complaining to Mars 1820.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] supported by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], complaining to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'' by [[George Hayter]], exhibited in 1820 at the [[Royal Academy|RA]] \"to acclaim\" (in the Ceiling of the Ante Library Chatsworth House)&nbsp;\u2013 Winner of the Royal Academy Painting of the Year in 1823]]\nThe 6th Duke conducted many modernisations of Chatsworth House to meet 19th-century standards of comfort, that suited a less formal lifestyle than that of the 1st Duke's time. The corridors around the edges of the courtyard were enclosed and furnished with a multicoloured marble floor, so that rooms could be easily reached from indoors, and more shared living rooms to replace individual guest apartments. The cook's bedroom and the back stairs made way for the Oak Stairs, topped by a glass dome, that were built at the northern end of the Painted Hall to improve internal communications. Along this staircase hang portraits of the first 11 Dukes and some of their family members. The Duke transformed the long gallery, originally created by the 1st Duke, into a library. He was a great lover of books and purchased entire libraries. The Ante-Library in the adjoining room was originally used by the 1st Duke as a dining room and then a billiard room before the 6th Duke used it to house his increasing collection of books. This was just one of the rooms in which the Duke installed a single pane window, which he believed to be the 'greatest ornament of modern decoration'.<ref name=\"yourguide\" /> The window in the Ante-Library is the only one to have been preserved. Much of the scientific library of [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731\u20131810) is in this room. The most notable addition by the 6th Duke to Chatsworth was the Wyatville designed North Wing. Plans for a symmetrical wing to the south were begun but later abandoned.<ref name=\"yourguide\">{{Cite book |title=Your Guide to Chatsworth |year=2012 |publisher=Streamline Press Ltd |isbn=978-0-9537329-1-3}}</ref>\n\nThe entire ground floor of the North Wing was occupied by service rooms, including a kitchen, servants' hall, laundry, butler and housekeeper's rooms. On the first floor, facing west, were two sets of bachelor bedrooms called 'California' and 'The Birds.' The main rooms in the new wing face east, and were accessed from the main house through a small library called the Dome Room. The first room beyond this is a dining room, with a music gallery in the serving lobby where the musicians played. Next is the sculpture gallery, the largest room in the house, and then the orangery. The Belvedere Tower contains a plunge bath, using the marble from the 1st Duke's bathroom, and a ballroom that was later turned into a theatre by the 8th Duke. Above the theatre is the [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] itself, an open viewing platform below the roof.\n\n===Private rooms===\nChatsworth has 126 rooms, with nearly 100 of them closed to visitors. The house is well adapted to allow the family to live privately in their apartments while the house is open to the public. [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire]] described the family rooms in detail in her book ''Chatsworth: The House''. She lived at [[Edensor]] until her death in 2014, and the present (12th) Duke and Duchess live at Chatsworth. The family occupies rooms on the ground and first floors of the south front, all three floors of the west front, and the upper two floors of the north front. Staircases in the northeast corner of the main block and in a turret in the east front enable them to move about without crossing the public route.\n\nThe main family living rooms are on the first floor of the south front. The family dining room is in the southeast corner and has the same dimensions as the State Dining Room directly above. This has been the usual location of the family dining room; the Bachelor Duke's dining room in the north wing took over that role for an interlude of little more than a hundred years. Both Bess of Hardwick's house and the 1st Duke's house had a hierarchy of three dining rooms in this corner, each taller and more lavishly decorated than the one below. A common parlour on the ground floor was used by the gentlemen of the household, and later for informal family meals. Above it was the main family dining room, and at the top the [[Great Chamber]], which was reserved for royalty, although the 6th Duke wrote that, to his knowledge, it had never been used.\n\nThe yellow drawing room, is next to the dining room and directly underneath the State Drawing Room. The Dowager Duchess has written that the house is so solidly built that the crowds passing above are imperceptible. The trio of reception rooms here is completed by the blue drawing room, which is below the State Music Room. This was created in the 18th century by knocking together the 1st Duke's bedroom and dressing room, and has a door to his private gallery at the upper level of the chapel. It has also served as a billiard room and as a school room. Charity events are sometimes held in this part of the house. Both drawing rooms have access to the garden through the South Front's external staircase.\n\nThree corridors called 'the Tapestry Gallery', 'the Burlington Corridor' and 'the Book Passage' are wrapped around the south, west and north passages at this level, and give access to family bedrooms. There is a sitting room in the north-west corner&nbsp;\u2014 one of the few rooms in the house with outside views in two directions. There are more family bedrooms on the second floor facing west and north. The Scots and Leicester bedrooms in the east wing are still used when there is a large house party, which is the reason why sometimes they are available as a separately charged optional extra in the tour of the house and sometimes they are not. This suite of rooms now contains the 11th Duke's Exhibition. Visitors bypass the first floor on their way down the West Stairs from the state rooms to the Chapel.\n\nThe private north stairs lead down to more private rooms on the ground floor of the West Front. In the centre is the West Entrance Hall, which is, once again, the family entrance. To the right, on entering, is a passage room known as the mineral room, which leads through to a study. To the left there is the Leather Room; with walls of leather and a great many books this is one of at least six libraries in the house. The next room is the Duke's Study, which has two windows, many more books and floral decoration painted for the Bachelor Duke by, in his own words, \"three bearded artists in blouses imported from Paris.\" The corner room on the ground floor is the former 'little dining room'. These rooms are all very high, as the ground level in the west wing is lower than that of the Painted Hall and the ground floor corridors around the courtyard. Steps from the West Entrance Hall lead up to the west corridor.\n\nThe other family living rooms are in the eastern half of the ground floor of the South Front and can be reached through the Chapel Corridor on the public route, or the turret staircase from the dining room. The room in the south-east corner was once the Ducal bathroom, until the Bachelor Duke built his new plunge bath in the North Wing, and is now the pantry where the family china is kept. This connects to the modern kitchen, which is under the library and was made out of the steward's room and the linen room. Next to the pantry in the south front are offices.\n\n==Park and landscape==\nChatsworth's garden attracts around 300,000 visitors a year. It has a complex blend of different features from six different centuries and covers {{convert|105|acre|km2}}. The garden is surrounded by a wall 1.75 miles (2.8&nbsp;km) long. It sits on the eastern side of the valley of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent River]] and blends into the landscape of the surrounding park, which covers {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}}. The woods on the moors to the east of the valley form a backdrop to the garden. There is a staff of approximately 20 full-time gardeners. The average rainfall is around 33.7&nbsp;inches (855&nbsp;mm) a year, and there are an average of 1,160 sunshine hours a year. Most of the principal features of the garden were created in five main phases of development.\n\n===Elizabethan garden===\nThe house and garden were first constructed by Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick in 1555. The Elizabethan garden was much smaller than the modern garden is now. There were terraces to the east of the house where the main lawn is now, ponds and fountains to the south, and fishponds to the west by the river. The main visual remnant of this time is a squat stone tower known as Queen Mary's Bower on account of a legend that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was allowed to take the air there while she was a prisoner at Chatsworth. The bower is now outside the garden wall in the park. Some of the retaining walls of the West Garden also date to this era, but they were reconstructed and extended later.\n\n[[File:A panoramic view of Chatsworth House and Park, by Pieter Tillemans (1684-1734).jpg|thumb|800px|center|A panoramic view of Chatsworth House and Park, early 18th century ([[Pieter Tillemans]])]]\n\n===1st Duke's garden (1684\u20131707)===\nAt the same time as he was rebuilding the house, the 1st Duke also created [[baroque]] gardens. It featured numerous [[parterre]]s cut into the slopes above the house, and many fountains, garden buildings and classical sculptures. The principal surviving features from this time are:\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Derbyshire.jpg|Flora's Temple|left|thumb]]\n[[File:Grand Cascade.jpg|The Cascade|right|thumb]]\n*'''The Cascade''' and '''Cascade House''' is a set of stone steps over which water flows from a set of fountains at the top. It was built in 1696 and rebuilt on a grander scale in 1701. In 1703 a grand baroque Temple or Cascade House designed by [[Thomas Archer]] was added at the top. A major restoration of both the Cascade and the Cascade House in 1994\u20131996 took 10,000 man-hours of work. In 2004 the Cascade was voted the best water feature in England by a panel of 45 garden experts organised by ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chatsworth.org/news/news_cascade.htm |title=Chatsworth's Cascade is the best in England |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720143459/http://www.chatsworth.org/news/news_cascade.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}</ref> It has 24 cut steps, each slightly different and with a variety of textures so that each gives a different sound when water runs over and down them.\n*The '''Canal Pond''', dug in 1702, is a {{convert|314|yd|adj=on}}-long rectangular lake to the south of the house.\n*'''The Seahorse Fountain''' is a sculptural fountain in a circular pond on the lawn between the house and the Canal Pond. Originally, it was the centrepiece of the main parterre.\n*'''The Willow Tree Fountain''' is an imitation tree that squirts water on the unsuspecting from its branches. The writer [[Celia Fiennes]] wrote in her diary: \"There&nbsp;... in the middle of ye grove stands a fine willow tree, the leaves, barke and all looks very naturall, ye roote is full of rubbish or great stones to appearance and all on a sudden by ye turning of a sluice it rains from each leafe and from the branches like a shower, it being made of brass and pipes to each leafe, but in appearance is exactly like any willow.\" The tree has been replaced twice and then restored in 1983.\n*'''The First Duke's greenhouse''' is a long, low building with ten arched windows and a temple-like centrepiece. It has been moved from its original site overlooking the 1st Duke's bowling green to the northern edge of the main lawn and is now fronted by a rose garden.\n*'''Flora's Temple''' is a classical temple built in 1695 and moved to its present site at the northern end of the broad walk in 1760. It contains a statue of the goddess [[Flora (goddess)|Flora]] by [[Caius Gabriel Cibber]].\n*'''The West Garden'''\u2014now the family's private garden with modern planting in a three-section formal structure\u2014is mainly a creation of the 1st Duke's time, but the layout is not original.\n\n===4th Duke's garden (1755\u201364)=== <!--Section linked from [[Capability Brown]]-->\nThe 4th Duke commissioned the [[landscape architect]], [[Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown]] to transform the garden in the fashionable naturalistic landscape style of the day. Most of the ponds and parterres were converted to lawns, but as detailed above several important features were spared. Many trees were planted, including various American species specially imported from [[Philadelphia]] in 1759. The main aim of this work was to improve integration of the garden and park. Brown's 5.5 acre (22,000 m\u00b2) Salisbury Lawns still form the setting of the Cascade.\n\n===6th Duke's garden (1826\u201358)===\n[[File:The Rockeries, Chatsworth House, England (2).JPG|thumb|The Rockeries]]\n[[File:Chatsworth House Fountain.jpg|thumb|right|The Emperor Fountain]]\n[[File:Neoclassical sculpture, Chatsworth House garden, England.JPG|thumb|Neoclassical sculpture, Chatsworth House garden]]\nIn 1826 a 23-year-old named [[Joseph Paxton]], who had been trained at [[Kew Gardens]], was appointed head gardener at Chatsworth. The 6th Duke had inherited Chatsworth fifteen years earlier and had previously shown little interest in improving the neglected garden, but he soon formed a productive and extravagantly funded partnership with Paxton, who proved to be the most innovative garden designer of his era, and remains the greatest single influence on Chatsworth's garden. Features that survive from that time include:\n\n*'''The Rockeries and The Strid''': in 1842 Paxton began work on a rockery of a gargantuan scale, piling rocks weighing several tons one on top of another. One of them was described thus by Lord Desart in the 1860s: \"In one place a sort of miniature [[Matterhorn]] apparently blocked the path but with the touch of the finger it revolved on a metal axis and made a way to pass.\" It is now locked in place to comply with health and safety regulations. Another rock is so balanced that it can be swayed with little pressure. Two rocks are named for the Queen and Prince Albert, and another for the Duke of Wellington, all of whom visited Chatsworth in the 6th Duke's time. The Wellington Rock, a construction of several rocks piled on top of each other, is 45 feet (14 m) high and a small waterfall drips over it into a pond. Sometimes in the winter the water freezes creating icicles. The water flows into a pond created by Paxton called 'The Strid', which is named after a stretch of the [[River Wharfe]] on the Devonshires' [[Bolton Abbey]] estate, where the river is compressed into a turbulent chasm just a yard wide. Chatsworth's Strid is a placid stretch of water fringed with rocks and luxuriant vegetation and crossed by a rustic bridge.\n*'''The Arboretum and Pinetum''': the 6th Duke's time was an age of plant-hunting expeditions, with major new species readily discovered by intrepid botanists, and the Duke was one of the most generous sponsors. In 1829 he took an additional eight acres (32,000 m\u00b2) of the park into the garden to create a pinetum, and in 1835 Paxton began work on an [[arboretum]], which was planned as a systematic succession of trees in accordance with botanical classification. Chatsworth has some of the oldest specimens of species such as [[Douglas fir]] and [[Giant Sequoia]] in the UK. Also in this part of the garden is the Grotto Pond, which was originally a fishpond, breeding fish for Chatsworth's table. The 6th Duke's mother had had the rustic grotto built at the end of the 18th century. The area around the pond is now planted for autumn colour.\n*'''The Azalea Dell and the Ravine''': [[Rhododendron]]s and [[Azalea]]s grow well at Chatsworth as the soil suits them, and a section of the southern end of the garden is devoted to them. This is the most rugged part of the garden with steep serpentine paths and a stream running down a small valley known as The Ravine. In 1997 a waterfall was created out of old drinking troughs gathered from fields on the estate. There is also a [[bamboo]] walk there.\n*'''The [[Emperor Fountain]]''': in 1843 Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] informed the Duke that he was likely to visit Chatsworth the following year. In anticipation of this Imperial visit, the Duke decided to construct the world's highest fountain, and set Paxton to work to build it. An eight-acre (32,000 m\u00b2) lake was dug on the moors 350 feet (110 m) above the house to supply the natural water pressure. The work was finished in just six months, continuing at night by the light of flares, and the resulting water jet is on record as reaching a height of 296 feet (90 m). However, the Tsar died in 1855 and never saw the fountain. Because of the limited supply of water the fountain usually runs on partial power and only reaches half its full height, but occasionally it is switched to maximum flow.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082911/http://www.chatswortheducation.com/news/news_fountain.htm Emperor Fountain goes sky high], Chatsworth press release, 25 April 2007.</ref> The water power found a practical use generating Chatsworth's electricity from 1893 to 1936. The house was then connected to the mains, and a new turbine was installed in 1988 that produces about a third of the electricity the house needs.\n*'''The Conservative Wall''' is a set of greenhouses that run up the slope from Flora's Temple to the stables against the north wall of the garden. A tall central section is flanked by ten smaller sections. They are used to grow fruit and [[camellia]]s. Two ''[[Camellia reticulata]]'' 'Captain Rawes' planted in 1850 survive. Chatsworth's camellias have won many prizes. The name of the building has no political connotations; the Dukes of Devonshire were [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and later [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]].\n\n[[File:Victoria Regia LIN 1849-.jpg|thumb|left|Paxton's daughter Annie standing on a ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'' leaf in the lily house]][[File:Chatsworth - Great Conservatory in the 19th century.JPG|thumb|The Great [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]] at Chatsworth. Built from 1836 to 1841 and demolished in 1920.]]\nPaxton was responsible, along with architect [[Decimus Burton]], for Chatsworth's Great Conservatory, which began construction in 1836 and was completed in 1841. It was 277 feet (84 m) long, 123 feet (37 m) wide and 61 feet (19 m) high making it the largest glass house in the world at that time and cost \u00a333,099. A carriage drive ran the length of the building between lush tropical vegetation. One W. Adam called it \"A mountain of glass&nbsp;... an unexampled structure&nbsp;... like a sea of glass when the waves are settling and smoothing down after a storm.\" The [[King of Saxony]] compared it to \"A tropical scene with a glass sky.\" The Great Conservatory was demolished after World War I as all the plants had died as it had not been heated during the war, and the cost of running became too much. Another large glasshouse at Barbrook, on the edge of the park, was devoted to cultivation of the giant Amazon water lily, ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'', which flowered in captivity there for the first time. This Lily House has also been lost.\n\n===Modern garden (1950\u2013present)===\n[[File:Chatsworth House.jpg|thumb|The South Front and the South Lawn with the Seahorse Fountain. The exterior steps are a 19th-century replacement for the original horseshoe-shaped steps.]]\nThe 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Dukes made few changes to the garden. The garden suffered during World War II, but the 11th Duke and his wife were keen gardeners and oversaw a revival in its fortunes. British gardening personality [[Alan Titchmarsh]] wrote in 2003: \"Chatsworth's greatest strength is that its owners have refused to let the garden rest on its Victorian laurels. It continues to grow and develop, and that is what makes it one of the best and most vibrant gardens in Britain.\" Many of the historical features have been restored to an immaculate condition, and unusually for an English country house garden in modern times, numerous important new features have been added including:\n*'''The South Lawn limes''' were double rows of [[espalier|pleached]] red-twigged limes on either side of the South Lawn, which were planted in 1952 and removed in 2014.\n*'''The Serpentine Hedge''' is a wavy hedged yew corridor that leads from the Ring Pond to the bust of the 6th Duke. It was planted in 1953.\n*'''The Maze''' was planted with 1,209 yews in the centre of the site of the former Great Conservatory in 1962. Two flower gardens occupy the rest of the site.\n*'''The Display Greenhouse''' (1970) is in a modern style, but is unobtrusively sited behind the First Duke's greenhouse. It has three climate zones, tropical, Mediterranean and temperate. Public access is limited but groups may book tours and there are first-come-first-served tours on a few days each season.\n*'''The Cottage Garden''' was inspired by an exhibit at the 1988 [[Chelsea Flower Show]]. A front garden of flower beds bordered by box leads to the \"kitchen/dining\" room with furniture covered with plants. There is a bedroom in the same style on the upper level.\n*'''The Kitchen Garden''' is a productive fruit and vegetable garden with decorative features. It was created behind the stables in the early 1990s.

The new walk gives views out into the south park, across the River Derwent and up the hill towards New Piece wood.

Its entrance gate features four Doric columns with rusticated banding, a pediment containing a huge carving of the family coat of arms, two life-size stags in embellished with real antlers, and a clock tower topped by a [[cupola]]. The building was designed by [[James Paine (architect)|James Paine]] for the 4th Duke and was built in 1758\u201367. It is approximately {{convert|190|ft|m|-1}} square and is two storeys tall. There are low towers in the corners in addition to the one over the entrance gate. The stables originally had stalls for 80 horses, and all necessary equine facilities including a [[blacksmith]]s shop. The first floor was occupied by granaries and accommodation for the many stable staff. According to the Dowager Duchess in her book, ''Chatsworth: The House'', one room still has \"Third Postillion\" painted on the door. The 6th Duke added a carriage house behind the stables in the 1830s.\n\nThe last horses left the stables in 1939 and the building was then used as a store and garage. The grooms' accommodation was converted into flats for Chatsworth employees and pensioners and their families. When the house reopened to the public after the war, \"catering\" was limited to an outdoor tap, which has since been relabelled \"water for dogs\". In 1975 a tea bar was established with an investment of \u00a3120. The first attempt at a caf\u00e9 opened in 1979. It seated 90 in some old horse stalls in the stables and was not satisfactory; either to the customers or from a commercial point of view. In 1987 the Duke and Duchess's private chef, a Frenchman named Jean-Pierre B\u00e9raud who was also a leading light in the success of the Chatsworth Farm Shop and Chatsworth Foods, took charge of the catering. After a failed attempt to obtain planning permission for a new building incorporating the old ice house in the park, a 250-seat restaurant was created in the carriage house. The 19th-century coach used by the Dowager Duchess and the late Duke at the Queen's Coronation is on display there. Other facilities include The Cavendish Rooms, which also serves refreshments, a shop and three rooms available for hire. The stables cater for thirty thousand people a month during the visitor season.\n\n===Park, woods and farmyard===\nChatsworth's park covers about {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}} and is open to the public free of charge all year-round, except for the south-east section, known as the Old Park, which is not open since it is used for breeding by the herds of red and fallow deer. The attitudes of the Dukes regarding wider access rights have changed significantly over the years. Upon his death, in 2004, the [[Ramblers Association]] praised the 11th Duke for his enlightened championing of open access, as well as his apologies for the attitude of the 10th Duke, who had restricted access to much estate land. Even during the 11th Duke's tenure, however, disputes arose\u2014when the definitive [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights of way]] were being compiled in the 1960s and 70s, the footpath to the Swiss Cottage (an isolated house by one of the lakes in the woods) was contested, and the matter went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], making Derbyshire one of the last counties to settle its definitive maps.\n[[File:The Hunting Tower Chatsworth House Derbyshire England.JPG|thumb|left|The Hunting Tower c.1580]]\n[[File:Chatsworth Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 112435.jpg|thumb|right|The Bridge 1759\u201364 by James Paine]]\nFarm stock also graze in the park, many of which belong to tenant farmers or smallholders, who use the park for summer grazing. Bess of Harwick's park was entirely on the eastern side of the river and only extended as far south as the Emperor Fountain and as far north as the cricket ground. Seven fish ponds were dug to the north-west of the house, where the large, flat area used for events such as the annual Chatsworth Horse Trials and the Country Fair, that is typically held towards the end of August, is now.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chatsworth Country Fair|url=http://www.chatsworthcountryfair.co.uk|work=Chatsworth Country Fair|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> The bridge across the river was at the southern end of the park and it crossed to the old village of [[Edensor]], which was by the river in full sight of the house.\n\nCapability Brown did at least as much work in the park as he did in the garden. The open, tree-flecked landscape that is admired today is man-made. Brown straightened the river, and there is a network of drainage channels under the grass. The park is fertilised with manure from the estates farms and managed to keep weeds and scrub under control. Brown filled in most of the fishponds and extended the park to the west of the river. At the same time [[James Paine (architect)|James Paine]] designed the new bridge to the north of the house, which was set at an angle of 40 degrees to command the best view of the West Front of the house. Most of the houses in Edensor were demolished, and the village was rebuilt out of sight of the house. The hedges between the fields on the west bank of the river were grubbed up to create open parkland, and woods were planted on the horizon. These were arranged in triangular clumps so that the screen of trees could be maintained when each planting had to be felled. Brown's plantings reached their peak in the mid-20th century and are gradually being replaced. The 5th Duke had an elegant red-brick inn built at Edensor to accommodate the increasing numbers of well-to-do travellers who were coming to see Chatsworth. It is now the estate office.\n\nIn 1823 the Bachelor Duke acquired the [[Duke of Rutland]]'s land around [[Baslow]] to the north of Chatsworth in exchange for some land elsewhere. He extended the park around half a mile (800 m) north to its present boundary. He also had the remaining cottages from the old Edensor inside the park demolished apart from the home of one old man who did not wish to move, which still stands in isolation in the park today. The houses in Edensor were rebuilt in picturesque pattern-book styles. In the 1860s the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th Duke]] had [[St Peter's Church, Edensor]] enlarged by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]. The church's spire embellishes the views from the house, garden and park, and inside there is a remarkable monument to Bess of Hardwick's sons Henry Cavendish and William, 1st Earl of Devonshire. St Peter's in Edensor is also where the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th]], [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th]], [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|8th]], [[Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire|9th]], [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th]] and [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th]] Duke of Devonshire and their wives are buried. Their remains are not entombed in a vault inside the church but lie, marked by simple headstones, in individual graves in the Cavendish family plot overlooking the churchyard.\n\nOn the hills of the eastern side of the park there is Stand Wood, where the Hunting Tower is located, that was built in 1582 by Bess of Hardwick. At the top of Stand Wood there is a plateau covering several square miles by lakes, woods and moorland. There are public paths through the area and Chatsworth offers guided tours with commentary in a 28-seater trailer pulled by a tractor. This area is the source of the water for all the gravity-fed waterworks in the garden. The Swiss Lake feeds the Cascade and the Emperor Lake feeds the Emperor Fountain. The Bachelor Duke had an aqueduct built, over which water tumbles on its way to the cascade.\n\nThe late Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, was a keen advocate of rural life, and in 1973 the Chatsworth Farmyard exhibit was opened in the old building yard above the stables. The aim was to explain to those unfamiliar with rural life how food was produced. There are milking demonstrations and displays of rare breeds. An adventure playground was added in 1983, and a venue for talks and exhibitions called Oak Barn was opened by television gardener [[Alan Titchmarsh]] in 2005. Chatsworth also runs two annual rural-skills weeks during which demonstrations of agricultural and forestry are given to groups of schoolchildren on the estate farms and woods.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Estate==\n[[File:ChatsworthWeir.jpg|thumb|Weir on the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] at the Chatsworth estate]]\n\nChatsworth is the hub of a {{convert|35,000|acre|km2|adj=on}} agricultural estate. The Chatsworth estate, together with {{convert|30,000|acre|km2}} around [[Bolton Abbey]] in Yorkshire (mostly moorland) and some land in [[Eastbourne]], belongs to The Trustees of Chatsworth Settlement, a family trust established in 1946. The Duke and other members of the family are entitled to the income. The family's {{convert|8,000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Lismore Castle]] estate in Ireland is held in a separate trust. The estate includes dozens of tenanted farms and over 450 houses and flats. There are five sub-estates scattered across Derbyshire:\n\n*'''The Main Estate''' is a compact block of {{convert|12,310|acres|0|abbr=on}} around the house, including the park and many properties in the villages of Baslow, Pilsley, Edensor, Beeley, and Calton Lees.\n*'''The West Estate''' is {{convert|6,498|acre|km2}} of scattered high ground, mostly in the [[Peak District]] and partly in [[Staffordshire]]. [[Hartington, Derbyshire|Hartington]], from which the family takes its secondary title is nearby.\n*'''The Shottle Estate''' is {{convert|3,519|acre|km2}} in and around [[Shottle]], which is around 15 miles (24&nbsp;km) south of Chatsworth. This is low-lying land and is home to most of the dairy farms on the estate, and also has some arable farms.\n*'''The Staveley Estate''' is {{convert|3,400|acre|km2}} at [[Staveley, Derbyshire|Staveley]] near [[Chesterfield]], including a {{convert|355|acre|km2}} industrial site called Staveley Works, which is let to various tenants, some woodlands, and arable farms.\n*'''The [[Scarcliffe]] Estate''', mostly arable farms, is {{convert|9,320|acre|km2}} east of Chesterfield.\n\nThe Chatsworth Settlement has a wide range of sources of income in addition to agricultural rents. Several thousand acres of the estate, mostly around Chatsworth and on the Staveley estate, are farmed in hand. A number of properties may be rented as holiday cottages, including Bess of Hardwick's Hunting Tower in the park. Several quarries produce limestone and other minerals.\n\nThe 11th Duke and Duchess did not opt for the \"theme park\" approach to modernising a country estate, but they did throw off the traditional aristocratic reluctance to participate in commerce. The Chatsworth Farm Shop is a very large enterprise in the UK, employing over a hundred people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About the farm shop |url=https://www.chatsworth.org/shopping-dining/farm-shop/about-the-farm-shop/ |website=Chatsworth |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2019|reason=nothing directly supporting number-of-peaple-employed}} A 90-seat restaurant opened at the farm shop in 2005. From 1999 to 2003 there was also a shop in the exclusive London district of [[Belgravia]], but it was not successful and closed down. The Settlement also runs the four shops and the catering operations at Chatsworth, paying a percentage of turnover to the charitable Chatsworth House Trust in lieu of rent. It also runs the Devonshire Arms Hotel and the Devonshire Fell Hotel & Bistro on the Bolton Abbey estate and owns the Cavendish Hotel at Baslow on the edge of Chatsworth Park, which is let to a tenant. The old kitchen garden at Barbrook on the edge of the park is let to the [[Caravan Club]], and a paddock at the southern end of the park where bucks used to be fattened for Chatsworth's table is a tenanted garden centre. In both cases the Settlement receives a percentage of turnover as rent. There is also a line of Chatsworth branded foods, endorsed with the Dowager Duchess's signature, which is available by mail order. The Dowager Duchess has also established Chatsworth Design to exploit intellectual property rights to the Devonshire collections, and a furniture company called Chatsworth Carpenters, but the latter has now been licensed to an American company.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) \u2013 The house itself is named in the novel as one of the estates [[Elizabeth Bennet]] visits before arriving at Pemberley.\n*''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975) \u2013 Chatsworth House represented Castle Hackton.\n*''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' (1984) \u2013 Two rooms in Chatsworth House represented two rooms in [[Admiralty House, London|Admiralty House]].\n*''[[Interceptor (TV series)|Interceptor]]'' (1989) \u2013 An episode was partially filmed on the grounds as the key was hidden on the top of the Cascade waterwork.\n*''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' (2005) \u2013 Represented [[Pemberley]], Mr [[Fitzwilliam Darcy|Darcy]]'s home in the film adaptation.\n*On 9 July 2006, the Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their tour in support of their album ''[[Face to Face (Westlife album)|Face to Face]]''.\n*''[[The Duchess (film)|The Duchess]]'' (2008)\n*''[[The Wolfman (2009 film)|The Wolfman]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Rivers with Griff Rhys Jones]]'' (2009) \u2013 [[Griff Rhys Jones]] was a guest at Chatsworth while making and filming his show.\n*''[[Chatsworth (TV series)|Chatsworth]]'' (2012) \u2013 Chatsworth House was the subject of a three-part documentary on [[BBC]] television.

They enclosed the first park at Chatsworth and built a house on the high ground in what is now the south-eastern part of the garden. In 1549 they sold all their property in the area to Sir [[William Cavendish (courtier)|William Cavendish]], [[Treasurer of the Chamber|Treasurer of the King's Chamber]] and the husband of [[Bess of Hardwick]], who had persuaded him to sell his property in Suffolk and settle in her native county.\n\nBess began to build the new house in 1553. She selected a site near the river, which was drained by digging a series of reservoirs, which doubled as fish ponds. Sir William died in 1557, but Bess finished the house in the 1560s and lived there with her fourth husband, [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]]. In 1568 Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and brought his prisoner to Chatsworth several times from 1570 onwards. She lodged in the apartment now known as the Queen of Scots rooms, on the top floor above the great hall, which faces onto the inner courtyard. An accomplished [[needlework|needlewoman]], Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the [[Oxburgh Hangings]].<ref name=\"Digby\">{{Cite book |last=Digby |first=George Wingfield |date=1964 |title=Elizabethan Embroidery |publisher=Thomas Yoseloff |pages=58\u201363 |asin=B0042KP67G}}</ref> Bess died in 1608 and Chatsworth was passed to her eldest son, [[Henry Cavendish (politician)|Henry]].

The 1st Duke's stables are to the left of the house]]\nFew changes were made at Chatsworth until the mid-17th century. [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire]] was a staunch Royalist and expelled from the House of Lords in 1642. He left England for the safety of the continent and his estates were sequestrated.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{Cite DNB |wstitle=Cavendish, William (1617-1684)}}</ref> Chatsworth was occupied by both sides during the Civil War, and the 3rd Earl did not return to the house until the restoration of the monarchy. He reconstructed the principal rooms in an attempt to make them more comfortable, but the Elizabethan house was outdated and unsafe.\n\nThe [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|4th Earl of Devonshire]], who was to become the 1st Duke in 1694 for helping to put William of Orange on the English throne, was an advanced [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and forced to retire to Chatsworth during the reign of [[James II of England|King James II]]. This called for a rebuilding of the house, which began in 1687. Cavendish initially planned to reconstruct only the south wing with the State Apartments, and so he decided to retain the Elizabethan courtyard plan, though this layout was becoming increasingly unfashionable. He enjoyed building and reconstructed the East Front, which included the Painted Hall and Long Gallery, followed by the West Front from 1699 to 1702. The North Front was completed in 1707 just before he died. The 1st Duke also had large [[parterre]] gardens designed by [[George London (landscape architect)|George London]] and [[Henry Wise (gardener)|Henry Wise]], who was later appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] as Royal Gardner at [[Kensington Palace]].\n\nIn 1774, [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]], married [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Georgiana Spencer]] famous as a socialite who gathered around her a large circle of literary and political friends. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds would paint her; the Gainsborough painting would be disposed of by the 5th Duke and be recovered much later, after many vicissitudes. Georgiana was the great-great-great-great aunt of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. Their lives, centuries apart, have been compared in tragedy.[3] The movie [[The Duchess]] portrayed their life together.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:ChatsworthMarlow.JPG|thumb|This late 18th-century oil painting by William Marlow emphasises the [[Romanticism|romantic]] aspect of Chatsworth's setting on the edge of the [[Peak District]]]]\n[[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire]], and [[William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire]], made no changes to the house and gardens, but both contributed greatly to the collection found at Chatsworth to this date. Connoisseur of the arts the collection include paintings, Old Master drawings and prints, ancient coins and carved Greek and Roman sculptures. Palladian furniture designed by [[William Kent]] was commissioned by the 3rd Duke when he had [[Devonshire House]] in London rebuilt following a fire in 1733. Upon the sale and demolition of Devonshire House in 1924 the furniture was transferred to Chatsworth.\n\nThe 4th Duke made great changes to the house and gardens. He decided the approach to the house should be from the west and had the old stables and offices as well as parts of Edensor village pulled down so they were not visible from the house. He also replaced the 1st Duke's formal gardens with a more natural look, designed by Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown, which he helped bring into fashion.\n\nIn 1748, the 4th Duke married [[Charlotte Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Lady Charlotte Boyle]], the sole surviving heiress of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]]. Lord Burlington was an accomplished architect in his own right with many works to his name including [[Chiswick House]]. With his death, his important collection of architectural drawings and Inigo Jones masque designs, Old Master paintings and William Kent designed furniture were transferred to the Dukes of Devonshire. This inheritance also brought many estates to the family.\n\n===19th century===\nThe [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke]] (known as 'the Bachelor Duke') was a passionate traveller, builder, gardener and collector who transformed Chatsworth. In 1811 he inherited the title and eight major estates; Chatsworth and [[Hardwick Hall]] in Derbyshire, Devonshire House, [[Burlington House]] and [[Chiswick House]] in London, [[Bolton Abbey]] and [[Londesborough Hall]] in Yorkshire, and [[Lismore Castle]] in Ireland. These estates covered {{convert|200000|acre|km2}} of land in England and Ireland.\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Dining room.jpg|thumb|left|The 6th Duke's dining room]]\nThe Duke was a great collector especially of sculpture and books. When he built the North Wing to the designs of [[Sir Jeffry Wyatville]], it included a purpose built Sculpture Gallery to house his collection, and he repurposed several rooms in the house to contain the entire libraries he would purchase at auction. The 6th Duke loved to entertain, and the early 19th century saw a rise in popularity of country house parties. In addition to a sculpture gallery, the new north wing housed an orangery, a theatre, a Turkish bath, a dairy, a vast new kitchen and numerous servants rooms. In 1830 the Duke increased the guest accommodation  by converting suites of rooms into individual guest bedrooms. People invited to stay at Chatsworth spent their days hunting, riding, reading and playing billiards. In the evening formal dinners would take place, followed by music, charades and billiards or conversation in the smoking room for the men. Women would return to their bedroom many times during the day to change their outfits. The guest bedrooms on the east front at Chatsworth are the most complete set of bedrooms from the period to survive with their original furnishings.<ref name=\"yourguide\"/>{{rp|52}} There is much eastern influence in the decoration including hand-painted Chinese wallpapers and fabrics which are typical of Regency taste, which developed during the reign of [[George IV]] (1762\u20131830). People who have stayed at Chatsworth include [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Charles Dickens]].\n\n[[File:Chatsworth from Morris's Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen (1880).JPG|thumb|A view of Chatsworth from the south-west circa 1880. The stables can be seen behind the house and the Hunting Tower is visible in Stand Wood]]\nIn October 1832, Princess Victoria (later Queen Victoria) and her mother, the [[Viktoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], visited Chatsworth where she had her first formal adult dinner, at the age of 13, in the new dining room. The 6th Duke had another opportunity to welcome Victoria in 1843 when the Queen and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] returned to be entertained by a large array of illuminated fountains. The Duke spent 47 years transforming the house and gardens. A [[Latin]] inscription over the fireplace in the Painted Hall translates as, \"William Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, inherited this most beautiful house from his father in the year 1811, which had been begun in the year of English liberty 1688, and completed it in the year of his bereavement 1840\". 1688 was the year of the [[Glorious Revolution]], supported by the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dynasties including the Cavendishes. The year 1840 saw the death of the Duke's beloved niece Blanche, who was married to his heir, the future [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th Duke]]. In 1844 he published a book called ''Handbook to Chatsworth and Hardwick''.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, a colour postcard sent from Liverpool to Navsari, India in 1913.jpg|thumbnail|Chatsworth, c. 1913.]]\nIn the early 20th century social change and taxes began to affect the Devonshires' lifestyle. When the [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|8th Duke]] died in 1908 over \u00a3500,000 of death duties became due. This was a small charge compared to what followed forty-two years later, but the estate was already burdened with debt from the 6th Duke's extravagances, the failure of the 7th Duke's business ventures at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], and the depression in British agriculture that had been apparent since the 1870s. In 1912 the family sold 25 books printed by [[William Caxton]] and a collection of 1,347 volumes of plays acquired by the 6th Duke, including four [[Shakespeare]] [[Folio (printing)|folios]] and 39 Shakespeare [[quarto]]s, to the [[Huntington Library]] in California. Tens of thousands of acres of land in [[Somerset]], [[Sussex]] and Derbyshire were also sold during, and immediately after, World War I.\n\nIn December 1904, [[Carlos I of Portugal|King Charles I of Portugal]] and [[Am\u00e9lie of Orl\u00e9ans|Queen Maria Am\u00e9lia]] stayed at Chatsworth House during their visit to [[Great Britain]]. It snowed almost constantly while they were there, and the King reportedly started a [[snowball fight]] (in which the assembled ladies enthusiastically joined) when he met the [[Lu\u00eds Pinto de Soveral, 1st Marquis of Soveral|Marquis of Soveral]], the Portuguese [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the [[Court of St James's]].<ref>{{Cite journal |editor-last=Chaves |editor-first=Jos\u00e9 Joubert |date=5 December 1904 |title=Viagem Real&nbsp;\u2014 Os Reis de Portugal Sob a Nevada em Chatsworth |trans-title=Royal Trip&nbsp;\u2014 The King and Queen of Portugal under the Snow in Chatsworth |url=http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/IlustracaoPort/1904/N57/N57_item1/P7.html |language=Portuguese |journal=Illustra\u00e7\u00e3o Portugueza |location=Lisbon |accessdate=7 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035903/http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/IlustracaoPort/1904/N57/N57_item1/P7.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the family's London mansion, Devonshire House, which occupied a {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on [[Piccadilly]], was sold to developers and demolished. Much of the contents of Devonshire House was moved to Chatsworth and a much smaller house at 2 Carlton Gardens near [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] was acquired. The Great [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]] in the garden at Chatsworth was demolished as it needed 10 men to run it, huge quantities of coal to heat it, and all the plants had died during the war when no coal had been available for non-essential purposes. To further reduce running costs, there was also talk of pulling down the 6th Duke's north wing, which was then regarded as having no aesthetic or historical value, but nothing came of it. Chiswick House\u2014the celebrated [[Palladian]] villa in the suburbs of West London that the Devonshires inherited when the [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|4th Duke]] married [[Lord Burlington]]'s daughter\u2014was sold to [[Brentford]] Council in 1929.\n\nNonetheless, life at Chatsworth continued much as before. The household was run by a [[comptroller]] and domestic staff were still available, although more so in the country than in the cities. The staff at Chatsworth at this time consisted of a butler, under butler, groom of the chambers, valet, three footmen, a housekeeper, the Duchess's maid, 11 housemaids, two sewing women, a cook, two kitchen maids, a vegetable maid, two or three scullery maids, two stillroom maids, a dairy maid, six laundry maids and the Duchess's secretary. All of these 38 or 39 people lived in the house. Daily staff included the odd man, upholsterer, scullery-maid, two scrubbing women, laundry porter, steam boiler man, coal man, two porter's lodge attendants, two night firemen, night porter, two window cleaners, and a team of joiners, plumbers and electricians. The Clerk of Works supervised the maintenance of the house and other properties on the estate. There were also grooms, chauffeurs and gamekeepers. The number of garden staff was somewhere between the 80 of the 6th Duke's time and the 20 or so of the early 21st century. There was also a librarian, Francis Thompson, who wrote the first book-length account of Chatsworth since the 6th Duke's handbook.\n\nMost of the UK's country houses were put to institutional use during World War II. Some of those used as barracks were badly damaged, but the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th Duke]], anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, arranged for Chatsworth to be occupied by [[Rydal Penrhos|Penrhos College]], a girls' [[Public School (UK)|public school]] in [[Colwyn Bay]], Wales. The contents of the house were packed away in 11 days and, in September 1939, 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.\n\nIn May 1944 [[Kathleen Kennedy Cavendish|Kathleen Kennedy]], sister of [[John F. Kennedy]], married [[William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington|William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington]], the elder son of the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th Duke of Devonshire]]. However, he was killed in action in Belgium in September 1944, and Kathleen died in a plane crash in 1948. His younger brother Andrew became the [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th Duke]] in 1950. He was married to [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah Mitford]], one of the [[Mitford family|Mitford girls]] and sister to [[Nancy Mitford]], [[Diana Mitford]], [[Pamela Mitford]], [[Unity Mitford]] and [[Jessica Mitford]]\n\n[[File:Chatsworth Cascade.jpg|thumb|Chatsworth House viewed from the top of the Cascade]]\nThe modern history of Chatsworth begins in 1950. The family had not yet moved back after the war and, although the 10th Duke had transferred his assets to his son during his lifetime in the hope of avoiding [[death duties]], he died a few weeks too early for the lifetime exemption to apply, and tax was charged at 80% on the whole estate. The amount due was \u00a37&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|7000000|1950|r=-4}}}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}. Some of the family's advisors considered the situation to be irretrievable, and there was a proposal to transfer Chatsworth to the nation as a [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] of [[Northern England]]. Instead, the Duke decided to retain his family's home if he could. He sold tens of thousands of acres of land, transferred Hardwick Hall to the National Trust in lieu of tax, and sold some major works of art from Chatsworth. The family's Sussex house, Compton Place was lent to a school. The effect of the death duties was mitigated to some extent by the historically low value of art during the post-war years and the increase in land values, subsequent to 1950, during the post-war agricultural revival, and, on the face of it, the losses were considerably less than 80% in terms of physical assets. In Derbyshire {{convert|35000|acre|km2}} were retained out of {{convert|83000|acre|km2}}. The Bolton Abbey estate in Yorkshire and the Lismore Castle estate in Ireland remained in the family. Nonetheless, it took 17 years to complete negotiations with the [[Inland Revenue]], interest being due in the meantime. The Chatsworth Estate is now managed by the Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, which was established in 1946.\n[[File:View of Chatsworth House, England.jpg|thumb|left|A modern view of the house]]\nThe 10th Duke was pessimistic about the future of houses like Chatsworth, and made no plans to move back in after the war. After Penrhos College left in 1945 the only people who slept in the house were two housemaids, but over the winter of 1948\u201349 the house was cleaned and tidied for reopening to the public by two Hungarian women who had been Kathleen Kennedy's cook and housemaid in London and a team of their compatriots. The house was Grade I listed in 1951, following the passing of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]].<ref name=\"NHLE1373871\" />\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th Duke]] and Duchess began to think about moving into the house. The pre-war house had relied entirely on a large staff for its comforts, and lacked modern facilities. The building was rewired, the plumbing and heating were overhauled, and six self-contained staff flats were created to replace the small staff bedrooms and communal servants' hall. Including those in the staff flats, 17 bathrooms were added to the existing handful. The 6th Duke's cavernous kitchen was abandoned and a new one was created closer to the family dining room. The family rooms were repainted, carpets were brought out of store, and curtains were repaired or replaced. The Duke and Duchess and their three children moved across the park from Edensor House in 1959.\n\nIn 1981, the trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, owners of the house, created a new charitable trust, The Chatsworth House Trust. The intention was to preserve the house and its setting for \"the benefit of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.peakdistrictonline.co.uk/the-chatsworth-house-trust-c100228.html Peak District Online] Retrieved 24 September 2014.</ref> The new trust was granted a 99-year lease; this covered the house, its principal contents, grounds, precincts and adjacent forestry, a total of {{convert|1822|acre|km2}}. To legalise the arrangement, the Chatsworth House Trust pays a token rent of \u00a31 a year. To facilitate this arrangement and establish a sufficient multimillion-pound endowment fund, the trustees sold works of art, mostly old master drawings, which had not been on regular display. The family is represented on the House Trust's Council of Management, but the majority of directors are non-family members. The duke pays a market rent for the use of his private apartments in the house. The cost of running the house and grounds is around \u00a34&nbsp;million a year.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Chatsworth House 6 March 2011 4.JPG|thumb|Renovation of Chatsworth House, 2011]]\nThe 11th Duke died in 2004 and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke, [[Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire]]. The 11th Duke's widow, the [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Dowager Duchess of Devonshire]], died on 24 September 2014. Up until her death she was very active in promoting the estate and increasing its visitor income. She was responsible for many additions to the gardens, including the maze, the kitchen, the cottage gardens and several commissions of modern sculpture. She also wrote seven books about different aspects of Chatsworth and its estate.\n\nA structural survey in 2004 showed that major renovation to the house was required. A \u00a332 million programme of works was subsequently undertaken, including the restoration of stonework, statues, paintings, tapestries and water features. The work, the most extensive for 200 years, took ten years and was completed in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-43501436 |title=Chatsworth House \u00a332m restoration unveiled |date=24 March 2018 |first= |last= |accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nChatsworth House is built on sloping ground, lower on the north and west sides than on the south and east sides. The original Tudor mansion was built in the 1560s by [[Bess of Hardwick]] in a quadrangle layout, approximately {{convert|170|ft|m|-1}} from north to south and {{convert|190|ft|m|-1}} from east to west, with a large central courtyard. The main entrance was on the west front, which was embellished with four towers or turrets, and the [[great hall]] in the medieval tradition was on the east side of the courtyard, where the Painted Hall remains the focus of the house to this day.\n\nThe south and east fronts were rebuilt under the order of [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] and were completed by 1696 for [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]]. The 1st Duke's Chatsworth was a key building in the development of [[English Baroque]] architecture. According to the architectural historian Sir [[John Summerson]], \"It inaugurates an artistic revolution which is the counterpart of the political revolution in which the Earl was so prominent a leader.\" The design of the south front was revolutionary for an English house, with no attics or hipped roof, but instead two main stories supported by a [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] basement. The facade is dramatic and sculptural with [[Ionic order|ionic]] pilasters and a heavy [[entablature]] and [[balustrade]]. The existing heavy and angular stone stairs from the first floor down to the garden are a 19th-century replacement of an elegant curved double staircase. The east front is the quietest of the four on the main block. Like the south front it is unusual in that it has an even number of bays and no centrepiece. The emphasis is placed on the end bays, each highlighted by double pairs of pilasters, of which the inner pairs project outwards.\n\n[[File:Chatsworth - west front from Vitruvius Britannicus.jpg|thumb|left|The West Front of Chatsworth from [[Colen Campbell]]'s ''Vitruvius Britannicus'']]The west and north fronts may have been the work of [[Thomas Archer]], possibly in collaboration with the Duke himself. The west front has nine wide bays with a central pediment supported by four columns and [[pilaster]]s to the other bays. Due to the slope of the site this front is taller than the south front. It is also large, with many other nine-bay three-storey facades little more than half as wide and tall. The west front is very lively with much carved stonework, and the window frames are highlighted with gold leaf, which catches the setting sun. The north front was the last to be built. It presented a challenge, as the north end of the west front projected nine feet (3 m) further than the north end of the east front. This problem was overcome by building a slightly curved facade to distract the eye. The attic windows on this side are the only ones visible on the exterior of the house and are set into the main facade, rather than into a visible roof. Those in the curved section were originally oval, but are now rectangular like those in the end sections. The north front was altered in the 19th century when [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]], along with the architect [[Jeffry Wyatville]], built the North Wing, doubling the size of the house. Most of this wing only has two storeys, compared to the three of the main block. It is attached to the north-east corner of the house, and is around 400 feet (120 m) long. At the end of the North Wing is the North, or Belvedere, Tower. The work was carried out in an [[Italianate]] style that blends smoothly with the elaborate finish of the baroque house.\n\nThe 6th Duke built a gatehouse at this end of the house with three gates. The central and largest gate led to the North Entrance, then the main entrance to the house. This is now the entrance used by visitors. The north gate led to the service courtyard, and the matching south gate led to the original front door in the west front, which was relegated to secondary status in the Duke's time, but is now the family's private entrance once again.\n\nThe facades to the central courtyard were also rebuilt by the 1st Duke. The courtyard was larger than it is now, as there were no corridors on the western side and the northern and southern sides only had enclosed galleries on the first floor with open galleries below. In the 19th century, new accommodation was built on these three sides on all three levels. The only surviving baroque facade is that on the eastern side, where five bays of the original seven remain, and are largely as built. There are carved trophies by [[Samuel Watson (sculptor)|Samuel Watson]], a [[Derbyshire]] craftsman who did a lot of work at Chatsworth in stone, marble and wood.\n\n==Interiors==\nThe 1st and 6th Dukes both inherited an old house, and tried to adapt to the lifestyle of their time without changing the fundamentals of its layout, making Chatsworth's layout unique, full of irregularities and the interiors a collection of different styles. Many of the rooms are recognisable of one main period, but in nearly every case, they have been altered more often than might be supposed at first glance.\n\n===State apartments===\n[[File:Chatsworth main hallway.jpg|Painted Hall with murals completed 1694 by [[Louis Laguerre]]|left|thumb]]\n[[File:Chatsworth bedroom.jpg|State Bedroom completed 1694|right|thumb]]\n[[File:Chatsworth House library.JPG|thumb|Library 1694\u20131700 plaster work by Edward Goudge, ceiling paintings by James Thornhill, bookcases and fireplace by Jeffry Wyatville 1824]]\nThe 1st Duke created a richly appointed Baroque suite of [[state rooms]] across the south front in anticipation of a visit by [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] that never occurred. The State Apartments are accessed from the Painted Hall, decorated with murals showing scenes from the life of [[Julius Caesar]] by [[Louis Laguerre]], and ascending the cantilevered Great Stairs to the [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms that would control how far a person could progress into the presence of the King and Queen.\n\nThe Great Chamber is the largest room in the State Apartments, followed by the State Drawing Room, the Second Withdrawing Room, the State Bedroom and finally the State Closet with each room being more private and ornate than the last. The Great Chamber includes a painted ceiling of a classical scene by [[Antonio Verrio]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Tomlinson|first=Lucy|title=Inside Chatsworth House|magazine=Britain Magazine|date=11 October 2012}}</ref> The Second Withdrawing Room was renamed the State Music Room by the 6th Duke when he brought the violin door here from Devonshire House in London. The door features a very convincing [[trompe l'oeil]] of a violin and bow \"hanging\" on a silver knob, painted around 1723 by [[Jan van der Vaart (painter)|Jan van der Vaart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housederby_chatsworth.htm#text|title=Chatsworth House|last=Anon|work=tour K|publisher=Just Tour Ltd|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chatsworth.org/learning/photolibrary_images.htm |title=Chatsworth&nbsp;\u2013 photo library |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705013815/http://www.chatsworth.org/learning/photolibrary_images.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAround the time [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] decided that [[Hampton Court]], with its state apartments in the same style, was uninhabitable, the 6th Duke wrote that he was tempted to demolish the State Apartments to make way for new bedrooms. However, sensitive to his family's heritage, he left the rooms largely untouched, making additions rather than change the existing spaces of the house. Changes to the main baroque interiors were restricted to details such as stamped leather hangings on the walls of the State Music Room and State Bedroom, and a wider and shallower, but less elegant staircase in the Painted Hall, which was itself later replaced. The contents of the State Apartments were rearranged in 2010 to reflect the way they would have looked in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dorment|first=Richard|title=Chatsworth House: a masterpiece in every room|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===18th-century alterations===\nIn the 1760s, [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire]] redirected the approach to Chatsworth. He converted the kitchen in the centre of the north front into an entrance hall from which guests would walk through an open colonnade in the courtyard, through a passage past the cook's bedroom and the back stairs and into the Painted Hall. He then built an neoclassical service wing for his kitchens that were a forerunner of the 6th Duke's north wing. [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]] had some of the family's private rooms redecorated and some partition walls were moved, but there are few traces of the mid- and late 18th century in the public rooms.\n\n===19th-century alterations===\n[[File:Venus supported by Iris, complaining to Mars 1820.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] supported by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], complaining to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'' by [[George Hayter]], exhibited in 1820 at the [[Royal Academy|RA]] \"to acclaim\" (in the Ceiling of the Ante Library Chatsworth House)&nbsp;\u2013 Winner of the Royal Academy Painting of the Year in 1823]]\nThe 6th Duke conducted many modernisations of Chatsworth House to meet 19th-century standards of comfort, that suited a less formal lifestyle than that of the 1st Duke's time. The corridors around the edges of the courtyard were enclosed and furnished with a multicoloured marble floor, so that rooms could be easily reached from indoors, and more shared living rooms to replace individual guest apartments. The cook's bedroom and the back stairs made way for the Oak Stairs, topped by a glass dome, that were built at the northern end of the Painted Hall to improve internal communications. Along this staircase hang portraits of the first 11 Dukes and some of their family members. The Duke transformed the long gallery, originally created by the 1st Duke, into a library. He was a great lover of books and purchased entire libraries. The Ante-Library in the adjoining room was originally used by the 1st Duke as a dining room and then a billiard room before the 6th Duke used it to house his increasing collection of books. This was just one of the rooms in which the Duke installed a single pane window, which he believed to be the 'greatest ornament of modern decoration'.<ref name=\"yourguide\" /> The window in the Ante-Library is the only one to have been preserved. Much of the scientific library of [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731\u20131810) is in this room. The most notable addition by the 6th Duke to Chatsworth was the Wyatville designed North Wing. Plans for a symmetrical wing to the south were begun but later abandoned.<ref name=\"yourguide\">{{Cite book |title=Your Guide to Chatsworth |year=2012 |publisher=Streamline Press Ltd |isbn=978-0-9537329-1-3}}</ref>\n\nThe entire ground floor of the North Wing was occupied by service rooms, including a kitchen, servants' hall, laundry, butler and housekeeper's rooms. On the first floor, facing west, were two sets of bachelor bedrooms called 'California' and 'The Birds.' The main rooms in the new wing face east, and were accessed from the main house through a small library called the Dome Room. The first room beyond this is a dining room, with a music gallery in the serving lobby where the musicians played. Next is the sculpture gallery, the largest room in the house, and then the orangery. The Belvedere Tower contains a plunge bath, using the marble from the 1st Duke's bathroom, and a ballroom that was later turned into a theatre by the 8th Duke. Above the theatre is the [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] itself, an open viewing platform below the roof.\n\n===Private rooms===\nChatsworth has 126 rooms, with nearly 100 of them closed to visitors. The house is well adapted to allow the family to live privately in their apartments while the house is open to the public. [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire]] described the family rooms in detail in her book ''Chatsworth: The House''. She lived at [[Edensor]] until her death in 2014, and the present (12th) Duke and Duchess live at Chatsworth. The family occupies rooms on the ground and first floors of the south front, all three floors of the west front, and the upper two floors of the north front. Staircases in the northeast corner of the main block and in a turret in the east front enable them to move about without crossing the public route.\n\nThe main family living rooms are on the first floor of the south front. The family dining room is in the southeast corner and has the same dimensions as the State Dining Room directly above. This has been the usual location of the family dining room; the Bachelor Duke's dining room in the north wing took over that role for an interlude of little more than a hundred years. Both Bess of Hardwick's house and the 1st Duke's house had a hierarchy of three dining rooms in this corner, each taller and more lavishly decorated than the one below. A common parlour on the ground floor was used by the gentlemen of the household, and later for informal family meals. Above it was the main family dining room, and at the top the [[Great Chamber]], which was reserved for royalty, although the 6th Duke wrote that, to his knowledge, it had never been used.\n\nThe yellow drawing room, is next to the dining room and directly underneath the State Drawing Room. The Dowager Duchess has written that the house is so solidly built that the crowds passing above are imperceptible. The trio of reception rooms here is completed by the blue drawing room, which is below the State Music Room. This was created in the 18th century by knocking together the 1st Duke's bedroom and dressing room, and has a door to his private gallery at the upper level of the chapel. It has also served as a billiard room and as a school room. Charity events are sometimes held in this part of the house. Both drawing rooms have access to the garden through the South Front's external staircase.\n\nThree corridors called 'the Tapestry Gallery', 'the Burlington Corridor' and 'the Book Passage' are wrapped around the south, west and north passages at this level, and give access to family bedrooms. There is a sitting room in the north-west corner&nbsp;\u2014 one of the few rooms in the house with outside views in two directions. There are more family bedrooms on the second floor facing west and north. The Scots and Leicester bedrooms in the east wing are still used when there is a large house party, which is the reason why sometimes they are available as a separately charged optional extra in the tour of the house and sometimes they are not. This suite of rooms now contains the 11th Duke's Exhibition. Visitors bypass the first floor on their way down the West Stairs from the state rooms to the Chapel.\n\nThe private north stairs lead down to more private rooms on the ground floor of the West Front. In the centre is the West Entrance Hall, which is, once again, the family entrance. To the right, on entering, is a passage room known as the mineral room, which leads through to a study. To the left there is the Leather Room; with walls of leather and a great many books this is one of at least six libraries in the house. The next room is the Duke's Study, which has two windows, many more books and floral decoration painted for the Bachelor Duke by, in his own words, \"three bearded artists in blouses imported from Paris.\" The corner room on the ground floor is the former 'little dining room'. These rooms are all very high, as the ground level in the west wing is lower than that of the Painted Hall and the ground floor corridors around the courtyard. Steps from the West Entrance Hall lead up to the west corridor.\n\nThe other family living rooms are in the eastern half of the ground floor of the South Front and can be reached through the Chapel Corridor on the public route, or the turret staircase from the dining room. The room in the south-east corner was once the Ducal bathroom, until the Bachelor Duke built his new plunge bath in the North Wing, and is now the pantry where the family china is kept. This connects to the modern kitchen, which is under the library and was made out of the steward's room and the linen room. Next to the pantry in the south front are offices.\n\n==Park and landscape==\nChatsworth's garden attracts around 300,000 visitors a year. It has a complex blend of different features from six different centuries and covers {{convert|105|acre|km2}}. The garden is surrounded by a wall 1.75 miles (2.8&nbsp;km) long. It sits on the eastern side of the valley of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent River]] and blends into the landscape of the surrounding park, which covers {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}}. The woods on the moors to the east of the valley form a backdrop to the garden. There is a staff of approximately 20 full-time gardeners. The average rainfall is around 33.7&nbsp;inches (855&nbsp;mm) a year, and there are an average of 1,160 sunshine hours a year. Most of the principal features of the garden were created in five main phases of development.\n\n===Elizabethan garden===\nThe house and garden were first constructed by Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick in 1555. The Elizabethan garden was much smaller than the modern garden is now. There were terraces to the east of the house where the main lawn is now, ponds and fountains to the south, and fishponds to the west by the river. The main visual remnant of this time is a squat stone tower known as Queen Mary's Bower on account of a legend that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was allowed to take the air there while she was a prisoner at Chatsworth. The bower is now outside the garden wall in the park. Some of the retaining walls of the West Garden also date to this era, but they were reconstructed and extended later.\n\n[[File:A panoramic view of Chatsworth House and Park, by Pieter Tillemans (1684-1734).jpg|thumb|800px|center|A panoramic view of Chatsworth House and Park, early 18th century ([[Pieter Tillemans]])]]\n\n===1st Duke's garden (1684\u20131707)===\nAt the same time as he was rebuilding the house, the 1st Duke also created [[baroque]] gardens. It featured numerous [[parterre]]s cut into the slopes above the house, and many fountains, garden buildings and classical sculptures. The principal surviving features from this time are:\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Derbyshire.jpg|Flora's Temple|left|thumb]]\n[[File:Grand Cascade.jpg|The Cascade|right|thumb]]\n*'''The Cascade''' and '''Cascade House''' is a set of stone steps over which water flows from a set of fountains at the top. It was built in 1696 and rebuilt on a grander scale in 1701. In 1703 a grand baroque Temple or Cascade House designed by [[Thomas Archer]] was added at the top. A major restoration of both the Cascade and the Cascade House in 1994\u20131996 took 10,000 man-hours of work. In 2004 the Cascade was voted the best water feature in England by a panel of 45 garden experts organised by ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chatsworth.org/news/news_cascade.htm |title=Chatsworth's Cascade is the best in England |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720143459/http://www.chatsworth.org/news/news_cascade.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}</ref> It has 24 cut steps, each slightly different and with a variety of textures so that each gives a different sound when water runs over and down them.\n*The '''Canal Pond''', dug in 1702, is a {{convert|314|yd|adj=on}}-long rectangular lake to the south of the house.\n*'''The Seahorse Fountain''' is a sculptural fountain in a circular pond on the lawn between the house and the Canal Pond. Originally, it was the centrepiece of the main parterre.\n*'''The Willow Tree Fountain''' is an imitation tree that squirts water on the unsuspecting from its branches. The writer [[Celia Fiennes]] wrote in her diary: \"There&nbsp;... in the middle of ye grove stands a fine willow tree, the leaves, barke and all looks very naturall, ye roote is full of rubbish or great stones to appearance and all on a sudden by ye turning of a sluice it rains from each leafe and from the branches like a shower, it being made of brass and pipes to each leafe, but in appearance is exactly like any willow.\" The tree has been replaced twice and then restored in 1983.\n*'''The First Duke's greenhouse''' is a long, low building with ten arched windows and a temple-like centrepiece. It has been moved from its original site overlooking the 1st Duke's bowling green to the northern edge of the main lawn and is now fronted by a rose garden.\n*'''Flora's Temple''' is a classical temple built in 1695 and moved to its present site at the northern end of the broad walk in 1760. It contains a statue of the goddess [[Flora (goddess)|Flora]] by [[Caius Gabriel Cibber]].\n*'''The West Garden'''\u2014now the family's private garden with modern planting in a three-section formal structure\u2014is mainly a creation of the 1st Duke's time, but the layout is not original.\n\n===4th Duke's garden (1755\u201364)=== <!--Section linked from [[Capability Brown]]-->\nThe 4th Duke commissioned the [[landscape architect]], [[Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown]] to transform the garden in the fashionable naturalistic landscape style of the day. Most of the ponds and parterres were converted to lawns, but as detailed above several important features were spared. Many trees were planted, including various American species specially imported from [[Philadelphia]] in 1759. The main aim of this work was to improve integration of the garden and park. Brown's 5.5 acre (22,000 m\u00b2) Salisbury Lawns still form the setting of the Cascade.\n\n===6th Duke's garden (1826\u201358)===\n[[File:The Rockeries, Chatsworth House, England (2).JPG|thumb|The Rockeries]]\n[[File:Chatsworth House Fountain.jpg|thumb|right|The Emperor Fountain]]\n[[File:Neoclassical sculpture, Chatsworth House garden, England.JPG|thumb|Neoclassical sculpture, Chatsworth House garden]]\nIn 1826 a 23-year-old named [[Joseph Paxton]], who had been trained at [[Kew Gardens]], was appointed head gardener at Chatsworth. The 6th Duke had inherited Chatsworth fifteen years earlier and had previously shown little interest in improving the neglected garden, but he soon formed a productive and extravagantly funded partnership with Paxton, who proved to be the most innovative garden designer of his era, and remains the greatest single influence on Chatsworth's garden. Features that survive from that time include:\n\n*'''The Rockeries and The Strid''': in 1842 Paxton began work on a rockery of a gargantuan scale, piling rocks weighing several tons one on top of another. One of them was described thus by Lord Desart in the 1860s: \"In one place a sort of miniature [[Matterhorn]] apparently blocked the path but with the touch of the finger it revolved on a metal axis and made a way to pass.\" It is now locked in place to comply with health and safety regulations. Another rock is so balanced that it can be swayed with little pressure. Two rocks are named for the Queen and Prince Albert, and another for the Duke of Wellington, all of whom visited Chatsworth in the 6th Duke's time. The Wellington Rock, a construction of several rocks piled on top of each other, is 45 feet (14 m) high and a small waterfall drips over it into a pond. Sometimes in the winter the water freezes creating icicles. The water flows into a pond created by Paxton called 'The Strid', which is named after a stretch of the [[River Wharfe]] on the Devonshires' [[Bolton Abbey]] estate, where the river is compressed into a turbulent chasm just a yard wide. Chatsworth's Strid is a placid stretch of water fringed with rocks and luxuriant vegetation and crossed by a rustic bridge.\n*'''The Arboretum and Pinetum''': the 6th Duke's time was an age of plant-hunting expeditions, with major new species readily discovered by intrepid botanists, and the Duke was one of the most generous sponsors. In 1829 he took an additional eight acres (32,000 m\u00b2) of the park into the garden to create a pinetum, and in 1835 Paxton began work on an [[arboretum]], which was planned as a systematic succession of trees in accordance with botanical classification. Chatsworth has some of the oldest specimens of species such as [[Douglas fir]] and [[Giant Sequoia]] in the UK. Also in this part of the garden is the Grotto Pond, which was originally a fishpond, breeding fish for Chatsworth's table. The 6th Duke's mother had had the rustic grotto built at the end of the 18th century. The area around the pond is now planted for autumn colour.\n*'''The Azalea Dell and the Ravine''': [[Rhododendron]]s and [[Azalea]]s grow well at Chatsworth as the soil suits them, and a section of the southern end of the garden is devoted to them. This is the most rugged part of the garden with steep serpentine paths and a stream running down a small valley known as The Ravine. In 1997 a waterfall was created out of old drinking troughs gathered from fields on the estate. There is also a [[bamboo]] walk there.\n*'''The [[Emperor Fountain]]''': in 1843 Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] informed the Duke that he was likely to visit Chatsworth the following year. In anticipation of this Imperial visit, the Duke decided to construct the world's highest fountain, and set Paxton to work to build it. An eight-acre (32,000 m\u00b2) lake was dug on the moors 350 feet (110 m) above the house to supply the natural water pressure. The work was finished in just six months, continuing at night by the light of flares, and the resulting water jet is on record as reaching a height of 296 feet (90 m). However, the Tsar died in 1855 and never saw the fountain. Because of the limited supply of water the fountain usually runs on partial power and only reaches half its full height, but occasionally it is switched to maximum flow.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082911/http://www.chatswortheducation.com/news/news_fountain.htm Emperor Fountain goes sky high], Chatsworth press release, 25 April 2007.</ref> The water power found a practical use generating Chatsworth's electricity from 1893 to 1936. The house was then connected to the mains, and a new turbine was installed in 1988 that produces about a third of the electricity the house needs.\n*'''The Conservative Wall''' is a set of greenhouses that run up the slope from Flora's Temple to the stables against the north wall of the garden. A tall central section is flanked by ten smaller sections. They are used to grow fruit and [[camellia]]s. Two ''[[Camellia reticulata]]'' 'Captain Rawes' planted in 1850 survive. Chatsworth's camellias have won many prizes. The name of the building has no political connotations; the Dukes of Devonshire were [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and later [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]].\n\n[[File:Victoria Regia LIN 1849-.jpg|thumb|left|Paxton's daughter Annie standing on a ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'' leaf in the lily house]][[File:Chatsworth - Great Conservatory in the 19th century.JPG|thumb|The Great [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]] at Chatsworth. Built from 1836 to 1841 and demolished in 1920.]]\nPaxton was responsible, along with architect [[Decimus Burton]], for Chatsworth's Great Conservatory, which began construction in 1836 and was completed in 1841. It was 277 feet (84 m) long, 123 feet (37 m) wide and 61 feet (19 m) high making it the largest glass house in the world at that time and cost \u00a333,099. A carriage drive ran the length of the building between lush tropical vegetation. One W. Adam called it \"A mountain of glass&nbsp;... an unexampled structure&nbsp;... like a sea of glass when the waves are settling and smoothing down after a storm.\" The [[King of Saxony]] compared it to \"A tropical scene with a glass sky.\" The Great Conservatory was demolished after World War I as all the plants had died as it had not been heated during the war, and the cost of running became too much. Another large glasshouse at Barbrook, on the edge of the park, was devoted to cultivation of the giant Amazon water lily, ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'', which flowered in captivity there for the first time. This Lily House has also been lost.\n\n===Modern garden (1950\u2013present)===\n[[File:Chatsworth House.jpg|thumb|The South Front and the South Lawn with the Seahorse Fountain. The exterior steps are a 19th-century replacement for the original horseshoe-shaped steps.]]\nThe 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Dukes made few changes to the garden. The garden suffered during World War II, but the 11th Duke and his wife were keen gardeners and oversaw a revival in its fortunes. British gardening personality [[Alan Titchmarsh]] wrote in 2003: \"Chatsworth's greatest strength is that its owners have refused to let the garden rest on its Victorian laurels. It continues to grow and develop, and that is what makes it one of the best and most vibrant gardens in Britain.\" Many of the historical features have been restored to an immaculate condition, and unusually for an English country house garden in modern times, numerous important new features have been added including:\n*'''The South Lawn limes''' were double rows of [[espalier|pleached]] red-twigged limes on either side of the South Lawn, which were planted in 1952 and removed in 2014.\n*'''The Serpentine Hedge''' is a wavy hedged yew corridor that leads from the Ring Pond to the bust of the 6th Duke. It was planted in 1953.\n*'''The Maze''' was planted with 1,209 yews in the centre of the site of the former Great Conservatory in 1962. Two flower gardens occupy the rest of the site.\n*'''The Display Greenhouse''' (1970) is in a modern style, but is unobtrusively sited behind the First Duke's greenhouse. It has three climate zones, tropical, Mediterranean and temperate. Public access is limited but groups may book tours and there are first-come-first-served tours on a few days each season.\n*'''The Cottage Garden''' was inspired by an exhibit at the 1988 [[Chelsea Flower Show]]. A front garden of flower beds bordered by box leads to the \"kitchen/dining\" room with furniture covered with plants. There is a bedroom in the same style on the upper level.\n*'''The Kitchen Garden''' is a productive fruit and vegetable garden with decorative features. It was created behind the stables in the early 1990s. Chatsworth's original kitchen garden covered {{convert|11.5|acres|0|abbr=on}} and was by the river in the park.\n*'''Modern sculpture''' includes various pieces, such as ''War Horse'' and ''Walking Madonna'' by Dame [[Elizabeth Frink]], and 14 bronze portrait heads by [[Angela Conner]]. \n*'''The Sensory Garden''' is fully accessible to the disabled and features many fragrant plants. It was opened in 2004 by the then [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]].\n*'''Quebec''' is a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} part of the garden to the south and west of the canal pond that was, until 2006, a neglected and dank area covered with ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]''. This is now an extension to the Arboretum walk with a path that runs along the top of the steep bank. The new walk gives views out into the south park, across the River Derwent and up the hill towards New Piece wood. An 18th-century cascade was uncovered during the clearance.<ref name=\"trailleaflet\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.chatsworth.org/files/hidden_gems_garden_trail.pdf |title=Hidden Gems Walking Tour |publisher=Chatsworth Estate |accessdate=22 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106222219/http://www.chatsworth.org/files/hidden_gems_garden_trail.pdf |archive-date=6 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Stables===\n[[File:Stable block - Chatsworth House - Derbyshire, England - DSC03651.jpg|left|thumb|The stable block 1758\u201367 by James Paine]]\n\nThe stable block at Chatsworth is prominently situated on the rising ground to the north-east of the house. Its entrance gate features four Doric columns with rusticated banding, a pediment containing a huge carving of the family coat of arms, two life-size stags in embellished with real antlers, and a clock tower topped by a [[cupola]]. The building was designed by [[James Paine (architect)|James Paine]] for the 4th Duke and was built in 1758\u201367. It is approximately {{convert|190|ft|m|-1}} square and is two storeys tall. There are low towers in the corners in addition to the one over the entrance gate. The stables originally had stalls for 80 horses, and all necessary equine facilities including a [[blacksmith]]s shop. The first floor was occupied by granaries and accommodation for the many stable staff. According to the Dowager Duchess in her book, ''Chatsworth: The House'', one room still has \"Third Postillion\" painted on the door. The 6th Duke added a carriage house behind the stables in the 1830s.\n\nThe last horses left the stables in 1939 and the building was then used as a store and garage. The grooms' accommodation was converted into flats for Chatsworth employees and pensioners and their families. When the house reopened to the public after the war, \"catering\" was limited to an outdoor tap, which has since been relabelled \"water for dogs\". In 1975 a tea bar was established with an investment of \u00a3120. The first attempt at a caf\u00e9 opened in 1979. It seated 90 in some old horse stalls in the stables and was not satisfactory; either to the customers or from a commercial point of view. In 1987 the Duke and Duchess's private chef, a Frenchman named Jean-Pierre B\u00e9raud who was also a leading light in the success of the Chatsworth Farm Shop and Chatsworth Foods, took charge of the catering. After a failed attempt to obtain planning permission for a new building incorporating the old ice house in the park, a 250-seat restaurant was created in the carriage house. The 19th-century coach used by the Dowager Duchess and the late Duke at the Queen's Coronation is on display there. Other facilities include The Cavendish Rooms, which also serves refreshments, a shop and three rooms available for hire. The stables cater for thirty thousand people a month during the visitor season.\n\n===Park, woods and farmyard===\nChatsworth's park covers about {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}} and is open to the public free of charge all year-round, except for the south-east section, known as the Old Park, which is not open since it is used for breeding by the herds of red and fallow deer. The attitudes of the Dukes regarding wider access rights have changed significantly over the years. Upon his death, in 2004, the [[Ramblers Association]] praised the 11th Duke for his enlightened championing of open access, as well as his apologies for the attitude of the 10th Duke, who had restricted access to much estate land. Even during the 11th Duke's tenure, however, disputes arose\u2014when the definitive [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights of way]] were being compiled in the 1960s and 70s, the footpath to the Swiss Cottage (an isolated house by one of the lakes in the woods) was contested, and the matter went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], making Derbyshire one of the last counties to settle its definitive maps.\n[[File:The Hunting Tower Chatsworth House Derbyshire England.JPG|thumb|left|The Hunting Tower c.1580]]\n[[File:Chatsworth Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 112435.jpg|thumb|right|The Bridge 1759\u201364 by James Paine]]\nFarm stock also graze in the park, many of which belong to tenant farmers or smallholders, who use the park for summer grazing. Bess of Harwick's park was entirely on the eastern side of the river and only extended as far south as the Emperor Fountain and as far north as the cricket ground. Seven fish ponds were dug to the north-west of the house, where the large, flat area used for events such as the annual Chatsworth Horse Trials and the Country Fair, that is typically held towards the end of August, is now.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chatsworth Country Fair|url=http://www.chatsworthcountryfair.co.uk|work=Chatsworth Country Fair|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> The bridge across the river was at the southern end of the park and it crossed to the old village of [[Edensor]], which was by the river in full sight of the house.\n\nCapability Brown did at least as much work in the park as he did in the garden. The open, tree-flecked landscape that is admired today is man-made. Brown straightened the river, and there is a network of drainage channels under the grass. The park is fertilised with manure from the estates farms and managed to keep weeds and scrub under control. Brown filled in most of the fishponds and extended the park to the west of the river. At the same time [[James Paine (architect)|James Paine]] designed the new bridge to the north of the house, which was set at an angle of 40 degrees to command the best view of the West Front of the house. Most of the houses in Edensor were demolished, and the village was rebuilt out of sight of the house. The hedges between the fields on the west bank of the river were grubbed up to create open parkland, and woods were planted on the horizon. These were arranged in triangular clumps so that the screen of trees could be maintained when each planting had to be felled. Brown's plantings reached their peak in the mid-20th century and are gradually being replaced. The 5th Duke had an elegant red-brick inn built at Edensor to accommodate the increasing numbers of well-to-do travellers who were coming to see Chatsworth. It is now the estate office.\n\nIn 1823 the Bachelor Duke acquired the [[Duke of Rutland]]'s land around [[Baslow]] to the north of Chatsworth in exchange for some land elsewhere. He extended the park around half a mile (800 m) north to its present boundary. He also had the remaining cottages from the old Edensor inside the park demolished apart from the home of one old man who did not wish to move, which still stands in isolation in the park today. The houses in Edensor were rebuilt in picturesque pattern-book styles. In the 1860s the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th Duke]] had [[St Peter's Church, Edensor]] enlarged by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]. The church's spire embellishes the views from the house, garden and park, and inside there is a remarkable monument to Bess of Hardwick's sons Henry Cavendish and William, 1st Earl of Devonshire. St Peter's in Edensor is also where the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th]], [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th]], [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|8th]], [[Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire|9th]], [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th]] and [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th]] Duke of Devonshire and their wives are buried. Their remains are not entombed in a vault inside the church but lie, marked by simple headstones, in individual graves in the Cavendish family plot overlooking the churchyard.\n\nOn the hills of the eastern side of the park there is Stand Wood, where the Hunting Tower is located, that was built in 1582 by Bess of Hardwick. At the top of Stand Wood there is a plateau covering several square miles by lakes, woods and moorland. There are public paths through the area and Chatsworth offers guided tours with commentary in a 28-seater trailer pulled by a tractor. This area is the source of the water for all the gravity-fed waterworks in the garden. The Swiss Lake feeds the Cascade and the Emperor Lake feeds the Emperor Fountain. The Bachelor Duke had an aqueduct built, over which water tumbles on its way to the cascade.\n\nThe late Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, was a keen advocate of rural life, and in 1973 the Chatsworth Farmyard exhibit was opened in the old building yard above the stables. The aim was to explain to those unfamiliar with rural life how food was produced. There are milking demonstrations and displays of rare breeds. An adventure playground was added in 1983, and a venue for talks and exhibitions called Oak Barn was opened by television gardener [[Alan Titchmarsh]] in 2005. Chatsworth also runs two annual rural-skills weeks during which demonstrations of agricultural and forestry are given to groups of schoolchildren on the estate farms and woods.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Estate==\n[[File:ChatsworthWeir.jpg|thumb|Weir on the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] at the Chatsworth estate]]\n\nChatsworth is the hub of a {{convert|35,000|acre|km2|adj=on}} agricultural estate. The Chatsworth estate, together with {{convert|30,000|acre|km2}} around [[Bolton Abbey]] in Yorkshire (mostly moorland) and some land in [[Eastbourne]], belongs to The Trustees of Chatsworth Settlement, a family trust established in 1946. The Duke and other members of the family are entitled to the income. The family's {{convert|8,000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Lismore Castle]] estate in Ireland is held in a separate trust. The estate includes dozens of tenanted farms and over 450 houses and flats. There are five sub-estates scattered across Derbyshire:\n\n*'''The Main Estate''' is a compact block of {{convert|12,310|acres|0|abbr=on}} around the house, including the park and many properties in the villages of Baslow, Pilsley, Edensor, Beeley, and Calton Lees.\n*'''The West Estate''' is {{convert|6,498|acre|km2}} of scattered high ground, mostly in the [[Peak District]] and partly in [[Staffordshire]]. [[Hartington, Derbyshire|Hartington]], from which the family takes its secondary title is nearby.\n*'''The Shottle Estate''' is {{convert|3,519|acre|km2}} in and around [[Shottle]], which is around 15 miles (24&nbsp;km) south of Chatsworth. This is low-lying land and is home to most of the dairy farms on the estate, and also has some arable farms.\n*'''The Staveley Estate''' is {{convert|3,400|acre|km2}} at [[Staveley, Derbyshire|Staveley]] near [[Chesterfield]], including a {{convert|355|acre|km2}} industrial site called Staveley Works, which is let to various tenants, some woodlands, and arable farms.\n*'''The [[Scarcliffe]] Estate''', mostly arable farms, is {{convert|9,320|acre|km2}} east of Chesterfield.\n\nThe Chatsworth Settlement has a wide range of sources of income in addition to agricultural rents. Several thousand acres of the estate, mostly around Chatsworth and on the Staveley estate, are farmed in hand. A number of properties may be rented as holiday cottages, including Bess of Hardwick's Hunting Tower in the park. Several quarries produce limestone and other minerals.\n\nThe 11th Duke and Duchess did not opt for the \"theme park\" approach to modernising a country estate, but they did throw off the traditional aristocratic reluctance to participate in commerce. The Chatsworth Farm Shop is a very large enterprise in the UK, employing over a hundred people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About the farm shop |url=https://www.chatsworth.org/shopping-dining/farm-shop/about-the-farm-shop/ |website=Chatsworth |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2019|reason=nothing directly supporting number-of-peaple-employed}} A 90-seat restaurant opened at the farm shop in 2005. From 1999 to 2003 there was also a shop in the exclusive London district of [[Belgravia]], but it was not successful and closed down. The Settlement also runs the four shops and the catering operations at Chatsworth, paying a percentage of turnover to the charitable Chatsworth House Trust in lieu of rent. It also runs the Devonshire Arms Hotel and the Devonshire Fell Hotel & Bistro on the Bolton Abbey estate and owns the Cavendish Hotel at Baslow on the edge of Chatsworth Park, which is let to a tenant. The old kitchen garden at Barbrook on the edge of the park is let to the [[Caravan Club]], and a paddock at the southern end of the park where bucks used to be fattened for Chatsworth's table is a tenanted garden centre.
