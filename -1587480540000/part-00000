The cathedrals are notable particularly for their great height, and their extensive use of [[stained glass]] to fill the interiors with light.  They were the tallest and largest buildings of their time, and the most prominent examples of [[Gothic architecture]]. The appearance of the Gothic Cathedral was not only a revolution in architecture;  it also introduced new forms in decoration, sculpture, and art.\n\n[[Cathedrals]] were by definition churches where a [[bishop]] presided.  Abbeys were the churches attached to monasteries.  Many smaller [[parish]] churches were also built in the Gothic style. The appearance of the great cathedrals in the 12th century was a response to the dramatic increase of population and wealth in some parts of Europe, and the need for larger and more imposing buildings.  Technical advances, such an innovative uses of the  [[pointed arch]], [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], allowed the churches and cathedral to become much  taller, stronger, with larger windows and more light.\n\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France at the  [[Abbey of Saint Denis]], near Paris, with the rebuilding of the ambulatory and west facade  of the Abbey church by the Abbot [[Suger]] (1135\u201340).<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\">Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobile'' (2006), p. 36</ref>. The first Gothic cathedral in France,  [[Sens Cathedral]],  was begun between 1135 and 1140, and consecrated in 1164.  <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\nThe style quickly appeared in England, where it was called simply \"The French style.\"   The Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt by a French master builder from Sens,   [[William of Sens]] between 1174 and 1184.     Other elements of the style were imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also brought finely-cut stones from Normandy for their construction. \n\n[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] was begun in 1163, and consecrated in 1177.<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\"/>  The later part of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century saw a more refined style, characterised by [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  A third period, called ''Rayonnante'' in France, more highly decorated, as characterized by [[Sainte Chapelle]] (1241-1248) and [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France.  The fourth and final period, called ''Flamboyante'', appeared in the second half of the 14th century, taking its name from the flamelike motifs of decoration.  [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370), with its walls of stained glass, is a good example.\n\nRenaissance cathedrals and churches gradually replaced Gothic cathedrals, and the original cathedrals, such as Notre Dame, experienced many modifications or fell into ruin.   However, in the mid-19th century, in large part due to the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'', better known in English as [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], by  [[Victor Hugo]], there was a new wave of interest in the Gothic cathedral. Many Gothic cathedrals and churches were restored, with greater or lesser  accuracy.\n\n==Name==\nThe term [[cathedral]] came from the Greek ''cathedra'', or \"seat\", since it was the official seat of the Bishop, or ''Eveque'', and the principal church of the [[diocese]].   His title came from the Greek term ''Episkopos'', or \"he who sees.\"  As the leader of the [[diocese]]. The Bishop was considered the direct descendant of the [[Apostles]] or disciples of Christ, and had three missions: to direct the affairs of the church within the diocese, to administer the sacraments, and teach the [[Gospels]], or the message of Christ. The Bishop of a cathedral was assisted by the [[Canon (priest)|Canon]]s, or ''Chanoines' in French,   who formed a council called the Chapter.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'', (2015), pg. 4</ref>\n\nAt its time, it was called \"The French Style\"   The term \"Gothic\" was a very negative term invented in the late Renaissance by its critics, including the art historian and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].  They considered the style was barbaric, the opposite of the new Renaissance style that they favored.\n\n== Early Gothic Mid-12th century ==\n===Abbot Suger and the Basilica of Saint Denis===\n \t\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France in the mid-12th century in an [[Abbey]], [[St Denis Basilica]], built by Abbot [[Suger]] (1081-1151).  The old Basilica was the traditional burial place of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and of the Kings of France, and was also a very popular pilgrimage destination, so much so that pilgrims were sometimes crushed by the crowds.   Suger became the abbot of Saint Denis in 1122.  He became the friend and confident of two French Kings [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and  He served the Regent for Louis VII during the absence of the King for the [[Second Crusade]] (1147-49).  \n \t\nSuger, with the full support of the King, decided to enlarge the church and reconstruct it on a new model.  <ref name = universalis>''Dictionnaire des Architectes'', Encyclopedia Universalis (1999), pp. 659-663</ref>   His first modification was a new west facade, inspired in part by new churches is Normandy,  with two towers and three deep portals.   Each of the portals had a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of sculpture, telling a Biblical or inspiring story.  the tympana installed by Sugar depicted the Last Judgement over the main door and the Martyrdom of Saint Denis over the other door.   The tympana  over the east portals became a characteristic feature of later Gothic cathedrals. <ref>Mignon, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drale Gothiques'' (205), p. 9</ref> \n\nWhen the new facade was complete, Suger turned his attention to the choir and the ambulatory in the west of thehe Suger was also a scholar of the philosophy of [[Plato]], and he believed thet light was a way by which the faithful could be elevated from the material to the immaterial and the divine. The ambulatory of old church was very dark, since Romanesque architecture, with barrel vaults,  required thick walls and supporting walls  between the small chapels.  Suger decided to use a new form of vault, the [[rib vault]], with [[Pointed arch|pointed arches]], which was higher and stronger.  This allowed him to remove the walls between the chapels, and opened the space for seventy stained glass windows in the choir, filling the church with light. {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|page=9}} \n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration.

Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine, Aisne|Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n\n* '''[[Laon Cathedral]]''' was begun in about 1160. Like many early Gothic cathedrals, it retained some romanesque features, including tribunes over the side aisles, a use of both round a pointed arches, and a two story chapel on each arm of the transept. Like most early Gothic churches, it was not exceptionally bigh, but it was exceptional long, with eleven bays in the nave, and ten in the choir. Because it was not high, it was possible to build a square tower over the crossing of the transept, in addition to four shorter towers on the corners, each with long lancet openings. One curious feature are the sixteen life-sized sculpted oxen on towers, each under its own canopy, symbolizing the animals which hauled the stones to the site.  <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]] {begun 1160)\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]''' begun in 1163 by the archbishop [[Maurice de Sully]], was the largest and highest of the new French cathedrals. The nave was 122 meters long and the vaulted ceiling was 35 meters high, twelve meters higher than Laon Cathedral.  It used the older six-part [[rib vault]] in the ceiling, but replaced the alternating pillars and columns of earlier cathedrals with a single type of pillar, creating greater harmony. It made innovative use of [[flying buttress]] to counterbalance the weight of the higher vaults, so the walls could be thinner and have more windows. It had four levels, like the earlier cathedrals, but the old [[triforium]] was replaced by small rose windows. Unlike Laon Cathedral, the facade of Notre Dame, with its two towers, expressed a remarkable calm and harmony.Notre-Dame was modified in the later Gothic period, with the addition of the rose windows in the transepts (1250-1260) and double flying buttresses.    {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp. 18-19}}\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris 2013-07-24.jpg|The facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (begun 1163)\nFile:Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 22 June 2014 002.jpg|Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 122 meters long\n\n</gallery>\n\n=== Early English cathedrals and churches ===\nGothic elements, often called \"The French style\". soon appeared in English cathedrals and abbeys.  While English cathedrals tended to follow the French style, they had a few special charactersics of their own,  Unlike French cathedrals, they tended to great length rather than great height.  They also made extensive of [[Purbeck Marble]]  for columns, floors and wall panels, which added color and reflection to the interiors.  The early English style lasted from the late 12th century to the mid-14th century. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Early Gothic Architecture'', (retrieved April 19, 2020)</ref>\n* '''[[Canterbury Cathedral]]''' (Early Gothic portion - 1174-85) One of the earliest to use Gothic features in the French way was [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Following a fire in 1174 which destroyed much of the choir, a French master builder, [[William of Sens]], who probably had participated in the construction of [[Sens Cathedral]], was selected to conduct the reconstruction.  It was rebuilt between 1174 and 1184.  William of Sens himself fell fifty feet from the scaffolding and was seriously injured, and had to return to France, where he died in 1180. It was completed by sn English builder, [[William the Englishman]]. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line edition, \"William of Sens\", retrieved April 19, 2020</ref> While the choir is not as high some French cathedrals, it makes up for the difference by its dramatic length. The choir is 180 ft (55 m) long and 71 ft (22 m) high. \n\nThe nave and much of the rest of the cathedral were rebuilt into the [[perpendicular style]] beginning in the late 14th century. The new transepts and aisles were given the more decorative  [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]], where ribs were connected to each other for decorative rather than structural effect.  The crossing tower was begun in 1433, and is 23t feet (72 metes) high. Alterations to the Cathedral continued until 1834. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury-cathedral-wyrdlight.jpg|[[Canterbury Cathedral (1174-1834) The exterior was largely rebuilt into the perpendicular style in the 14th and 15th century. \nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]] (1174\u201384).

The builders made use of the Gothic [[rib vault]] in constructing the new nave and choir. These were replaced by the  more decorative [[lierne (vault)|lierne vault]] in the late 13th century.  Two  [[rose windows]], called the Bishops's Eye and the Dean's Eye, were added at about there same time.   The original cathedral had two towers on the wsst facade, and then  a central tower was built in the 14th century,  topped by a wooden spire, which made it the tallest structure in the world for two hundred years.  The other two towers were also given spires and raised in height. The great spire fell during a windstorm and was not replaced.\n \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Lincoln Cathedral viewed from Lincoln Castle.jpg| [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1192-1225)\nFile:Lincoln Cathedral Nave 1, Lincolnshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The elaborate vaults of the nave were added in the 1ate 12th and 13th century. \n</gallery>\n* '''[[Whitby Abbey]]  and [[Rievaulx Abbey]] ''' The early Gothic style was also used in the reconstruction of several English  [[abbeys]], notably the [[Benedictine]] [[Whitby Abbey]], and the [[Cistercian]] [[Rievaulx Abbey]], which had great importance at the time, though they were both built in secluded areas of the country far from the cites.

He transformed the country from a small feudal state to the most prosperous and powerful nation in Europe. He was also a great builder, constructing the [[Louvre Palace]] and the first wall around Paris, and founding the [[University of Paris]] (1215). <ref>''Petit Robert Dictipnnaire Universel des Noms Propres'' (1988), pg. 1409 </ref>   The new structures were larger and taller, and their forms were simplified and more balanced. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}  He was succeeded by [[Louis IX of France]], whose reign saw the construction of several great cathedrals, and his own remarkable chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]].  <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-century cathedral style in France is often called [[Rayonnant]]. The objective of the architects was larger windows and more lavish decoration rather than simply greater size.  The mid-level triforium gradually disappeared, and stained glass windows seemed to cover entire walls. The great monuments of the style included [[Amiens Cathedral]], the modified  [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and especially the royal chapel of Louis IX of France, [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (consecrated 1248). <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\n* ''' [[Chartres Cathedral]] ''' was constructed following the destruction by fire of the Romanesque cathedral in 1194, which left only the crypt, royal total an apse  intact. It was rapidly reconstructed, and was largely finished by 1221. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|pages=20-21}}. It surpassed Notre Dame de Paris both in length (130.2 meters) and height (36 meters). It had an immense transept which had its own collateral chapels. The choir was extended by a double disambulatory with three radiating chapels.  Chartres has a number of innovative features.  The traditional level of tribunes on both sides of the nave were removed, thanks to the strength and reach of the flying buttresses, reducing the number of levels from four to three.  This made room for a row of large windows, the same height as the ground-floor arcades, bringing much more light into the church, and a greater sensation of harmony.  Another innovation was the use of the simpler but stronger quadripartite [[rib vault]] instead of the six-part vaults of Notre Dame, which allowed greater height and a simpler arrangement of columns and pillars on the ground floor. {The cathedral was originally planned to have seven towers, but in the end had only two, from different periods.  {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}.  Another feature of Chartres was the use of walls painted white or in different colors. As of 2020, after the walls had been cleaned of soot and dirt, these colors are in the processs of being restored or recreated, a measure that has drawn some criticism. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/chartres-cathedral-clean-up-row-experts-divided-over-whether-dirt-should-be-left-in-place-to-keep-a6706627.html|title=Let there be light?

At Amiens the arcades on the ground floor are a full eighteen meters high, equaling the combined height of the triforium and clerestory above.  Amiens adopted the system of stained glass windows in chassis that was used at Reims, but went a step further. The high clerestory windows in the nave are composed of four lancet windows topped by two rosettes, while those in the transept have as many as eight lancets in single window. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=28}}   \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (1).JPG|[[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1220)\nFile:Amiens Cathedral choir Wikimedia Commons.jpg|Choir and altar of Amiens Cathedral\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Sainte-Chapelle]]''' (1241-48)  was the royal chapel constructed by [[Louis IX of France]] at his palace on the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]] in Paris to shelter the relics of the [[Passion of Christ]].

The Romanesque cathedral was destroyed by a fire in 1210. The Archbishop Aubrey de Humbert began a new cathedral in the Gothic style in 1211. The choir was finished in 1241.  Work on the facade did not begin until 1251, and was not finished until the 16th century.  It was heavily damaged in the [[First World War]], but restored  and reconsecrated in 1937. Like Chartres, the elevation has just three levels, giving more space for windows. The traditional tympanum on the facade was replaced by a large rose window, while the sculpture usually on the tympanum was moved to the inside of the facade.  Another innovation at the Reims was the placement of each stained glass windows in a large separate ''chassis'', or frame, rather than directly into the wall, which allowed much more complex patterns.   Another innovation was the placement of statues of angels sheltered in the pinnacles atop the flying buttresses.  In all, Reims has more than 2300 statues in its decoration. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=26}}  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Facade de Notre Dame de Reims.png|Facade of [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211 to the 16th century)\nFile:Reims Cathedrale Notre Dame interior 002.JPG|Western rose window\n</gallery>\n* ''' [[Beauvais Cathedral]] ''' had an unfortunate history.

The simple and functional quadrapartite [[rib vault]] was  replaced by more elaborate [[lierne]] vault and fan fault, whose ribs were largely decorative. <ref>Encyclop\u00e6edia Britannica on-line, \"High Gothic\" (retrieved April 20, 2020)</ref>\n\n[[Henry III of England]] (1207-72) was an important patron of this new style, both with additions to [[Westminster Abbey]] (after 1245) and in the east end of [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]] (1258).

The cathedrals are notable particularly for their great height, and their extensive use of [[stained glass]] to fill the interiors with light.  They were the tallest and largest buildings of their time, and the most prominent examples of [[Gothic architecture]]. The appearance of the Gothic Cathedral was not only a revolution in architecture;  it also introduced new forms in decoration, sculpture, and art.\n\n[[Cathedrals]] were by definition churches where a [[bishop]] presided.  Abbeys were the churches attached to monasteries.  Many smaller [[parish]] churches were also built in the Gothic style. The appearance of the great cathedrals in the 12th century was a response to the dramatic increase of population and wealth in some parts of Europe, and the need for larger and more imposing buildings.  Technical advances, such an innovative uses of the  [[pointed arch]], [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], allowed the churches and cathedral to become much  taller, stronger, with larger windows and more light.\n\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France at the  [[Abbey of Saint Denis]], near Paris, with the rebuilding of the ambulatory and west facade  of the Abbey church by the Abbot [[Suger]] (1135\u201340).<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\">Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobile'' (2006), p. 36</ref>. The first Gothic cathedral in France,  [[Sens Cathedral]],  was begun between 1135 and 1140, and consecrated in 1164.  <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\nThe style quickly appeared in England, where it was called simply \"The French style.\"   The Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt by a French master builder from Sens,   [[William of Sens]] between 1174 and 1184.     Other elements of the style were imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also brought finely-cut stones from Normandy for their construction. \n\n[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] was begun in 1163, and consecrated in 1177.<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\"/>  The later part of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century saw a more refined style, characterised by [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  A third period, called ''Rayonnante'' in France, more highly decorated, as characterized by [[Sainte Chapelle]] (1241-1248) and [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France.  The fourth and final period, called ''Flamboyante'', appeared in the second half of the 14th century, taking its name from the flamelike motifs of decoration.  [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370), with its walls of stained glass, is a good example.\n\nRenaissance cathedrals and churches gradually replaced Gothic cathedrals, and the original cathedrals, such as Notre Dame, experienced many modifications or fell into ruin.   However, in the mid-19th century, in large part due to the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'', better known in English as [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], by  [[Victor Hugo]], there was a new wave of interest in the Gothic cathedral. Many Gothic cathedrals and churches were restored, with greater or lesser  accuracy.\n\n==Name==\nThe term [[cathedral]] came from the Greek ''cathedra'', or \"seat\", since it was the official seat of the Bishop, or ''Eveque'', and the principal church of the [[diocese]].   His title came from the Greek term ''Episkopos'', or \"he who sees.\"  As the leader of the [[diocese]]. The Bishop was considered the direct descendant of the [[Apostles]] or disciples of Christ, and had three missions: to direct the affairs of the church within the diocese, to administer the sacraments, and teach the [[Gospels]], or the message of Christ. The Bishop of a cathedral was assisted by the [[Canons]], or ''Chanoines' in French,   who formed a council called the Chapter.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'', (2015), pg. 4</ref>\n\nAt its time, it was called \"The French Style\"   The term \"Gothic\" was a very negative term invented in the late Renaissance by its critics, including the art historian and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].  They considered the style was barbaric, the opposite of the new Renaissance style that they favored.\n\n== Early Gothic Mid-12th century ==\n===Abbot Suger and the Basilica of Saint Denis===\n \t\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France in the mid-12th century in an [[Abbey]], [[St Denis Basilica]], built by Abbot [[Suger]] (1081-1151).  The old Basilica was the traditional burial place of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and of the Kings of France, and was also a very popular pilgrimage destination, so much so that pilgrims were sometimes crushed by the crowds.   Suger became the abbot of Saint Denis in 1122.  He became the friend and confident of two French Kings [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and  He served the Regent for Louis VII during the absence of the King for the [[Second Crusade]] (1147-49).  \n \t\nSuger, with the full support of the King, decided to enlarge the church and reconstruct it on a new model.  <ref name = universalis>''Dictionnaire des Architectes'', Encyclopedia Universalis (1999), pp. 659-663</ref>   His first modification was a new west facade, inspired in part by new churches is Normandy,  with two towers and three deep portals.   Each of the portals had a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of sculpture, telling a Biblical or inspiring story.  the tympana installed by Sugar depicted the Last Judgement over the main door and the Martyrdom of Saint Denis over the other door.   The tympana  over the east portals became a characteristic feature of later Gothic cathedrals. <ref>Mignon, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drale Gothiques'' (205), p. 9</ref> \n\nWhen the new facade was complete, Suger turned his attention to the choir and the ambulatory in the west of thehe Suger was also a scholar of the philosophy of [[Plato]], and he believed thet light was a way by which the faithful could be elevated from the material to the immaterial and the divine. The ambulatory of old church was very dark, since Romanesque architecture, with barrel vaults,  required thick walls and supporting walls  between the small chapels.  Suger decided to use a new form of vault, the [[rib vault]], with [[Pointed arch|pointed arches]], which was higher and stronger.  This allowed him to remove the walls between the chapels, and opened the space for seventy stained glass windows in the choir, filling the church with light. {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|page=9}} \n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration.

Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n\n* '''[[Laon Cathedral]]''' was begun in about 1160. Like many early Gothic cathedrals, it retained some romanesque features, including tribunes over the side aisles, a use of both round a pointed arches, and a two story chapel on each arm of the transept. Like most early Gothic churches, it was not exceptionally bigh, but it was exceptional long, with eleven bays in the nave, and ten in the choir. Because it was not high, it was possible to build a square tower over the crossing of the transept, in addition to four shorter towers on the corners, each with long lancet openings. One curious feature are the sixteen life-sized sculpted oxen on towers, each under its own canopy, symbolizing the animals which hauled the stones to the site.  <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]] {begun 1160)\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]''' begun in 1163 by the archbishop [[Maurice de Sully]], was the largest and highest of the new French cathedrals. The nave was 122 meters long and the vaulted ceiling was 35 meters high, twelve meters higher than Laon Cathedral.  It used the older six-part [[rib vault]] in the ceiling, but replaced the alternating pillars and columns of earlier cathedrals with a single type of pillar, creating greater harmony. It made innovative use of [[flying buttress]] to counterbalance the weight of the higher vaults, so the walls could be thinner and have more windows. It had four levels, like the earlier cathedrals, but the old [[triforium]] was replaced by small rose windows. Unlike Laon Cathedral, the facade of Notre Dame, with its two towers, expressed a remarkable calm and harmony.Notre-Dame was modified in the later Gothic period, with the addition of the rose windows in the transepts (1250-1260) and double flying buttresses.    {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp. 18-19}}\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris 2013-07-24.jpg|The facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (begun 1163)\nFile:Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 22 June 2014 002.jpg|Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 122 meters long\n\n</gallery>\n\n=== Early English cathedrals and churches ===\nGothic elements, often called \"The French style\". soon appeared in English cathedrals and abbeys.  While English cathedrals tended to follow the French style, they had a few special charactersics of their own,  Unlike French cathedrals, they tended to great length rather than great height.  They also made extensive of [[Purbeck Marble]]  for columns, floors and wall panels, which added color and reflection to the interiors.  The early English style lasted from the late 12th century to the mid-14th century. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Early Gothic Architecture'', (retrieved April 19, 2020)</ref>\n* '''[[Canterbury Cathedral]]''' (Early Gothic portion - 1174-85) One of the earliest to use Gothic features in the French way was [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Following a fire in 1174 which destroyed much of the choir, a French master builder, [[William of Sens]], who probably had participated in the construction of [[Sens Cathedral]], was selected to conduct the reconstruction.  It was rebuilt between 1174 and 1184.  William of Sens himself fell fifty feet from the scaffolding and was seriously injured, and had to return to France, where he died in 1180. It was completed by sn English builder, [[William the Englishman]]. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line edition, \"William of Sens\", retrieved April 19, 2020</ref> While the choir is not as high some French cathedrals, it makes up for the difference by its dramatic length. The choir is 180 ft (55 m) long and 71 ft (22 m) high. \n\nThe nave and much of the rest of the cathedral were rebuilt into the [[perpendicular style]] beginning in the late 14th century. The new transepts and aisles were given the more decorative  [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]], where ribs were connected to each other for decorative rather than structural effect.  The crossing tower was begun in 1433, and is 23t feet (72 metes) high.

Two  [[rose windows]], called the Bishops's Eye and the Dean's Eye, were added at about there same time.   The original cathedral had two towers on the wsst facade, and then  a central tower was built in the 14th century,  topped by a wooden spire, which made it the tallest structure in the world for two hundred years.  The other two towers were also given spires and raised in height.

He transformed the country from a small feudal state to the most prosperous and powerful nation in Europe. He was also a great builder, constructing the [[Louvre Palace]] and the first wall around Paris, and founding the [[University of Paris]] (1215). <ref>''Petit Robert Dictipnnaire Universel des Noms Propres'' (1988), pg. 1409 </ref>   The new structures were larger and taller, and their forms were simplified and more balanced. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}  He was succeeded by [[Louis IX of France]], whose reign saw the construction of several great cathedrals, and his own remarkable chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]].  <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-century cathedral style in France is often called [[Rayonnant]]. The objective of the architects was larger windows and more lavish decoration rather than simply greater size.  The mid-level triforium gradually disappeared, and stained glass windows seemed to cover entire walls. The great monuments of the style included [[Amiens Cathedral]], the modified  [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and especially the royal chapel of Louis IX of France, [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (consecrated 1248). <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\n* ''' [[Chartres Cathedral]] ''' was constructed following the destruction by fire of the Romanesque cathedral in 1194, which left only the crypt, royal total an apse  intact. It was rapidly reconstructed, and was largely finished by 1221. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|pages=20-21}}. It surpassed Notre Dame de Paris both in length (130.2 meters) and height (36 meters). It had an immense transept which had its own collateral chapels. The choir was extended by a double disambulatory with three radiating chapels.  Chartres has a number of innovative features.  The traditional level of tribunes on both sides of the nave were removed, thanks to the strength and reach of the flying buttresses, reducing the number of levels from four to three.  This made room for a row of large windows, the same height as the ground-floor arcades, bringing much more light into the church, and a greater sensation of harmony.  Another innovation was the use of the simpler but stronger quadripartite [[rib vault]] instead of the six-part vaults of Notre Dame, which allowed greater height and a simpler arrangement of columns and pillars on the ground floor. {The cathedral was originally planned to have seven towers, but in the end had only two, from different periods.  {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}.  Another feature of Chartres was the use of walls painted white or in different colors. As of 2020, after the walls had been cleaned of soot and dirt, these colors are in the processs of being restored or recreated, a measure that has drawn some criticism. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/chartres-cathedral-clean-up-row-experts-divided-over-whether-dirt-should-be-left-in-place-to-keep-a6706627.html|title=Let there be light?

Longer and stronger flying buttresses were added to support the choir, which allowed thinner walls, and larger windows were added to clerestory.

Its nave is 145 meters long and 70 meters wide at the transept. Its elevation copied Chartres in having just three, not four levels, but the plan was very different.  At Amiens the arcades on the ground floor are a full eighteen meters high, equaling the combined height of the triforium and clerestory above.  Amiens adopted the system of stained glass windows in chassis that was used at Reims, but went a step further. The high clerestory windows in the nave are composed of four lancet windows topped by two rosettes, while those in the transept have as many as eight lancets in single window. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=28}}   \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (1).JPG|[[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1220)\nFile:Amiens Cathedral choir Wikimedia Commons.jpg|Choir and altar of Amiens Cathedral\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Sainte-Chapelle]]''' (1241-48)  was the royal chapel constructed by [[Louis IX of France]] at his palace on the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]] in Paris to shelter the relics of the [[Passion of Christ]]. It is composed of a lower chapel, used by the Palace and the Court, and an upper chapel, where the relics were kept, where the walls are filled with an exception array of stained glass windows.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', (2002) Centre des Monuments National, pg. 297</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Sainte Chapelle - Upper level 1.jpg|Upper chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (1241-48)\n</gallery>\n* ''' [[Reims Cathedral]] ''' had the special distinction asthe coronation church for the Kings of France. The Romanesque cathedral was destroyed by a fire in 1210. The Archbishop Aubrey de Humbert began a new cathedral in the Gothic style in 1211. The choir was finished in 1241.  Work on the facade did not begin until 1251, and was not finished until the 16th century.  It was heavily damaged in the [[First World War]], but restored  and reconsecrated in 1937. Like Chartres, the elevation has just three levels, giving more space for windows. The traditional tympanum on the facade was replaced by a large rose window, while the sculpture usually on the tympanum was moved to the inside of the facade.  Another innovation at the Reims was the placement of each stained glass windows in a large separate ''chassis'', or frame, rather than directly into the wall, which allowed much more complex patterns.   Another innovation was the placement of statues of angels sheltered in the pinnacles atop the flying buttresses.  In all, Reims has more than 2300 statues in its decoration. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=26}}  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Facade de Notre Dame de Reims.png|Facade of [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211 to the 16th century)\nFile:Reims Cathedrale Notre Dame interior 002.JPG|Western rose window\n</gallery>\n* ''' [[Beauvais Cathedral]] ''' had an unfortunate history.  After a fire in 1225 destroyed the old cathedral, The Bishop Milon de Nanteuil proposed to construct the tallest cathedral of all.  The choir, forty meters high,  was finished in 1272, but collapsed in 1284.  It was rebuilt with reinforced pillars vaults with additional rib in the 14th century. The transept was completed in the 1560s, and was capped with a stone and wood spire, 150 meters high.  Unfortunately, the spire collapsed in 1573, and the cathedral was left unfinished, with only the choir and transept.{{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=29}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Beauvais Cathedral Exterior 1, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg|The unfinished [[Beauvais Cathedral]] (1225 - 1272)\nFile:Picardie Beauvais2 tango7174.jpg|Choir of Beauvais Cathedral\n</gallery>\n\n=== England - Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic ===\nIn England, the second period of Gothic cathedrals is often called [[Decorated Gothic]], as the decoration inside and outside became more elaborate, blurred the lines and overshadowed the architecture.  It lasted from about the mid-thirteenth to the mid-fourteenth century.  The simple and functional quadrapartite [[rib vault]] was  replaced by more elaborate [[lierne]] vault and fan fault, whose ribs were largely decorative. <ref>Encyclop\u00e6edia Britannica on-line, \"High Gothic\" (retrieved April 20, 2020)</ref>\n\n[[Henry III of England]] (1207-72) was an important patron of this new style, both with additions to [[Westminster Abbey]] (after 1245) and in the east end of [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]] (1258). Some of his projects appear to have been be inspired by [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in France, built by Henry's brother-in-law, [[Louis IX of France]]. <ref>Encyclop\u00e6edia Britannica on-line, \"High Gothic\" (retrieved April 20, 2020)</ref> \n\nThe second part of this period in England is often called [[Perpendicular]], because of its strong emphasis on the appearance of height. \n\n* ''' [[Lincoln Cathedral]] ''' . The (Angel Choir), (begun 1256, dedicated in 1280) was a notable early example of decorated Gothic. The new style was expressed in decorative ribs of the [[lierne]] vaults and especially in the elaborate [[tracery]] of the stained glass windows. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Angel Choir - geograph.org.uk - 718449.jpg|The Angel Choir of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1256-1280)\n</gallery>\n* '''[[York Minster]]  '''was reconstructed beginning in 1220 on the foundations of the old Norman cathedral, with the intention of rivalling [[Canterbury Cathedral]], then under construction.

Beginning in the mid-15th century, it was largely rebuilt and redecorated in the Flamboyant stye, with a new choir a cupola with star vaulting, a latern tower, and new portals, grills and choir stalls. The new work was not completed until 1567.  The Burgos workshop continued to train Spanish sculptors and artisans.

Approximately 90% of Mauritania's land is within the [[Sahara]]; consequently, the population is concentrated in the south, where precipitation is slightly higher.

On 16 April 2009, Aziz resigned from the military to run for president in the 19 July elections, which he won.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/world/africa/20mauritania.html?_r=0|title=Coup Leader Wins Election Amid Outcry in Mauritania|agency=[[Associated Press]] (AP)|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=19 July 2009|location= Nouakchott, Mauritania |accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Names and pronunciation==\nMauritania ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Mauritania.ogg|\u02cc|m|\u0252r|\u026a|\u02c8|t|e\u026a|n|i|\u0259|,_|\u02cc|m|\u0254\u02d0r|\u026a|-}};<ref name=\":0\">{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}</ref> ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0648\u0631\u064a\u062a\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627}}, ''{{transl|ar|M\u016br\u012bt\u0101ny\u0101}}'', {{lang-fr|Mauritanie}}) is officially known as the '''Islamic Republic of Mauritania''' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0631\u064a\u062a\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629}}).

Mauritania was part of [[French West Africa]] from 1920, as a [[protectorate]] and, then, a [[colony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/world/mauritania-history.html|title=Mauritania: History|website=www.infoplease.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>\n\nFrench rule brought legal prohibitions against slavery and an end to inter-clan warfare. During the colonial period, 90% of the population remained nomadic. Many sedentary peoples, whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier, began to trickle back into Mauritania. The previous capital of the country under the French rule, [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], was located in Senegal, so when the country gained independence in 1960, Nouakchott, at the time little more than a fortified village (''\"ksar\"''), was chosen as the site of the new capital of Mauritania.<ref name=\"Pazzanita2008\">{{cite book|author=Pazzanita, Anthony G. |title=Historical Dictionary of Mauritania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KU_9MfXKKYC&pg=PA369|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-6265-4}} page 369.</ref>\n\nAfter gaining independence, larger numbers of indigenous [[Sub-Saharan African]] peoples ([[Fula people|Haalpulaar]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], and [[Wolof people|Wolof]]) entered Mauritania, moving into the area north of the [[Senegal River]].

This occurred as the French militarily suppressed the most intransigent Hassane tribes in the north. This changed the former balance of power, and new conflicts arose between the southern populations and Moors.

Its claims were taken over by Morocco.\n\nDue to economic weakness, Mauritania has been a negligible player in the territorial dispute, with its official position being that it wishes for an expedient solution that is mutually agreeable to all parties. While most of Western Sahara has been occupied by Morocco, the UN still considers the Western Sahara a territory that needs to express its wishes with respect to statehood. A referendum is still supposed to be held at some point in the future, under UN auspices, to determine whether or not the indigenous [[Sahrawis]] wish to be independent, as the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], or to be part of Morocco.\n\n===Ould Daddah era (1960\u20131978)===\n{{Main|Constitution of Mauritania|Mauritanian People's Party|Moktar Ould Daddah}}\n<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->\nMauritania became an independent nation in November 1960.<ref>{{citation|first= Martin |last= Meredith |title= The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence|publisher= Public Affairs Publishing|location= New York|year= 2005|page= 69|isbn=978-1610390712}}</ref> In 1964 [[President of Mauritania|President]] [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], originally installed by the French, formalized Mauritania as a [[one-party state]] with a new [[Constitution of Mauritania|constitution]], setting up an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] presidential regime. Daddah's own [[Parti du Peuple Mauritanien]] (PPM) became the ruling organization in a [[One-party state|one-party system]]. The President justified this on the grounds that Mauritania was not ready for western-style [[multi-party system|multi-party democracy]]. Under this one-party constitution, Daddah was reelected in uncontested elections in 1976 and 1978.\n\nDaddah was ousted in a [[Military Committee for National Recovery|bloodless coup]] on 10 July 1978. He had brought the country to near-collapse through the disastrous [[History of Western Sahara|war]] to [[annexation|annex]] the [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|southern part]] of [[Western Sahara]], framed as an attempt to create a \"[[Greater Mauritania]]\".\n\n===CMRN and CMSN military governments (1978\u20131984)===\n[[File:Chinguetti-Guide.JPG|thumb|[[Chinguetti]] was a center of Islamic scholarship in West Africa.]]\n[[Col.]] [[Mustafa Ould Salek]]'s [[CMRN]] [[military junta|''junta'']] proved incapable of either establishing a strong base of power or extracting the country from its destabilizing conflict with the [[Western Sahara|Sahrawi]] resistance movement, the [[Polisario Front]]. It quickly fell, to be replaced by another military government, the [[Military Committee for National Salvation|CMSN]].\n\nThe energetic Colonel [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah]] soon emerged as its strongman. By giving up all claims to Western Sahara, he found peace with the Polisario and improved relations with its main backer, Algeria. But relations with Morocco, the other party to the conflict, and its European ally France deteriorated. Instability continued, and Haidallah's ambitious reform attempts foundered. His regime was plagued by attempted coups and intrigue within the military establishment. It became increasingly contested due to his harsh and uncompromising measures against opponents; many dissidents were jailed, and some executed. In 1981 slavery was formally abolished by law, making Mauritania the last country in the world to do so.\n\n===Ould Taya's rule (1984\u20132005)===\nIn December 1984, Haidallah was deposed by Colonel [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]], who, while retaining tight military control, relaxed the political climate. Ould Taya moderated Mauritania's previous pro-Algerian stance, and re-established ties with Morocco during the late 1980s. He deepened these ties during the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of Mauritania's drive to attract support from Western states and Western-aligned Arab states. Mauritania has not rescinded its recognition of Polisario's Western Saharan exile government, and remains on good terms with Algeria. Its position on the Western Sahara conflict is, since the 1980s, one of strict neutrality.\n\nOrdinance 83.127, enacted 5 June 1983, launched the process of nationalization of all land not clearly the property of a documented owner, thus abolishing the traditional system of land tenure.

President Taya won elections in 1992 and 1997. Most opposition parties boycotted the first legislative election in 1992. For nearly a decade the parliament was dominated by the PRDS.

During the mid-to late 1990s, Mauritania shifted its foreign policy to one of increased co-operation with the US and Europe. It was rewarded with diplomatic normalization and aid projects. On 28 October 1999, Mauritania joined Egypt, Palestine, and Jordan as the only members of the Arab League to officially recognize Israel.

The leaders of the attempted coup escaped from the country, but some of them were caught, later on. Mauritania's [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2003|presidential election]], its third since adopting the democratic process in 1992, took place on 7 November 2003. Six candidates, including Mauritania's first female and first Haratine (descended from former [[Slavery in Mauritania|slaves]]) candidates, represented a wide variety of political goals and backgrounds.

The coup proceeded without loss of life.

However, Abdel Aziz's regime was isolated internationally, and became subject to diplomatic sanctions and the cancellation of some aid projects. It found few foreign supporters (among them Morocco, Libya and Iran), while Algeria, the United States, France and other European countries criticized the coup, and continued to refer to Abdallahi as the legitimate president of Mauritania. Domestically, a group of parties coalesced around Abdallahi to continue protesting the coup, which caused the junta to ban demonstrations and crack down on opposition activists. International and internal pressure eventually forced the release of Abdallahi, who was instead placed under house arrest in his home village. The new government broke off relations with Israel. In March 2010, Mauritania's female foreign minister Mint Hamdi Ould Mouknass announced that Mauritania had cut ties with Israel in a \"complete and definitive way.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Mauritania-Affirms-Break-with-Israel-88763857.html |title=Mauritania Affirms Break with Israel |publisher=Voice of America News |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328205455/http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Mauritania-Affirms-Break-with-Israel-88763857.html |archive-date=28 March 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter the coup, Abdel Aziz insisted on holding new presidential elections to replace Abdallahi, but was forced to reschedule them due to internal and international opposition. During the spring of 2009, the [[Military junta|junta]] negotiated an understanding with some opposition figures and international parties. As a result, Abdallahi formally resigned under protest, as it became clear that some opposition forces had defected from him and most international players, notably including France and Algeria, now aligned with Abdel Aziz. The United States continued to criticize the coup, but did not actively oppose the elections.\n\nAbdallahi's resignation allowed the [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2009|election]] of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority. Many of Abdallahi's former supporters criticized this as a political ploy and refused to recognize the results. They argued that the election had been falsified due to junta control, and complained that the international community had let down the opposition. Despite complaints, the elections were almost unanimously accepted by Western, Arab and African countries, which lifted sanctions and resumed relations with Mauritania. By late summer, Abdel Aziz appeared to have secured his position and to have gained widespread international and internal support. Some figures, such as Senate chairman [[Messaoud Ould Boulkheir]], continued to refuse the new order and call for Abdel Aziz's resignation.\n\nIn February 2011, the waves of the [[Arab Spring]] [[2011\u201312 Mauritanian protests|spread to Mauritania]], where thousands of people took to the streets of the capital.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/feb/25/gaddafi-libya-live-blog |location=London |work=The Guardian |first= Richard |last= Adams |title=Libya's turmoil |date=25 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2014, Mauritania was invited as a non-member guest nation to the G20 summit in Brisbane.\n\n== Society ==\n=== Demographics ===\n{{Main|Demographics of Mauritania}}\n[[File:Adrar-Mother&daughter.JPG|thumb|A [[Moors|Moorish]] family in the [[Adrar Region|Adrar Plateau]].]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\"|Population{{UN_Population|ref}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Million\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1950 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|0.7\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|2.7\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{UN_Population|Year}} ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Mauritania}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}}\n|} \n{{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}}}, Mauritania had a population of approximately 4.3 million.

While most of Western Sahara has been occupied by Morocco, the UN still considers the Western Sahara a territory that needs to express its wishes with respect to statehood.

Daddah's own [[Parti du Peuple Mauritanien]] (PPM) became the ruling organization in a [[One-party state|one-party system]]. The President justified this on the grounds that Mauritania was not ready for western-style [[multi-party system|multi-party democracy]]. Under this one-party constitution, Daddah was reelected in uncontested elections in 1976 and 1978.\n\nDaddah was ousted in a [[Military Committee for National Recovery|bloodless coup]] on 10 July 1978.

It quickly fell, to be replaced by another military government, the [[Military Committee for National Salvation|CMSN]].\n\nThe energetic Colonel [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah]] soon emerged as its strongman. By giving up all claims to Western Sahara, he found peace with the Polisario and improved relations with its main backer, Algeria. But relations with Morocco, the other party to the conflict, and its European ally France deteriorated. Instability continued, and Haidallah's ambitious reform attempts foundered. His regime was plagued by attempted coups and intrigue within the military establishment. It became increasingly contested due to his harsh and uncompromising measures against opponents; many dissidents were jailed, and some executed. In 1981 slavery was formally abolished by law, making Mauritania the last country in the world to do so.\n\n===Ould Taya's rule (1984\u20132005)===\nIn December 1984, Haidallah was deposed by Colonel [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]], who, while retaining tight military control, relaxed the political climate. Ould Taya moderated Mauritania's previous pro-Algerian stance, and re-established ties with Morocco during the late 1980s. He deepened these ties during the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of Mauritania's drive to attract support from Western states and Western-aligned Arab states. Mauritania has not rescinded its recognition of Polisario's Western Saharan exile government, and remains on good terms with Algeria. Its position on the Western Sahara conflict is, since the 1980s, one of strict neutrality.\n\nOrdinance 83.127, enacted 5 June 1983, launched the process of nationalization of all land not clearly the property of a documented owner, thus abolishing the traditional system of land tenure.

Ould Taya also started co-operating with the United States in anti-terrorism activities, a policy which was criticized by some human rights organizations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/11/23/backlash.forusally.ap/ |title=Crackdown courts U.S. approval |publisher=CNN |date=24 November 2003 |accessdate=6 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407090221/http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/11/23/backlash.forusally.ap/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=47093 |title=Mauritania: New wave of arrests presented as crackdown on Islamic extremists |publisher=IRIN Africa |date=12 May 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2008}}</ref> (See also [[Foreign relations of Mauritania]].)\n\n[[File:Road from Nouakchott to Mauritanian.jpg|thumb|Road from Nouakchott to the Mauritanian\u2013Senegalese border]]\nA group of current and former Army officers launched a violent and unsuccessful coup attempt on 8 June 2003. The leaders of the attempted coup escaped from the country, but some of them were caught, later on. Mauritania's [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2003|presidential election]], its third since adopting the democratic process in 1992, took place on 7 November 2003. Six candidates, including Mauritania's first female and first Haratine (descended from former [[Slavery in Mauritania|slaves]]) candidates, represented a wide variety of political goals and backgrounds. Incumbent President [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]] won reelection with 67.0% of the popular vote, according to the official figures, with [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla]] finishing second.\n\n===August 2005 military coup===\n<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->\nOn 3 August 2005, a military coup led by Colonel [[Ely Ould Mohamed Vall]] ended Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's twenty-one years of rule. Taking advantage of Taya's attendance at the funeral of [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] [[King Fahd]], the military, including members of the presidential guard, seized control of key points in the capital [[Nouakchott]]. The coup proceeded without loss of life. Calling themselves the Military Council for Justice and Democracy, the officers released the following statement:\n\n:\"The national armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the oppressive activities of the defunct authority, which our people have suffered from during the past years.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4741243.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Mauritania officers 'seize power' |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Military Council later issued another statement naming Colonel Vall as president and director of the national police force, the ''S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nationale''. Vall, once regarded as a firm ally of the now-ousted president, had aided Taya in the coup that had originally brought him to power, and had later served as his security chief. Sixteen other officers were listed as members of the Council.\n\nThough cautiously watched by the international community, the coup came to be generally accepted, with the military ''junta'' organizing elections within a promised two-year timeline. In a [[referendum]] on 26 June 2006, Mauritanians overwhelmingly (97%) approved a new constitution which limited the duration of a president's stay in office. The leader of the ''junta'', Col. Vall, promised to abide by the referendum and relinquish power peacefully. Mauritania's establishment of relations with [[Israel]]{{spaced ndash}}it is one of only three Arab states to recognize Israel{{spaced ndash}}was maintained by the new regime, despite widespread criticism from the opposition. They considered that position as a legacy of the Taya regime's attempts to curry favor with the West.\n\nParliamentary and municipal elections in Mauritania took place on 19 November and 3 December 2006.\n\n===2007 presidential elections===\n[[File:Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi.jpg|thumb|[[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]]]]\nMauritania's first fully democratic presidential elections took place on 11 March 2007.

However, Abdel Aziz's regime was isolated internationally, and became subject to diplomatic sanctions and the cancellation of some aid projects. It found few foreign supporters (among them Morocco, Libya and Iran), while Algeria, the United States, France and other European countries criticized the coup, and continued to refer to Abdallahi as the legitimate president of Mauritania. Domestically, a group of parties coalesced around Abdallahi to continue protesting the coup, which caused the junta to ban demonstrations and crack down on opposition activists. International and internal pressure eventually forced the release of Abdallahi, who was instead placed under house arrest in his home village. The new government broke off relations with Israel. In March 2010, Mauritania's female foreign minister Mint Hamdi Ould Mouknass announced that Mauritania had cut ties with Israel in a \"complete and definitive way.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Mauritania-Affirms-Break-with-Israel-88763857.html |title=Mauritania Affirms Break with Israel |publisher=Voice of America News |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328205455/http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Mauritania-Affirms-Break-with-Israel-88763857.html |archive-date=28 March 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter the coup, Abdel Aziz insisted on holding new presidential elections to replace Abdallahi, but was forced to reschedule them due to internal and international opposition. During the spring of 2009, the [[Military junta|junta]] negotiated an understanding with some opposition figures and international parties. As a result, Abdallahi formally resigned under protest, as it became clear that some opposition forces had defected from him and most international players, notably including France and Algeria, now aligned with Abdel Aziz. The United States continued to criticize the coup, but did not actively oppose the elections.\n\nAbdallahi's resignation allowed the [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2009|election]] of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority. Many of Abdallahi's former supporters criticized this as a political ploy and refused to recognize the results. They argued that the election had been falsified due to junta control, and complained that the international community had let down the opposition. Despite complaints, the elections were almost unanimously accepted by Western, Arab and African countries, which lifted sanctions and resumed relations with Mauritania. By late summer, Abdel Aziz appeared to have secured his position and to have gained widespread international and internal support. Some figures, such as Senate chairman [[Messaoud Ould Boulkheir]], continued to refuse the new order and call for Abdel Aziz's resignation.\n\nIn February 2011, the waves of the [[Arab Spring]] [[2011\u201312 Mauritanian protests|spread to Mauritania]], where thousands of people took to the streets of the capital.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/feb/25/gaddafi-libya-live-blog |location=London |work=The Guardian |first= Richard |last= Adams |title=Libya's turmoil |date=25 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2014, Mauritania was invited as a non-member guest nation to the G20 summit in Brisbane.\n\n== Society ==\n=== Demographics ===\n{{Main|Demographics of Mauritania}}\n[[File:Adrar-Mother&daughter.JPG|thumb|A [[Moors|Moorish]] family in the [[Adrar Region|Adrar Plateau]].]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\"|Population{{UN_Population|ref}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Million\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1950 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|0.7\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|2.7\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{UN_Population|Year}} ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Mauritania}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}}\n|} \n{{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}}}, Mauritania had a population of approximately 4.3 million.

He is the most decorated Freestyle Motocross rider in [[X Games]] history. With 10 total medals (3 Golds and 7 Bronzes), he is the only rider to compete in at least 1 event in every X Games. He became a born again Christian after a near fatal crash in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Matt|title=Some X Games Bad Boys Turn to the Bible|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/sports/02xgames.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n[[File:Brian Deegan jumping at X Games 17 in Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|[[X Games]] 17 in Los Angeles]]\nDeegan was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].  He became a pro supercross rider with Team Moto XXX at age 17. In 1997 at the LA Coliseum, Brian Deegan won the 125cc main and in true rebel fashion, ghost rode his bike across the finish line. This was the beginning of what we know today as Freestyle Motocross.\n\nIn 2004, at the Winter X Games, Deegan crashed while attempting a 360 over a 100&nbsp;ft snow double, breaking his [[femur]] and both wrists. He came back 6 months later to place fourth at the Summer X Games. Deegan was also the first rider ever to land a 360 (Mulisha Twist) in competition.\n\nSwitching to [[off-road racing|four wheels]] in 2009, Deegan ventured into short course off-road racing in the [[Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series]]' Unlimited Lites division, winning the championship over experienced drivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racerxonline.com/article/brian-deegan-wins-off-road-championship.aspx|title=Brian Deegan Wins Off-Road Championship|date=November 16, 2009|publisher=Racer X Online|accessdate=2 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120050819/http://www.racerxonline.com/article/brian-deegan-wins-off-road-championship.aspx|archive-date=20 November 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2010 X Games, Deegan competed in the Rally Car Racing event at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Deegan finished second behind Tanner Foust due to a wrong turn he made during the race. Brian also competed in Rally Car Super Rally where he also finished second behind Tanner Foust.\n\nAt X Games XVII, Deegan won gold in RallyCross.\n\nIn 2011, he won the World Championship race at [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]] in the [[Traxxas TORC Series]]. He also competed at the [[2011 Race of Champions|Race of Champions]]. He also won the championships in the Pro Lite Unlimited and Pro 2 classes of the Lucas oil Off Road Racing Series.\n\nIn 2012, he debuted the Metal Mulisha [[Monster truck]]. Todd LeDuc officially debuted it at [[Reliant Stadium]] in [[Houston, Texas]] in January 2012. Deegan himself drove the truck in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] at [[Chase Field]]. He was scheduled to drive the truck at the Monster Jam World Finals 13, but injured himself in driving practice. Todd LeDuc replaced him. He also won his second championship in the Pro 2 class of the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series.\n\nDeegan raced an [[OlsbergsMSE]] [[Ford Fiesta]] at the [[Global RallyCross Championship]], resulting runner-up in 2012, fourth in 2013 and 12th in 2014. He also continued his Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series career, winning the Pro Light Unlimited championship in 2013 and the Pro 2 championship in 2014. In 2015, Deegan was hired by [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] to compete in seven Global Rallycross Championship races in an [[M-Sport]] Fiesta along with former professional motocross rider [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McFadin|first=Daniel|url=http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/18/chip-ganassi-red-bull-global-rallycross-xgames/|title=Chip Ganassi Racing enters world of Global Rallycross|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Media appearances==\nDuring a 2005 taping of [[MTV]]'s [[Viva La Bam]] Deegan under-rotated a back-flip and the handle bars hit hard in his midsection, almost losing his life. He lost a [[kidney]], lacerated his [[spleen]], and lost a significant amount of blood. He now has a long scar down his stomach, that he calls his \"zipper\", spanning almost his entire abdomen, as a result of the accident. At the end of the episode when it originally aired, Bam dedicated it to Brian. The accident was cut out of the show.\n\nAlso during taping of the same show, [[Bam Margera]]'s uncle, [[Vincent Margera|Don Vito]], was forced by his nephew to lay down on the ground with the intention of Deegan and two others to jump over him, for what Margera and Deegan called the \"Fatboy Jump World Record\". Vito was held by the feet and arms by Margera and [[Raab Himself]] in order to restrain him. The bikers jumped over Vito, with Deegan narrowly missing him by less than a foot away, which startled Vito. That bit was featured in the show.\n\nIn 2006, Deegan and Berkela films released a film entitled ''Disposable Hero'' that follows him through the struggles and rewards that accompany the freestyle motocross sport and lifestyle. Jesse James, Ronnie Faist, [[Jeremy Stenberg]], Cameron Steele, Chris Ackerman, [[Nate Adams]], and Seth Enslow are a few of the featured cast that talk about Deegan and his life's journeys. The film aired on [[Spike TV]] on December 5, 2007.\n\nDeegan performed stunts in the movie ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]''. He is also working on a reality show for [[MTV]]. There is no scheduled air date yet.\n\nHe has been on the cover of ''[[Transworld MX]]'' and ''[[Racer X (magazine)|Racer X]]'' magazines and has been featured  multiple times in ''[[FHM]]'' magazine.\n\nDeegan was in the [[Game Boy Advance]]/[[Nintendo GameCube]]/[[PlayStation 2]] video game ''[[Freekstyle]]''.\n\n==Other ventures==\nIn addition to supporting riders, the Metal Mulisha have a clothing line and other related merchandise. Deegan also has a toy line called Hevy Hitters distributed in retail locations such as [[Walmart]]. Most recently he teamed up with Illektron to create Battlez FMX, a collectible card and dice game featuring Deegan, Todd Potter and [[Jeremy Lusk]].\n\nHe is the former owner of the FMX park, the Compound, which he later sold to [[Nate Adams]].

He is the most decorated Freestyle Motocross rider in [[X Games]] history. With 10 total medals (3 Golds and 7 Bronzes), he is the only rider to compete in at least 1 event in every X Games. He became a born again Christian after a near fatal crash in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Matt|title=Some X Games Bad Boys Turn to the Bible|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/sports/02xgames.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n[[File:Brian Deegan jumping at X Games 17 in Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|[[X Games]] 17 in Los Angeles]]\nDeegan was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].  He became a pro supercross rider with Team Moto XXX at age 17. In 1997 at the LA Coliseum, Brian Deegan won the 125cc main and in true rebel fashion, ghost rode his bike across the finish line. This was the beginning of what we know today as Freestyle Motocross.\n\nIn 2004, at the Winter X Games, Deegan crashed while attempting a 360 over a 100&nbsp;ft snow double, breaking his [[femur]] and both wrists. He came back 6 months later to place fourth at the Summer X Games. Deegan was also the first rider ever to land a 360 (Mulisha Twist) in competition.\n\nSwitching to [[off-road racing|four wheels]] in 2009, Deegan ventured into short course off-road racing in the [[Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series]]' Unlimited Lites division, winning the championship over experienced drivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racerxonline.com/article/brian-deegan-wins-off-road-championship.aspx|title=Brian Deegan Wins Off-Road Championship|date=November 16, 2009|publisher=Racer X Online|accessdate=2 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120050819/http://www.racerxonline.com/article/brian-deegan-wins-off-road-championship.aspx|archive-date=20 November 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2010 X Games, Deegan competed in the Rally Car Racing event at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Deegan finished second behind Tanner Foust due to a wrong turn he made during the race. Brian also competed in Rally Car Super Rally where he also finished second behind Tanner Foust.\n\nAt X Games XVII, Deegan won gold in RallyCross.\n\nIn 2011, he won the World Championship race at [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]] in the [[Traxxas TORC Series]]. He also competed at the [[2011 Race of Champions|Race of Champions]]. He also won the championships in the Pro Lite Unlimited and Pro 2 classes of the Lucas oil Off Road Racing Series.\n\nIn 2012, he debuted the Metal Mulisha [[Monster truck]]. Todd LeDuc officially debuted it at [[Reliant Stadium]] in [[Houston, Texas]] in January 2012. Deegan himself drove the truck in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] at [[Chase Field]]. He was scheduled to drive the truck at the Monster Jam World Finals 13, but injured himself in driving practice. Todd LeDuc replaced him. He also won his second championship in the Pro 2 class of the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series.\n\nDeegan raced an [[OlsbergsMSE]] [[Ford Fiesta]] at the [[Global RallyCross Championship]], resulting runner-up in 2012, fourth in 2013 and 12th in 2014. He also continued his Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series career, winning the Pro Light Unlimited championship in 2013 and the Pro 2 championship in 2014. In 2015, Deegan was hired by [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] to compete in seven Global Rallycross Championship races in an [[M-Sport]] Fiesta along with former professional motocross rider [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McFadin|first=Daniel|url=http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/18/chip-ganassi-red-bull-global-rallycross-xgames/|title=Chip Ganassi Racing enters world of Global Rallycross|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Media appearances==\nDuring a 2005 taping of [[MTV]]'s [[Viva La Bam]] Deegan under-rotated a back-flip and the handle bars hit hard in his midsection, almost losing his life. He lost a [[kidney]], lacerated his [[spleen]], and lost a significant amount of blood. He now has a long scar down his stomach, that he calls his \"zipper\", spanning almost his entire abdomen, as a result of the accident. At the end of the episode when it originally aired, Bam dedicated it to Brian. The accident was cut out of the show.\n\nAlso during taping of the same show, [[Bam Margera]]'s uncle, [[Vincent Margera|Don Vito]], was forced by his nephew to lay down on the ground with the intention of Deegan and two others to jump over him, for what Margera and Deegan called the \"Fatboy Jump World Record\". Vito was held by the feet and arms by Margera and [[Raab Himself]] in order to restrain him. The bikers jumped over Vito, with Deegan narrowly missing him by less than a foot away, which startled Vito. That bit was featured in the show.\n\nIn 2006, Deegan and Berkela films released a film entitled ''Disposable Hero'' that follows him through the struggles and rewards that accompany the freestyle motocross sport and lifestyle. Jesse James, Ronnie Faist, [[Jeremy Stenberg]], Cameron Steele, Chris Ackerman, [[Nate Adams]], and Seth Enslow are a few of the featured cast that talk about Deegan and his life's journeys. The film aired on [[Spike TV]] on December 5, 2007.\n\nDeegan performed stunts in the movie ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]''. He is also working on a reality show for [[MTV]]. There is no scheduled air date yet.\n\nHe has been on the cover of ''[[Transworld MX]]'' and ''[[Racer X (magazine)|Racer X]]'' magazines and has been featured  multiple times in ''[[FHM]]'' magazine.\n\nDeegan was in the [[Game Boy Advance]]/[[Nintendo GameCube]]/[[PlayStation 2]] video game ''[[Freekstyle]]''.\n\n==Other ventures==\nIn addition to supporting riders, the Metal Mulisha have a clothing line and other related merchandise. Deegan also has a toy line called Hevy Hitters distributed in retail locations such as [[Walmart]]. Most recently he teamed up with Illektron to create Battlez FMX, a collectible card and dice game featuring Deegan, Todd Potter and [[Jeremy Lusk]].\n\nHe is the former owner of the FMX park, the Compound, which he later sold to [[Nate Adams]]. At the 2007 X Games Deegan stated he sometimes regrets selling it. He also owns Supercross.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrian Deegan has been married to Marissa Deegan since 2003. Together, they have three children. [[Hailie Deegan]], who currently competes full-time in the ARCA Menards Series, Haiden and Hudson who competes in youth Motocross. Bloodline: The Life and Times of Brian Deegan is Brian documentary about his transition from being a championship motocross rider to a father of next generation motorsports stars.\n\n==Career highlights==\n*1997 Los Angeles Supercross \u2013 1st place\n*1999 World Freestyle champ / Gravity Games Silver\n*2000 Gravity Games Gold\n*2000 Air MX Champ\n*2000 Bluetorch Ride and Slide FMX Champ\n*2001 Moto x Big Air \u2013 Bronze\n*2002 Winter X Games Gold\n*2003 Featured Rider on Tony Hawk tour\n*2003 Summer X-Games Gold\n*2003 EXPN Rider of the year nominee\n*First to land a 360\n*2004 ESPY award nominee\n*Hold the most medals in FMX X Games history: 10 medals\n*2004 ESPN top 100 athlete of all sports\n*2005 Winter X Games Gold Medalist\n*2007 Winner Best Biography X Dance Action Sports Film Festival for Brian Deegan: Disposable Hero\n*2009 Awarded The Lifetime Achievement Award At The Transworld Motocross Awards In Las Vegas.\n*1 gold and 5 medals at the X Games rally events.\n*2nd at the 2012 Global RallyCross Championship.\n*4th at the 2013 Global RallyCross Championship.\n*2009, 2011 and 2013 [[Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series]] Pro Lite Unlimited champion\n*2011, 2012 and 2014 Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series Pro 2 Unlimited champion\n*2011 World Championship race winner in the Pro Light truck class\n\n==Racing record==\n===Complete Global RallyCross Championship results===\n====Supercar====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!
