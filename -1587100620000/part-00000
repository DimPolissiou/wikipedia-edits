Chamberlain and his supporters believed war could be avoided and hoped Germany would agree to leave the rest of Poland alone. German [[hegemony]] over Central Europe was also at stake. In private, Hitler said in May that Danzig was not the important issue to him, but pursuit of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for Germany.<ref>''A World at Total War: Global Conflict and the Politics of Destruction, 1937\u20131945'', Roger Chickering, Stig F\u00f6rster, Bernd Greiner, p. 97</ref>\n\n=== Breakdown of talks ===\nWith tensions mounting, Germany turned to aggressive diplomacy. On 28 April 1939, Hitler [[unilateral]]ly withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935. Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

To provide sufficient food you must have sparsely settled areas. There is therefore no question of sparing Poland, and the decision remains to attack Poland at the first opportunity. We cannot expect a repetition of Czechoslovakia.

Behind him stand German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin.]]\n\nOn 22 August, just over a week before the onset of war, Hitler delivered a speech to his military commanders at the [[Obersalzberg]]:\n\n{{quote|The object of the war is \u2026 physically to destroy the enemy. That is why I have prepared, for the moment only in the East, my [[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde|'Death's Head' formations]] with orders to kill without pity or mercy all men, women, and children of Polish descent or language. Only in this way can we obtain the living space we need. {{sfn|Piotrowski|1998|p=115}} }}\n\nWith the surprise signing of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August, the result of secret Nazi\u2013Soviet talks held in [[Moscow]], Germany neutralized the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and war became imminent. In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled.

The ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army) had 3,472 [[tank]]s in its inventory, of which 2,859 were with the Field Army and 408 with the [[Replacement Army]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=88}} 453 tanks were assigned into four light divisions, while another 225 tanks were in detached regiments and companies.{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=91}}  Most notably, the Germans had seven ''[[Panzer]]'' divisions, with 2,009 tanks between them, utilizing a new [[operational doctrine]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|pp=90\u201391}} It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P.

[[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]] and strafing. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] [[dive bomber]]s, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[Heinkel He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then.

The Polish Air Force consisted of a 'Bomber Brigade', 'Pursuit Brigade' and aircraft assigned to the various ground armies.<ref>'Duel for the Sky' by Christopher Shores</ref> The Polish fighters were older than their German counterparts; the PZL P.11 fighter\u2014produced in the early 1930s\u2014had a top speed of only {{convert|365|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, far less than German bombers.

As a \"last minute\" order in the summer of 1939, Poland bought 160 French [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] fighters and 111 English airplanes (100 light bombers [[Fairey Battle]], 10 [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and 1 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]; the sale of 150 Spitfires asked by the Polish government was rejected by the Air Ministry).<ref name=\"Wojciech Mazur\">{{cite journal |last1=Mazur |first1=Wojciech |title=Pomocnik Historyczny |journal=Polityka |date=March 2009 |volume=3/2009 |page=103}}</ref> Despite the fact that some of the airplanes had been shipped to Poland (the first transport of purchased aircraft on the ship \"Lassel\" sailed from Liverpool on 28 August 1939<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.plus-minus.net.pl/PomocPolsce/UnitedKingdom/index1.html | title=1::Pomoc wojenna Imperium Brytyjskiego dla Polski w okresie II Wojny \u015aWIATOWEJ}}</ref>), none of them would take part in combat.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Those had been lengthened by another {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938. The German incorporation of [[Bohemia and Moravia]] and creation of the German [[puppet state]] of [[History of Slovakia#World War II|Slovakia]] meant that Poland's southern flank was also exposed.\n\nHitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months.<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=29\u201330| isbn=978-1-4179-9277-5 }}</ref> They intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuver of ''Fall Weiss''. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:\n* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], attacking from German [[Silesia]] and from the [[Moravia]]n and Slovak border: General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]'s 8th Army was to drive eastward against [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; General [[Wilhelm List]]'s 14th Army was to push on toward [[Krak\u00f3w]] and to turn the Poles' [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] flank; and General [[Walter von Reichenau]]'s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armor, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.\n* A second route of attack from northern [[Prussia]]. Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain. This strategy also left [[supply line]]s poorly protected. One-third of Poland's forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] from East Prussia and the west. Another third were concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Warsaw.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 304\u2013310</ref> The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvers, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n[[File:Peking.jpg|thumb|[[Peking Plan]]: Polish destroyers evacuate the Baltic Sea en route to the United Kingdom.|alt=Photo of three Polish destroyers executing the Peking Plan and evacuating to British before the start of the invasion.]]\n\nAs the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"PN\" /> In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, the [[Danish straits]] were well within operating range of the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''Luftwaffe'', so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war [[propaganda]] emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The propaganda also had some negative consequences for the Polish troops themselves, whose communications, disrupted by German mobile units operating in the rear and civilians blocking roads, were further thrown into chaos by bizarre reports from Polish radio stations and newspapers, which often reported imaginary victories and other military operations. This led to some Polish troops being encircled or taking a stand against overwhelming odds, when they thought they were actually counterattacking or would soon receive reinforcements from other victorious areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Phase 1: German invasion ===\n[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map showing the advances made by the Germans, and the disposition of all troops from 1 to 14 September|alt=Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of German and Polish troops on 14 September 1939.]]\n\nFollowing several German-staged incidents (like the Gleiwitz incident, a part of [[Operation Himmler]]), which German propaganda used as a [[pretext]] to claim that German forces were acting in [[self-defence]], one of the first acts of war took place on 1 September 1939. At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45. Around that time Luftwaffe attacked a number of military and civilian targets, including [[bombing of Wielu\u0144]], the first large scale city bombing of the war. At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.\n[[File:Zniszczenia1939 0.jpg|thumb|left|The city of [[Wielu\u0144]] destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing|alt=Aerial photo showing the city of Wielu\u0144, which was destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing on 1 September]]\n\nFrance and the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September, but [[Western betrayal|failed to provide any meaningful support]]. The German-French border saw only [[Saar Offensive|a few minor skirmishes]], although the majority of German forces, including 85% of their armoured forces, were engaged in Poland. Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and [[Lw\u00f3w]].

In 1939, only 10% of the Polish army was made up of cavalry units.<ref>Henryk Smaczny, ''Ksi\u0119ga kawalerii polskiej'' (\"Book of Polish cavalry\"), TESCO, Warszawa 1989, {{ISBN|83-00-02555-3}}</ref> [[Polish cavalry]] never charged German tanks or entrenched infantry or artillery, but usually acted as [[Mounted infantry|mobile infantry]] (like [[dragoon]]s) and reconnaissance units, and executed cavalry charges only in rare situations against foot soldiers. Most of these charges were successful.<ref name=\"Kawaleria\">{{cite web | author=Marcin Lewandowski | title=Szar\u017ce we wrze\u015bniu 1939 (Cavalry charges in September 1939) | publisher= | year=2005 | work=Kawaleria II RP | url=http://www.kawaleria.marcin-lewandowski.xip.pl/szarze.php | accessdate=2006-04-26 |language=pl}}</ref> Other armies (including German and Soviet) also fielded and extensively used elite horse cavalry units at that time. The last cavalry-vs-cavalry battle in Europe was fought between German and Polish cavalries ([[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d (1939)]]). Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun. The myth originated from war correspondents' reports similar to that of the [[Charge at Krojanty|Battle of Krojanty]], where a Polish cavalry brigade was fired upon in ambush by hidden armored vehicles, after it had mounted a successful sabre-charge against German infantry. There were also cases when Polish cavalry dashing between tanks trying to break out of encirclement gave an impression of an attack.<ref group=\"Note\">Seidner takes issue here with this contention on at least one occasion. Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/APHistory/Cavalry_Myth/cavalry_myth.html|title=Cavalry Myth}}</ref>\n\n=== Polish Air Force ===\nThe [[Polish Air Force order of battle in 1939|Polish Air Force]] was not destroyed on the ground in the first days of the war. Though numerically inferior, it had been redeployed from major air bases to small camouflaged airfields shortly before the war. Only some [[trainer aircraft|trainers]] and auxiliary aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J. Zaloga, Ramiro Bujeiro, Howard Gerrard, ''Poland 1939: the birth of blitzkrieg'', Osprey Publishing, 2002, {{ISBN|1-84176-408-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQeAKAjlEwMC&pg=PA50&dq=Polish+airforce+1939+ground Google Print, p.50]</ref> The ''Luftwaffe'' lost 285 aircraft to all operational causes, with 279 more damaged, and the Poles lost 333 aircraft.<ref>Overy, Richard J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uocntt1lGDUC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28 ''The Air War: 1939\u20131945''], London, Europa Publications, 1980. p. 28</ref>\n\n=== Polish resistance to the invasion ===\nAnother question concerns whether Poland inflicted any significant losses on the German forces and whether it surrendered too quickly. In the first few days, Germany sustained very heavy losses: Poland cost the Germans 993 tanks and armored vehicles as campaign losses of which 300 tanks were never recovered,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achtungpanzer.com/invasion-of-poland-fall-weiss.htm|title=Invasion of Poland \u2013 Fall Weiss|website=achtungpanzer.com}}</ref><ref>''Encyklopedia II wojny \u015bwiatowej'', p. 670</ref> thousands of soldiers, and 25% of its air strength.<ref>Bekker, Cajus (1964) ''Angriffshohe'' 285 aircraft destroyed, 279 damaged of initial force</ref> As for duration, the September Campaign lasted about a week and a half less than the [[Battle of France]] in 1940 even though the Anglo-French forces were much closer to parity with the Germans in numerical strength and equipment and were supported by the [[Maginot line]].<ref group=\"Note\" name=\"FrenchForces\">Polish to German forces in the September Campaign: 1,000,000 soldiers, 4,300 guns, 880 tanks, 435 aircraft (Poland) to 1,800,000 soldiers, 10,000 guns, 2,800 tanks, 3,000 aircraft (Germany). French and participating Allies to German forces in the Battle of France: 2,862,000 soldiers, 13,974 guns, 3,384 tanks, 3,099 aircraft 2 (Allies) to 3,350,000 soldiers, 7,378 guns, 2,445 tanks, 5,446 aircraft (Germany).</ref> Furthermore, the Polish Army was preparing the [[Romanian Bridgehead]], which would have prolonged Polish defence, but the plan was invalidated by the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', ch. 3</ref> Poland also never officially surrendered to the Germans. Under German occupation, there was continued resistance by forces such as the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'', [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]]'s guerillas, and the [[Le\u015bni]] (\"forest partisans\").\n\n[[File:Defenders of Warsaw (1939).jpg|thumb|[[Polish Army|Polish soldiers]] with anti-aircraft artillery near the Warsaw Central Station in the first days of September 1939.]]\n[[File:American Embassy in Warsaw 1939.jpg|thumb|American embassy in Warsaw during the German air raid in September 1939. Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the ''Wehrmacht''. \u2013 Zaloga and Madej<ref name=\"Cooper4\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Horses in World War II]]\n* [[List of Polish divisions in World War II]]\n* [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]\n* [[Phoney War]]\n* [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)]]\n* [[Timeline of the invasion of Poland]]\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

In private, Hitler said in May that Danzig was not the important issue to him, but pursuit of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for Germany.<ref>''A World at Total War: Global Conflict and the Politics of Destruction, 1937\u20131945'', Roger Chickering, Stig F\u00f6rster, Bernd Greiner, p. 97</ref>\n\n=== Breakdown of talks ===\nWith tensions mounting, Germany turned to aggressive diplomacy. On 28 April 1939, Hitler [[unilateral]]ly withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935. Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion.<ref>Oslon and Cloud,\"A Question of Honor\" p. 50</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing the [[Peking Plan]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (only about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order), and because of that many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions. The late mobilization reduced combat capability of Polish Army by about 1/3.\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n{{See also|Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign|Soviet order of battle for invasion of Poland in 1939|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{See also|German order of battle for the invasion of Poland}}\n\nGermany had a substantial numeric advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military before the conflict. The ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army) had 3,472 [[tank]]s in its inventory, of which 2,859 were with the Field Army and 408 with the [[Replacement Army]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=88}} 453 tanks were assigned into four light divisions, while another 225 tanks were in detached regiments and companies.{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=91}}  Most notably, the Germans had seven ''[[Panzer]]'' divisions, with 2,009 tanks between them, utilizing a new [[operational doctrine]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|pp=90\u201391}} It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P. Taylor, p. 41</ref> [[Invasion of Poland#Misconceptions|some other historians]] disagree.<ref name=Cooper0 />\n\n[[Aircraft]] played a major role in the campaign. [[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]] and strafing. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] [[dive bomber]]s, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[Heinkel He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then. In spite of this, [[Polish cavalry]] [[brigade]]s were used as mobile [[mounted infantry]] and had some successes against both German infantry and cavalry.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 158</ref>\n[[File:Samoloty PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b wraz z za\u0142ogami 02 (1939).jpg|thumb|left|Polish [[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]] medium bombers with a four-man crew |alt=A Polish PZL.37 ''\u0141o\u015b'' medium bomber aircraft]]\n\nAn average Polish infantry division consisted of 16,492 soldiers and was equipped with 326 light and medium machine guns, 132 heavy machine guns, 92 anti-tank rifles and several dozen light, medium, heavy, anti-tank and anti-airplane field artillery.

Poland had only about 600 aircraft, of which only [[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]] heavy bombers were modern and comparable to their German counterparts.

All those aircraft were of indigenous Polish design, with the bombers being more modern than fighters, according to the [[Ludomi\u0142 Rayski]] air force expansion plan, which relied on a strong bomber force. The Polish Air Force consisted of a 'Bomber Brigade', 'Pursuit Brigade' and aircraft assigned to the various ground armies.<ref>'Duel for the Sky' by Christopher Shores</ref> The Polish fighters were older than their German counterparts; the PZL P.11 fighter\u2014produced in the early 1930s\u2014had a top speed of only {{convert|365|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, far less than German bombers.

As a \"last minute\" order in the summer of 1939, Poland bought 160 French [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] fighters and 111 English airplanes (100 light bombers [[Fairey Battle]], 10 [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and 1 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]; the sale of 150 Spitfires asked by the Polish government was rejected by the Air Ministry).<ref name=\"Wojciech Mazur\">{{cite journal |last1=Mazur |first1=Wojciech |title=Pomocnik Historyczny |journal=Polityka |date=March 2009 |volume=3/2009 |page=103}}</ref> Despite the fact that some of the airplanes had been shipped to Poland (the first transport of purchased aircraft on the ship \"Lassel\" sailed from Liverpool on 28 August 1939<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.plus-minus.net.pl/PomocPolsce/UnitedKingdom/index1.html | title=1::Pomoc wojenna Imperium Brytyjskiego dla Polski w okresie II Wojny \u015aWIATOWEJ}}</ref>), none of them would take part in combat.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Those had been lengthened by another {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938. The German incorporation of [[Bohemia and Moravia]] and creation of the German [[puppet state]] of [[History of Slovakia#World War II|Slovakia]] meant that Poland's southern flank was also exposed.\n\nHitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months.<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=29\u201330| isbn=978-1-4179-9277-5 }}</ref> They intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuver of ''Fall Weiss''. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:\n* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], attacking from German [[Silesia]] and from the [[Moravia]]n and Slovak border: General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]'s 8th Army was to drive eastward against [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; General [[Wilhelm List]]'s 14th Army was to push on toward [[Krak\u00f3w]] and to turn the Poles' [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] flank; and General [[Walter von Reichenau]]'s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armor, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.\n* A second route of attack from northern [[Prussia]]. Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain.

Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared.

At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45.

At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south.

The ''Luftwaffe'' gained [[air superiority]] early in the campaign.

Up to 120,000 Polish troops escaped to [[Neutral country|neutral]] Romania (through the Romanian Bridgehead and [[Hungary]]), and another 20,000 to [[Latvia]] and Lithuania, with the majority eventually making their way to France or Britain.

It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with the United Kingdom and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a \"world war\". Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of a pan-European war, which combined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937 and the [[Pacific War]] in 1941 to form the global conflict known as World War II.\n\nThe invasion of Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. No declaration of war was issued by Britain and France against the Soviet Union. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been [[Western betrayal#Up to 1939|betrayed by their Western allies]].

In 1939, only 10% of the Polish army was made up of cavalry units.<ref>Henryk Smaczny, ''Ksi\u0119ga kawalerii polskiej'' (\"Book of Polish cavalry\"), TESCO, Warszawa 1989, {{ISBN|83-00-02555-3}}</ref> [[Polish cavalry]] never charged German tanks or entrenched infantry or artillery, but usually acted as [[Mounted infantry|mobile infantry]] (like [[dragoon]]s) and reconnaissance units, and executed cavalry charges only in rare situations against foot soldiers. Most of these charges were successful.<ref name=\"Kawaleria\">{{cite web | author=Marcin Lewandowski | title=Szar\u017ce we wrze\u015bniu 1939 (Cavalry charges in September 1939) | publisher= | year=2005 | work=Kawaleria II RP | url=http://www.kawaleria.marcin-lewandowski.xip.pl/szarze.php | accessdate=2006-04-26 |language=pl}}</ref> Other armies (including German and Soviet) also fielded and extensively used elite horse cavalry units at that time. The last cavalry-vs-cavalry battle in Europe was fought between German and Polish cavalries ([[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d (1939)]]). Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun. The myth originated from war correspondents' reports similar to that of the [[Charge at Krojanty|Battle of Krojanty]], where a Polish cavalry brigade was fired upon in ambush by hidden armored vehicles, after it had mounted a successful sabre-charge against German infantry. There were also cases when Polish cavalry dashing between tanks trying to break out of encirclement gave an impression of an attack.<ref group=\"Note\">Seidner takes issue here with this contention on at least one occasion.

Though numerically inferior, it had been redeployed from major air bases to small camouflaged airfields shortly before the war. Only some [[trainer aircraft|trainers]] and auxiliary aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J. Zaloga, Ramiro Bujeiro, Howard Gerrard, ''Poland 1939: the birth of blitzkrieg'', Osprey Publishing, 2002, {{ISBN|1-84176-408-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQeAKAjlEwMC&pg=PA50&dq=Polish+airforce+1939+ground Google Print, p.50]</ref> The ''Luftwaffe'' lost 285 aircraft to all operational causes, with 279 more damaged, and the Poles lost 333 aircraft.<ref>Overy, Richard J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uocntt1lGDUC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28 ''The Air War: 1939\u20131945''], London, Europa Publications, 1980. p. 28</ref>\n\n=== Polish resistance to the invasion ===\nAnother question concerns whether Poland inflicted any significant losses on the German forces and whether it surrendered too quickly.

Under German occupation, there was continued resistance by forces such as the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'', [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]]'s guerillas, and the [[Le\u015bni]] (\"forest partisans\").\n\n[[File:Defenders of Warsaw (1939).jpg|thumb|[[Polish Army|Polish soldiers]] with anti-aircraft artillery near the Warsaw Central Station in the first days of September 1939.]]\n[[File:American Embassy in Warsaw 1939.jpg|thumb|American embassy in Warsaw during the German air raid in September 1939. Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the ''Wehrmacht''. \u2013 Zaloga and Madej<ref name=\"Cooper4\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Horses in World War II]]\n* [[List of Polish divisions in World War II]]\n* [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]\n* [[Phoney War]]\n* [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)]]\n* [[Timeline of the invasion of Poland]]\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

And then they realize that PJ robot gave up most of his energy to let them in. Then they move the statue, which they have some sort of connection to, (they say that their arms start tingling,) to its proper place. Then they become Catboy, Gekko, and Owlette, and jump into the Cat-Car. They go to stop Night Ninja, and find that they all have new powers.

That night they jump in the Cat-Car and find out that Luna is going to the moon and decide to go after her. Gekko is scared and tries to say that Luna Girl is bluffing, but Catboy and Owlette aren't willing to take a chance and decide to go to the moon in their HQ Rocket. Gekko reluctantly agrees to go. When they arrive on the moon Gekko offers to stay with PJ robot and help repair the HQ Rocket that got damaged by Luna Girl while going to the moon, but Owlette and Catboy say that they think that they should all go after Luna Girl and Gekko admits that he is scared not just of going to Space, but also of being so far from home.\nOwlette says that that's Ok and that she felt the same way when she had her first sleepover.\nBut Gekko asks if her first sleepover was on the moon. To which Catboy says no and that Gekko can stay and guard the ship while PJ robot fixes it. To which Gekko happily agrees. Catboy and Owlette follow Luna girl to where a harvest moon crystal is that will boost her power, when they catch up with Luna Girl she has already found the crystal, when they try to stop Luna with their powers they find that they don't work the same on the moon as on earth.

Catboy and Owlette try to contact Gekko to warn him, but inside the fortress no communication can get through. Gekko goes to help them but gets trapped too. Since their powers don't work the same way on the moon as they do on earth, Catboy uses his Super Cat Speed to break their prisons while Luna goes to earth to bring everyone to the moon. But unfortunately her Luna Wand let's her know that the PJ masks are escaping from the fortress. The PJ masks, in order to escape from Luna Girl, improvise since their powers don't work the same way there. And manage to get the Luna Wand away from Luna and get the harvest moon crystal out of the Luna Wand and turn it back into a Luna magnet. Then they take the harvest moon crystal back to earth, (where Gekko is ecstatic to be,) and put it in the PJ Vault. When Luna gets back to earth she vows to get the harvest moon crystal back, paving the way for a Moonstruck part 3.

That night they go to their HQ where PJ Robot has been hard at work, trying his best to be helpful from creating a means of communication to cleaning up the Cat-Car to trying to make a few modifications to the PJ Picture Player. But none of them are needed by The PJ Masks. They jump into the Owl-Glider and go to stop  Night Ninja who is teaching the Ninjalinos how to make stuff levitate with an ancient Ninja art called \"Ninja Fingers\" and they start battling Night Ninja and the Ninjalinos, which is right about the time PJ Robot starts messing with the PJ Picture Player and finds a huge crystal statue of an Owl, a Cat, and a lizard. While calling Owlette he accidentally uses the statue to blind her, causing the Ninjalinos to take her, Catboy and Gekko's powers, as they (the PJs) turn back into Amaya, Connor and Greg, respectively. Without their powers they were no match for Night Ninja and the Ninjalinos, the latter of which having already left after they took their powers, so they ran away from Night Ninja to their HQ but without the crystal in its place there is no power whatsoever so they couldn't get in to their HQ. They get pretty nasty towards PJ robot once they get to HQ but then they apologize to him shortly after. Then PJ robot used his own energy to power the HQ so Connor, Greg, and Amaya can get in. And then they realize that PJ robot gave up most of his energy to let them in. Then they move the statue, which they have some sort of connection to, (they say that their arms start tingling,) to its proper place. Then they become Catboy, Gekko, and Owlette, and jump into the Cat-Car. They go to stop Night Ninja, and find that they all have new powers. They stop Night Ninja with their new powers and save the day.\n\n----\n''Vehicle'': Owl-Glider and Cat-Car\n\n''Hero revelation'': Words can hurt, don't say mean things about others.\n| LineColor       = FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 35a\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8a\n| Title           = Moonstruck: Race to the Moon\n| DirectedBy      = Christian De Vita\n| WrittenBy       = Brad Birch<br>{{StoryTeleplay|ex1label=Head writer|ex1=Brad Birch}}\n| Aux2            = Christian Kuntz\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|4|20}}\n| Viewers         = 0.72<ref name=\"ms\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-20-2018.html|title=Top 150 Friday Cable Originals and Network Finals: 4.20.2018|author=Mitch Metcalf|work=Showbuzz Daily|date=April 23, 2018|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = During the day, the PJ Masks and their class go to the museum and learn about the harvest moon and figure that since Luna girl likes the moon she is going to plan something bad.

Gekko is scared and tries to say that Luna Girl is bluffing, but Catboy and Owlette aren't willing to take a chance and decide to go to the moon in their HQ Rocket. Gekko reluctantly agrees to go. When they arrive on the moon Gekko offers to stay with PJ robot and help repair the HQ Rocket that got damaged by Luna Girl while going to the moon, but Owlette and Catboy say that they think that they should all go after Luna Girl and Gekko admits that he is scared not just of going to Space, but also of being so far from home.\nOwlette says that that's Ok and that she felt the same way when she had her first sleepover.\nBut Gekko asks if her first sleepover was on the moon. To which Catboy says no and that Gekko can stay and guard the ship while PJ robot fixes it. To which Gekko happily agrees.

Catboy and Owlette try to contact Gekko to warn him, but inside the fortress no communication can get through. Gekko goes to help them but gets trapped too. Since their powers don't work the same way on the moon as they do on earth, Catboy uses his Super Cat Speed to break their prisons while Luna goes to earth to bring everyone to the moon. But unfortunately her Luna Wand let's her know that the PJ masks are escaping from the fortress. The PJ masks, in order to escape from Luna Girl, improvise since their powers don't work the same way there. And manage to get the Luna Wand away from Luna and get the harvest moon crystal out of the Luna Wand and turn it back into a Luna magnet. Then they take the harvest moon crystal back to earth, (where Gekko is ecstatic to be,) and put it in the PJ Vault.

He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on December 18, 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest in pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, \"a sexton was just another name for a janitor''.\"''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, and excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father, for the order's focus on the Holy Family and towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America|Catholic University]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C. to complete his theology studies and take his final vows. On June 15, 1941 Peyton and his brother Thomas were ordained at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the University of Notre Dame as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.<ref>[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-enduring-legacy-of-now-venerable-father-patrick-peyton Pronechen, Joseph. \"The Enduring Legacy of Now-\u2018Venerable\u2019 Father Patrick Peyton\", ''National Catholic Register'', January 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n==Lifetime crusade==\n{{Main|Family Rosary Crusade|Family Theater}}\nPeyton was given very light duties following the completion of his theological studies. His first assignment was in [[Albany, New York]] as the chaplain of the [[Holy Cross Brothers]] of the Vincentian Institute. Peyton started letters to Bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]]. He would also pioneer in conducting public rallies to bring families to pledge to pray the Rosary as a unit. These Rosary rallies attended by millions would become the most significant event where Peyton could be best remembered.  According to historian Hugh Wilford, \"Peyton himself was deeply conscious of the political dimension of his mission, proudly proclaiming in a 1946 radio broadcast, 'The rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism\u2014the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith'\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=GRIBBLE |first1=RICHARD  |date=2003 |title=Anti-Communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A. |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=535\u2013558 |doi= 10.1093/jcs/45.3.535|jstor=23920511 }}</ref>\n\nThese Rosary Crusades were duplicated in different dioceses with attendees growing in numbers, taking Peyton across the globe from [[Brussels, Belgium]] to [[Madrid, Spain]] across Asia to [[Manila, Philippines]], down south of the [[equator]] to New Zealand and [[Papua New Guinea]] and into several South American cities like [[Lima, Peru]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]]. With the help of a non-Catholic advertising practitioner, Peyton would popularize the slogan ''\"The family that prays together stays together.\"''\n\n==Death and legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:father patrick peyton rosary rally philippines.gif|left|thumb|350px|Peyton shaking hands with [[Filipinos]] who gathered for the Rosary Rally in [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]]. 1953]] -->\n\nWith the [[Cold War]] threatening a new world peace, Peyton's work in promoting prayer, was recognized by the Holy See. His efforts earned him the title ''\"The Rosary Priest\".''\n\nControversy hounded Peyton throughout his ministry as some accused him of being a front for American intelligence during his missions in Latin America. Peyton's Rosary Crusades in Latin America were funded and, to some extent, directed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which was interested in combating leftist political movements in Latin America.  This came about through Peyton's connection to [[J. Peter Grace]], the great-grandson of the founder of [[W.R. Grace and Company]], a multinational corporation with interests in transport, [[sugar]], and mining in South America, whom Peyton had met in 1946 on a trans-Atlantic voyage.  Grace, who was involved with other [[CIA]] front operations as well, wrote to John Moore, the chair of the Business Advisory Council, and the two men approached [[Allen Dulles]].  Dulles later met with Grace in the White House office of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who expressed enthusiasm.  The CIA decided for several years where the crusades would take place, and CIA funds were expended in [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]], until Peyton's provincial superior, Richard H. Sullivan, learned of the secret funding from [[Theodore Hesburgh]], the chair of the board of trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]], in October 1964.  It took the [[Holy See|Vatican]] more than a year and a half to oblige Peyton to give up his CIA financing.<ref>Hugh Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'' [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2008], pp.&nbsp;182\u201396 .</ref> While the CIA determined the locations of the Crusades, it did not influence the content or Peyton's goal of promoting family prayer, the Rosary and devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nOthers accused Peyton of living an ostentatious lifestyle, living a life with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992 at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]. Then the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original Ministries, Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International, and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on December 18, 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, ''a sexton was just another name for a janitor.''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. Peyton excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father for the order's focus towards the Holy Family and its precision towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America|Catholic University]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C. to complete his theology studies and take his final vows. On June 15, 1941 Peyton and his brother Thomas were ordained at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the University of Notre Dame as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.<ref>[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-enduring-legacy-of-now-venerable-father-patrick-peyton Pronechen, Joseph. \"The Enduring Legacy of Now-\u2018Venerable\u2019 Father Patrick Peyton\", ''National Catholic Register'', January 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n==Lifetime crusade==\n{{Main|Family Rosary Crusade|Family Theater}}\nPeyton was given very light duties following the completion of his theological studies. His first assignment was in [[Albany, New York]] as the chaplain of the [[Holy Cross Brothers]] of the Vincentian Institute. Peyton started letters to Bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]]. He would also pioneer in conducting public rallies to bring families to pledge to pray the Rosary as a unit. These Rosary rallies attended by millions would become the most significant event where Peyton could be best remembered.  According to historian Hugh Wilford, \"Peyton himself was deeply conscious of the political dimension of his mission, proudly proclaiming in a 1946 radio broadcast, 'The rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism\u2014the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith'\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=GRIBBLE |first1=RICHARD  |date=2003 |title=Anti-Communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A. |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=535\u2013558 |doi= 10.1093/jcs/45.3.535|jstor=23920511 }}</ref>\n\nThese Rosary Crusades were duplicated in different dioceses with attendees growing in numbers, taking Peyton across the globe from [[Brussels, Belgium]] to [[Madrid, Spain]] across Asia to [[Manila, Philippines]], down south of the [[equator]] to New Zealand and [[Papua New Guinea]] and into several South American cities like [[Lima, Peru]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]]. With the help of a non-Catholic advertising practitioner, Peyton would popularize the slogan ''\"The family that prays together stays together.\"''\n\n==Death and legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:father patrick peyton rosary rally philippines.gif|left|thumb|350px|Peyton shaking hands with [[Filipinos]] who gathered for the Rosary Rally in [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]]. 1953]] -->\n\nWith the [[Cold War]] threatening a new world peace, Peyton's work in promoting prayer, was recognized by the Holy See. His efforts earned him the title ''\"The Rosary Priest\".''\n\nControversy hounded Peyton throughout his ministry as some accused him of being a front for American intelligence during his missions in Latin America. Peyton's Rosary Crusades in Latin America were funded and, to some extent, directed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which was interested in combating leftist political movements in Latin America.  This came about through Peyton's connection to [[J. Peter Grace]], the great-grandson of the founder of [[W.R. Grace and Company]], a multinational corporation with interests in transport, [[sugar]], and mining in South America, whom Peyton had met in 1946 on a trans-Atlantic voyage.  Grace, who was involved with other [[CIA]] front operations as well, wrote to John Moore, the chair of the Business Advisory Council, and the two men approached [[Allen Dulles]].  Dulles later met with Grace in the White House office of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who expressed enthusiasm.  The CIA decided for several years where the crusades would take place, and CIA funds were expended in [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]], until Peyton's provincial superior, Richard H. Sullivan, learned of the secret funding from [[Theodore Hesburgh]], the chair of the board of trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]], in October 1964.  It took the [[Holy See|Vatican]] more than a year and a half to oblige Peyton to give up his CIA financing.<ref>Hugh Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'' [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2008], pp.&nbsp;182\u201396 .</ref> While the CIA determined the locations of the Crusades, it did not influence the content or Peyton's goal of promoting family prayer, the Rosary and devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nOthers accused Peyton of living an ostentatious lifestyle, living a life with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992 at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]. Then the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original Ministries, Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International, and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

But the use of genetic data to inform medical decisions is lagging. More than a decade since the Human Genome Project was declared complete, fewer than 60 genetic variants are deemed worthy for use in clinical care, most for severe conditions in very young children. These genetic variants can guide medical decisions. Genomic data alone is not very useful, but needs to be examined in the right context in research and healthcare\n\nSome health-care organizations are working out ways to collect evidence from ongoing care to improve patient outcomes. Such efforts systematically analyse clinical data from peer-reviewed literature and introduce selected findings into clinical care. Then they track and evaluate outcomes.\n\nOne of the best examples of such a 'learning health-care system' is the Geisinger Health System, which serves 2.6 million patients in [[Pennsylvania]]. Once diagnosed with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart failure or depression, patients' care and outcomes are monitored. [[Performance indicator|Metrics]] such as hospitalization rates are used to recommend that certain individuals receive coordinated attention from a team of specialists including mental-health [[Mental health professional|practitioners]] and nutritionists. Over three years, this reduced hospital admissions by 18% and seemed to reduce spending by 7%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Medical genomics: Gather and use genetic data in health care|url = http://www.nature.com/news/medical-genomics-gather-and-use-genetic-data-in-health-care-1.15065|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Genomics]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=April 2016}}\n{{Underlinked|date=May 2016}}\n}}\n\n'''Genomic and medical data ''' refers to an area within [[genetics]] that concerns the recording, [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] and analysis of an organism's [[genome]].\n\n==Background==\nGenomics is a concept that was first developed by Fred Sanger who first sequenced the complete genome of a virus and of a [[mitochondrion]].

But the use of genetic data to inform medical decisions is lagging. More than a decade since the Human Genome Project was declared complete, fewer than 60 genetic variants are deemed worthy for use in clinical care, most for severe conditions in very young children. These genetic variants can guide medical decisions. Genomic data alone is not very useful, but needs to be examined in the right context in research and healthcare\n\nSome health-care organizations are working out ways to collect evidence from ongoing care to improve patient outcomes. Such efforts systematically analyse clinical data from peer-reviewed literature and introduce selected findings into clinical care. Then they track and evaluate outcomes.\n\nOne of the best examples of such a 'learning health-care system' is the Geisinger Health System, which serves 2.6 million patients in [[Pennsylvania]]. Once diagnosed with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart failure or depression, patients' care and outcomes are monitored. [[Metric|Metrics]] such as hospitalization rates are used to recommend that certain individuals receive coordinated attention from a team of specialists including mental-health [[Practitioner|practitioners]] and nutritionists. Over three years, this reduced hospital admissions by 18% and seemed to reduce spending by 7%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Medical genomics: Gather and use genetic data in health care|url = http://www.nature.com/news/medical-genomics-gather-and-use-genetic-data-in-health-care-1.15065|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Genomics]]\n", "name_user": "Cnwilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Metric\u2192Performance indicator,Practitioner\u2192Mental health professional", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_and_Medical_Data"}

Inglish and other acquaintances settled there in the summer of 1837, and the settlement was named \"Bois D'Arc\". The [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]] named the city Bloomington in 1843, but renamed it Bonham in honor of [[James Butler Bonham]], a defender of the [[Alamo]]. On February 2, 1848, Bonham was incorporated as a city. A 1936 statue of Bonham by Texas sculptor [[Allie Tennant]] is on the courthouse grounds.<ref>Little, Carol Morris, ''A Comprehensive Guide to Outdoor Sculpture in Texas'', University of Texas Press, Austin,  1996 p. 100</ref>\n\nAfter connecting to the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] the city began to grow, and by 1885 there were six churches, three colleges, two public schools, three weekly newspapers, a sawmill, two grain mills, a power plant, and about 2,300 inhabitants. 1890 saw the addition of streetcars, an ice plant, and the opening of the Texas Power and Light Company, the area's utility provider. In 1925 the city was connected to natural gas lines.\n\nIn 1898, 1911\u20131914 and 1921\u20131922, Bonham hosted [[minor league baseball]]. The [[Bonham Boosters]] and other Bonham teams played as members of the Class D [[Texas-Oklahoma League]] (1911\u20131914, 1921\u20131922) and the Independent [[Southwestern League]] (1898). Bonham teams featured a different moniker each season. [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] member [[Kid Nichols]] was Manager of the 1914 Bonham Sliders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi|title=Register Team Encyclopedia|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?code=TXOK&class=D|title=Texas-Oklahoma League (D) Encyclopedia and History|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], a training camp and an aviation school for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] were in the vicinity of Bonham, as was a prisoner-of-war camp for German soldiers.

Inglish and other acquaintances settled there in the summer of 1837, and the settlement was named \"Bois D'Arc\". The [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]] named the city Bloomington in 1843, but renamed it Bonham in honor of [[James Butler Bonham]], a defender of the [[Alamo]]. On February 2, 1848, Bonham was incorporated as a city. A 1936 statue of Bonham by Texas sculptor [[Allie Tennant]] is on the courthouse grounds.<ref>Little, Carol Morris, ''A Comprehensive Guide to Outdoor Sculpture in Texas'', University of Texas Press, Austin,  1996 p. 100</ref>\n\nAfter connecting to the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] the city began to grow, and by 1885 there were six churches, three colleges, two public schools, three weekly newspapers, a sawmill, two grain mills, a power plant, and about 2,300 inhabitants. 1890 saw the addition of streetcars, an ice plant, and the opening of the Texas Power and Light Company, the area's utility provider. In 1925 the city was connected to natural gas lines.\n\nIn 1898, 1911\u20131914 and 1921\u20131922, Bonham hosted [[minor league baseball]]. The [[Bonham Boosters]] and other Bonham teams played as members of the Class D [[Texas-Oklahoma League]] (1911\u20131914, 1921\u20131922) and the Independent [[Southwestern League]] (1898). Bonham teams featured a different moniker each season. [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] member [[Kid Nichols]]was Manager of the 1914 Bonham Sliders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi|title=Register Team Encyclopedia|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?code=TXOK&class=D|title=Texas-Oklahoma League (D) Encyclopedia and History|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], a training camp and an aviation school for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] were in the vicinity of Bonham, as was a prisoner-of-war camp for German soldiers. Parts of the camp, approximately 0.5 miles north of US 82, can still be visited today.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 211\n|1860= 477\n|1870= 928\n|1880= 1889\n|1890= 3361\n|1900= 5042\n|1910= 4844\n|1920= 6008\n|1930= 5655\n|1940= 6349\n|1950= 7049\n|1960= 7357\n|1970= 7698\n|1980= 7338\n|1990= 6686\n|2000= 9990\n|2010= 10127\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10372\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2010, there were 10,127 people, 2,959 households, and 1,861 families residing in the city.

It is currently a [[Boroughs of Longueuil|borough]] of the city of [[Longueuil]]. It covers an area of {{convert|4.78|km2}}, with a population of 16,733 at the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census of Canada]]. Greenfield Park is the only borough of Longueuil that has an officially [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] status. It is primarily a post-WWI suburban area. Like the other two boroughs, most of the buildings in Greenfield Park are single-family homes. Nearly all of the land in Greenfield Park is built on, making it Longueuil's most densely populated borough.\n\nGreenfield Park is divided into two sections. The older section of the borough is to the west of [[Taschereau Boulevard]] near [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]], [[LeMoyne, Quebec|LeMoyne]] and [[Brossard]], while the newer section is to the east, near the [[Lafl\u00e8che, Quebec|Lafl\u00e8che]] neighbourhood. Most of the Greenfield Park's businesses are located along Taschereau Boulevard, the [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]]'s most important commercial artery. The [[Charles LeMoyne Hospital]], located on the Taschereau Boulevard, is the largest on the south shore.\n\n==History==\n;Seigneury of Longueuil\nBefore becoming a town, the area known as Greenfield Park was land belonging to the [[Seigneury]] of Longueuil. It had been an agricultural area up until the end of the 19th century. Greenfield Park benefited from its proximity to neighbouring St. Lambert's rail line connected to the newly constructed [[Victoria Bridge, Montreal|Victoria Bridge]], which was the only major rail link between Montreal and the [[South Shore (Montreal)|South Shore]]. At the time, the bridge was the longest railway bridge in the world. Development had begun to spread into Greenfield Park, which merited the establishment of a town to provide services for the population.<ref name=\"gfp\">[https://web.archive.org/web/19990903110027/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hills/5559/ Greenfield Park Historical Society], geocities.com; accessed October 26, 2018.</ref>\n\n;Town\nGreenfield Park was named after the area's primary geographical features, which were in fact ''''green fields'''' and forests. The town was established on March 24, 1911. The original ''Charter of Greenfield Park'' gave reasoning for the town's creation:\n<blockquote>\n''Whereas the rate-payers of the territory comprised in cadastral lots Nos . 225 to 244 of the parish of Longueuil have by a large majority in number and value represented that, in consequence of the rapid increase of population within the said territory being a suburb of the city of Montreal and in consequence of the necessity for local improvements similar to those of other suburbs of Montreal, it is necessary that the said territory be created into a separate municipality and they have prayed, that the general principles of the Cities and Towns' Act be applied to the said municipality and also that they be granted several powers similar to those of other suburbs of Montreal which are not contained in said act . . .''<ref name=\"gpk\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090115073354/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Cabin/1066/16greenfieldpark.html History of Greenfield Park]</ref>\n</blockquote>\nWith the creation of the town came to need to put infrastructure and services in place. The only way for citizens to reach nearby [[Montreal]] was by rail, through the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] or the [[Montreal and Southern Counties Railway]]. In 1913, Greenfield Park, along with neighbouring municipalities [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|St. Lambert]], [[Montreal South]] and [[Longueuil]], built a shared sewer system and water filtration plant. The town also used [[artesian wells]] as a source for drinking water.<ref name=\"gpk\"/>\n\n;World War I and II\nDuring World War I, such a high percentage of Greenfield Parkers served in the Canadian forces that regular town meetings could not be held.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Similarly, in [[World War II]], Greenfield Park was the Canadian community that had one of the highest participation rate of military volunteers for its size. This fact was recognized by both [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]], [[J.L. Ralston]].<ref name=\"gpk\"/><ref name=\"leg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legion94.ca/pages/History/History_E.htm|title=The Birth Of Branch 94|work=Greenfield Park Branch 94|publisher=[[Royal Canadian Legion]]|accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, returning [[Royal Canadian Legion|veterans]] were able to purchase homes with financial assistance through a purchasing program put into place by the town.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n;Late 20th Century\nIn the early 1960s, Greenfield Park acquired 40 percent more land by annexing part of [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]]. This land was located on the opposite side of Taschereau, and  A large amount of veterans housing was built on these lands, particularly along Bellevue Street North. During the early 60s, over 60% of the town's population traced their ancestry to the [[United Kingdom]], roughly half of that number live in the town today.<ref name=\"gpk\"/><ref name=\"eth\">[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/ETO/Table1.cfm?T=501&Lang=E&GV=4&GID=2458015&Prov=24&S=1&O=D Ethno-Cultural Portrait of Canada].</ref>\n\n;Merger with Longueuil\nGreenfield Park was a [[town]] until January 1, 2002, when it along with several other suburbs on [[South Shore (Montreal)|Montreal's South Shore]] were merged into the amalgamated city of [[Longueuil]]. (On January 1, 2006, [[Boucherville]], [[Brossard]], [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville]] and [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]] were \"demerged\", or reconstituted.) Following these demergers, Greenfield Park became one of only three remaining boroughs of Longueuil, along with [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and [[Le Vieux-Longueuil]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:QuebecCanadaDayPark.jpg|thumb|[[Canada Day]] is celebrated annually at Empire Park.]]\n\n===Municipal===\nGreenfield Park is represented by one city councillor in [[Longueuil City Council]] and two borough councillors.

It is currently a [[Boroughs of Longueuil|borough]] of the city of [[Longueuil]]. It covers an area of {{convert|4.78|km2}}, with a population of 16,733 at the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census of Canada]]. Greenfield Park is the only borough of Longueuil that has an officially [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] status. It is primarily a post-WWI suburban area. Like the other two boroughs, most of the buildings in Greenfield Park are single-family homes. Nearly all of the land in Greenfield Park is built on, making it Longueuil's most densely populated borough.\n\nGreenfield Park is divided into two sections. The older section of the borough is to the west of [[Taschereau Boulevard]] near [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]], [[LeMoyne, Quebec|LeMoyne]] and [[Brossard]], while the newer section is to the east, near the [[Lafl\u00e8che, Quebec|Lafl\u00e8che]] neighbourhood. Most of the Greenfield Park's businesses are located along Taschereau Boulevard, the [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]]'s most important commercial artery. The [[Charles LeMoyne Hospital]], located on the Taschereau Boulevard, is the largest on the south shore.\n\n==History==\n;Seigneury of Longueuil\nBefore becoming a town, the area known as Greenfield Park was land belonging to the [[Seigneury]] of Longueuil. It had been an agricultural area up until the end of the 19th century. Greenfield Park benefited from its proximity to neighbouring St. Lambert's rail line connected to the newly constructed [[Victoria Bridge, Montreal|Victoria Bridge]], which was the only major rail link between Montreal and the [[South Shore (Montreal)|South Shore]]. At the time, the bridge was the longest railway bridge in the world. Development had begun to spread into Greenfield Park, which merited the establishment of a town to provide services for the population.<ref name=\"gfp\">[https://web.archive.org/web/19990903110027/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hills/5559/ Greenfield Park Historical Society], geocities.com; accessed October 26, 2018.</ref>\n\n;Town\nGreenfield Park was named after the area's primary geographical features, which were in fact ''''green fields'''' and forests. The town was established on March 24, 1911. The original ''Charter of Greenfield Park'' gave reasoning for the town's creation:\n<blockquote>\n''Whereas the rate-payers of the territory comprised in cadastral lots Nos . 225 to 244 of the parish of Longueuil have by a large majority in number and value represented that, in consequence of the rapid increase of population within the said territory being a suburb of the city of Montreal and in consequence of the necessity for local improvements similar to those of other suburbs of Montreal, it is necessary that the said territory be created into a separate municipality and they have prayed, that the general principles of the Cities and Towns' Act be applied to the said municipality and also that they be granted several powers similar to those of other suburbs of Montreal which are not contained in said act . . .''<ref name=\"gpk\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090115073354/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Cabin/1066/16greenfieldpark.html History of Greenfield Park]</ref>\n</blockquote>\nWith the creation of the town came to need to put infrastructure and services in place. The only way for citizens to reach nearby [[Montreal]] was by rail, through the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] or the [[Montreal and Southern Counties Railway]]. In 1913, Greenfield Park, along with neighbouring municipalities [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|St. Lambert]], [[Montreal South]] and [[Longueuil]], built a shared sewer system and water filtration plant. The town also used [[artesian wells]] as a source for drinking water.<ref name=\"gpk\"/>\n\n;World War I and II\nDuring World War I, such a high percentage of Greenfield Parkers served in the Canadian forces that regular town meetings could not be held.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Similarly, in [[World War II]], Greenfield Park was the Canadian community that had one of the highest participation rate of military volunteers for its size. This fact was recognized by both [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]], [[J.L. Ralston]].<ref name=\"gpk\"/><ref name=\"leg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legion94.ca/pages/History/History_E.htm|title=The Birth Of Branch 94|work=Greenfield Park Branch 94|publisher=[[Royal Canadian Legion]]|accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, returning [[Royal Canadian Legion|veterans]] were able to purchase homes with financial assistance through a purchasing program put into place by the town.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n;Late 20th Century\nIn the early 1960s, Greenfield Park acquired 40 percent more land by annexing part of [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]]. This land was located on the opposite side of Taschereau, and  A large amount of veterans housing was built on these lands, particularly along Bellevue Street North. During the early 60s, over 60% of the town's population traced their ancestry to the [[United Kingdom]], roughly half of that number live in the town today.<ref name=\"gpk\"/><ref name=\"eth\">[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/ETO/Table1.cfm?T=501&Lang=E&GV=4&GID=2458015&Prov=24&S=1&O=D Ethno-Cultural Portrait of Canada].</ref>\n\n;Merger with Longueuil\nGreenfield Park was a [[town]] until January 1, 2002, when it along with several other suburbs on [[South Shore (Montreal)|Montreal's South Shore]] were merged into the amalgamated city of [[Longueuil]]. (On January 1, 2006, [[Boucherville]], [[Brossard]], [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville]] and [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]] were \"demerged\", or reconstituted.) Following these demergers, Greenfield Park became one of only three remaining boroughs of Longueuil, along with [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and [[Le Vieux-Longueuil]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:QuebecCanadaDayPark.jpg|thumb|[[Canada Day]] is celebrated annually at Empire Park.]]\n\n===Municipal===\nGreenfield Park is represented by one city councillor in [[Longueuil City Council]] and two borough councillors. The borough president is Robert Myles of Option Greenfield Park. As of the November 3, 2013 [[2013 Longueuil municipal election|Longueuil municipal election]], the current borough council consists of the following councillors:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Greenfield Park Borough Council\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:150px;\"| Title\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:150px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Party\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:100px;\"| Councilor\n|-\n| City Councillor\n|  style=\"background:#2f873e; width:20px;\"| &nbsp;\n| Option Greenfield Park\n| Robert Myles\n|-\n| Borough Councillor 1\n|  style=\"background:#2f873e; width:20px;\"| &nbsp;\n| Option Greenfield Park\n| Wade Wilson\n|-\n| Borough Councillor 2\n|  style=\"background:#afbd22; width:20px;\"| &nbsp;\n| Action Longueuil\n| Sylvain Joly\n|}\n\n;Coat of Arms\nGreenfield Park's [[coat of arms]] is golden, with a sable reversed [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]].

Then we say that a subset ''D'' of ''X'' is a '''[[Absolutely convex set|disk]]''' if it is [[convex set|convex]] and [[balanced set|balanced]]. The disk ''D'' is necessarily [[absorbing set|absorbing]] in the space <math>\\operatorname{span} D</math> and so its [[Minkowski functional]] forms a seminorm on this space, which is denoted by <math>\\mu_D</math> or by ''p<sub>D</sub>'' and defined by <math>\\mu_D(x) := \\inf_{x \\in \\lambda B} | \\lambda|</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=370}}  When we give <math>\\operatorname{span} D</math> the topology induced by this seminorm, we denote the resulting topological vector space by <math>X_D</math>. A bounded disk in ''X'' for which ''X<sub>D</sub>'' is a Banach space is called a '''Banach disk''', '''infracomplete''', or a '''bounded completant'''. \n\nThis space is not necessarily Hausdorff as is the case, for instance, if we let <math>X = \\mathbb{R}^2</math> and ''D'' be the ''x''-axis. However, if ''D'' is a [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|bounded]] disk and if ''X'' is Hausdorff, then <math>\\mu_D</math> is a norm and ''X<sub>D</sub>'' is a normed space. If ''D'' is a bounded sequentially complete disk and ''X'' is Hausdorff, then the space ''X<sub>D</sub>'' is a Banach space. \n\n=== Topology ===\nA basis of neighborhoods of ''0'' of this space consists of all sets of the form ''r D'' where ''r'' ranges over all positive real numbers. If ''D'' is [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|von Neuman bounded]] in ''X'' then the (normed) topology of ''X<sub>D</sub>'' will be finer than the subspace topology that ''X'' induces on this set. In particular, the natural injection <math>X_{D} \\to X</math> is continuous.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=370}} <math>X_D</math>'s topology is in fact finer than even the subspace topolofy that <math>\\operatorname{span} D</math> inherits from <math>X_{\\tau}</math>, which is ''X'' with the [[Mackey topology]]. \n\nLet <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)</math> be a net in <math>X_{B}</math> and suppose that ''B'' is balanced, convex, and bounded. Then <math>x_{\\alpha} \\to 0</math> in <math>X_{B}</math> if and only if there exists a net <math>\\left( r_{\\alpha} \\right)</math> of real numbers such that <math>r_{\\alpha} \\to 0</math> and <math>x_{\\alpha} \\in r_{\\alpha} B</math>, where we can take for all <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>r_{\\alpha} \\geq 0</math>. \n\n=== Canonical maps ===\nThe natural inclusion <math>\\operatorname{In}_B : X_B \\to X</math> is called the '''canonical map''' and it is a continuous linear injection.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}} \n\nSuppose that ''B'' and ''C'' are bounded disks in ''X'' with <math>\\emptyset \\neq B \\subseteq C</math>. Then <math>E_B \\subseteq E_C</math> and the natural inclusion <math>\\operatorname{In}_B^C : X_B \\to X_C</math> is a continuous linear map called the '''canonical embedding'''.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}}\n\n=== Properties ===\nSuppose that ''X'' is a locally convex Hausdorff space. If ''D'' is a bounded Banach disk in ''X'' and ''T'' is a barrel in ''X'' then ''T'' absorbs ''D'' (i.e. there is a number ''r > 0'' such that ''D \u2286 r T'').\n\n===Examples===\nLet <math>B</math> be a convex balanced subset of ''X''. \n* Any closed and bounded disk in a Banach space is a Banach disk. \n* Any complete bounded disk is a Banach disk. In particular, any convex balanced compacy subset is a Banach disk.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | pp=370-371}} \n* If <math>L : X \\to Y</math> is a continuous linear map and <math>B \\subseteq X</math> is a Banach disk, then <math>h(B)</math> is a Banach disk and <math>h\\big\\vert_{X_B} : X_B \\to h\\left( X_B \\right)</math> induces an isometric TVS-isomorphism <math>F_{h(B)} \\cong X_{B} / \\left( X_{B} \\cap \\operatorname{ker} h \\right)</math>. \n* If ''U'' is a convex balanced closed neighborhood of ''0'' in ''X'' then the collection of all neighborhoods ''r U'', where ''r > 0'' ranges over the positive real numbers, induces a topological vector space topology on ''X''. When ''X'' has this topology, it is denoted by ''X_U''. Since this topology is not necessarily Hausdorff nor complete, the completion of the Hausdorff space <math>X_U/\\ker(\\mu_U)</math> is denoted by <math>\\hat{X}_U</math> so that <math>\\hat{X}_U</math> is a complete Hausdorff space and <math>\\mu_U</math> is a norm on this space making <math>\\hat{X}_U</math> into a Banach space. The polar of ''U'', <math>D'</math>, is a weakly compact bounded equicontinuous disk in <math>X^*</math> and so is infracomplete.\n\n==  Induced by a radial disk - Quotient ==\nSuppose that ''X'' is a topological vector space and ''V'' is a [[convex set|convex]] [[balanced set|balanced]] and [[radial set|radial]] set. \nThen <math>\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{n} V : n = 1, 2, \\ldots \\right\\}</math> is a neighborhood basis at the origin for some locally convex topology <math>\\tau_{V}</math> on ''X''. This TVS topology <math>\\tau_{V}</math> is given by the [[Minkowski functional]] formed by ''V'', <math>p_V : X \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>, which is a seminorm on ''X'' defined by <math>p_V(x) = \\inf_{r > 0, x \\in r V} r</math>. The topology <math>\\tau_{V}</math> is Hausdorff if and only if <math>p_V</math> is a norm, or equivalently, if and only if <math>p_V^{-1}(0) = \\{ 0 \\}</math> or equivalently, for which it suffices that ''V'' be [[von Neumann bounded|bounded]] in ''X''. The topology <math>\\tau_{V}</math> need not be Hausdorff but <math>X / p_V^{-1}(0)</math> is Hausdorff. A norm on <math>X / p_V^{-1}(0)</math> is given by <math>\\left\\| x + p_{V}^{-1}(0) \\right\\| = p_{V}(x)</math>, where this value is in fact independent of the representative of the equivalence class <math>x + p_{V}^{-1}(0)</math> chosen. The normed space <math>\\left( X / p_V^{-1}(0), \\| \\cdot \\| \\right)</math> is denoted by <math>X_V</math> and its completion is denoted by <math>\\hat{X}_V</math>.  \n\nIf in addition ''V'' is bounded in ''X'' then the seminorm <math>p_V : X \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> is a norm so in particular, <math>p_V^{-1}(0) = \\{ 0 \\}</math>. In this case, we take <math>X_V</math> to be the vector space <math>X</math> instead of <math>X / \\{ 0 \\}</math> so that the notation <math>X_V</math> is unambiguous (whether <math>X_V</math> denotes the space induced by a radial disk or the space induced by a bounded disk).{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}} \n\nThe [[quotient topology]] <math>\\tau_Q</math> on <math>X / p_V^{-1}(0)</math> (inherited from ''X'''s original topology) is finer (in general, strictly finer) than the norm topology. \n\n=== Canonical maps ===\nThe '''canonical map''' is the [[quotient map]] <math>q_V : X \\to X_V = X / p_V^{-1}(0)</math>, which is continuous when <math>X_V</math> has either the norm topology or the quotient topology.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}}\n\nIf ''U'' and ''V'' are radial disks such that <math>U \\subseteq V</math> then <math>p_U^{-1}(0) \\subseteq p_V^{-1}(0)</math> so there is a continuous linear surjective '''canonical map''' <math>q_{V, U} : X / p_U^{-1}(0) \\to X / p_V^{-1}(0) = X_V</math> defined by sending <math>x + p_U^{-1}(0) \\in X_U = X / p_U^{-1}(0)</math> to the equivalence class <math>x + p_V^{-1}(0)</math>, where one may verify that the definition does not depend on the representative of the equivalence class <math>x + p_U^{-1}(0)</math> that is chosen.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}} This canonical map has norm <math>\\leq 1</math>{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}} and it has a unique continuous linear canonical extension to <math>\\hat{X}_U</math> that is denoted by <math>\\hat{q}_{V, U} : \\hat{X}_U \\to \\hat{X}_V</math>.\n\nSuppose that in addition ''B'' and ''C'' are bounded disks in ''X'' with <math>\\emptyset \\neq B \\subseteq C</math> so that <math>E_B \\subseteq E_C</math> and the natural inclusion <math>\\operatorname{In}_B^C : X_B \\to X_C</math> is a continuous linear map. Let <math>\\operatorname{In}_B : X_B \\to X</math>, <math>\\operatorname{In}_C : X_C \\to X</math>, and <math>\\operatorname{In}_B^C : X_B \\to X_C</math> be the canonical maps. Then <math>\\operatorname{In}_C = \\operatorname{In}_B^C \\circ \\operatorname{In}_B</math> and <math>q_V = q_{V, U} \\circ q_U</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}}\n\n== Induced by a bounded radial disk ==\nSuppose that ''S'' is a bounded radial disk. \nSince ''S'' is a bounded disk, if we let ''D := S'' then we may create the auxiliary normed space <math>X_D := \\operatorname{span}(D)</math> with norm <math>\\mu_{D}(x) = \\inf_{r > 0, x \\in r D} r</math>; since ''S'' is radial, <math>X_S = X</math>. \nSince ''S'' is a radial disk, if we let ''V := S'' then we may create the auxiliary seminormed space <math>X/p_V^{-1}(0)</math> by the seminorm <math>p_V(x) = \\inf_{r > 0, x \\in r D} r</math>; because ''S'' is bounded, this seminorm is a norm and <math>p_V^{-1}(0) = \\{ 0 \\}</math> so <math>X/p_V^{-1}(0) = X/\\{ 0 \\} = X</math>. \nThus, in this case the two auxiliary normed spaces produced by these two different methods result in the same normed space. \n\n== Duality ==\nSuppose that <math>E^{\\prime}</math> is a weakly closed equicontinuous disk in <math>X^{\\prime}</math> (this implies that <math>E^{\\prime}</math> is weakly compact) and let <math>U := E^{\\prime \\circ} = \\{ x \\in X : |e(x)| \\leq 1 \\text{ for all } e \\in E\\}</math> be the polar of <math>E^{\\prime}</math>. Since <math>U^{\\circ} = E^{\\prime \\circ \\circ} = E^{\\prime}</math> by the [[bipolar theorem]], it follows that a continuous linear functional <math>\\lambda</math> belongs to <math>X^{\\prime}_{E^{\\prime}} = \\operatorname{span} E^{\\prime}</math> if and only if <math>\\lambda</math> belongs to the continuous dual space of <math>\\left( X, \\mu_U \\right)</math>, where <math>\\mu_U</math> is the [[Minkowski functional]] of <math>U</math> defined by <math>\\mu_U(x) = \\inf_{r > 0, x \\in r U} r</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=477}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Injective tensor product]]\n* [[Nuclear operator]]s\n* [[Nuclear space]]s\n* [[Initial topology]]\n* [[Projective tensor product]]\n* [[Tensor product of Hilbert spaces]]\n* [[Topological tensor product]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | last=Diestel | first=Joe | title=The metric theory of tensor products : Grothendieck's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 revisited | publisher=American Mathematical Society | publication-place=Providence, R.I | year=2008 | isbn=0-8218-4440-7 | oclc=185095773 | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Diestel | 2008 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Dubinsky | first=Ed | title=The structure of nuclear Fr\u00e9chet spaces | publisher=Springer-Verlag | publication-place=Berlin New York | year=1979 | isbn=3-540-09504-7 | oclc=5126156 | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Dubinsky | 1979 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Grothendieck | first=Grothendieck | title=Produits tensoriels topologiques et espaces nucl\u00e9aires | publisher=American Mathematical Society | publication-place=Providence | year=1966 | isbn=0-8218-1216-5 | oclc=1315788 | language=fr | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Grothendieck | 1966 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Husain | first=Taqdir | title=Barrelledness in topological and ordered vector spaces | publisher=Springer-Verlag | publication-place=Berlin New York | year=1978 | isbn=3-540-09096-7 | oclc=4493665 | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Husain | 1978 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Khaleelulla | first=S.

Then we say that a subset ''D'' of ''X'' is a '''[[Absolutely convex set|disk]]''' if it is [[convex set|convex]] and [[balanced set|balanced]]. The disk ''D'' is necessarily [[absorbing set|absorbing]] in the space <math>\\operatorname{span} D</math> and so its [[Minkowski functional]] forms a seminorm on this space, which is denoted by <math>\\mu_D</math> or by ''p<sub>D</sub>'' and defined by <math>\\mu_D(x) := \\inf_{x \\in \\lambda B} | \\lambda|</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=370}}  When we give <math>\\operatorname{span} D</math> the topology induced by this seminorm, we denote the resulting topological vector space by <math>X_D</math>. A bounded disk in ''X'' for which ''X<sub>D</sub>'' is a Banach space is called a '''Banach disk''', '''infracomplete''', or a '''bounded completant'''. \n\nThis space is not necessarily Hausdorff as is the case, for instance, if we let <math>X = \\mathbb{R}^2</math> and ''D'' be the ''x''-axis. However, if ''D'' is a [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|bounded]] disk and if ''X'' is Hausdorff, then <math>\\mu_D</math> is a norm and ''X<sub>D</sub>'' is a normed space. If ''D'' is a bounded sequentially complete disk and ''X'' is Hausdorff, then the space ''X<sub>D</sub>'' is a Banach space. \n\n=== Topology ===\nA basis of neighborhoods of ''0'' of this space consists of all sets of the form ''r D'' where ''r'' ranges over all positive real numbers. If ''D'' is [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|von Neuman bounded]] in ''X'' then the (normed) topology of ''X<sub>D</sub>'' will be finer than the subspace topology that ''X'' induces on this set. In particular, the natural injection <math>X_{D} \\to X</math> is continuous.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=370}} <math>X_D</math>'s topology is in fact finer than even the subspace topolofy that <math>\\operatorname{span} D</math> inherits from <math>X_{\\tau}</math>, which is ''X'' with the [[Mackey topology]]. \n\nLet <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)</math> be a net in <math>X_{B}</math> and suppose that ''B'' is balanced, convex, and bounded. Then <math>x_{\\alpha} \\to 0</math> in <math>X_{B}</math> if and only if there exists a net <math>\\left( r_{\\alpha} \\right)</math> of real numbers such that <math>r_{\\alpha} \\to 0</math> and <math>x_{\\alpha} \\in r_{\\alpha} B</math>, where we can take for all <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>r_{\\alpha} \\geq 0</math>. \n\n=== Canonical maps ===\nThe natural inclusion <math>\\operatorname{In}_B : X_B \\to X</math> is called the '''canonical map''' and it is a continuous linear injection.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}} \n\nSuppose that ''B'' and ''C'' are bounded disks in ''X'' with <math>\\emptyset \\neq B \\subseteq C</math>. Then <math>E_B \\subseteq E_C</math> and the natural inclusion <math>\\operatorname{In}_B^C : X_B \\to X_C</math> is a continuous linear map called the '''canonical embedding'''.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}}\n\n=== Properties ===\nSuppose that ''X'' is a locally convex Hausdorff space. If ''D'' is a bounded Banach disk in ''X'' and ''T'' is a barrel in ''X'' then ''T'' absorbs ''D'' (i.e. there is a number ''r > 0'' such that ''D \u2286 r T'').\n\n===Examples===\nLet <math>B</math> be a convex balanced subset of ''X''. \n* Any closed and bounded disk in a Banach space is a Banach disk. \n* Any complete bounded disk is a Banach disk. In particular, any convex balanced compacy subset is a Banach disk.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | pp=370-371}} \n* If <math>L : X \\to Y</math> is a continuous linear map and <math>B \\subseteq X</math> is a Banach disk, then <math>h(B)</math> is a Banach disk and <math>h\\big\\vert_{X_B} : X_B \\to h\\left( X_B \\right)</math> induces an isometric TVS-isomorphism <math>F_{h(B)} \\cong X_{B} / \\left( X_{B} \\cap \\operatorname{ker} h \\right)</math>. \n* If ''U'' is a convex balanced closed neighborhood of ''0'' in ''X'' then the collection of all neighborhoods ''r U'', where ''r > 0'' ranges over the positive real numbers, induces a topological vector space topology on ''X''. When ''X'' has this topology, it is denoted by ''X_U''. Since this topology is not necessarily Hausdorff nor complete, the completion of the Hausdorff space <math>X_U/\\ker(\\mu_U)</math> is denoted by <math>\\hat{X}_U</math> so that <math>\\hat{X}_U</math> is a complete Hausdorff space and <math>\\mu_U</math> is a norm on this space making <math>\\hat{X}_U</math> into a Banach space. The polar of ''U'', <math>D'</math>, is a weakly compact bounded equicontinuous disk in <math>X^*</math> and so is infracomplete.\n\n==  Induced by a radial disk - Quotient ==\nSuppose that ''X'' is a topological vector space and ''V'' is a [[convex set|convex]] [[balanced set|balanced]] and [[radial set|radial]] set. \nThen <math>\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{n} V : n = 1, 2, \\ldots \\right\\}</math> is a neighborhood basis at the origin for some locally convex topology <math>\\tau_{V}</math> on ''X''. This TVS topology <math>\\tau_{V}</math> is given by the [[Minkowski functional]] formed by ''V'', <math>p_V : X \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>, which is a seminorm on ''X'' defined by <math>p_V(x) = \\inf_{r > 0, x \\in r V} r</math>. The topology <math>\\tau_{V}</math> is Hausdorff if and only if <math>p_V</math> is a norm, or equivalently, if and only if <math>p_V^{-1}(0) = \\{ 0 \\}</math> or equivalently, for which it suffices that ''V'' be [[von Neumann bounded|bounded]] in ''X''. The topology <math>\\tau_{V}</math> need not be Hausdorff but <math>X / p_V^{-1}(0)</math> is Hausdorff. A norm on <math>X / p_V^{-1}(0)</math> is given by <math>\\left\\| x + p_{V}^{-1}(0) \\right\\| = p_{V}(x)</math>, where this value is in fact independent of the representative of the equivalence class <math>x + p_{V}^{-1}(0)</math> chosen. The normed space <math>\\left( X / p_V^{-1}(0), \\| \\cdot \\| \\right)</math> is denoted by <math>X_V</math> and its completion is denoted by <math>\\hat{X}_V</math>.  \n\nIf in addition ''V'' is bounded in ''X'' then the seminorm <math>p_V : X \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> is a norm so in particular, <math>p_V^{-1}(0) = \\{ 0 \\}</math>. In this case, we take <math>X_V</math> to be the vector space <math>X</math> instead of <math>X / \\{ 0 \\}</math> so that the notation <math>X_V</math> is unambiguous (whether <math>X_V</math> denotes the space induced by a radial disk or the space induced by a bounded disk).{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}} \n\nThe [[quotient topology]] <math>\\tau_Q</math> on <math>X / p_V^{-1}(0)</math> (inherited from ''X'''s original topology) is finer (in general, strictly finer) than the norm topology. \n\n=== Canonical maps ===\nThe '''canonical map''' is the [[quotient map]] <math>q_V : X \\to X_V = X / p_V^{-1}(0)</math>, which is continuous when <math>X_V</math> has either the norm topology or the quotient topology.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}}\n\nIf ''U'' and ''V'' are radial disks such that <math>U \\subseteq V</math> then <math>p_U^{-1}(0) \\subseteq p_V^{-1}(0)</math> so there is a continuous linear surjective '''canonical map''' <math>q_{V, U} : X / p_U^{-1}(0) \\to X / p_V^{-1}(0) = X_V</math> defined by sending <math>x + p_U^{-1}(0) \\in X_U = X / p_U^{-1}(0)</math> to the equivalence class <math>x + p_V^{-1}(0)</math>, where one may verify that the definition does not depend on the representative of the equivalence class <math>x + p_U^{-1}(0)</math> that is chosen.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}} This canonical map has norm <math>\\leq 1</math>{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}} and it has a unique continuous linear canonical extension to <math>\\hat{X}_U</math> that is denoted by <math>\\hat{q}_{V, U} : \\hat{X}_U \\to \\hat{X}_V</math>.\n\nSuppose that in addition ''B'' and ''C'' are bounded disks in ''X'' with <math>\\emptyset \\neq B \\subseteq C</math> so that <math>E_B \\subseteq E_C</math> and the natural inclusion <math>\\operatorname{In}_B^C : X_B \\to X_C</math> is a continuous linear map. Let <math>\\operatorname{In}_B : X_B \\to X</math>, <math>\\operatorname{In}_C : X_C \\to X</math>, and <math>\\operatorname{In}_B^C : X_B \\to X_C</math> be the canonical maps. Then <math>\\operatorname{In}_C = \\operatorname{In}_B^C \\circ \\operatorname{In}_B</math> and <math>q_V = q_{V, U} \\circ q_U</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=97}}\n\n== Induced by a bounded radial disk ==\nSuppose that ''S'' is a bounded radial disk. \nSince ''S'' is a bounded disk, if we let ''D := S'' then we may create the auxiliary normed space <math>X_D := \\operatorname{span}(D)</math> with norm <math>\\mu_{D}(x) = \\inf_{r > 0, x \\in r D} r</math>; since ''S'' is radial, <math>X_S = X</math>. \nSince ''S'' is a radial disk, if we let ''V := S'' then we may create the auxiliary seminormed space <math>X/p_V^{-1}(0)</math> by the seminorm <math>p_V(x) = \\inf_{r > 0, x \\in r D} r</math>; because ''S'' is bounded, this seminorm is a norm and <math>p_V^{-1}(0) = \\{ 0 \\}</math> so <math>X/p_V^{-1}(0) = X/\\{ 0 \\} = X</math>. \nThus, in this case the two auxiliary normed spaces produced by these two different methods result in the same normed space. \n\n== Duality ==\nSuppose that <math>E^{\\prime}</math> is a weakly closed equicontinuous disk in <math>X^{\\prime}</math> (this implies that <math>E^{\\prime}</math> is weakly compact</math>) and let <math>U := E^{\\prime \\circ} = \\{ x \\in X : |e(x)| \\leq 1 \\text{ for all } e \\in E\\}</math> be the polar of <math>E^{\\prime}</math>. Since <math>U^{\\circ} = E^{\\prime \\circ \\circ} = E^{\\prime}</math> by the [[bipolar theorem]], it follows that a continuous linear functional <math>\\lambda</math> belongs to <math>X^{\\prime}_{E^{\\prime}} = \\operatorname{span} E^{\\prime}</math> if and only if <math>\\lambda</math> belongs to the continuous dual space of <math>\\left( X, \\mu_U \\right)</math>, where <math>\\mu_U</math> is the [[Minkowski functional]] of <math>U</math> defined by <math>\\mu_U(x) = \\inf_{r > 0, x \\in r U} r</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=477}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Injective tensor product]]\n* [[Nuclear operator]]s\n* [[Nuclear space]]s\n* [[Initial topology]]\n* [[Projective tensor product]]\n* [[Tensor product of Hilbert spaces]]\n* [[Topological tensor product]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | last=Diestel | first=Joe | title=The metric theory of tensor products : Grothendieck's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 revisited | publisher=American Mathematical Society | publication-place=Providence, R.I | year=2008 | isbn=0-8218-4440-7 | oclc=185095773 | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Diestel | 2008 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Dubinsky | first=Ed | title=The structure of nuclear Fr\u00e9chet spaces | publisher=Springer-Verlag | publication-place=Berlin New York | year=1979 | isbn=3-540-09504-7 | oclc=5126156 | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Dubinsky | 1979 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Grothendieck | first=Grothendieck | title=Produits tensoriels topologiques et espaces nucl\u00e9aires | publisher=American Mathematical Society | publication-place=Providence | year=1966 | isbn=0-8218-1216-5 | oclc=1315788 | language=fr | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Grothendieck | 1966 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Husain | first=Taqdir | title=Barrelledness in topological and ordered vector spaces | publisher=Springer-Verlag | publication-place=Berlin New York | year=1978 | isbn=3-540-09096-7 | oclc=4493665 | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Husain | 1978 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Khaleelulla | first=S.

In Westchester, it serves some of that county's most affluent communities as it slowly trends eastward.\n\n===Manhattan and the Bronx===\nThe Harlem Line begins underground at [[Grand Central Terminal]], on the [[Park Avenue main line]]. The train tracks leave underground north of 97th Street and run on an elevated [[viaduct]] starting at 102nd Street in Manhattan. After stopping at [[Harlem\u2013125th Street (Metro-North station)|Harlem\u2013125th Street]], the Harlem Line crosses the Harlem River at 135th Street in [[Manhattan]], entering [[the Bronx]] via the [[Park Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Park Avenue Bridge]]. The train tracks go into [[Cut (earthmoving)|open-cut]] north of 144th Street.\n\nIn the Bronx, the Harlem Line cuts through the neighborhoods of the southwest Bronx, with two stations: [[Melrose (Metro-North station)|Melrose]], at 162nd Street (it then runs under the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) and [[Tremont (Metro-North station)|Tremont]], at 177th Street. [[Fordham (Metro-North station)|Fordham]] station is next, at Fordham Road (190th Street). The tracks rise to ground level after the Fordham station. The Harlem Line then parallels the western edge of [[Fordham University]] until the [[Botanical Garden (Metro-North station)|Botanical Garden]] station at Bedford Park Boulevard (200th Street).\n\nThe Harlem Line then cuts northeast to join the Bronx River Parkway, which lies to the east of the tracks. The [[Williams Bridge (Metro-North station)|Williams Bridge]] station is next, at Gun Hill Road (210th Street). After the Williams Bridge station, [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] begins to the west of the tracks, with [[Webster Avenue]] in between the cemetery and tracks. The [[Woodlawn (Metro-North station)|Woodlawn]] station is at 233rd Street, and it is north of here that the [[New Haven Line]] diverges to head east towards the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\nThe Harlem Line then goes under a bridge for the parkway, and it remains to the west of the tracks until [[Scarsdale (Metro-North station)|Scarsdale]] station. The [[Wakefield (Metro-North station)|Wakefield]] station at 241st Street concludes the Bronx portion of the Harlem Line.\n\n===Westchester County===\nThe [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] portion of the Harlem Line begins at Bronx River Road in southeastern [[Yonkers]]. After the [[Mount Vernon West (Metro-North station)|Mount Vernon West]] station, the Harlem Line runs along the on-ramp to the [[Cross County Parkway]] eastbound, right before Fleetwood station. After the [[Bronxville (Metro-North station)|Bronxville]] station, the Harlem Line parallels the [[Bronx River Parkway]] all the way up to [[White Plains (Metro-North station)|White Plains]].\n\nFrom White Plains, the railroad winds its way through the city and passing through the yards at [[North White Plains (Metro-North station)|North White Plains]], which was the northern boundary of third-rail electrification until 1984. The stretch north of North White Plains is unique because it is the only third-rail electrified stretch of Metro-North's network that has [[grade crossing]]s, a byproduct of its existence pre-electrification. [[Katonah (Metro-North station)|Katonah]] and [[Brewster (Metro-North station)|Brewster]] stations are located right next to [[grade crossings]].\n\nAfter North White Plains, the next station is [[Valhalla (Metro-North station)|Valhalla]] adjacent to the Taconic State Parkway. The double-track railroad then curves to follow the [[Saw Mill River]] Valley and the eponymous parkway. Rail and road briefly separate at [[Mount Kisco (Metro-North station)|Mount Kisco]], but then remain close by at the last stop along the Saw Mill, [[Bedford Hills (Metro-North station)|Bedford Hills]] (although the parkway cannot be seen from the station).\n\nPast Katonah, the railroad runs between the [[Croton River]] and I-684. [[Golden's Bridge (Metro-North station)|Golden's Bridge]] and [[Purdy's (Metro-North station)|Purdy's]] are both located very close to the interstate, although only the former can be seen from it. North of the latter, the tracks follow the river to [[Croton Falls (Metro-North station)|Croton Falls]], and pick up Route 22 for the first time.\n\n===Putnam County===\nAfter Croton Falls station, the Harlem Line runs along [[East Branch Reservoir]] and crosses into Putnam County and its rural landscape. Above Brewster station, the railroad passes through the yards at Putnam Junction to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]] station, which was formerly known as Brewster North. This is the northern boundary of [[third rail]] electrification.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} \n\nNorth of Southeast, the line operates with a single track and uses diesel locomotives. This section is also known as the Wassaic Branch. Prior to the 2010s, the branch was not signalized, and manual block system rules were used to direct train movements;<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} however, [[positive train control]] was installed in the late 2010s.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kazmi | first=Aleeza | title=Positive Train Control Testing Begins On LIRR, Metro-North | website=WSHU | date=October 16, 2018 | url=https://www.wshu.org/post/positive-train-control-testing-begins-lirr-metro-north | access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> The track finally follows its own course, away from any road or river, past the former Dykemans and abandoned [[Towners (NYCRR station)|Towners]] stations up to [[Patterson (Metro-North station)|Patterson]] and into Dutchess County.\n\n===Dutchess County===\nShortly before reaching [[Pawling (Metro-North station)|Pawling]], the line enters the Harlem Valley (which takes its name from the railroad) and begins to parallel Route 22, although not as closely as it did the roads further south. A few miles north of Pawling, the [[Appalachian Trail]] crossing has [[Appalachian Trail (Metro-North station)|its own stop]] to allow [[Thru-hiking|thru-hikers]] to take a break in the city and day hikers to visit the nearby [[Pawling Nature Preserve]].\n\nThe next two stops, [[Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale (Metro-North station)|Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale]] and [[Dover Plains (Metro-North station)|Dover Plains]], are roughly eight miles (13&nbsp;km) apart, the longest distance between any two stops on the Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was the last stop on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era that had not yet been torn up were renovated and the line was extended to [[Tenmile River (Metro-North station)|Tenmile River]] and its new northern terminus, [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]]. The total travel time between Grand Central and Wassaic is 2 hours on a peak through train.\n\nA small [[rail yard|yard]] where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|New York and Harlem Railroad}}\n\n=== Origin as a streetcar line ===\n[[File:1847_Lower_Manhattan_map.jpg|thumb|An 1847 map of [[Lower Manhattan]]; the only railroad in Manhattan at that time was the New York and Harlem Railroad]]\nThe Harlem Line in its current form originated from the New York and Harlem Railroad (NY&H), which was the first streetcar company in the [[United States]].

In 1836 amendment to its charter granted it the right to enter Manhattan along a route that they \"may deem most eligible\"\u2013direct competition to the NY&H. The NY&A had periods of inactivity, in part due to the [[Panic of 1837|financial panic of 1837]]. Surveys were completed in some places, and ground was proken in various areas. [[Gouverneur Morris Jr.|Gouverneur Morris]], a Vice President and Director of the NY&A, reached an agreement with the Harlem.

Initially, the work was to be completed by the end of 1983, but due to a strike, its completion was delayed to 1984. Initially, service was provided with a mixture of new and old electric cars, but these were replaced by the new [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M3A]]s.

Reverse-peak trains were able to run every 30 minutes instead of every 90 minutes, helping fuel a 30 percent increase in ridership along the line through Southern Westchester and the Bronx. Most of the new reverse-peak users came from the Bronx. The increased service helped revitalize White Plains' downtown, helping anchor the economy of central Westchester.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rauchfoundation.org/files/9913/5818/7008/How_the_LIRR_Could_Shape_the_Next_Economy.pdf|title=How the Long Island Rail Road Could Shape the Next Economy|date=2013|website=rauchfoundation.org|publisher=Regional Plan Association|pages=11\u201312|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> Express trains could skip stops via the express track while additional local trains could make stops in Westchester and the Bronx.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/rail-line-upgrade-boosting-ridership-article-1.559742|title=RAIL LINE UPGRADE BOOSTING RIDERSHIP|last=Egbert|first=Bill|date=July 21, 2005|work=NY Daily News|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Purchase by the MTA===\nOn November 13, 2018, the MTA announced its intent to purchase the Hudson and Harlem Lines as well as the Grand Central Terminal for up to $35.065 million, plus a [[Interest rate#Related terms|discount rate]] of 6.25%.<ref name=purchase/> The purchase would include all inventory, operations, improvements, and maintenance associated with each asset, except for the air rights over Grand Central.

The lower 53 miles (86&nbsp;km) from [[Grand Central Terminal]] to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]], in [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], is [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] with a [[third rail]] and has at least two tracks. The section north of Southeast, sometimes called the '''Wassaic Branch''', is a non-electrified single-track line served by [[diesel locomotive]]s. The diesel trains run as a shuttle on the northern end of the line, except rush-hour express trains to and from Grand Central.  [[Starting March 28, 2020, until further notice, there is no weekend service on The Wassaic Branch]].\n\nWith 38 stations, the Harlem Line has the most of any Metro-North main line. Its northern [[Terminal station|terminal]], [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]], is the northernmost station in the system. It is the only Metro-North line used exclusively by that carrier (no use by [[Amtrak]], though [[CSX]] services freight customers as far north as [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]]) and the only one that uses the entirety of existing track. Metro-North has assigned it the [[color code]] blue, used as trim on station signs and [[spot color]] on printed [[Public transport timetable|timetables]]. The blue color-coding appears to have started with timetables issued by predecessor [[New York Central]] for the then-Harlem Division as far back as 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iridetheharlemline.com/2012/09/21/the-harlem-line-and-the-color-blue/|title=The Harlem Line, and the color blue|last=Moser|first=Emily|date=September 21, 2012|website=I Ride The Harlem Line...|access-date=June 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the line has traditionally served to bring commuters from [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to jobs in the city, since the 2000s it has begun to see more \"[[reverse commute|reverse commuting]]\" from the Bronx into Westchester and points north. The northern reaches of the line are also close enough to [[Western Massachusetts]] that residents in parts of that region are also able to commute to jobs in New York City.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|1}}<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n==Line description==\n[[File:Railway map around New York City.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Railway diagram of intercity services around New York City, showing Penn Station and [[Grand Central Terminal]]]]\nThe Harlem Line hews closely to roads along [[river]]-based transportation corridors dating back to even pre-rail times. It follows three major [[parkway]]s closely from the Bronx northwards through Westchester: the [[Bronx River Parkway]] (and a short portion that becomes the [[Taconic State Parkway]]), the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] and [[Interstate 684]]. In the last section it also begins to run close to [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]], the long north-south two-lane state highway that parallels the eastern border of the state. In Westchester, it serves some of that county's most affluent communities as it slowly trends eastward.\n\n===Manhattan and the Bronx===\nThe Harlem Line begins underground at [[Grand Central Terminal]], on the [[Park Avenue main line]]. The train tracks leave underground north of 97th Street and run on an elevated [[viaduct]] starting at 102nd Street in Manhattan. After stopping at [[Harlem\u2013125th Street (Metro-North station)|Harlem\u2013125th Street]], the Harlem Line crosses the Harlem River at 135th Street in [[Manhattan]], entering [[the Bronx]] via the [[Park Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Park Avenue Bridge]]. The train tracks go into [[Cut (earthmoving)|open-cut]] north of 144th Street.\n\nIn the Bronx, the Harlem Line cuts through the neighborhoods of the southwest Bronx, with two stations: [[Melrose (Metro-North station)|Melrose]], at 162nd Street (it then runs under the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) and [[Tremont (Metro-North station)|Tremont]], at 177th Street. [[Fordham (Metro-North station)|Fordham]] station is next, at Fordham Road (190th Street). The tracks rise to ground level after the Fordham station. The Harlem Line then parallels the western edge of [[Fordham University]] until the [[Botanical Garden (Metro-North station)|Botanical Garden]] station at Bedford Park Boulevard (200th Street).\n\nThe Harlem Line then cuts northeast to join the Bronx River Parkway, which lies to the east of the tracks. The [[Williams Bridge (Metro-North station)|Williams Bridge]] station is next, at Gun Hill Road (210th Street). After the Williams Bridge station, [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] begins to the west of the tracks, with [[Webster Avenue]] in between the cemetery and tracks. The [[Woodlawn (Metro-North station)|Woodlawn]] station is at 233rd Street, and it is north of here that the [[New Haven Line]] diverges to head east towards the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\nThe Harlem Line then goes under a bridge for the parkway, and it remains to the west of the tracks until [[Scarsdale (Metro-North station)|Scarsdale]] station. The [[Wakefield (Metro-North station)|Wakefield]] station at 241st Street concludes the Bronx portion of the Harlem Line.\n\n===Westchester County===\nThe [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] portion of the Harlem Line begins at Bronx River Road in southeastern [[Yonkers]]. After the [[Mount Vernon West (Metro-North station)|Mount Vernon West]] station, the Harlem Line runs along the on-ramp to the [[Cross County Parkway]] eastbound, right before Fleetwood station. After the [[Bronxville (Metro-North station)|Bronxville]] station, the Harlem Line parallels the [[Bronx River Parkway]] all the way up to [[White Plains (Metro-North station)|White Plains]].\n\nFrom White Plains, the railroad winds its way through the city and passing through the yards at [[North White Plains (Metro-North station)|North White Plains]], which was the northern boundary of third-rail electrification until 1984. The stretch north of North White Plains is unique because it is the only third-rail electrified stretch of Metro-North's network that has [[grade crossing]]s, a byproduct of its existence pre-electrification. [[Katonah (Metro-North station)|Katonah]] and [[Brewster (Metro-North station)|Brewster]] stations are located right next to [[grade crossings]].\n\nAfter North White Plains, the next station is [[Valhalla (Metro-North station)|Valhalla]] adjacent to the Taconic State Parkway. The double-track railroad then curves to follow the [[Saw Mill River]] Valley and the eponymous parkway. Rail and road briefly separate at [[Mount Kisco (Metro-North station)|Mount Kisco]], but then remain close by at the last stop along the Saw Mill, [[Bedford Hills (Metro-North station)|Bedford Hills]] (although the parkway cannot be seen from the station).\n\nPast Katonah, the railroad runs between the [[Croton River]] and I-684. [[Golden's Bridge (Metro-North station)|Golden's Bridge]] and [[Purdy's (Metro-North station)|Purdy's]] are both located very close to the interstate, although only the former can be seen from it. North of the latter, the tracks follow the river to [[Croton Falls (Metro-North station)|Croton Falls]], and pick up Route 22 for the first time.\n\n===Putnam County===\nAfter Croton Falls station, the Harlem Line runs along [[East Branch Reservoir]] and crosses into Putnam County and its rural landscape. Above Brewster station, the railroad passes through the yards at Putnam Junction to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]] station, which was formerly known as Brewster North. This is the northern boundary of [[third rail]] electrification.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} \n\nNorth of Southeast, the line operates with a single track and uses diesel locomotives. This section is also known as the Wassaic Branch. Prior to the 2010s, the branch was not signalized, and manual block system rules were used to direct train movements;<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} however, [[positive train control]] was installed in the late 2010s.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kazmi | first=Aleeza | title=Positive Train Control Testing Begins On LIRR, Metro-North | website=WSHU | date=October 16, 2018 | url=https://www.wshu.org/post/positive-train-control-testing-begins-lirr-metro-north | access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> The track finally follows its own course, away from any road or river, past the former Dykemans and abandoned [[Towners (NYCRR station)|Towners]] stations up to [[Patterson (Metro-North station)|Patterson]] and into Dutchess County.\n\n===Dutchess County===\nShortly before reaching [[Pawling (Metro-North station)|Pawling]], the line enters the Harlem Valley (which takes its name from the railroad) and begins to parallel Route 22, although not as closely as it did the roads further south. A few miles north of Pawling, the [[Appalachian Trail]] crossing has [[Appalachian Trail (Metro-North station)|its own stop]] to allow [[Thru-hiking|thru-hikers]] to take a break in the city and day hikers to visit the nearby [[Pawling Nature Preserve]].\n\nThe next two stops, [[Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale (Metro-North station)|Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale]] and [[Dover Plains (Metro-North station)|Dover Plains]], are roughly eight miles (13&nbsp;km) apart, the longest distance between any two stops on the Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was the last stop on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era that had not yet been torn up were renovated and the line was extended to [[Tenmile River (Metro-North station)|Tenmile River]] and its new northern terminus, [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]]. The total travel time between Grand Central and Wassaic is 2 hours on a peak through train.\n\nA small [[rail yard|yard]] where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|New York and Harlem Railroad}}\n\n=== Origin as a streetcar line ===\n[[File:1847_Lower_Manhattan_map.jpg|thumb|An 1847 map of [[Lower Manhattan]]; the only railroad in Manhattan at that time was the New York and Harlem Railroad]]\nThe Harlem Line in its current form originated from the New York and Harlem Railroad (NY&H), which was the first streetcar company in the [[United States]].

In 1836 amendment to its charter granted it the right to enter Manhattan along a route that they \"may deem most eligible\"\u2013direct competition to the NY&H.

Initially, the work was to be completed by the end of 1983, but due to a strike, its completion was delayed to 1984. Initially, service was provided with a mixture of new and old electric cars, but these were replaced by the new [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M3A]]s.

Reverse-peak trains were able to run every 30 minutes instead of every 90 minutes, helping fuel a 30 percent increase in ridership along the line through Southern Westchester and the Bronx. Most of the new reverse-peak users came from the Bronx. The increased service helped revitalize White Plains' downtown, helping anchor the economy of central Westchester.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rauchfoundation.org/files/9913/5818/7008/How_the_LIRR_Could_Shape_the_Next_Economy.pdf|title=How the Long Island Rail Road Could Shape the Next Economy|date=2013|website=rauchfoundation.org|publisher=Regional Plan Association|pages=11\u201312|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> Express trains could skip stops via the express track while additional local trains could make stops in Westchester and the Bronx.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/rail-line-upgrade-boosting-ridership-article-1.559742|title=RAIL LINE UPGRADE BOOSTING RIDERSHIP|last=Egbert|first=Bill|date=July 21, 2005|work=NY Daily News|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Purchase by the MTA===\nOn November 13, 2018, the MTA announced its intent to purchase the Hudson and Harlem Lines as well as the Grand Central Terminal for up to $35.065 million, plus a [[Interest rate#Related terms|discount rate]] of 6.25%.<ref name=purchase/> The purchase would include all inventory, operations, improvements, and maintenance associated with each asset, except for the air rights over Grand Central.

Being developed during Schreiber's tenure in a record store at the time, the magazine developed a reputation for its extensive focus on [[independent music]], but has since expanded to a variety of coverage on both indie and [[popular music]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Dan|date=November 13, 2014|url=http://ajr.org/2014/11/13/music-critics-role-changing/|title=Are Professional Music Critics an Endangered Species?|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe site generally concentrates on new music, but ''Pitchfork'' journalists have also reviewed [[reissue]]s and [[box set]]s. Since 2016, it has published retrospective reviews of classic or otherwise important albums every Sunday. The site has also published \"best-of\" lists\u2014such as the best albums of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and the best songs of the 1960s\u2014as well as annual features detailing the best albums and tracks of each year since 1999 (and a retrospective Best Albums of 1998 list in 2018).\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 230\n| image2 = Pitchfork Media Logo.svg\n| caption2 = Previous ''Pitchfork'' logo\n| total_width = \n| image1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n}}\n{{see also|The Dissolve}}\nIn late 1995, Ryan Schreiber, a recent high school graduate, created the magazine in [[Minneapolis]]. Influenced by local [[fanzine]]s and [[KUOM]], Schreiber, who had no previous writing experience, aimed to provide the Internet with a regularly updated resource for [[Indie (music)|independent music]]. Initially called ''Turntable'', the site was updated monthly with interviews and reviews. In May 1996, the site began publishing daily and was renamed ''Pitchfork'', alluding to [[Tony Montana]]'s tattoo in ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042800457.html |title= Giving Indie Acts A Plug, or Pulling It |last= Freedom du Lac |first= J. |date= April 30, 2006 |website= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1999, Schreiber relocated ''Pitchfork'' to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. By then, the site had expanded to four full-length album reviews daily, as well as sporadic interviews, features, and columns. It had also begun garnering a following for its extensive coverage of [[underground music]] and its writing style, which was often unhindered by the conventions of [[journalism]].

(Pope Francis album)|Wake Up!]]'' featured the rating \"[[3:16]]\", though using the same method of revealing ''Meow the Jewels''{{'}} actual score reveals the score to be 5.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21235-wake-up/|title=Pope Francis|work=Pitchfork}}</ref> Rather than give a proper review to [[Jet (band)|Jet]]'s ''[[Shine On (Jet album)|Shine On]]'', the site simply posted an embedded video of a monkey urinating into its own mouth and a 0.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9464-shine-on/ |title=Jet: ''Shine On'' |publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref>\n\n===Initial release 10.0 rated albums===\nThe following is a list of albums given Pitchfork's highest possible rating, on initial release. The score is rare and has only been given to eleven albums since the site was launched in 1995. Many more albums have been given a 10 on re-release. Note that Pitchfork has since deleted the reviews for 12 Rods, Amon Tobin, Walt Mink, The Flaming Lips, and Bob Dylan without replacing them with newer reviews, effectively reducing the canon of albums that Pitchfork still considers to be worthy of a 10.0 on initial release to six albums.\n\n''[[Relaxation of the Asshole]]'', a comedy album by [[Guided by Voices]] singer [[Robert Pollard]], was awarded a dual 0 and 10 on initial release. A later site redesign changed the rating to 0 only, although the explanation for the unusual rating remains in the text of the review.<ref>[https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6383-relaxation-of-the-asshole/ Robert Pollard - ''Relaxation of the Asshole'' review] \u2013 Pitchfork</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:0.95em;line-height:1.5em;\"\n|-\n!

Being developed during Schreiber's tenure in a record store at the time, the magazine developed a reputation for its extensive focus on [[independent music]], but has since expanded to a variety of coverage on both indie and [[popular music]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Dan|date=November 13, 2014|url=http://ajr.org/2014/11/13/music-critics-role-changing/|title=Are Professional Music Critics an Endangered Species?|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe site generally concentrates on new music, but ''Pitchfork'' journalists have also reviewed [[reissue]]s and [[box set]]s. Since 2016, it has published retrospective reviews of classic or otherwise important albums every Sunday. The site has also published \"best-of\" lists\u2014such as the best albums of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and the best songs of the 1960s\u2014as well as annual features detailing the best albums and tracks of each year since 1999 (and a retrospective Best Albums of 1998 list in 2018).\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 230\n| image2 = Pitchfork Media Logo.svg\n| caption2 = Previous ''Pitchfork'' logo\n| total_width = \n| image1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n}}\n{{see also|The Dissolve}}\nIn late 1995, Ryan Schreiber, a recent high school graduate, created the magazine in [[Minneapolis]]. Influenced by local [[fanzine]]s and [[KUOM]], Schreiber, who had no previous writing experience, aimed to provide the Internet with a regularly updated resource for [[Indie (music)|independent music]]. Initially called ''Turntable'', the site was updated monthly with interviews and reviews. In May 1996, the site began publishing daily and was renamed ''Pitchfork'', alluding to [[Tony Montana]]'s tattoo in ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042800457.html |title= Giving Indie Acts A Plug, or Pulling It |last= Freedom du Lac |first= J. |date= April 30, 2006 |website= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1999, Schreiber relocated ''Pitchfork'' to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. By then, the site had expanded to four full-length album reviews daily, as well as sporadic interviews, features, and columns. It had also begun garnering a following for its extensive coverage of [[underground music]] and its writing style, which was often unhindered by the conventions of [[journalism]]. In October, the site added a daily music news section.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n''Pitchfork'' has launched a variety of subsidiary websites.

As suggested in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article in April 2006, ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s reviews can have a significant influence on an album's popularity, especially if it had only been available to a limited audience or had been released on an [[independent record label]]. A dismissive 0.0 review of former Dismemberment Plan frontman [[Travis Morrison]]'s ''[[Travistan]]'' album led to a large sales drop and a virtual college radio blacklist.<ref name=\"Washington Post\"/> On the other hand, \"an endorsement from Pitchfork\u2014which dispenses its approval one-tenth of a point at a time, up to a maximum of 10 points\u2014is very valuable, indeed.\"<ref name=\"Washington Post\"/>\n\nExamples of ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s impact include:\n*[[Arcade Fire]] is among the bands most commonly cited to have benefited from a ''Pitchfork'' review.

It was expanded to three days (Friday, July 13 \u2013 Sunday, July 15), with the first day being a collaboration between ''Pitchfork'' and the British music festival [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] as part of the latter's \"Don't Look Back\" series, in which seminal artists perform their most legendary albums in their entirety. Performers that evening included [[Sonic Youth]] playing ''[[Daydream Nation]]'', [[Slint]] playing ''[[Spiderland]]'', and [[GZA (musician)|GZA/Genius]] playing ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. Some of the other artists who performed over the weekend included [[Yoko Ono]], [[De La Soul]], [[Cat Power]], [[The New Pornographers]], [[Stephen Malkmus]], [[Clipse]], [[Iron & Wine]], [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]], [[of Montreal]], [[Deerhunter]], [[Dan Deacon]], [[The Ponys]], and [[The Sea and Cake]]. Since 2011, a European winter edition of the festival takes place in Paris.\n\n===All Tomorrow's Parties===\nIn 2008 ''Pitchfork'' collaborated with [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] to curate half of the bill for one of their May festival weekends. This was the first event that ''Pitchfork'' has been involved in outside of the United States.\n\n==Rating system==\n''Pitchfork''{{'}}s music reviews use two different rating systems:\n* Individual track reviews were formerly ranked from 1 to 5 stars, but on January 15, 2007, the site introduced a new system called \"Forkcast\". In it, instead of assigning tracks a particular rating, reviewers simply label them one of the following categories: \"New Music\", \"Old Music\", \"Video\", \"Advanced Music\", \"Rising\", \"[[What the fuck?#Modern usage|WTF]]\", \"On Repeat\" (the category of their most favorably regarded songs), and \"Delete\" (for the least favored songs). {{As of|2009}}, the site had officially removed this system, opting to instead simply review tracks, while giving some a label of \"Best New Track\".\n* Album reviews are given a rating from 0 to 10, specific to one decimal point.\n\nOn October 24, 2003, Pitchformula.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchformula.com|title=Pitchformula.com|website=pitchformula.com|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}</ref> made a survey of the 5,575 reviews available on ''Pitchfork'' at that time, showing that:\n* 6.7 was the average rating\n* 2,339 reviews had been awarded a rating of 7.4 or higher\n* 2,362 reviews had been awarded a rating of between 5.0 and 7.3\n* 873 reviews had been awarded a rating of less than 5.0<ref name=\"Pitchformula\"/>\n\nBritish Sea Power's 2008 album ''[[Do You Like Rock Music?]]'' was initially awarded a tongue-in-cheek rating of \"U.2\", however the page now gives a rating of 8.2, seemingly at odds with the critical review.<ref>{{Cite web|title = British Sea Power: Do You Like Rock Music?|url = https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11152-do-you-like-rock-music/|website = Pitchfork|access-date = February 5, 2016|language = en-US}}</ref> Their rating of [[Run the Jewels]]' remix album ''Meow the Jewels'' (2015) was a pictogram of a cat's head with hearts for eyes \u2013 highlighting the pictogram and right-clicking on it reveals that the actual score is 7.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21145-meow-the-jewels/|title=Run the Jewels|work=Pitchfork}}</ref> Their review of [[Pope Francis]]' album ''[[Wake Up!

The score is rare and has only been given to eleven albums since the site was launched in 1995. Many more albums have been given a 10 on re-release. Note that Pitchfork has since deleted the reviews for 12 Rods, Amon Tobin, Walt Mink, The Flaming Lips, and Bob Dylan without replacing them with newer reviews, effectively reducing the canon of albums that Pitchfork still considers to be worthy of a 10.0 on initial release to six albums.\n\n''[[Relaxation of the Asshole]]'', a comedy album by [[Guided by Voices]] singer [[Robert Pollard]], was awarded a dual 0 and 10 on initial release. A later site redesign changed the rating to 0 only, although the explanation for the unusual rating remains in the text of the review.<ref>[https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6383-relaxation-of-the-asshole/ Robert Pollard - ''Relaxation of the Asshole'' review] \u2013 Pitchfork</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:0.95em;line-height:1.5em;\"\n|-\n!
