On 4 January 871, the [[Battle of Reading (871)|first Battle of Reading]] took place, when an army led by [[Ethelred of Wessex|King Ethelred]] and his brother [[Alfred the Great]] attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', and this account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of the town of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to winter quarters in London.<ref name=tsor14>{{cite book | first = Daphne | last = Phillips | title = The Story of Reading | publisher = Countryside Books | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-905392-07-8 | pages = 14\u201315}}</ref><ref name=ahcbbr>{{cite book | chapter = The borough of Reading: The borough | title = A History of the County of Berkshire | volume = 3 | year = 1923 | pages = 342\u2013364 | chapterurl = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43226 | editor1-first= P.H. | editor1-last= Ditchfield | editor2-first= William  | editor2-last= Page | accessdate = 5 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman conquest of England]], [[William the Conqueror]] gave land in and around Reading to his foundation of [[Battle Abbey]]. In its 1086 [[Domesday Book]] listing, the town was explicitly described as a [[borough]]. The presence of six [[mill (factory)|mill]]s is recorded, with four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle Abbey.<ref name=ahcbbr/>\n\n==Time of the Abbey==\n[[File:Reading Abbey interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reading Abbey]]]]\n[[Reading Abbey]] was founded by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] in 1121, and he is buried within the Abbey grounds. As part of his endowments, he gave the abbey his lands within Reading, along with land at [[Cholsey]]. He also arranged for the land previously owned by Battle Abbey to be transferred to Reading Abbey, in return for some of his land at [[Appledram]] in Sussex.<ref name=ahcbbr/><ref name=cs1t16>{{cite book | title = The Town of Reading and its Abbey | first = Cecil | last = Slade | publisher = MRM Associates Ltd | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-9517719-4-9 | pages = 1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nThe foundation of Reading Abbey led to the town becoming a place of [[pilgrimage]] and enhanced the town's prosperity. However the relationship between already established borough's [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] and the Abbey was to prove strained at times. In 1253 Reading's [[Guild|Merchant Guild]] successfully petitioned for the grant of a charter from the King and negotiated a division of authority with the Abbey. However disputes continued over the Abbey's powers to raise taxes and appoint the Guild's officers. Even the title of the Guild's first officer was open to dispute, with the Guild and, on occasion, the King referring to him as the Mayor, whilst the Abbey continued to call him the Guild Warden.<ref name=cs1t16/>\n\nIt is not known exactly how badly Reading was affected by the [[Black Death]] that swept through England in the 14th century. But it is known that the abbot of Reading Abbey, [[Henry of Appleford]], was one of its victims in 1361, and that nearby [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]] lost 60% of its population.<ref name=hor34>{{cite book | title = A History of Reading | first = Stuart | last = Hylton | publisher = Philimore & Co Ltd | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-86077-458-4 | pages = 34\u201338}}</ref>\n\nIn 1487, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] granted a further charter that went further than previous charters, although still leaving the appointment of the Mayor/Warden in the hands of the Abbey. This charter, and a subsequent judicial arbitration in 1499, confirmed the Guild as a [[body corporate]] in perpetuity.<ref name=cs17t25>{{cite book | title = The Town of Reading and its Abbey | first = Cecil | last = Slade | publisher = MRM Associates Ltd | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-9517719-4-9 | pages = 17\u201325}}</ref>\n\n==Dissolution and war==\nThe Abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. The last abbot, [[Hugh Cook Faringdon]], was subsequently tried and convicted of [[high treason]] and [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in front of the Abbey Church. The dissolution initially saw the Mayor appointed by the King's officers administering the dismemberment of the abbey properties. However, in 1542 [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] granted the Guild a new charter that permitted the burgesses to elect the Mayor.<ref name=\"cs17t25\"/><ref name=\"rarwa\">{{cite book | author=The staff of the Trust for Wessex Archeology and Reading Museum and Art Gallery | title=Reading Abbey Rediscovered, a summary of the Abbey's history and recent archaeological excavations | publisher=Trust for Wessex Archeology | year=1983}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Map of Redding by John Speed, 1611.jpg|thumb|The earliest map of Reading, published in 1611 by [[John Speed]].]]\nBy 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England followed closely by Colchester and Leicester, based on taxable wealth. By 1611, Reading had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth, as instanced by the fortune made by local merchant [[John Kendrick (cloth merchant)|John Kendrick]]. At this time, Reading had mostly traditional timber framed houses, a few examples of which still exist in Castle Street, Market Place and other places. Often the front ground floor of the house was given over to retail activities, with family and lodgers living in the rooms behind and above.<ref name=hor34/><ref name=hor51>{{cite book | title = A History of Reading | first = Stuart | last = Hylton | publisher = Philimore & Co Ltd | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-86077-458-4 | pages = 51\u201352}}</ref>\n\nThe town played an important role during the [[English Civil War]]; it changed hands a number of times. Despite its [[fortifications]], it had a Royalist garrison imposed on it in 1642. The subsequent [[Siege of Reading]] by the Parliamentary forces succeeded in April 1643.<ref>Barr\u00e8s-Baker, Malcolm: ''The Siege of Reading: The Failure of the Earl of Essex's 1643 Spring Offensive''.

[[James II of England|James II]] had stationed an advance guard of 600, largely Irish, troops in Reading to stop the march of [[William III of England|William's]] army towards London. Seeing these troops as an occupying force, the people of Reading requested help from William, informing him of the Royalist positions in the town. As a result, a relief force of about 250 troops attacked from an unexpected direction, and forced the Irish troops to abandon the town. This defeat of James' troops by an inferior force, together the willingness of the people of Reading to support William, convinced James of the insecurity of his position and he fled the country.<ref name=ahcbbr/><ref>{{cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work = Royal Berkshire History | publisher = Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_broadst.html | title = The Battle of Broad Street | accessdate = 27 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==18th century==\n[[File:View of Reading from Caversham by Joseph Farington, 1793.jpg|thumb|left|''View of Reading from [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]]'' by [[Joseph Farington]] in 1793.]]\nThe 18th century saw the beginning of a major [[iron works]] in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. Agricultural products from the surrounding area still used Reading as a market place, especially at the famous Reading cheese fair but now trade was coming in from a wider area.<ref name=tsor84>{{cite book | first = Daphne | last = Phillips | title = The Story of Reading | publisher = Countryside Books | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-905392-07-8 | pages = 84\u201389}}</ref>\n\nReading's trade benefited from better designed [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] roads which helped it establish its location on the major coaching routes from London to [[Oxford]] and the [[west country]]. It also gained from increasing river traffic on both the Thames and Kennet. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened the River Kennet to boats as far as Newbury. This opposition stopped when it became apparent the new route benefited the town. The opening of the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] in 1810 made it possible to go by barge from Reading to the [[Bristol Channel]].<ref name=tsor75>{{cite book | first = Daphne | last = Phillips | title = The Story of Reading | publisher = Countryside Books | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-905392-07-8 | pages = 75\u201380}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1714, and probably earlier, the role of [[county town]] for Berkshire was shared between Reading and [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]]. The [[Assizes|Assize]] and [[Quarter Sessions]] courts met in both towns, with the Lenten Assizes traditional held in Reading and the Summer Assizes in Abingdon. The [[Prison|county gaol]] was at Reading, but both had a [[house of correction]], also known as a Bridewell, that held prisoners from various parts of the county.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Judith |title=A History of Berkshire |year=1995 |publisher=Phillimore |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-729-1 |page=103 }}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the century, [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth]], lived at [[Bulmershe Court]], in what is now the Reading suburb of [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]]. Although he moved to [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] when he was appointed [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], he retained his local connections. He donated to the town of Reading the four acres (16,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) of land that is today the [[Royal Berkshire Hospital]], and his name is commemorated in the town's ''Sidmouth Street'' and ''Addington Road''.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work = Royal Berkshire History | publisher = Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/haddington.html | title = Henry Addington, Viscount Sidmouth (1757\u20131844) | accessdate = 4 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust | title = Royal Berkshire Hospital | url = http://www.royalberkshire.nhs.uk/about_us/our_locations/royal_berkshire_hospital.aspx | accessdate = 4 May 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327052337/http://www.royalberkshire.nhs.uk/about_us/our_locations/royal_berkshire_hospital.aspx# | archive-date = 27 March 2009 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Reading OS map 1830.JPG|thumb|Map of Reading from 1830 by [[Ordnance Survey]].]]\nIn 1801, the population of Reading was about 9,400. During the 19th century, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre. Reading maintained its representation by two members of parliament with the [[Reform Act 1832]], and the borough was one of the ones reformed as a [[municipal borough]] by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. In 1836 the [[Reading Borough Police]] were founded. The [[Great Western Railway]] arrived in 1841, followed by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]], in 1849, and the [[London and South Western Railway]], in 1856.\n\nThe ''Reading Establishment'', an early commercial photographic studio, operated in Reading from 1844\u201347 and was managed by Nicholaas Henneman, a [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutchman]] and former valet of [[William Fox Talbot|William Henry Fox Talbot]] (a pioneer of photography).

[[Miles Aircraft]] in Woodley was an important local firm from the 1930s to 1950s. The Lower Earley development, started in the 1970s, was the largest private housing development in Europe.

On 4 January 871, the [[Battle of Reading (871)|first Battle of Reading]] took place, when an army led by [[Ethelred of Wessex|King Ethelred]] and his brother [[Alfred the Great]] attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', and this account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of the town of Reading.

In its 1086 [[Domesday Book]] listing, the town was explicitly described as a [[borough]]. The presence of six [[mill (factory)|mill]]s is recorded, with four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle Abbey.<ref name=ahcbbr/>\n\n==Time of the Abbey==\n[[File:Reading Abbey interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reading Abbey]]]]\n[[Reading Abbey]] was founded by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] in 1121, and he is buried within the Abbey grounds. As part of his endowments, he gave the abbey his lands within Reading, along with land at [[Cholsey]]. He also arranged for the land previously owned by Battle Abbey to be transferred to Reading Abbey, in return for some of his land at [[Appledram]] in Sussex.<ref name=ahcbbr/><ref name=cs1t16>{{cite book | title = The Town of Reading and its Abbey | first = Cecil | last = Slade | publisher = MRM Associates Ltd | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-9517719-4-9 | pages = 1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nThe foundation of Reading Abbey led to the town becoming a place of [[pilgrimage]] and enhanced the town's prosperity. However the relationship between already established borough's [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] and the Abbey was to prove strained at times. In 1253 Reading's [[Guild|Merchant Guild]] successfully petitioned for the grant of a charter from the King and negotiated a division of authority with the Abbey. However disputes continued over the Abbey's powers to raise taxes and appoint the Guild's officers. Even the title of the Guild's first officer was open to dispute, with the Guild and, on occasion, the King referring to him as the Mayor, whilst the Abbey continued to call him the Guild Warden.<ref name=cs1t16/>\n\nIt is not known exactly how badly Reading was affected by the [[Black Death]] that swept through England in the 14th century.

The last abbot, [[Hugh Cook Faringdon]], was subsequently tried and convicted of [[high treason]] and [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in front of the Abbey Church. The dissolution initially saw the Mayor appointed by the King's officers administering the dismemberment of the abbey properties.

By 1611, Reading had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth, as instanced by the fortune made by local merchant [[John Kendrick (cloth merchant)|John Kendrick]]. At this time, Reading had mostly traditional timber framed houses, a few examples of which still exist in Castle Street, Market Place and other places. Often the front ground floor of the house was given over to retail activities, with family and lodgers living in the rooms behind and above.<ref name=hor34/><ref name=hor51>{{cite book | title = A History of Reading | first = Stuart | last = Hylton | publisher = Philimore & Co Ltd | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-86077-458-4 | pages = 51\u201352}}</ref>\n\nThe town played an important role during the [[English Civil War]]; it changed hands a number of times. Despite its [[fortifications]], it had a Royalist garrison imposed on it in 1642.

[[James II of England|James II]] had stationed an advance guard of 600, largely Irish, troops in Reading to stop the march of [[William III of England|William's]] army towards London. Seeing these troops as an occupying force, the people of Reading requested help from William, informing him of the Royalist positions in the town. As a result, a relief force of about 250 troops attacked from an unexpected direction, and forced the Irish troops to abandon the town. This defeat of James' troops by an inferior force, together the willingness of the people of Reading to support William, convinced James of the insecurity of his position and he fled the country.<ref name=ahcbbr/><ref>{{cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work = Royal Berkshire History | publisher = Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_broadst.html | title = The Battle of Broad Street | accessdate = 27 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==18th century==\n[[File:View of Reading from Caversham by Joseph Farington, 1793.jpg|thumb|left|''View of Reading from [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]]'' by [[Joseph Farington]] in 1793.]]\nThe 18th century saw the beginning of a major [[iron works]] in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous.

It also gained from increasing river traffic on both the Thames and Kennet. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened the River Kennet to boats as far as Newbury. This opposition stopped when it became apparent the new route benefited the town. The opening of the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] in 1810 made it possible to go by barge from Reading to the [[Bristol Channel]].<ref name=tsor75>{{cite book | first = Daphne | last = Phillips | title = The Story of Reading | publisher = Countryside Books | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-905392-07-8 | pages = 75\u201380}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1714, and probably earlier, the role of [[county town]] for Berkshire was shared between Reading and [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]]. The [[Assizes|Assize]] and [[Quarter Sessions]] courts met in both towns, with the Lenten Assizes traditional held in Reading and the Summer Assizes in Abingdon. The [[Prison|county gaol]] was at Reading, but both had a [[house of correction]], also known as a Bridewell, that held prisoners from various parts of the county.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Judith |title=A History of Berkshire |year=1995 |publisher=Phillimore |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-729-1 |page=103 }}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the century, [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth]], lived at [[Bulmershe Court]], in what is now the Reading suburb of [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]].

During the 19th century, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre. Reading maintained its representation by two members of parliament with the [[Reform Act 1832]], and the borough was one of the ones reformed as a [[municipal borough]] by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. In 1836 the [[Reading Borough Police]] were founded.

In 1975 he was hired as sports editor and feature writer for the News-Herald in Perkasie \u2013 a position he held for the next five years.  Following a brief period in which he drove across the country for fun and then worked as a truck driver, deejay and day cook, he landed a job at The Free Press in Quakertown, Pa.  There he served as a columnist, medical writer, movie reviewer and editor of a weekly entertainment magazine.  In 1981, when Free Press publisher Charles Meredith III underwent quadruple bypass surgery, Scott received permission to observe the operation directly over Meredith\u2019s chest.  He then wrote a series of award-winning articles about it for The Free Press and then adapted the series for a feature story that appeared in [[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia Magazine]] in October 1981.\n\nIn the summer of 1983, producer/director [[Mike Tollin]] and [[Gary Cohen]] (Halcyon Days Productions) hired him to write ''This is the USFL'', the weekly highlight show for the new [[United States Football League]],  which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1983-1985. Once the USFL disbanded, Scott remained with Halcyon Days Productions for several years as a freelance writer and producer.  It was during this time that he and Tollin followed Phillies slugger [[Mike Schmidt]] during his quest for 500 home runs and then produced a film that chronicled the slugger\u2019s effort.  Scott was also an integral part of various other shows and videos including ''Men of October'', ''Legacy'', ''The Best of the USFL'' and ''Michael Bolton\u2019s Winning Softball''.  In the late 1980s, Scott wrote more than 1,000 one-minute radio shows for ''John Madden\u2019s Sports Quiz'', ''John Madden\u2019s Sports Calendar'' and ''Bob Costas\u2019 Sports Flashback'' \u2013 before landing a job with MLB Productions writing for baseball television and the VCR/DVD industry.\n\n==Major League Baseball Productions==\nJeff Scott joined MLB Productions (through Phoenix Communications) in 1988 as the writer for ''ESPN\u2019s Major League Baseball Magazine'' \u2013 one of the first independently produced programs for the fledgling network. Over the next four years Scott wrote 176 episodes of the widely acclaimed program which was narrated by Warner Fusselle.  He began writing ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' \u2013 the longest running sports anthology program in television history \u2013 in 1992, for [[Mel Allen]], the legendary announcer and original voice of TWIB.  After the Hall of Fame broadcaster died in 1996, Scott wrote for another Hall of Famer, [[Ozzie Smith]], who hosted the show for two seasons.  When the Baseball Commissioner\u2019s office took back MLB Productions from Phoenix Communications in 1999 Scott began writing for Buzz Brainard, who would narrate TWIB for the next 11 seasons. Scott wrote 450 consecutive episodes of the iconic show before it was discontinued at the end of the 2011 season.  Scott wrote and helped create TWIB\u2019s replacement \u2013 ''MLB Player Poll'' \u2013 which debuted on [[FOX]] and [[MLB Network]] in the spring of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=RBR-TVBR |url=http://rbr.com/mlb-player-poll-to-air-on-fox-each-saturday/ |publisher=RBR-TVBR |title=MLB Player Poll to air on Fox each Saturday |url-status=live |accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref> The program \u2013 which polls players on a variety of subjects \u2013 was hosted by MLB Network personality, [[Greg Amsinger]] during its two year run.

Miri kora needed his army in order to protect Soran Emirate, When ottomans attacked and captured some strategic areas, a tribe leader named Rash Agha informed his tribe and collected nearly 150 to 160 men of the tribe and went off to fight the Ottomans, Rash Agha defeated the Ottomans and frightened them which made the Ottomans to fall back, that day Rash Agha recaptured all of the strategic areas and made security points all around the area.\nWhen Miri kora heard about Rash Agha's bravery by volunteering to fight the enemy, Miri kora happily invited Rash Agha to his palace and said \u201cI lost my dignity Rashid but you bought back my dignity and saved my Rawandiz with your bravery therefore you will be my prime minister\u201d Miri kora trusted rashagha with many dangerous missions such as sending Rash Agha to kill Ali Beg, Rash Agha successfully killed Ali Beg with his own dagger and brought back two his daughters as a gift for Miri kora and kept the dagger as a victory and pride for himself, the dagger became very popular at the time, After that Miri kora attacked the unarmed Assyrian towns of [[Tel Keppe]] and [[Alqosh]] and killed thousands of their inhabitants, kidnapping the women and children. Miri kora is usually attributed as Amir Muhammad, the then ruler of the [[Soran Emirate]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title= Welcome to Tel Keppe\n|publisher=Chaldeans Online\n|url= http://www.chaldeansonline.org/telkeppe/index.htm\n|accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> {{Unreliable source?|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Rowanduz Gorge.jpg|thumb|250px|Rowanduz Gorge near the city of [[Diana, Iraq|Soran]] in the North of Iraq]]\nIn 1915, during the [[First World War]], the town was occupied by the Russians and Assyrians.<ref>{{cite web\n|title= Assyrians & the Assyrian Identity in the Ottoman Empire\n|publisher=Zinda magazine\n|date=1999-11-16\n|url= http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/1999/znda1116.html\n|accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref>\nThe Muslim population was massacred by the Russians and Assyrians, after Nikolai Baratov's [[Cossacks]] recaptured the town only 20 percent of the Kurdish population managed to survive.<ref>Shattering Empires: The Clash and Collapse of the Ottoman and Russian Empires 1908-1918, Michael A.

Miri kora needed his army in order to protect Soran Emirate, When ottomans attacked and captured some strategic areas, a tribe leader named Rash Agha informed his tribe and collected nearly 150 to 160 men of the tribe and went off to fight the Ottomans, Rash Agha defeated the Ottomans and frightened them which made the Ottomans to fall back, that day Rash Agha recaptured all of the strategic areas and made security points all around the area.\nWhen Miri kora heard about Rash Agha\u2019s bravery by volunteering to fight the enemy, Miri kora happily invited Rash Agha to his palace and said \u201cI lost my dignity Rashid but you bought back my dignity and saved my Rawandiz with your bravery therefore you will be my prime minister\u201d Miri kora trusted rashagha with many dangerous missions such as sending Rash Agha to kill Ali Beg, Rash Agha successfully killed Ali Beg with his own dagger and brought back two his daughters as a gift for Miri kora and kept the dagger as a victory and pride for himself, the dagger became very popular at the time, After that Miri kora attacked the unarmed Assyrian towns of [[Tel Keppe]] and [[Alqosh]] and killed thousands of their inhabitants, kidnapping the women and children. Miri kora is usually attributed as Amir Muhammad, the then ruler of the [[Soran Emirate]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title= Welcome to Tel Keppe\n|publisher=Chaldeans Online\n|url= http://www.chaldeansonline.org/telkeppe/index.htm\n|accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> {{Unreliable source?|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Rowanduz Gorge.jpg|thumb|250px|Rowanduz Gorge near the city of [[Diana, Iraq|Soran]] in the North of Iraq]]\nIn 1915, during the [[First World War]], the town was occupied by the Russians and Assyrians.<ref>{{cite web\n|title= Assyrians & the Assyrian Identity in the Ottoman Empire\n|publisher=Zinda magazine\n|date=1999-11-16\n|url= http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/1999/znda1116.html\n|accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref>\nThe Muslim population was massacred by the Russians and Assyrians, after Nikolai Baratov's [[Cossacks]] recaptured the town only 20 percent of the Kurdish population managed to survive.<ref>Shattering Empires: The Clash and Collapse of the Ottoman and Russian Empires 1908-1918, Michael A.

It was the [[capital city]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from 402 until that empire collapsed in 476. It then served as the capital of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] until it was re-conquered in 540 by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Afterwards, the city formed the centre of the Byzantine [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] until the invasion of the [[Lombards]] in 751, after which it became the seat of the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]].\n\nAlthough it is an inland city, Ravenna is connected to the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Candiano Canal]]. It is known for its well-preserved late Roman and Byzantine architecture, with eight buildings comprising the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] \"Early Christian Monuments of Ravenna\".<ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/788</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Ravenna}}\nThe origin of the name ''Ravenna'' is unclear, although it is believed the name is [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.ravenna.it/contenuti/index.php?t=arte_storia&id=1&cat=&lang=2 Tourism in Ravenna \u2013 Official site \u2013 History]. Turismo.ravenna.it (2010-06-20). Retrieved on 2011-06-20.</ref> Some have speculated that \"ravenna\" is related to \"Rasenna\" (later \"Rasna\"), the term that the Etruscans used for themselves, but there is no agreement on this point.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n===Ancient era===\n{{see also|Ostrogothic Ravenna}}\nThe origins of Ravenna are uncertain.<ref>Deborah M. Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010), for this and much of the information that follows</ref> The first settlement is variously attributed to (and then has seen the copresence of) the [[Thessalians]], the Etruscans and the [[Umbri]]ans. Afterwards its territory was settled also by the [[Senones]], especially the southern countryside of the city (that wasn't part of the lagoon), the ''Ager Decimanus''. Ravenna consisted of houses built on piles on a series of small islands in a marshy lagoon \u2013 a situation similar to [[Venice]] several centuries later. The Romans ignored it during their conquest of the [[Po River]] Delta, but later accepted it into the [[Roman Republic]] as a federated town in 89 [[Common Era|BC]]. \n\nIn 49 BC, it was the location where [[Julius Caesar]] gathered his forces before crossing the [[Rubicon]]. Later, after his battle against [[Mark Antony]] in 31 BC, Emperor [[Augustus]] founded the military harbor of [[Classe, ancient port of Ravenna|Classe]].<ref>From ''classis, Latin \"fleet\".</ref> This harbor, protected at first by its own walls, was an important station of the [[Roman Navy|Roman Imperial Fleet]]. Nowadays the city is landlocked, but Ravenna remained an important [[seaport]] on the [[Adriatic]] until the early [[Middle Ages]]. During the Germanic campaigns, [[Thusnelda]], widow of [[Arminius]], and [[Marbod]], King of the [[Marcomanni]], were confined at Ravenna.\n[[File:Ravenna(Peutinger Map).png|thumb|left|The city of Ravenna in the 4th century as shown on the Peutinger Map]]\nRavenna greatly prospered under Roman rule. Emperor [[Trajan]] built a {{convert|70|km|2|abbr=on}} long [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]] at the beginning of the 2nd century. During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlers in Ravenna revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there.<ref>Dio 72.11.4-5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius''</ref> In AD 402, [[Emperor Honorius]] transferred the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from [[Milan]] to Ravenna. At that time it was home to 50,000 people.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/1166147/_The_Fall_and_Decline_of_the_Roman_Urban_Mind_</ref> The transfer was made partly for defensive purposes: Ravenna was surrounded by swamps and marshes, and was perceived to be easily defensible (although in fact the city fell to opposing forces numerous times in its history); it is also likely that the move to Ravenna was due to the city's port and good sea-borne connections to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. However, in 409, King [[Alaric I]] of the [[Kingdom of the Visigoths|Visigoths]] simply bypassed Ravenna, and went on to [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack]] [[Rome]] in 410 and to take [[Galla Placidia]], daughter of Emperor [[Theodosius I]], hostage. \n\nAfter many vicissitudes, Galla Placidia returned to Ravenna with her son, Emperor [[Valentinian III]], due to the support of her nephew [[Theodosius II]]. Ravenna enjoyed a period of peace, during which time the Christian religion was favoured by the imperial court, and the city gained some of its most famous monuments, including the Orthodox Baptistery, the misnamed [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] (she was not actually buried there), and [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]].\n\nThe late 5th century saw the dissolution of Roman authority in the west, and [[Romulus Augustulus|the last person to hold the title of emperor in the West]] was deposed in 476 by the general [[Odoacer]]. Odoacer ruled as King of Italy for 13 years, but in 489 the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] sent the [[Ostrogoth]] King [[Theodoric the Great]] to re-take the Italian peninsula. After losing the [[Battle of Verona (489)|Battle of Verona]], [[Odoacer]] retreated to Ravenna, where he withstood a siege of three years by Theodoric, until the taking of [[Rimini]] deprived Ravenna of supplies. Theodoric took Ravenna in 493, supposedly slew Odoacer with his own hands, and Ravenna became the capital of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of Italy. Theodoric, following his imperial predecessors, also built many splendid buildings in and around Ravenna, including his palace church [[Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]], an Arian cathedral (now Santo Spirito) and Baptistery, and his own [[Mausoleum of Theodoric|Mausoleum]] just outside the walls.\n\n[[File:Mausoleum of Theoderic.JPG|The Mausoleum of Theodoric.|left|thumb]]\nBoth Odoacer and Theodoric and their followers were [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians, but co-existed peacefully with the Latins, who were largely Catholic Orthodox. Ravenna's Orthodox bishops carried out notable building projects, of which the sole surviving one is the Capella Arcivescovile. Theodoric allowed Roman citizens within his kingdom to be subject to Roman law and the Roman judicial system. The Goths, meanwhile, lived under their own laws and customs. In 519, when a mob had burned down the synagogues of Ravenna, Theodoric ordered the town to rebuild them at its own expense.\n\nTheodoric died in 526 and was succeeded by his young grandson [[Athalaric]] under the authority of his daughter [[Amalasunta]], but by 535 both were dead and Theodoric's line was represented only by Amalasuntha's daughter [[Matasuntha]]. Various Ostrogothic military leaders took the Kingdom of Italy, but none were as successful as Theodoric had been. Meanwhile, the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox Christian]] [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]], opposed both Ostrogoth rule and the [[Arianism|Arian]] variety of Christianity. In 535 his general [[Belisarius]] [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|invaded Italy]] and in 540 conquered Ravenna. After the conquest of Italy was completed in 554, Ravenna became the seat of Byzantine government in Italy.\n\nFrom 540 to 600, Ravenna's bishops embarked upon a notable building program of churches in Ravenna and in and around the port city of Classe. Surviving monuments include the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] and the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]], as well as the partially surviving San Michele in Africisco.\n\n===Exarchate of Ravenna===\n[[File:Ravenna SantApollinare Classe3.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Transfiguration of Jesus]]. Allegorical image with [[Crux gemmata]] and lambs represent apostles, 533\u2013549, [[apse]] of [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]]]]\n{{Main|Exarchate of Ravenna}}\nFollowing the conquests of [[Belisarius]] for the Emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century, Ravenna became the seat of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor of Italy, the [[Exarch]], and was known as the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. It was at this time that the [[Ravenna Cosmography]] was written.\n\nUnder Byzantine rule, the archbishop of the [[Archbishopric of Ravenna|Archdiocese of Ravenna]] was temporarily granted [[autocephaly]] from the Roman Church by the emperor, in 666, but this was soon revoked. Nevertheless, the archbishop of Ravenna held the second place in Italy after the pope, and played an important role in many theological controversies during this period.\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\nThe [[Lombards]], under [[King Liutprand]], occupied Ravenna in 712, but were forced to return it to the Byzantines.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Noble|first1=Thomas F. X.|title=The Republic of St. Peter: The Birth of the Papal State, 680\u2013825.|url=https://archive.org/details/republicofstpete0000nobl|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press.|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-8122-1239-8}}</ref> However, in 751 the Lombard king, [[Aistulf]], succeeded in conquering Ravenna, thus ending Byzantine rule in northern Italy.\n\nKing [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] of the [[King of the Franks|Franks]] attacked the Lombards under orders of [[Pope Stephen II]]. Ravenna then gradually came under the direct authority of the [[Pope]]s, although this was contested by the archbishops at various times. [[Pope Adrian I]] authorized [[Charlemagne]] to take away anything from Ravenna that he liked, and an unknown quantity of Roman columns, [[mosaic]]s, statues, and other portable items were taken north to enrich his capital of [[Aachen]].\n\nIn 1198 Ravenna led a league of [[Romagna]] cities against the Emperor, and the Pope was able to subdue it. After the war of 1218 the [[Traversari]] family was able to impose its rule in the city, which lasted until 1240. After a short period under an Imperial vicar, Ravenna was returned to the [[Papal States]] in 1248 and again to the Traversari until, in 1275, the [[Da Polenta]] established their long-lasting seigniory. One of the most illustrious residents of Ravenna at this time was the exiled poet [[Dante]]. The last of the Da Polenta, [[Ostasio III da Polenta|Ostasio III]], was ousted by the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1440, and the city was annexed to the Venetian territories in the [[Treaty of Cremona (1441)|Treaty of Cremona]].\n\nRavenna was ruled by Venice until 1509, when the area was invaded in the course of the [[Italian Wars]]. In 1512, during the [[War of the League of Cambrai|Holy League]] wars, Ravenna was sacked by the French following the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]]. Ravenna was also known during the Renaissance as the birthplace of the [[Monster of Ravenna]].\n\nAfter the Venetian withdrawal, Ravenna was again ruled by legates of the Pope as part of the Papal States. The city was damaged in a tremendous flood in May 1636. Over the next 300 years, a network of [[canals]] diverted nearby rivers and drained nearby swamps, thus reducing the possibility of flooding and creating a large belt of agricultural land around the city.\n\n===Modern age===\nApart from another short occupation by Venice (1527\u20131529), Ravenna was part of the Papal States until 1796, when it was annexed to the French puppet state of the [[Cisalpine Republic]], ([[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]] from 1802, and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] from 1805). It was returned to the Papal States in 1814. Occupied by Piedmontese troops in 1859, Ravenna and the surrounding [[Romagna]] area became part of the new unified [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. \n\nDuring [[World War II]], troops of the British [[27th Lancers]] entered and occupied Ravenna on 5 December 1944. A total of 937 Commonwealth soldiers who died in the winter of 1944-45 are buried in Ravenna War Cemetery, including 438 Canadians. <https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/history/second-world-war/canada-Italy-1943-to-1945>  The town suffered very little damage.\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Ravenna}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Basilica of San Vitale - triumphal arch mosaics.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Basilica of San Vitale]] - triumphal arch mosaics.]]\n[[File:Mausoleum of Galla Placidia ceiling mosaics.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Garden of Eden]] mosaic in [[mausoleum of Galla Placidia]]. 5th century CE.]]\n[[File:Arian Baptistry ceiling mosaic - Ravenna.jpg|thumbnail|Arian Baptistry ceiling mosaic.]]\n[[File:Christus Ravenna Mosaic.jpg|thumb|6th-century [[mosaic]] in Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna portrays Jesus long-haired and bearded, dressed in Byzantinian style.]]\n[[File:Baptistery.Arians02.jpg|The Arian Baptistry.|thumb]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Dante Alieghri tomb in Ravenna (exterior).jpg\n| width1 = 105\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Dante Alieghri tomb in Ravenna (interior).jpg\n| width2 = 110\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Dante's tomb exterior and interior, built in 1780\n}}\n[[File:Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna.JPG|The so-called \"Mausoleum of Galla Placidia\" in Ravenna.|thumb]]\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|Mosaic of the Palace of Theodoric in Sant'Apollinare Nuovo.|thumb]]\nEight early Christian monuments of Ravenna are inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]].

It was restored after the World War II bombings. The belltower contains four bells, the two majors dating back to 1208.\n* The 6th-century church of the ''[[Church of the Spirito Santo, Ravenna|Spirito Santo]]'', which has been quite drastically altered since the 6th century. It was originally the Arian cathedral. The fa\u00e7ade has a 16th-century portico with five arcades.\n* The [[San Francesco, Ravenna|St. Francis basilica]], rebuilt in the 10th\u201311th centuries over a precedent edifice dedicated to the Apostles and later to St. Peter. Behind the humble brick fa\u00e7ade, it has a nave and two aisles. Fragments of mosaics from the first church are visible on the floor, which is usually covered by water after heavy rains (together with the crypt). Here the funeral ceremony of [[Dante Alighieri]] was held in 1321. The poet is buried in a tomb annexed to the church, the local authorities having resisted for centuries all demands by Florence for return of the remains of its most famous exile.\n* The [[Baroque]] church of ''[[Santa Maria Maggiore, Ravenna|Santa Maria Maggiore]]'' (525\u2013532, rebuilt in 1671). It houses a picture by [[Luca Longhi]].\n* The church of ''[[San Giovanni Battista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Battista]]'' (1683), also in Baroque style, with a Middle Ages campanile.\n* The basilica of ''[[Santa Maria in Porto, Ravenna|Santa Maria in Porto]]'' (16th century), with a rich fa\u00e7ade from the 18th century. It has a nave and two aisles, with a high [[cupola]].

It was the [[capital city]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from 402 until that empire collapsed in 476. It then served as the capital of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] until it was re-conquered in 540 by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Afterwards, the city formed the centre of the Byzantine [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] until the invasion of the [[Lombards]] in 751, after which it became the seat of the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]].\n\nAlthough it is an inland city, Ravenna is connected to the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Candiano Canal]]. It is known for its well-preserved late Roman and Byzantine architecture, with eight buildings comprising the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] \"Early Christian Monuments of Ravenna\".<ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/788</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Ravenna}}\nThe origin of the name ''Ravenna'' is unclear, although it is believed the name is [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.ravenna.it/contenuti/index.php?t=arte_storia&id=1&cat=&lang=2 Tourism in Ravenna \u2013 Official site \u2013 History].

Retrieved on 2011-06-20.</ref> Some have speculated that \"ravenna\" is related to \"Rasenna\" (later \"Rasna\"), the term that the Etruscans used for themselves, but there is no agreement on this point.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n===Ancient era===\n{{see also|Ostrogothic Ravenna}}\nThe origins of Ravenna are uncertain.<ref>Deborah M. Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010), for this and much of the information that follows</ref> The first settlement is variously attributed to (and then has seen the copresence of) the [[Thessalians]], the Etruscans and the [[Umbri]]ans. Afterwards its territory was settled also by the [[Senones]], especially the southern countryside of the city (that wasn't part of the lagoon), the ''Ager Decimanus''. Ravenna consisted of houses built on piles on a series of small islands in a marshy lagoon \u2013 a situation similar to [[Venice]] several centuries later. The Romans ignored it during their conquest of the [[Po River]] Delta, but later accepted it into the [[Roman Republic]] as a federated town in 89 [[Common Era|BC]]. \n\nIn 49 BC, it was the location where [[Julius Caesar]] gathered his forces before crossing the [[Rubicon]]. Later, after his battle against [[Mark Antony]] in 31 BC, Emperor [[Augustus]] founded the military harbor of [[Classe, ancient port of Ravenna|Classe]].<ref>From ''classis, Latin \"fleet\".</ref> This harbor, protected at first by its own walls, was an important station of the [[Roman Navy|Roman Imperial Fleet]]. Nowadays the city is landlocked, but Ravenna remained an important [[seaport]] on the [[Adriatic]] until the early [[Middle Ages]]. During the Germanic campaigns, [[Thusnelda]], widow of [[Arminius]], and [[Marbod]], King of the [[Marcomanni]], were confined at Ravenna.\n[[File:Ravenna(Peutinger Map).png|thumb|left|The city of Ravenna in the 4th century as shown on the Peutinger Map]]\nRavenna greatly prospered under Roman rule. Emperor [[Trajan]] built a {{convert|70|km|2|abbr=on}} long [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]] at the beginning of the 2nd century. During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlers in Ravenna revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there.<ref>Dio 72.11.4-5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius''</ref> In AD 402, [[Emperor Honorius]] transferred the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from [[Milan]] to Ravenna. At that time it was home to 50,000 people.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/1166147/_The_Fall_and_Decline_of_the_Roman_Urban_Mind_</ref> The transfer was made partly for defensive purposes: Ravenna was surrounded by swamps and marshes, and was perceived to be easily defensible (although in fact the city fell to opposing forces numerous times in its history); it is also likely that the move to Ravenna was due to the city's port and good sea-borne connections to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. However, in 409, King [[Alaric I]] of the [[Kingdom of the Visigoths|Visigoths]] simply bypassed Ravenna, and went on to [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack]] [[Rome]] in 410 and to take [[Galla Placidia]], daughter of Emperor [[Theodosius I]], hostage. \n\nAfter many vicissitudes, Galla Placidia returned to Ravenna with her son, Emperor [[Valentinian III]], due to the support of her nephew [[Theodosius II]]. Ravenna enjoyed a period of peace, during which time the Christian religion was favoured by the imperial court, and the city gained some of its most famous monuments, including the Orthodox Baptistery, the misnamed [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] (she was not actually buried there), and [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]].\n\nThe late 5th century saw the dissolution of Roman authority in the west, and [[Romulus Augustulus|the last person to hold the title of emperor in the West]] was deposed in 476 by the general [[Odoacer]]. Odoacer ruled as King of Italy for 13 years, but in 489 the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] sent the [[Ostrogoth]] King [[Theodoric the Great]] to re-take the Italian peninsula. After losing the [[Battle of Verona (489)|Battle of Verona]], [[Odoacer]] retreated to Ravenna, where he withstood a siege of three years by Theodoric, until the taking of [[Rimini]] deprived Ravenna of supplies. Theodoric took Ravenna in 493, supposedly slew Odoacer with his own hands, and Ravenna became the capital of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of Italy. Theodoric, following his imperial predecessors, also built many splendid buildings in and around Ravenna, including his palace church [[Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]], an Arian cathedral (now Santo Spirito) and Baptistery, and his own [[Mausoleum of Theodoric|Mausoleum]] just outside the walls.\n\n[[File:Mausoleum of Theoderic.JPG|The Mausoleum of Theodoric.|left|thumb]]\nBoth Odoacer and Theodoric and their followers were [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians, but co-existed peacefully with the Latins, who were largely Catholic Orthodox. Ravenna's Orthodox bishops carried out notable building projects, of which the sole surviving one is the Capella Arcivescovile. Theodoric allowed Roman citizens within his kingdom to be subject to Roman law and the Roman judicial system. The Goths, meanwhile, lived under their own laws and customs. In 519, when a mob had burned down the synagogues of Ravenna, Theodoric ordered the town to rebuild them at its own expense.\n\nTheodoric died in 526 and was succeeded by his young grandson [[Athalaric]] under the authority of his daughter [[Amalasunta]], but by 535 both were dead and Theodoric's line was represented only by Amalasuntha's daughter [[Matasuntha]]. Various Ostrogothic military leaders took the Kingdom of Italy, but none were as successful as Theodoric had been. Meanwhile, the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox Christian]] [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]], opposed both Ostrogoth rule and the [[Arianism|Arian]] variety of Christianity. In 535 his general [[Belisarius]] [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|invaded Italy]] and in 540 conquered Ravenna. After the conquest of Italy was completed in 554, Ravenna became the seat of Byzantine government in Italy.\n\nFrom 540 to 600, Ravenna's bishops embarked upon a notable building program of churches in Ravenna and in and around the port city of Classe. Surviving monuments include the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] and the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]], as well as the partially surviving San Michele in Africisco.\n\n===Exarchate of Ravenna===\n[[File:Ravenna SantApollinare Classe3.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Transfiguration of Jesus]]. Allegorical image with [[Crux gemmata]] and lambs represent apostles, 533\u2013549, [[apse]] of [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]]]]\n{{Main|Exarchate of Ravenna}}\nFollowing the conquests of [[Belisarius]] for the Emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century, Ravenna became the seat of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor of Italy, the [[Exarch]], and was known as the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. It was at this time that the [[Ravenna Cosmography]] was written.\n\nUnder Byzantine rule, the archbishop of the [[Archbishopric of Ravenna|Archdiocese of Ravenna]] was temporarily granted [[autocephaly]] from the Roman Church by the emperor, in 666, but this was soon revoked. Nevertheless, the archbishop of Ravenna held the second place in Italy after the pope, and played an important role in many theological controversies during this period.\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\nThe [[Lombards]], under [[King Liutprand]], occupied Ravenna in 712, but were forced to return it to the Byzantines.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Noble|first1=Thomas F. X.|title=The Republic of St. Peter: The Birth of the Papal State, 680\u2013825.|url=https://archive.org/details/republicofstpete0000nobl|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press.|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-8122-1239-8}}</ref> However, in 751 the Lombard king, [[Aistulf]], succeeded in conquering Ravenna, thus ending Byzantine rule in northern Italy.\n\nKing [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] of the [[King of the Franks|Franks]] attacked the Lombards under orders of [[Pope Stephen II]]. Ravenna then gradually came under the direct authority of the [[Pope]]s, although this was contested by the archbishops at various times. [[Pope Adrian I]] authorized [[Charlemagne]] to take away anything from Ravenna that he liked, and an unknown quantity of Roman columns, [[mosaic]]s, statues, and other portable items were taken north to enrich his capital of [[Aachen]].\n\nIn 1198 Ravenna led a league of [[Romagna]] cities against the Emperor, and the Pope was able to subdue it. After the war of 1218 the [[Traversari]] family was able to impose its rule in the city, which lasted until 1240. After a short period under an Imperial vicar, Ravenna was returned to the [[Papal States]] in 1248 and again to the Traversari until, in 1275, the [[Da Polenta]] established their long-lasting seigniory. One of the most illustrious residents of Ravenna at this time was the exiled poet [[Dante]]. The last of the Da Polenta, [[Ostasio III da Polenta|Ostasio III]], was ousted by the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1440, and the city was annexed to the Venetian territories in the [[Treaty of Cremona (1441)|Treaty of Cremona]].\n\nRavenna was ruled by Venice until 1509, when the area was invaded in the course of the [[Italian Wars]]. In 1512, during the [[War of the League of Cambrai|Holy League]] wars, Ravenna was sacked by the French following the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]]. Ravenna was also known during the Renaissance as the birthplace of the [[Monster of Ravenna]].\n\nAfter the Venetian withdrawal, Ravenna was again ruled by legates of the Pope as part of the Papal States. The city was damaged in a tremendous flood in May 1636. Over the next 300 years, a network of [[canals]] diverted nearby rivers and drained nearby swamps, thus reducing the possibility of flooding and creating a large belt of agricultural land around the city.\n\n===Modern age===\nApart from another short occupation by Venice (1527\u20131529), Ravenna was part of the Papal States until 1796, when it was annexed to the French puppet state of the [[Cisalpine Republic]], ([[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]] from 1802, and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] from 1805). It was returned to the Papal States in 1814. Occupied by Piedmontese troops in 1859, Ravenna and the surrounding [[Romagna]] area became part of the new unified [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. \n\nDuring [[World War II]], troops of the British [[27th Lancers]] entered and occupied Ravenna on 5 December 1944. A total of 937 Commonwealth soldiers who died in the winter of 1944-45 are buried in Ravenna War Cemetery, including 438 Canadians. <https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/history/second-world-war/canada-Italy-1943-to-1945>  The town suffered very little damage.\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Ravenna}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Basilica of San Vitale - triumphal arch mosaics.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Basilica of San Vitale]] - triumphal arch mosaics.]]\n[[File:Mausoleum of Galla Placidia ceiling mosaics.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Garden of Eden]] mosaic in [[mausoleum of Galla Placidia]]. 5th century CE.]]\n[[File:Arian Baptistry ceiling mosaic - Ravenna.jpg|thumbnail|Arian Baptistry ceiling mosaic.]]\n[[File:Christus Ravenna Mosaic.jpg|thumb|6th-century [[mosaic]] in Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna portrays Jesus long-haired and bearded, dressed in Byzantinian style.]]\n[[File:Baptistery.Arians02.jpg|The Arian Baptistry.|thumb]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Dante Alieghri tomb in Ravenna (exterior).jpg\n| width1 = 105\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Dante Alieghri tomb in Ravenna (interior).jpg\n| width2 = 110\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Dante's tomb exterior and interior, built in 1780\n}}\n[[File:Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna.JPG|The so-called \"Mausoleum of Galla Placidia\" in Ravenna.|thumb]]\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|Mosaic of the Palace of Theodoric in Sant'Apollinare Nuovo.|thumb]]\nEight early Christian monuments of Ravenna are inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]].

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nNotable modern players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]], Tobias Cramm, Nicoleta Paraschivescu and [[Matteo Messori|Matteo Messori]].\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} A essential element in the pedagogy of the famed [[Music conservatories of Naples|music conservatories of Naples]], \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nNotable modern players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]], Tobias Cramm, Nicoleta Paraschivescu and [[Matteo Messori|Matteo Messori]].\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th.
