It is considered a milestone in Bachchan's career, and in the league of his all-time great movies. [[Amitabh Bachchan]] received his first [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] at the [[38th National Film Awards]] for his performance. [[Mithun Chakraborty]] received the [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]]. The film, despite being the tenth highest-grosser of 1990, had collections way below its high budget, and thus, the film recorded as ''flop'' at the box-office. The film was remade in 2012 [[Agneepath (2012 film)|with the same title]], by Johar's son [[Karan Johar]], as a tribute to his father. This movie seems to have some inspiration from 1983 [[Al Pacino]] hit movie [[Scarface (1983 film)|''Scarface'']] {{Citation Needed|date=April 2020|reason=Please provide verified articles to justify the claim}}.\n\n==Plot==\nMuch-loved village schoolmaster Deenanath Chauhan ([[Alok Nath]]) strongly opposes the plans of [[Kancha Cheena]], an underworld don ([[Danny Dengzongpa]]) and his band of gangsters to set up a base for heroin smuggling. After being discredited in a set-up scandal and lynched by the manipulated villagers, his family is evicted and made destitute much to Cheena's advantage. Swearing revenge after his father's murder and the attempted rape of his mother Suhasini Chauhan ([[Rohini Hattangadi]]) go unpunished, and with a burning desire to clear his father's name, his son Vijay ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) takes on the responsibilities of caring for his mother and sister Siksha ([[Neelam Kothari|Neelam]]) that, by a strange twist of fate, cause him to become a gangster in his own right. Working his way up the ladder and attaining notoriety as an underworld kingpin, Vijay suffers an assassination attempt by fellow gangsters after he refuses to co-operate with their drug-smuggling operations. Left to die, he is discovered by Krishnan Iyer M.A. ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]) who transports him to hospital and saves his life, and who eventually finds employment as Siksha's bodyguard. During his time in hospital, Vijay is cared for by Nurse Mary Matthew ([[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]]).\n\nVijay avenges his assassination attempt by killing his killers one by one, but his mother strongly disapproves of his murderous and gangster tendencies and drives him away from home after chastising him for dirtying the good name of his father. Vijay, hurt and upset, seeks solace in Mary's arms and begins a relationship with her. Siksha is then kidnapped and held in a slum by a gangster who wants to avenge the death of his associates killed by Vijay, and an unsuccessful rescue attempt by Krishnan ends up with the two of them brawling. Vijay hears of this and arrives to kill the gangster in a fit of rage. But this close encounter between Krishnan and Siksha causes a growing intimacy between the two of them and they fall in love with each other. Vijay is outraged and strongly protests against the relationship to his mother, but is rebuffed again when his mother disowns him a second time and considers Krishnan her \"good son\". Stung and deeply hurt by this slight, he again seeks solace in Mary and later marries her and resolves to do things \"in the right way\" to gain his mother's favour.\n\nAfter cutting a deal with Kancha Cheena to allow him access into his old village, Vijay sets in motion a number of strategies that undercut Cheena's criminal operations and gain him the legal ownership of the village. Revenge is a dish best served cold as Vijay informs Cheena of his identity as the son of Deenanath Chauhan, lands Cheena in jail and arranges for Cheena's associates to testify against him in court. Vijay returns the village to his mother and finds himself back in her favour, but Cheena ensures his release by arranging for the witnesses to be gunned down and Vijay's family to be kidnapped and held hostage. This is the last straw for Vijay who is forced to return to his criminal ways and to walk the \"Path of Fire\" in order to rescue them. An almighty struggle takes place as Cheena bombs every building and demolishes the whole village before he is killed by Vijay's bare hands. But Vijay does not survive; he dies of a bullet wound in the lap of his mother at the site of his old house. His mother realises that everything Vijay had done until then had been for the ultimate purpose of restoring the good name of Deenanath Chauhan, and she weeps over his body piteously along with Krishnan, Siksha and Mary.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Vijay Deenanath Chauhan\n*[[Mithun Chakraborty]] as Krishnan Iyer M.A.\n*[[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]] as Mary Mathew\n*[[Danny Denzongpa]] as Kancha Cheena (Underworld Kingpin)\n*[[Neelam Kothari]] as Siksha Chauhan\n*[[Goga Kapoor]] as Dinkar Rao\n*[[Alok Nath]] as Master Deenanath Chauhan\n*[[Rohini Hattangadi]] as Suhasini Chauhan\n*[[Sharat Saxena]] as Terralin (Rival Gang leader)\n*[[Tinnu Anand]] as Nathu\n*[[Vikram Gokhale]] as Commissioner M.

However, [[Karan Johar]] recounts in an interview how younger city based audiences thought it was a cool film.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johan|first1=Karan|title=Interview with Karan Johan : Indu Mirani|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTUJQdXFkw|website=You Tube|publisher=The Boss Dialogues|accessdate=18 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105225440/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTUJQdXFkw|archive-date=5 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Over the top, inane songs\", dialogues \"veering towards melodrama\" and, more importantly, Amitabh Bachchan's experimentation with his voice did not go well with the masses and the critics alike. Film Trade Analyst Komal Nahta wrote thus about Bachchan's voice, : \"But the biggest undoing of the film is Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s voice. He has spoken the dialogue in a different voice (inspired by [[Marlon Brando]] in [[The Godfather]]) which will not be accepted by the audience. Further the mixing not being clear, his dialogues are incomprehensible at places.\" He further wrote that the film lacked a gripping drama, well-set script, and that even the murder scenes lacked excitement.<ref name=\"agneepath6\" /> Satish Naidu in his review noted that the narrative had a slow pace in the last hour. Another fact that worked against the advantage of the film was its weak story. Rediff's review of Agneepath suggested that perhaps, the grim, violent, aggressive and dark portrayal of the underbelly of Bombay's underworld had worked against the film.<ref name=\"agneepathredifffours\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-revisiting-amitabh-bachchan-s-agneepath/20120124.htm|title=Revisiting Amitabh Bachchan's Agneepath (Slide 1)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210000326/http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-revisiting-amitabh-bachchan-s-agneepath/20120124.htm |date=10 February 2012|archive-date=10 February 2012|work=Rediff Movies}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the National Award for the best actor being bestowed on Amitabh Bachchan changed the perspective in which the film was appreciated.

He further drove home his opinion, describing the betrayal of a certain \"undeveloped terrain below\" by the jagged, staccato-like movements of the camera work. Further, Mr.Naidu praised the way in which Mukul Anand portrayed Amitabh Bachchan in the film. An interesting aspect of the film was its cinematography, handled by [[Pravin Bhatt]], which has been described as \"marvelous\" due to the \"beautiful scenes shot in Mauritius. The ship bombing scene was executed well, and that the portrayal of the picturesque scenery of trees and fields in full bloom (in the songs, especially) met with rave reviews. Movie Reviewer Peter Nepstad in his blog, the \"Illuminated Lantern\" wrote that:\n:\"Agneepath is deliriously melodramatic. The first thirty minutes, the prologue of the film if you will, in the village of his youth, ranks among the best openings of any Bollywood film I've ever seen. Afterwards, when most Bollywood films crank it down for some syrupy romance or goofy comedy, Agneepath plops its adult protagonist right in the middle of a gang fight. Often a film has a great set piece at the beginning, then deflates by the end, but Agneepath continues amping up the conflict from beginning to end, from riots in a village to riots in a city to mudfights in the slums to swordfights in the middle of a festival.\"<ref name=\"agneepathilluminelantern\">{{cite web|url=http://www.illuminatedlantern.com/cinema/review/archives/agneepath.php|title=Illuminated Lantern: A blog describing the heart of South Asian Cinema-Agneepath(1990) directed by Mukul.S.Anand|work=Illuminated Lantern|access-date=21 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223235509/http://www.illuminatedlantern.com/cinema/review/archives/agneepath.php|archive-date=23 February 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\nThe movie's review in Rediff.com, mentioned that: \"Agneepath, despite its amplified sentimentality, strong language and violence works on account of this very dynamism. \"<ref name=\"agneepathrediff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-revisiting-amitabh-bachchan-s-agneepath/20120124.htm|title=Rediff.com-Movies-Reviews-Revisiting Amitabh Bachchan's Agneepath(Slide 3)|work=Rediff|access-date=8 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210000326/http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-revisiting-amitabh-bachchan-s-agneepath/20120124.htm|archive-date=10 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nAccording to trade website [[Box Office India]], the gross collection of the movie was Rs 10,25,00,000, way below the film's budget and so despite being among the top grossers of the year the film was a flop.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Tracklist\n| headline        = Songs\n| extra_column    = Playback\n| all_music       = [[Laxmikant Pyarelal]], [[Jean Michel Jarre]]\n\n| title1  = Kisko Tha Pata\n| extra1  = [[SP Balasubramanyam]], [[Alka Yagnik]]\n\n| title2  = I Am Krishnan Iyer M.

It is considered a milestone in Bachchan's career, and in the league of his all-time great movies. [[Amitabh Bachchan]] received his first [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] at the [[38th National Film Awards]] for his performance. [[Mithun Chakraborty]] received the [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]]. The film, despite being the tenth highest-grosser of 1990, had collections way below its high budget, and thus, the film recorded as ''flop'' at the box-office. The film was remade in 2012 [[Agneepath (2012 film)|with the same title]], by Johar's son [[Karan Johar]], as a tribute to his father. This movie seems to have some inspiration from 1983 [[Al Pacino]] hit movie [[Scarface (1983 film)|''Scarface'']] {{Citation Needed|date=April 2020|reason=Please provide verified articles to justify the claim}}.\n\n==Plot==\nMuch-loved village schoolmaster Deenanath Chauhan ([[Alok Nath]]) strongly opposes the plans of [[Kancha Cheena]], an underworld don ([[Danny Dengzongpa]]) and his band of gangsters to set up a base for heroin smuggling. After being discredited in a set-up scandal and lynched by the manipulated villagers, his family is evicted and made destitute much to Cheena's advantage. Swearing revenge after his father's murder and the attempted rape of his mother Suhasini Chauhan ([[Rohini Hattangadi]]) go unpunished, and with a burning desire to clear his father's name, his son Vijay ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) takes on the responsibilities of caring for his mother and sister Siksha ([[Neelam Kothari|Neelam]]) that, by a strange twist of fate, cause him to become a gangster in his own right. Working his way up the ladder and attaining notoriety as an underworld kingpin, Vijay suffers an assassination attempt by fellow gangsters after he refuses to co-operate with their drug-smuggling operations. Left to die, he is discovered by Krishnan Iyer M.A. ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]) who transports him to hospital and saves his life, and who eventually finds employment as Siksha's bodyguard. During his time in hospital, Vijay is cared for by Nurse Mary Matthew ([[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]]).\n\nVijay avenges his assassination attempt by killing his killers one by one, but his mother strongly disapproves of his murderous and gangster tendencies and drives him away from home after chastising him for dirtying the good name of his father. Vijay, hurt and upset, seeks solace in Mary's arms and begins a relationship with her. Siksha is then kidnapped and held in a slum by a gangster who wants to avenge the death of his associates killed by Vijay, and an unsuccessful rescue attempt by Krishnan ends up with the two of them brawling. Vijay hears of this and arrives to kill the gangster in a fit of rage. But this close encounter between Krishnan and Siksha causes a growing intimacy between the two of them and they fall in love with each other. Vijay is outraged and strongly protests against the relationship to his mother, but is rebuffed again when his mother disowns him a second time and considers Krishnan her \"good son\". Stung and deeply hurt by this slight, he again seeks solace in Mary and later marries her and resolves to do things \"in the right way\" to gain his mother's favour.\n\nAfter cutting a deal with Kancha Cheena to allow him access into his old village, Vijay sets in motion a number of strategies that undercut Cheena's criminal operations and gain him the legal ownership of the village. Revenge is a dish best served cold as Vijay informs Cheena of his identity as the son of Deenanath Chauhan, lands Cheena in jail and arranges for Cheena's associates to testify against him in court. Vijay returns the village to his mother and finds himself back in her favour, but Cheena ensures his release by arranging for the witnesses to be gunned down and Vijay's family to be kidnapped and held hostage. This is the last straw for Vijay who is forced to return to his criminal ways and to walk the \"Path of Fire\" in order to rescue them. An almighty struggle takes place as Cheena bombs every building and demolishes the whole village before he is killed by Vijay's bare hands. But Vijay does not survive; he dies of a bullet wound in the lap of his mother at the site of his old house. His mother realises that everything Vijay had done until then had been for the ultimate purpose of restoring the good name of Deenanath Chauhan, and she weeps over his body piteously along with Krishnan, Siksha and Mary.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Vijay Deenanath Chauhan\n*[[Mithun Chakraborty]] as Krishnan Iyer M.A.\n*[[Madhavi]] as Mary Mathew\n*[[Danny Denzongpa]] as Kancha Cheena (Underworld Kingpin)\n*[[Neelam Kothari]] as Siksha Chauhan\n*[[Goga Kapoor]] as Dinkar Rao\n*[[Alok Nath]] as Master Deenanath Chauhan\n*[[Rohini Hattangadi]] as Suhasini Chauhan\n*[[Sharat Saxena]] as Terralin (Rival Gang leader)\n*[[Tinnu Anand]] as Nathu\n*[[Vikram Gokhale]] as Commissioner M.

Film Trade Analyst Komal Nahta wrote thus about Bachchan's voice, : \"But the biggest undoing of the film is Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s voice. He has spoken the dialogue in a different voice (inspired by [[Marlon Brando]] in [[The Godfather]]) which will not be accepted by the audience. Further the mixing not being clear, his dialogues are incomprehensible at places.\" He further wrote that the film lacked a gripping drama, well-set script, and that even the murder scenes lacked excitement.<ref name=\"agneepath6\" /> Satish Naidu in his review noted that the narrative had a slow pace in the last hour. Another fact that worked against the advantage of the film was its weak story. Rediff's review of Agneepath suggested that perhaps, the grim, violent, aggressive and dark portrayal of the underbelly of Bombay's underworld had worked against the film.<ref name=\"agneepathredifffours\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-revisiting-amitabh-bachchan-s-agneepath/20120124.htm|title=Revisiting Amitabh Bachchan's Agneepath (Slide 1)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210000326/http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-revisiting-amitabh-bachchan-s-agneepath/20120124.htm |date=10 February 2012|archive-date=10 February 2012|work=Rediff Movies}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the National Award for the best actor being bestowed on Amitabh Bachchan changed the perspective in which the film was appreciated.

He further drove home his opinion, describing the betrayal of a certain \"undeveloped terrain below\" by the jagged, staccato-like movements of the camera work. Further, Mr.Naidu praised the way in which Mukul Anand portrayed Amitabh Bachchan in the film. An interesting aspect of the film was its cinematography, handled by [[Pravin Bhatt]], which has been described as \"marvelous\" due to the \"beautiful scenes shot in Mauritius. The ship bombing scene was executed well, and that the portrayal of the picturesque scenery of trees and fields in full bloom (in the songs, especially) met with rave reviews. Movie Reviewer Peter Nepstad in his blog, the \"Illuminated Lantern\" wrote that:\n:\"Agneepath is deliriously melodramatic. The first thirty minutes, the prologue of the film if you will, in the village of his youth, ranks among the best openings of any Bollywood film I've ever seen. Afterwards, when most Bollywood films crank it down for some syrupy romance or goofy comedy, Agneepath plops its adult protagonist right in the middle of a gang fight. Often a film has a great set piece at the beginning, then deflates by the end, but Agneepath continues amping up the conflict from beginning to end, from riots in a village to riots in a city to mudfights in the slums to swordfights in the middle of a festival.\"<ref name=\"agneepathilluminelantern\">{{cite web|url=http://www.illuminatedlantern.com/cinema/review/archives/agneepath.php|title=Illuminated Lantern: A blog describing the heart of South Asian Cinema-Agneepath(1990) directed by Mukul.S.Anand|work=Illuminated Lantern|access-date=21 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223235509/http://www.illuminatedlantern.com/cinema/review/archives/agneepath.php|archive-date=23 February 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\nThe movie's review in Rediff.com, mentioned that: \"Agneepath, despite its amplified sentimentality, strong language and violence works on account of this very dynamism. \"<ref name=\"agneepathrediff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-revisiting-amitabh-bachchan-s-agneepath/20120124.htm|title=Rediff.com-Movies-Reviews-Revisiting Amitabh Bachchan's Agneepath(Slide 3)|work=Rediff|access-date=8 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210000326/http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-revisiting-amitabh-bachchan-s-agneepath/20120124.htm|archive-date=10 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nAccording to trade website [[Box Office India]], the gross collection of the movie was Rs 10,25,00,000, way below the film's budget and so despite being among the top grossers of the year the film was a flop.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Tracklist\n| headline        = Songs\n| extra_column    = Playback\n| all_music       = [[Laxmikant Pyarelal]], [[Jean Michel Jarre]]\n\n| title1  = Kisko Tha Pata\n| extra1  = [[SP Balasubramanyam]], [[Alka Yagnik]]\n\n| title2  = I Am Krishnan Iyer M.

It means explosive.\n\n== Plot ==\nNasir Jamal (Aditya Rawal), a teenager boy, resident of Kareli area in Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh). His friends call him 'Naate' despite him being quite tall.  Naate brings home complaints regularly. His father Shahid Jamal, a reputed contractor overlooks his son's deeds and in turn encourages his behaviour for the worse while his mom worried sick about her son and his carelessness. \n\nOne evening, Nasir goes to drop off a parcel at Sanam CD Music shop on Zahid's request, Naate's childhood friend. There, he finds the shop closed and coincidently meets a young girl, Neelam ([[Shalini Pandey]]) who lives right above the shop. An interesting conversation takes place between them. Soon after, they happen to meet a few more times by chance and Naate is now drawn to her. its not very different for Neelam. She appreciates Nasir's genuine gestures towards her, however she seems hesitant when things start to get real. Having had a tough journey, she battles to make things work with Nasir, but he is too light hearted about it all to see any red flags. \n\nWhile Nasir and Neelam get closer, Jigar Fareedi ([[Vijay Varma]]), a seemingly charming, influential person and a role model for many youngsters alike across paths with Nasir on account of his fight with Rajeeb Mehndi, a college student politician who is Jigar's candidate. Jigar demands that Nasir make a public apology and is arrogantly turned down leading to the beginning of an ego conflict between the two. \n\nNeelam struggles to understand her relationship with Nasir, but is unaware of how much she has grown to like him. They face multiple obstacle and are presented with testing times to really explore their journey together and what it would have mean for them to stay together anywhere. \n\nThis leads us to find out whether Nasir and Neelam will ever be able to be together?\n   \n== Production ==\n\n\n'''Scripting'''\n\nDirector Ranjan met his co-writer Hanzalah Shahid after coming back from the shoot of the film \u2018[[Mukkabaaz]]\u2019.

Ajay Rai of [[Jar Pictures]] watched the short film and told him to narrate to him whatever he writes next. \n\nRanjan completed the draft of Bamfaad and narrated it to Ajay and he immediately agreed to produce it.\n\n\n'''Casting'''\n\nRanjan gave the script to casting director Taran Bajaj to read telling him that he needs a 'Bamfaad' actor for the role of the protagonist, Nasir Jamal. On going through that Taran made him meet Aditya Rawal. Ranjan liked the energy of Aditya and thought him perfect for his character. Ranjan spent a good amount of time with Aditya working on his language, body language and attitude to get him into character. Ranjan narrated various incidents and anecdotes of the world to Aditya, did several hindi book reading sessions, travelled with him to the north indian small towns to get a better idea of the world and people. \n\nRanjan wanted a powerful female lead. He had seen [[Shalini Pandey]] in the Telugu film [[Arjun Reddy]]. It also happened that he saw a youtube video of Shalini in which she was performing and as he saw he realised he had found his heroine, Neelam. Following which he met Shalini and narrated the script to her. She liked the script and she was on. \n\n\n'''Filming'''     \n\nSince this was Ranjan\u2019s debut film, the budget was quite restrained. That is why he chose his hometown [[Kanpur]] as the base for shooting. His father Manmohan Chandel has played a very important part in the shoot. There were many times when the crew didn\u2019t have permission to shoot at a location, the crew used to shoot in Ranjan father\u2019s hometown as he used to get permission for the crew easily. \n\nThe principal photography of the film began on 2nd September 2018 in Kanpur and the film was wrapped on 22nd October 2018 in Lucknow. The shooting of the film got finished in a span of 45 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bamfaad-trailer-paresh-rawal-s-son-aditya-shalini-pandeys-love-story-marred-violence-drama-522226?amp|title=Bamfaad Trailer: Paresh Rawal\u2019s son Aditya & Shalini Pandey's love story is marred by violence & drama|date=7 April 2020|website=pinkvilla.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413081417/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bamfaad-trailer-paresh-rawal-s-son-aditya-shalini-pandeys-love-story-marred-violence-drama-522226?amp|archive-date=13 April 2020|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe Soundtrack for Bamfaad's songs is composed by [[Vishal Mishra (composer)|Vishal Mishra]] and the lyrics are written by [[Raj Shekhar]].\n\nThe film contains [[Suryakant Tripathi|Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']] - Baadal Raag, composed and sung by Harpreet Singh.

The striking introduction melds realism, humour and an earthy song. She mentioned, \"The second half of ''Bamfaad'' does not live up to the promise of the pre-interval portion. Still the director Ranjan Chandel and Writer Hanzalah Shahid are talents to watch out for. For one, in this era of stereotype-ridden, Islamophobic Bollywood rants, it is nice to see a film in which the protagonist is a Muslim, but is not given any stereotypical markers of the religion, and members of the community are treated as regular humans: some good, some not, some evil, some not\". She also mentioned, \"Besides, how can one not make note of artists who can conceptualise a scene in which a love-lorn youth gazing at the object of his affection tells her that pimples look good on her face? He does not say \u201ceven pimples\u201d, he simply says \u201cpimples\u201d. Oh the sweet innocence of those words!

It means explosive.\n\n== Plot ==\nNasir Jamal (Aditya Rawal), a teenager boy, resident of Kareli area in Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh). His friends call him 'Naate' despite him being quite tall.  Naate brings home complaints regularly. His father Shahid Jamal, a reputed contractor overlooks his son's deeds and in turn encourages his behaviour for the worse while his mom worried sick about her son and his carelessness. \n\nOne evening, Nasir goes to drop off a parcel at Sanam CD Music shop on Zahid's request, Naate's childhood friend. There, he finds the shop closed and coincidently meets a young girl, Neelam ([[Shalini Pandey]]) who lives right above the shop. An interesting conversation takes place between them. Soon after, they happen to meet a few more times by chance and Naate is now drawn to her. its not very different for Neelam. She appreciates Nasir's genuine gestures towards her, however she seems hesitant when things start to get real. Having had a tough journey, she battles to make things work with Nasir, but he is too light hearted about it all to see any red flags. \n\nWhile Nasir and Neelam get closer, Jigar Fareedi ([[Vijay Varma]]), a seemingly charming, influential person and a role model for many youngsters alike across paths with Nasir on account of his fight with Rajeeb Mehndi, a college student politician who is Jigar's candidate. Jigar demands that Nasir make a public apology and is arrogantly turned down leading to the beginning of an ego conflict between the two. \n\nNeelam struggles to understand her relationship with Nasir, but is unaware of how much she has grown to like him. They face multiple obstacle and are presented with testing times to really explore their journey together and what it would have mean for them to stay together anywhere. \n\nThis leads us to find out whether Nasir and Neelam will ever be able to be together?\n   \n== Production ==\n\n\n'''Scripting'''\n\nDirector Ranjan met his co-writer Hanzalah Shahid after coming back from the shoot of the film \u2018[[Mukkabaaz]]\u2019. Hanzalah gave him a script to read of a different title. Ranjan read the script and got fascinated by some characters of that world which inspired him to dwell more into that world.

Ajay Rai of [[Jar Pictures]] watched the short film and told him to narrate to him whatever he writes next. \n\nRanjan completed the draft of Bamfaad and narrated it to Ajay and he immediately agreed to produce it.\n\n\n'''Casting'''\n\nRanjan gave the script to casting director Taran Bajaj to read telling him that he needs a 'Bamfaad' actor for the role of the protagonist, Nasir Jamal. On going through that Taran made him meet Aditya Rawal. Ranjan liked the energy of Aditya and thought him perfect for his character. Ranjan spent a good amount of time with Aditya working on his language, body language and attitude to get him into character. Ranjan narrated various incidents and anecdotes of the world to Aditya, did several hindi book reading sessions, travelled with him to the north indian small towns to get a better idea of the world and people. \n\nRanjan wanted a powerful female lead. He had seen [[Shalini Pandey]] in the Telugu film [[Arjun Reddy]]. It also happened that he saw a youtube video of Shalini in which she was performing and as he saw he realised he had found his heroine, Neelam. Following which he met Shalini and narrated the script to her. She liked the script and she was on. \n\n\n'''Filming'''     \n\nSince this was Ranjan\u2019s debut film, the budget was quite restrained. That is why he chose his hometown [[Kanpur]] as the base for shooting. His father Manmohan Chandel has played a very important part in the shoot. There were many times when the crew didn\u2019t have permission to shoot at a location, the crew used to shoot in Ranjan father\u2019s hometown as he used to get permission for the crew easily. \n\nThe principal photography of the film began on 2nd September 2018 in Kanpur and the film was wrapped on 22nd October 2018 in Lucknow. The shooting of the film got finished in a span of 45 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bamfaad-trailer-paresh-rawal-s-son-aditya-shalini-pandeys-love-story-marred-violence-drama-522226?amp|title=Bamfaad Trailer: Paresh Rawal\u2019s son Aditya & Shalini Pandey's love story is marred by violence & drama|date=7 April 2020|website=pinkvilla.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413081417/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bamfaad-trailer-paresh-rawal-s-son-aditya-shalini-pandeys-love-story-marred-violence-drama-522226?amp|archive-date=13 April 2020|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe Soundtrack for Bamfaad's songs is composed by [[Vishal Mishra (composer)|Vishal Mishra]] and the lyrics are written by [[Raj Shekhar]].\n\nThe film contains [[Suryakant Tripathi|Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']] - Baadal Raag, composed and sung by Harpreet Singh.

Still the director Ranjan Chandel and Writer Hanzalah Shahid are talents to watch out for. For one, in this era of stereotype-ridden, Islamophobic Bollywood rants, it is nice to see a film in which the protagonist is a Muslim, but is not given any stereotypical markers of the religion, and members of the community are treated as regular humans: some good, some not, some evil, some not\". She also mentioned, \"Besides, how can one not make note of artists who can conceptualise a scene in which a love-lorn youth gazing at the object of his affection tells her that pimples look good on her face?

He was known for his association with, abduction of, and marriage to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], as her third and final husband.  He was accused of the murder of Mary's second husband, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]], a charge of which he was acquitted.  His marriage to Mary was controversial and divided the country; when he fled the growing rebellion to Scandinavia he was arrested in Norway and lived the rest of his life imprisoned in Denmark.\n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\nHe was the son of [[Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell]], and Agnes Sinclair (d. 1572), daughter of Henry Sinclair, 3rd Lord Sinclair, and was styled ''The Master of Bothwell'' from birth. He succeeded his father as [[Earl of Bothwell]] and Lord Hailes in 1556.\n\n===Marriages===\nAs [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland]], Lord Bothwell visited Copenhagen around 1559. He fell in love with Anna Tronds, known in English as [[Anna Throndsen]] or Anna Rustung. She was a Norwegian noblewoman whose father, [[Kristoffer Trondson]], a famous Norwegian admiral, was serving as Danish Royal Consul. After their engagement, or more likely marriage under Norwegian law, Anna left with Bothwell. In [[Flanders]], he said he was out of money and asked Anna to sell all her possessions. She complied and visited her family in Denmark to ask for more money. Anna was unhappy and apparently given to complaining about Bothwell. His treatment of Anna played a part in his eventual downfall.{{cn}}\n\nin February 1566, Bothwell married [[Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell|Lady Jean Gordon]], daughter of the [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly|4th Earl of Huntly]] and sister of Sir John Gordon and the [[George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly|5th Earl of Huntly]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunn |first=Jane |title=Elizabeth and Mary |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=2003|page=185}}</ref> They were divorced on 7 May 1567, citing his [[adultery]] with her servant Bessie Crawford.<ref>''Mary, Queen of Scots'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], 1969</ref> as cause. He married Mary, Queen of Scots, eight days later.\n\n===Meeting Queen Mary in France===\nLord Bothwell appears to have met [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Queen Mary]] when he visited the French Court in the autumn of 1560, after he left Anna Rustung in [[Flanders]]. He was kindly received by the Queen and her husband, [[Francis II of France|King Francis II]], and, as he himself put it: \"The Queen recompensed me more liberally and honourably than I had deserved\" \u2014 receiving 600 Crowns and the post and salary of gentleman of the French King's Chamber. He visited France again in the spring of 1561, and by 5 July was back in Paris for the third time \u2014 this time accompanied by the [[Bishop of Orkney]] and the [[Hugh Montgomerie, 3rd Earl of Eglinton|Earl of Eglinton]]. By August, the widowed Queen was on her way back to Scotland in a French galley, some of the organisation having been dealt with by Bothwell in his naval capacity.\n\n===Under Mary of Guise's regency===\nBothwell supported [[Mary of Guise]], queen dowager and regent of Scotland, against the Protestant [[Lords of the Congregation]]. Bothwell and 24 followers took 6000 crowns of English money destined to be used against Guise from the [[John Cockburn of Ormiston|Laird of Ormiston]] on Halloween 1559 at an ambush near [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]]. In retaliation the Protestant leader, the [[Duke of Ch\u00e2telherault]], sent his son the [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]] and the Master of Maxwell to seize Bothwell's home [[Crichton Castle]] and force the Earl, who was at [[Borthwick Castle|Borthwick]], to join them. Bothwell remained true to the Regent, though it was said in January he was \"weary of his part\". The English agent [[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]] also hinted at this time of a scandal involving his sister [[Jean Hepburn]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. i (1898), 262, 290.</ref>\n\n===At Queen Mary's court===\nAfter [[Scottish Reformation|Protestant Lords gained power]] following Mary of Guise's death and the return to Scotland of Mary, Queen of Scots, Bothwell appears to have been not much more than a troublesome noble at court. His open quarrel with the [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]] and the Hamiltons, who accused him of intriguing against the Crown, caused some degree of anguish to the Queen, and although the Earl of Arran was eventually declared mad, Bothwell was nevertheless imprisoned in [[Edinburgh Castle]] without trial in 1562. Later that year, while the Queen was in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], he escaped and went to [[Hermitage Castle]].<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 1 (1898), 548, 622, 652.</ref>\n\nThe Queen and Bothwell were by now very close. When Bothwell married [[Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell|Lady Jean Gordon]], daughter of [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly|The 4th Earl of Huntly]], in February 1566, the Queen attended the wedding (the marriage lasted just over a year). In the following summer, upon hearing that [[Little Jock Elliot#History|he had been seriously wounded]] and was likely to die, she rode all the way through the hills and forests of the Borders to be with him at [[Hermitage Castle]] only a few weeks after giving birth to her son. However, historian [[Antonia Fraser|Lady Antonia Fraser]] asserts that Queen Mary was already on her way to visit Bothwell on matters of state before she heard about his illness, and that therefore this visit is not evidence they were already lovers at the time of his accident.  Author [[Alison Weir]] agrees, and in fact the records show that Mary waited a full six days after learning of his injuries before going to visit Bothwell.  The story of her mad flight to his side was put about later by her enemies to discredit her.\n\n===Darnley's murder===\nIn February 1567, Bothwell was one of those accused of having murdered  the Queen's consort, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]]). Darnley's father, the [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox|Earl of Lennox]], and other relatives agitated for vengeance and the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] began proceedings against Bothwell on 12 April 1567.  [[William Drury|Sir William Drury]] reported to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Sir William Cecil]], Secretary of State to [[Elizabeth I of England]], that the Queen was in continuous ill-health \"for the most part either [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] or sickly\". On the appointed day Bothwell rode magnificently down the [[Canongate]], with the [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]] and [[William Maitland of Lethington]] flanking him, and his Hepburns trotting behind. The trial lasted from noon till seven in the evening. Bothwell was acquitted and it was widely rumoured that he would marry Mary.\n\n===Abduction of and marriage to Queen Mary===\n[[File:Arms of James Hepburn, 1st Duke of Orkney.svg|thumb|160px|Arms of James Hepburn, 1st Duke of Orkney]]\n\nThe next Wednesday, the Queen rode to the [[Parliament of Scotland|Estates of Parliament]], with Lord Bothwell carrying the [[Sceptre]], where the proceedings of Bothwell's trial were officially declared to be just according to the law of the land. On Saturday 19 April, eight bishops, nine earls, and seven Lords of Parliament put their signatures to what became known as the [[Ainslie Tavern Bond]], a manifesto declaring that Mary should marry a native-born subject, and handed it to Bothwell.\n\nOn Wednesday 24 April, while Mary was on the road from [[Linlithgow Palace]] to Edinburgh, Bothwell suddenly appeared with 800 men. He assured her that danger awaited her in Edinburgh, and told her that he proposed to take her to his castle at [[Dunbar]], out of harm's way.

He was known for his association with, abduction of, and marriage to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], as her third and final husband.  He was accused of the murder of Mary's second husband, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]], a charge of which he was acquitted.  His marriage to Mary was controversial and divided the country; when he fled the growing rebellion to Scandinavia he was arrested in Norway and lived the rest of his life imprisoned in Denmark.\n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\nHe was the son of [[Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell]], and Agnes Sinclair (d. 1572), daughter of Henry Sinclair, 3rd Lord Sinclair, and was styled ''The Master of Bothwell'' from birth. He succeeded his father as [[Earl of Bothwell]] and Lord Hailes in 1556.\n\n===Marriages===\nAs [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland]], Lord Bothwell sail \n around Europe. During a visit to Copenhagen around 1559, he fell in love with Anna Tronds, known in English as [[Anna Throndsen]] and posthumously as Anna Rustung. She was a Norwegian noblewoman whose father, [[Kristoffer Trondson]] (Rustung), a famous Norwegian admiral, was serving as Danish Royal Consul. After their engagement, or more likely marriage under Norwegian law, Anna left with Bothwell. In [[Flanders]], he said he was out of money and asked Anna to sell all her possessions. She complied and visited her family in Denmark to ask for more money. Anna was unhappy and apparently given to complaining about Bothwell. His treatment of Anna played a part in his eventual downfall.\n\nin February 1566, Bothwell married [[Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell|Lady Jean Gordon]], daughter of the [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly|4th Earl of Huntly]] and sister of Sir John Gordon and the [[George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly|5th Earl of Huntly]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunn |first=Jane |title=Elizabeth and Mary |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=2003|page=185}}</ref> They were divorced on 7 May 1567, citing his [[adultery]] with her servant Bessie Crawford<ref>''Mary, Queen of Scots'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], 1969</ref> as cause. He married Mary, Queen of Scots, eight days later.\n\n===Meeting Queen Mary in France===\nLord Bothwell appears to have met [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Queen Mary]] when he visited the French Court in the autumn of 1560, after he left Anna Rustung in [[Flanders]]. He was kindly received by the Queen and her husband, [[Francis II of France|King Francis II]], and, as he himself put it: \"The Queen recompensed me more liberally and honourably than I had deserved\" \u2014 receiving 600 Crowns and the post and salary of gentleman of the French King's Chamber. He visited France again in the spring of 1561, and by 5 July was back in Paris for the third time \u2014 this time accompanied by the [[Bishop of Orkney]] and the [[Hugh Montgomerie, 3rd Earl of Eglinton|Earl of Eglinton]]. By August, the widowed Queen was on her way back to Scotland in a French galley, some of the organisation having been dealt with by Bothwell in his naval capacity.\n\n===Under Mary of Guise's regency===\nBothwell supported [[Mary of Guise]], queen dowager and regent of Scotland, against the Protestant [[Lords of the Congregation]]. Bothwell and 24 followers took 6000 crowns of English money destined to be used against Guise from the [[John Cockburn of Ormiston|Laird of Ormiston]] on Halloween 1559 at an ambush near [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]]. In retaliation the Protestant leader, the [[Duke of Ch\u00e2telherault]], sent his son the [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]] and the Master of Maxwell to seize Bothwell's home [[Crichton Castle]] and force the Earl, who was at [[Borthwick Castle|Borthwick]], to join them. Bothwell remained true to the Regent, though it was said in January he was \"weary of his part\". The English agent [[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]] also hinted at this time of a scandal involving his sister [[Jean Hepburn]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. i (1898), 262, 290.</ref>\n\n===At Queen Mary's court===\nAfter [[Scottish Reformation|Protestant Lords gained power]] following Mary of Guise's death and the return to Scotland of Mary, Queen of Scots, Bothwell appears to have been not much more than a troublesome noble at court. His open quarrel with the [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]] and the Hamiltons, who accused him of intriguing against the Crown, caused some degree of anguish to the Queen, and although the Earl of Arran was eventually declared mad, Bothwell was nevertheless imprisoned in [[Edinburgh Castle]] without trial in 1562. Later that year, while the Queen was in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], he escaped and went to [[Hermitage Castle]].<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 1 (1898), 548, 622, 652.</ref>\n\nThe Queen and Bothwell were by now very close. When Bothwell married [[Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell|Lady Jean Gordon]], daughter of [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly|The 4th Earl of Huntly]], in February 1566, the Queen attended the wedding (the marriage lasted just over a year). In the following summer, upon hearing that [[Little Jock Elliot#History|he had been seriously wounded]] and was likely to die, she rode all the way through the hills and forests of the Borders to be with him at [[Hermitage Castle]] only a few weeks after giving birth to her son. However, historian [[Antonia Fraser|Lady Antonia Fraser]] asserts that Queen Mary was already on her way to visit Bothwell on matters of state before she heard about his illness, and that therefore this visit is not evidence they were already lovers at the time of his accident.  Author [[Alison Weir]] agrees, and in fact the records show that Mary waited a full six days after learning of his injuries before going to visit Bothwell.  The story of her mad flight to his side was put about later by her enemies to discredit her.\n\n===Darnley's murder===\nIn February 1567, Bothwell was one of those accused of having murdered  the Queen's consort, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]]). Darnley's father, the [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox|Earl of Lennox]], and other relatives agitated for vengeance and the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] began proceedings against Bothwell on 12 April 1567.  [[William Drury|Sir William Drury]] reported to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Sir William Cecil]], Secretary of State to [[Elizabeth I of England]], that the Queen was in continuous ill-health \"for the most part either [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] or sickly\". On the appointed day Bothwell rode magnificently down the [[Canongate]], with the [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]] and [[William Maitland of Lethington]] flanking him, and his Hepburns trotting behind. The trial lasted from noon till seven in the evening. Bothwell was acquitted and it was widely rumoured that he would marry Mary.\n\n===Abduction of and marriage to Queen Mary===\n[[File:Arms of James Hepburn, 1st Duke of Orkney.svg|thumb|160px|Arms of James Hepburn, 1st Duke of Orkney]]\n\nThe next Wednesday, the Queen rode to the [[Parliament of Scotland|Estates of Parliament]], with Lord Bothwell carrying the [[Sceptre]], where the proceedings of Bothwell's trial were officially declared to be just according to the law of the land. On Saturday 19 April, eight bishops, nine earls, and seven Lords of Parliament put their signatures to what became known as the [[Ainslie Tavern Bond]], a manifesto declaring that Mary should marry a native-born subject, and handed it to Bothwell.\n\nOn Wednesday 24 April, while Mary was on the road from [[Linlithgow Palace]] to Edinburgh, Bothwell suddenly appeared with 800 men. He assured her that danger awaited her in Edinburgh, and told her that he proposed to take her to his castle at [[Dunbar]], out of harm's way. She agreed to accompany him and arrived at Dunbar at midnight. There, Mary was taken prisoner by Bothwell and allegedly raped by him to secure marriage to her and the crown (though whether she was his accomplice or his unwilling victim remains a controversial issue). On 12 May the Queen created him [[Duke of Orkney]] and [[Marquess of Fife]], and on 15 May they were married in the Great Hall at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]], according to Protestant rites officiated by Adam Bothwell, [[Bishop of Orkney]].<ref>Donaldson, Gordon, ed., ''The Memoirs of Sir [[James Melville of Halhill]]'', Folio Society, London, (1969), 65: Simpson, Grant G., ''Scottish Handwriting'', Tuckwell (1998), no. 18, contract 14 May 1567.</ref> Mary gave her new husband a fur lined night-gown.<ref>Robertson, Joseph, ed., ''Inventaires de la Royne Descosse'', (1863), 176, \"a M. le Duc d'Orquenez ... ung manteaux de nuyct.\"</ref> Within three days, Sir William Drury wrote to London that although the manner of things appeared to be forcible, it was known to be otherwise.\n\nThe marriage divided the country into two camps, and on 16 June, the Lords opposed to Mary and the Duke of Orkney (as Bothwell had newly become) signed a Bond denouncing them. A showdown between the two opposing sides followed at [[Battle of Carberry Hill|Carberry Hill]] on 15 June 1567, from which Bothwell fled, after one final embrace, never to be seen again by Mary.

The bridge is made of [[concrete]] that is either cast-in-place (constructed fully in its final location) or [[precast concrete]] (built at another location and then transported to their final location for placement in the full structure).\n\nThese bridges are very economical for long spans (over 100 meters), especially when access to the construction site is restricted. They are also chosen for their aesthetic appeal.\n\n==History==\nThe first cantilevered segmental cast-in-place concrete bridge, built in 1930, was [[Ponte Em\u00edlio Baumgart]] across Rio do Peixe in the state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] of [[Brazil]] <ref> Girard, L. (1931): Le pont de Herval au Br\u00e9sil. In: La Technique des Travaux, v. 7, n. 11 (November 1931). The [[Instituto Militar de Engenharia]], provided a free pdf copy of the original magazine article at http://aquarius.ime.eb.br/~webde2/prof/ethomaz/baumgart/rev_travaux.pdf</ref>. It was followed in 1951 by the [[prestressed concrete]] bridge across the [[Lahn River]] in [[Balduinstein, Germany]], the first of many cantilevered bridges designed by [[Ulrich Finsterwalder]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}}\n\nThe first prestressed concrete bridge, assembled by several precast elements, was the [[Pont de Luzancy]] across the river [[Marne (river)|Marne]] in [[France]], built according to the design by [[Eug\u00e8ne Freyssinet]] and commenced in 1940, but due to the war, completed only in 1946.\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe sequence of construction is similar to traditional concrete bridge building, i.e., build the support towers (columns), build the temporary falsework, build the deck, perform finish work.  The principal differences are as follows:\n# The support towers may be built segmentally.  Often this is accomplished using \"slip-form\" construction, where the falsework moves (slips) upward following sequential concrete \"pours.\"  The falsework uses the newly constructed concrete as the basis for moving upward.\n# After the towers are built, a superstructure is built atop the towers.  This superstructure serves as the \"launching\" point for building the deck. (The deck is often built in both directions away from the tower, simultaneously.)\n# The deck is now constructed sequentially, beginning at the tower, one section at a time. This process is usually accomplished using a self propelled bridge layer that hoists the bridge section into place.  \n#*In cast-in-place bridges, the falsework is connected to the previously installed concrete and allowed to cantilever freely.  Next, the permanent reinforcing steel and supports are installed.  Finally, the concrete is placed and cured, freeing the falsework to be moved.  \n#* In pre-cast bridges, the concrete segment is constructed on the ground, and then transported and hoisted into place.  As the new segment is suspended in place by the crane, workers install steel reinforcing that attaches the new segment to preceding segments.  Each segment of the bridge is designed to accept connections from both preceding and succeeding segments.\n# The process in step 3 is repeated until the span is completed.\n\n[[Image:SegmentalBridgeFtLauderdale.jpg|300px|thumb|Segmental bridge under construction, Ft.

Photo A. Ramprasad (10).jpg|thumb|[[Suzlon One Earth]], designed by Christopher Benninger, in [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]].]]\n\n'''Christopher Charles Benninger''' is an American-Indian architect and planner..\n\n==About==\n\nChristopher Charles Benninger (b.1942) is one of India\u2019s highly decorated architects. His award-winning projects are the Mahindra United World College of India, the Samundra Institute of Maritime Studies, \u201cSuzlon One Earth\u201d world headquarters, the National Ceremonial Plaza at Thimphu, Bhutan, and his own studio and residence \u201cIndia House\u201d in Pune. Each project addresses the complex issues of design, context, climate, materials, sustainability, and technology, amidst the client\u2019s programmatic needs. Christopher studied urban planning at MIT and architecture at Harvard, where he later taught. He settled in India in 1971, founding the School of Planning at Ahmedabad as a Ford Foundation Advisor, where he continues as a Distinguished Professor. His name appears alongside Geoffrey Bawa, Charles Correa and Balkrishna Doshi as one of the six recipients of the Great Master Architect Award in India, presented every three years. \n\nHis firm, Christopher Charles Benninger Architects, has recently been awarded India\u2019s most sought after commissions: the Azim Premji University at Bengaluru; and the Indian Institute of Technology at Hyderabad, along with the Indian Institute of Management at Kolkata. His city and regional planning works range from Sri Lanka, across India to Bhutan. Benninger\u2019s expansive campuses reveal an understanding of Indian \u201cplace making\u201d, reflecting the great temple complexes and the Mogul campuses. His narrative presents a language that lies between American ideals embedded in wooded Arcadian landscapes and sacred notions enshrined within Indian courtyards, generating a unique approach to architecture and place making.\n\n==Early Life==\n\nChristopher was born in [[Hamilton, Ohio]] in 1942, in the midst of the Second World War. His father, Lawrence Joseph Benninger was then teaching soldiers how to keep the army\u2019s accounts. As the War ended, his family moved to settle down for a few years in Columbia at the University of Missouri. In 1955, they left the Mid-west, stopping in the Deep South for a year and then moving on to [[Gainesville, Florida]], where his father later retired as a Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Florida]]. His father published influential articles and textbooks on accounting, reflecting his own difficult childhood in the Great Depression.\n\nHis paternal grandfather, Ernest Eberlein was an artist settled in Free Acres, an experimental free-tax community in the Watchung Mountains west of the Hudson River.\n\nGlimpsing through the striking gardens of Gainesville inspired Christopher to himself create a new world of nature with gardens penetrating into living spaces and household activities taking place outdoors. Seeing this interest, his maternal aunt presented him with The Natural House, Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s compelling autobiographical book setting out his credo on architecture. Reading the book, a 14-year old Christopher decided what he wanted to be- an architect. \n\n==Education==\n\n[[University of Florida]]\n\nChristopher graduated from the Department of Architecture at the University of Florida in 1966. He studied Architecture at Grove Hall, a temporary wooden barrack put up in the Second World War for officers\u2019 training. He learnt from a core group of great teachers, including Blair Reeves, Robert Tucker, Turpin C. Bannister, Norman Jensen, Bernard Voichysonk, Dan Branch and Harry C. Merritt. They opened windows for him on new thoughts, concepts and issues, and fostered great competition. Professor Merritt led him to leave the small university town of Gainesville for the city of Boston to attend Harvard.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''MIT and Harvard University''' }}\n\nChristopher completed his Master of Architecture from the Graduate School of Architecture in 1967 and him Master of City Planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1971. In Cambridge, he worked in Jose Luis Sert\u2019s studio, who was his mentor and his teacher at the GSD. Walter Gropius, though retired by then, would visit the their studios and pose questions. He interacted with the likes of Jerzy Soltan, Joseph Zalewski and Albert Szabo. He was equally inspire by the American school of thought that embraced nature, wildlife and the cycles of the seasons, and the European school of thought dominant in Cambridge at the time, that pushed architecture to float above nature and worship sky gods, abstraction and ideas. \n\n\nAt MIT, Kevin Lynch awakened his understanding of cities, places and urban experiences, while Herbert Gans encouraged him to explore the social ecology of neighbourhoods and how people used them. At Sert\u2019s studio on Church Street, he worked on the Harvard Science Center and Sert\u2019s new studio on Brattle Street- rationalist buildings that continue to inspire him even today. \n\n\nEven though he was an architect, he studied Economics under John Kenneth Gailbraith and became Barbara Ward\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, traveling with her to Greece to attend the Delos Symposium on Doxiadis\u2019 yacht. There, he was introduced to Edmund Bacon, Margaret Mead, Arnold Toynbee and Buckminster Fuller. \n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Fullbright Fellowship (First visit to India)''' }}\n\nIn October 1968, Christopher travelled to India on a Fulbright Fellowship. He taught at the Ahmedabad School of Architecture as a Visiting Lecturer and researched low-income settlements in Ahmedabad. While in India, he designed a site and services housing scheme in Vadodara for the social workers Sanatbhai and Anuradhaben Mehta.\n\n==Career==\n\nProfessor Benninger, is widely regarded as one of India\u2019s foremost creative architects, and is respected as a leading urban and regional planner. He has been registered with the [[Council of Architecture]] since 1976, and is a Fellow of both the [http://www.itpi.org.in/ Institute of Town Planners], India and the [https://iigeo.org/ Indian Institute of Architects]. He is a member of the Regional Science Association, India, the [https://iigeo.org/ Institute of Indian Geographers], the [http://puneinternationalcentre.org/ Pune International Centre], the World Society of [[Ekistics]], the [[American Planning Association]], the [[American Institute of Architects]], and the [[India Habitat Centre]]. \n\nUnder Sanat Mehta\u2019s Housing Ministry in Gujarat, 1972, he designed India\u2019s first [[Economically Weaker Section]] township in [[Jamnagar]] funded by [[HUDCO]]. He designed two [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_Children%27s_Villages SOS Children\u2019s Villages] (Kolkata and Bawana) in 1973 and 1975, and the Alliance Francaise in Ahmedabad in that period. In 1976 he moved to [[Pune]] where he founded the Centre for Development Studies and Activities [CDSA], whose well-known campus he designed in the mid-1980s.\n\n\nBeginning in 1976 he worked with the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority to design their first Low Income Housing Township at Yousufguda that shelters more than two thousand low-income households. From 1974 to 1978 he designed the Madras Metropolitan Development Authority\u2019s pioneering Site and Services Programme, under which more than fifteen thousand shelter units were created with the participation of owner-builders from the city\u2019s slums. Under UNO funding, 1979\u201382, he prepared the development plans for six cities in Sri Lanka. In the 1980s professor Benninger prepared Integrated Rural Development Programmes for Ratnagiri, Etawah, Goa, Almora and many other districts with the GOI, [[UNICEF]] and local district governments.\n\nUnder [[World Bank]] funding he has prepared development plans for the cities of Kalyan and Thane [1986-90] through the [[BMRDA]]; studies and recommendations for the planning of twenty-eight urban centres in Madhya Pradesh [1988-92], and other plans for Indian cities.\n\n\nWhile the Executive Director of the Centre for Development Studies and Activities he was a Member of the University Faculty Senate and on the Board of University Teaching and Research [BUTR] of the [[Pune University]]; on the Bureau of Indian Standards Expert\u2019s Group on Urban Planning, Architecture and Construction Norms and Standards; on several HUDCO policy committees, and he carried out research and the preparation of policy papers for the Planning Commission, the Ministries of Rural Development, Women and Children [preparing the Integrated District Development Programme, GOI, funded by UNICEF, Home Affairs [Tribal Development]. He has advised the World Bank, the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[UNCHS]] [Habitat]; the [[UNFAO]], UNICEF and the [[Ford Foundation]] regarding development initiatives in India, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries.\n\nAs an expert advisor to the UNCHS [Habitat] Professor Benninger wrote the Theme Paper for the Seventh United Nations Commission Meeting on Human Settlements [1983], and in 1986 he wrote the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Draft Urban Investment Policy. He was a Member of the Technology Information Forecasting and Assessment Council [TIFAC], Ministry of Science and Technology from 1988 onwards. He remains a Distinguished Professor at [[CEPT University]] in Ahmedabad and Chairman of the Board of the Centre for Development Studies and Activities, Pune and is an Honorary Trustee of the Pune International Centre.

As it\u2019s Founder, Christopher developed the curriculum, hired faculty and brought in good students from all across India. \n\nThe School of Planning was an important experiment. It drew students from architecture, engineering, social work, law, the liberal arts and technology, upsetting the accreditation committees of civil engineers, geographers and architects. Their pedagogy was through \u2018laboratories,\u2019 rather than classrooms and studios. Students and teachers lived in villages, rural towns and slums \u2018learning from the people\u2019 with whom we made plans for the future. Theoretical subjects were cross-disciplinary involving administrators, social scientists, architects, community leaders and technicians.\n\nApart from being a Distinguished Professor, Christopher currently serves as a Member on the Academic Council at CEPT to help set policy on course content, faculty recruitment, research goals, and programme and faculty development.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD | '''Centre for Development Studies and Activities (CDSA)''' }}\n\nChristopher shifted to Pune to start CDSA in 1976 at the age of thirty-three. This was his second institution, a place of intellectual research and social action. At the peak of CDSA\u2019s ascendance more than eighty young professionals worked in offices at Pune, Bhutan, Goa,in the foothills of the Himalayas in Almora, and in Jaffna and Galle in Sri Lanka. They prepared town plans and slum improvement programs. They pioneered micro-watershed planning, micro-level social services planning, decentralized planning and participatory planning. \n\nHis twenty years at CDSA were spent inventing, enabling and facilitating programs, all to assist households to climb out of poverty. They worked in teams; they joined with villages and slum dwellers as their research laboratories, classrooms and teachers; and they drew from all disciplines. CDSA was part of an active network including the Indian Planning Commission, the National Housing Bank, the Housing and Urban Development Corporation and the Ministries of Social Welfare, Rural Development and Urban Affairs. Internationally, they worked with the UNCHS (Habitat) in Nairobi, the Asian Development Bank in Manila and the World Bank in Washington. Many programs in Bhutan and in India were developed with the United Nations.\n\nThe new School of Planning at CDSA was founded on didactic techniques initiated in Ahmedabad. The real world became the learning laboratory. Students lived in slums and villages learning from those they would plan for. Poverty alleviation, sustainability and equality were the main concerns and issues to be debated. Methods of \u2018stress identification\u2019, problem identification, program design and monitoring the results of development inputs were evolved. Land models, common resources models and social structure models were invented and explored. At CDSA, \u2018modern\u2019 came to mean planned and facilitated change that eradicated poverty, in a manner that employed limited resources rationally. It involved the civil society, NGOs, governments and the people.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD | '''Impact on Architectural Education in India''' }}\n\nProfessor Benninger has delivered 15 International lectures and more than 235 national lectures till date to the architecture, engineering and construction fraternities. Many of his books reached those remote corners educating students in the absence of good teachers of architecture and planning in India. Letters to a Young Architect, with its Gujarati, Bengali and Chinese translations, is a book that has crossed the language divide to reach aspiring architects and designers. His second book, Christopher Benninger: Architecture for Modern India, took Indian Modern Architecture to the world while celebrating India\u2019s age old traditions of the sustainable built environment. His contribution to the profession is not limited to giving a shape to the institutions and campuses he designed but in the evolution of his thoughts and design process.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD | '''Architecture''' }}\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''CCBA Designs: The studio''' }}\n\nCCBA Designs started as a small proprietorship design firm in 1995 by the Company Founder Chairman and Principal Architect Prof. Christopher Benninger along with Founder Managing Director Mr. Ramprasad Akkisetti. With the changing economic liberalization, and part of the expansion plan, Benninger Technical Services came into being in 1999 that eventually morphed into Christopher Charles Benninger Architects Private Limited (shortened to be addressed as CCBA) in 2000. CCBA is an Incorporated Company registered in 1999 under the Companies act 1956.\n\nThe team has always functioned as a studio, only accepting commissions involving study, analysis and the exploration of visual, spatial, social and technological concepts impinging on architecture, urbanism and human settlements. As an internationally known \u2018design house\u2019 CCBA has created products ranging from a capital city and new towns; educational campuses and corporate headquarters; housing communities and complexes; hotels and resorts; and on to the design of chairs and art works. In the end, it is not the \u201cthings\u201d they design, but the transcendental experience of the people using them, looking at them, or just being in them, which is their essence.  For the studio, the good life exists just a step outside of materiality, in a mystic twilight zone, which is called architecture.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''''India House: The Abode for Art''''' }}\n\nCCBA Designs operates from the founding directors own premises, India House.  This abode of design provides a salubrious work environment with galleries, recreational facilities and a Courtyard. The gallery is dedicated to the exhibition of master artist\u2019s work, exploring timeless energy with fresh commitment. India House Art Gallery stands for passion, dedicated to the interpretation of human existence through highly crafted imagery. The gallery is committed to working with exceptional artists who are visually gifted, technically exceptional, and of important artistic merit and accomplishment. Whatever the medium represented the art works are well rafted, unique and transformational. Though tied to no specific aesthetic philosophy, the gallery seeks to introduce the connoisseurs of Pune and the rest of India to creative genius that is of truly international quality, and influential nature. The gallery hosts autumn, winter and spring exhibitions, with related talks and seminars.\n\n==Early Works==\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''SOS Children\u2019s Villages''' }}\n\nThe SOS Children\u2019s Villages in India were an outcome of a social in Europe to care for orphans after the Second World War. The campuses in Bawana and Kolkata were the second and third such orphanages created in the sub-continent. Each village is composed of a headmaster\u2019s house, a clinic, a library, a community hall, utility buildings and twenty Houses. Each house accommodates both, children and a housemother.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''SOS Children\u2019s Village, Bawana, Haryana''' }}\n\nLocated in Bawana Village fifty kilometres from Delhi, this small campus is designed around a central village square. Narrow paths lead through four portals into four neighbourhood plazas, which in turn lead into domestic courtyards of five houses. Thus, the campus is conceived as a hierarchy of social spaces, where a child can find their own comfort level, either alone in their bedroom reading. The entire village is laid out on parallel lines, over which brick bearing walls are built and brick arched ceiling vaults span above these ground level spaces.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''SOS Children\u2019s Village, Kolkata, West Bengal''' }}\n\nThe SOS Children\u2019s Village in Kolkata emerged as a call from Mother Teresa to shelter the parentless children emerging from the freedom movement and subsequent war in Bangladesh. This village followed the same building programme, module sizes and room areas as the Bawana Village. Unlike the Bawana village, the Kolkata village is located within a dense urban fabric. An identical set of functions in an identical building programme was expressed in a completely different architectural language and spatial system.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''''Alliance Francaise, Ahmedabad, Gujarat''''' }}\n\nIn 1973 the Gujarat United School of Theology initiated the construction of a small, 260 sq. m., library and cultural centre for [https://ccba.in/project/alliance-francaise/ Alliance Francaise] that would house a specialized collection of books and a common cultural area for small programs. The structure is located in a corner site, accessible through the main academic quadrangle, of a late Nineteenth Century institution built from brick and trimmed with stone.  The strategy employs exposed brick bearing walls, reinforced for seismic resistance, and exposed concrete beams, lintels and fins transparently expressing the structural system. Natural lighting comes from north facing skylights, high in the ceilings, which wrap down the back north wall. A system of nine modules, 4.75 meters square, order the floor plan of nine such modules into a system of inter-locked, double height spaces. This module is halved to create pivoting square doors, and defined in three equal subdivisions to modulate the spacing of beams, turning down the back walls as fins, within which glass windows are fit. Modular toilets project out of this back wall. Interlocking volumes create a kinetic flow of spaces between three areas. An exposed concrete column, in the centre of the main space, creates the illusion of movement as one walks within the structure. \n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Centre for Development Studies and Activities, Pune, Maharashtra''' }}\n\nThe [https://cdsaindia.org/ Centre for Development Studies and Activities] (CDSA) is a place of exploration, reflection and analysis on the great laboratory that is India. It was built by the architect for his own trust activities whose focal concerns are the study of development processes and the role of planned interventions in societal changes. [https://ccba.in/project/cdsa/ The campus] is perched on a hill terrace along the slopes of India\u2019s Western Ghats Mountains as they meet the great plains of the Deccan Plateau providing scenic vistas. A fabric of build has emerged from the assemblage of three generic elements namely which are stone, transparent sliding panels and tile roofs. An interesting play of spaces has been created with the studios opening out into their own intimate landscaped courtyards, which again visually connect to the main central podium through square apertures. This openness reveals the deep-rooted meaning of the Institute, in which the liberated mind searches for the resolution of specific problems, often through teamwork, or through the exchange of opposing ideas.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''United World College Mahindra, Mulshi, Maharashtra''' }}\n\nThe [https://ccba.in/project/uwc-mahindra-college/ Mahindra United World College] of India is one the 12 campuses worldwide under the [http://uwcmahindracollege.org/gallery United World College] banner. Patronized by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Mahindra Mahindra family], the college accommodates about 200 students from over 60 countries, on an integrated residential campus. It is located in the picturesque Sahyadhri Mountains of the Western Ghats. The concept of the campus plan evolved from that of a mandala. It centres the plan of this diverse, micro cosmos, around an academic quadrangle with passages radiating out from it, offering points of encounter along the way, as well as views towards the valleys in the distance. Using the auspicious North-South axis to intersect the sun\u2019s east-west movement in a plan centred on the academic quadrangle, a system of individual structures is laid out, each having their own character and identity, yet integrated via connecting walls and a strong architectural language of masonry and terracotta tile roofs. Set in the foreground of vast rugged, mountains, the building angles and geometry mimic the imagery of distant landscapes, and appear in the same scale due to the sizing impact of perspective; making the near large and the distant small; making the campus appear to be in the same scale as the vast landscape. These techniques of borrowing landscapes and of creating kinetic experiences through articulate choreography of movement are unique aspects of this campus in the mountains.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Nagaloka, Nagpur, Maharashtra''' }}\n\nThe [https://ccba.in/project/nagaloka/ Nagaloka institute] is located in the metropolis of Nagpur in central India. This institute is a centre for training in social work focused on the upliftment of disadvantaged communities.  The campus includes an entrance gate, public sanitary facilities, an administration building, the large [https://www.nagaloka.org/ Dhamma Hall] for discourses and lectures, a library, classrooms, a meditation pavilion or Vihara, a catering centre, guest houses, dormitories for men and women and dharmashalas accommodating visitors. The central focus is a statue of the Buddha aligned on a long promenade from the entry. A statue of Dr. Ambedkar commemorates his role in leading many followers to spiritual enlightenment and social upliftment. Situated in the outskirts of Nagpur, the campus configuration is influenced by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarnath Deer Park at Sarnath], where the [[Buddha]] gave his Sermon of the Turning of the Wheel outlining the Fivefold Path. All of the structures are constructed of exposed brick, brick vaults, long span concrete shells and Kota stone flooring.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Kochi Refineries Limited, Kochi, Kerala''' }}\n\nThis corporate headquarters is located along the Kerala backwaters near Kochi, where a river turns sharply affording views up and down its edges, lined with coconut trees and thick forest cover. The design problem was to seek a holistic solution integrating the structural system, mechanical system and functional program into a system of \u201cfixed\u201d and \u201cflexible\u201d parts. Traditionally horizontal wood jaalis are employed to temper light and air, which is reflected in the employment of horizontal aluminium louvers in this work. It was essential that the headquarters of this energy enterprise be built around the concept of energy efficiency. The building is a glass cylinder, set inside a shading jaali tube, cutting down heat, while illuminating the interiors and saving energy. The strong building envelope allowed for space shaping within its geometric volume. The ground level structural glass walls are set back into the shade of the upper levels allowing the ground floor to act as one continuous open space flowing up through an atrium, while flowing out the ground level caf\u00e9 and entrance lobby into the horizontal natural vistas.\n\n==MAJOR PROJECTS (2000-2010)==\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Samundra Institute of Maritime Studies, Lonavala, Maharashtra''' }}\n\nThe Samundra Institute of Maritime Studies, a 55-acre green campus situated between Mumbai and Pune, is a green campus for pre-sea and post-sea maritime studies. The project was conceived by the owners of Executive Ship Management in Singapore to ensure the efficient, safe and environmentally sustainable management of their fleet of over sixty ships. The Architects were sent to sea for two weeks, as a pre-design sensitization exercise, and the conceptual designs were sketched at sea.\n\nLocated next to the Indrayani River, the campus consists of an administrative building, hostel accommodation for five hundred students with dining facilities, an auditorium and an amphitheatre. There is a large classroom building, a vast maritime workshop, a science building and extensive recreational facilities, including an Olympic-sized swimming pool.\n\nA \u201cShip on Campus\u201d is used to train young mariners. This is in fact a ship\u2019s eight storied, operational section that includes the engines, desalinization plant, sewerage treatment plant, generators, ventilating and air conditioning plants, tanker, fire fighting and other pumps, and navigation deck. \n\nMariners at sea live in miniature cities made of steel and glass and an attempt was made to replicate that environment in the campus. Taking inspiration from general ship accommodations, the student residences, in the centre of the campus, are in the form of a long, ship-like structure of five attached houses, each with their own entry stair, and commons areas and double seated rooms, each with an attached toilet.\n\nThis project was nearing completion just as the Suzlon One Earth project was initiated. Many green concepts that were explored at the Samudra Institute were built upon in the LEED-certified Suzlon campus. \n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Suzlon One Earth Corporate Headquarters, Pune, Maharashtra''' }}\n\nSuzlon Energy Limited is a leading wind energy company based in Pune that aspired to create the most environmentally sensitive office campus in India. Covering about one hundred thousand square meters of built-up area on 10.4 acres of urban land, the project achieved international LEED Platinum and Indian TERI GRIHA top certifications. 8% of its annual energy is generated on-site through photovoltaic panels and windmills, at an incremental cost of 11%. At the time of completion there were no other campuses in India with this level of certification and cost efficiency. With an off-site wind energy farm supplying ninety-two percent of the potential four megawatt energy consumption, the campus is a net zero energy project. The design exclusively employs non-toxic and recycled materials. Water, energy, air, sewerage and trash are all sustainably managed on site.\n\nThe planning strategy derives its inspiration from historical campuses like Fatehpur Sikri and the Meenakshi Temple complex in Madurai. The design is created around a central gathering space, or Brahmasthan, with the sky as its ceiling, offering the entire campus visual access to extensive gardens. The anchoring visual element is a stone Deepstambh, a traditional Indian pillar of oil lamps, set in the centre of a Crescent-shaped Reflecting Pool. The central garden plaza, on a podium over parking and utilities, encourages interaction and discussion amongst the 2,300 colleagues, providing an iconic memory point for all who visit the campus.\n\nA series of served and server spaces were conceptualized, allowing adaptability to the transformational nature of evolving business patterns. The served spaces, where people work have flexible modular walls and furniture systems. These are served by more static cores housing wet areas, vertical utility ducts, fire stairs, elevators, entry and reception areas. \u201cModules\u201d were employed, like silo fire stairs; the benchmark glass cylinder ventilation chimneys, and the 8.4 by 8.4 meter structural modules. Aluminium louvers act as a protective skin allowing daylight and cross ventilation. A generic strategy was to provide seventy-five percent of the workstations with daylight and external views.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Supreme Court, Thimphu, Bhutan''' }}\n\nThe Supreme Court of Bhutan is one of the critical components of the Bhutan modernization project, the transformation of the monarchy into a constitutional democracy. The mandate was to create an iconic structure reflecting the importance of the Constitution and the culture from which the Constitution emerged.  The campus also spatially addresses the ancient Trashichhoe Dzong where the studio had completed an important extension, in the form of the National Ceremonial Plaza.\n\nThe limitation of building resources, craftsmen and technology, was a major design constraint. Prior to this design there had been several attempts by foreign architects, whose requirements of highly processed materials, technical construction equipment and construction management obviated implementation.\n\nThe completed campus consists of one full-bench Court and four single-bench Courts, supported by an Administrative Building, a Judicial Library, a Registrar\u2019s Building and Lawyers\u2019 Chambers. The design strategy addressed site, cultural, contextual, technological and functional factors. The use of Bhutanese local materials, craftspeople and building technologies was employed. The campus follows patterns of dimensions, iconography norms, colour and motif signifiers, and fabrication methods that are unique to the culture. There is a vast unwritten catalogue of details, motifs, joinery, column designs, etc. that the carpenters and masons know \u2018by heart,\u2019 and carry out by instinct, and not through \u2018measuring and building.\u2019\n\nThe urban design issues of the National Capital Precinct were also addressed through a site plan that centred the structures on a Judicial Plaza, aligning the full bench Supreme Court with the Trashichhoe Dzong, and specifically the ancient Utsi to the south. \n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''IIM Calcutta, Kolkata, West Bengal''' }}\n\nThe Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta was the first in a series of business management institutions to be sponsored by the Government of India in the early 1960\u2019s to enhance the efficiency and transparency of commerce and industry. \n\nIn 2007 the Institute realized the need for a master plan and for increasing its student capacities. The proposed plan included hostels, executive training facilities, additional academic areas and major infrastructure additions. The residential complex would include a large dining and recreational facility on three levels. An executive hostel was also proposed with twenty-seven suites and one hundred and sixty-four single rooms apart from classrooms, syndicate rooms, lounges and dining facilities.\n\nThe construction language employs simple plastered facades and Kota stone flooring. Vertical silo staircase towers hold the four corners of the stepped hostels elevations.  Each of the hostel wings is composed of stepped sections, with private balconies stepping back up the exterior walls. Inside, open passages project into sky-lit atria, reaching out, one over the other, as they ascend. The residential nneighbourhoodopens up through landscaped terraces and gardens onto placid lotus ponds in a verdant landscape. The residential neighborhood is connected to the academic quadrangle by an iconic tubular steel pedestrian bridge, crossing a forty-three meters wide water pond. In the academic quadrangle, a dilapidated school was demolished and moved, making way for a larger open space. \n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Kirloskar Institute of Advanced Management Studies, Pune, Maharashtra''' }}\n\nThe Kirloskar Institute of Advanced Management Studies was conceptualised by the Kirloskar Group of Industries, one of the oldest family owned industrial establishments in Western India, to create a a generation of management professionals suited to the modern business environment. \n\nLocated on the periphery of Pune on the Sahyadhri mountain range, the site slopes down from an arterial road. From the entrance, a series of courtyards step down onto subsequent lower terraces, and each terrace is devoted to a core function focused around a courtyard. The entry and the administration were kept at the top; mid-career executive training on the next lower terrace courtyard; masters in business administration, first and second years, on the next two lower level terraces, and the library at the lowest terrace. In each of these courtyards, one side is devoted to faculty offices and the others to classrooms. \n\nOn the other side of the site the residential area begins with an residential entry for executive management candidates on the higher terrace, and subsequent dropping terraces dedicated to accommodate postgraduate student hostels and common areas. The recreational area on the lowermost terrace has a swimming pool and multi-purpose halls for yoga and a gym. There are tennis courts and other sports areas at the lower end of the site where a water collection pond and cisterns store rainwater.\n\nExposed concrete with white rough plaster on brick infill walls, natural Kota Stone floors and sloped copper aluminium roofs, mirroring the mountainous terrain, have been used in the project. \n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Lodha Belmondo, Pune, Maharashtra''' }}\n\nNestled between the Expressway and the Pavana River, this 100-acre township boasts of picturesque views of the Western Ghats and the adjoining river while maintaining easy access to the employment hubs and emerging residential areas of Pune. \n\nDevelopment Control regulations required wide setbacks from the expressway and the adjoining river. These setbacks, along with a large swathe of land unfit for construction through the centre, limited development to small pockets along the periphery of the site. To make the project financially viable for the developers, the Architect proposed a high-rise construction to utilize maximum FSI. This approach also freed up more than 70% of the site\u2019s groundcover to develop amenities including an 18-hole golf course and a world-class club house.\n\nThe housing scheme takes cues from the global trend of \u201cplus one\u201d that focuses not only on the private living spaces but also on the common and public spaces, amenities, and the surrounding environment as significant value-adding enhancements. The state-of-the-art livings spaces are a mix of flats and villas. These varying typologies have been seamlessly assembled, both functionally and aesthetically.\n\nThe large facades of these imposing vertical towers have been broken down into horizontal elements. The composition of the aluminum louvers, the cantilevered balconies and recessed windows, appropriately complements this considerable upright mass.  The terracotta-faced staircase and elevator cores rise up to resemble ancient temples of the medieval period. The complete fa\u00e7ade is bound together by a projecting frame of masonry along its edge. \n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''COEP Girls\u2019 Hostel, Pune''' }}\n\nInitiated in 1854, the College of Engineering at Pune (COEP) is one of the oldest engineering colleges in Asia. Over decades the 36-acre campus has been encroached upon for expanding highways, railway lines, arterial roads, and recently flyovers, resulting in five fragmented land parcels, one of which is covered by low income squatters. A new management in 2006 formulated a vision to double its student intake, enhance its facilities and to increase its residential hostels, especially for women.\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''Women\u2019s\u2019 Residence''' }}\n\nThe women\u2019s residence was the first initiative in this campus development program. This hostel is envisioned to anchor a pedestrian stem of four, twelve-storied structures, positioning common spaces on the ground level and locating residential rooms above. The strategy for the residences is to situate two bedrooms on either side of a wet core accessed through a dry balcony, lent privacy by concrete jaalis that filter views. With the ground floor dedicated to common facilities, and the roof garden level devoted to a gym, clinic, laundry and apartments for mentors, the remaining ten floors, of twenty rooms each, accommodate six hundred women within the college campus.\n\nThe ground floor level of this structure hosts a cutout-porch, through which the planned stem, or campus street, will later pass. To one side of this porch lies a coffee shop, and on the other side is the hostel entrance lobby, with elevators and vertical stair. There is also an entry into the large dining room, with cooking facilities behind it. This structure is wedged into a corner site of the residential campus with one side opening onto a narrow garden promenade, shared with a hundred year old, ground and two floors, boys\u2019 hostel that has been renovated into a postgraduate women\u2019s residence. \n\n== MAJOR PROJECTS (2010-2020) ==\n\n{{ font color | #2445AD| '''FORBES MARSHALL GREEN FIELD INDUSTRIAL PARK, PUNE, MAHARASHTRA''' }}\n\nThe [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Marshall Forbes family] had been working out of antiquated, inefficient and chaotic structures, that grew according to need in an ad hoc manner over decades.
