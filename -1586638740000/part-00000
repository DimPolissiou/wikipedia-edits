He played collegiately at [[Oklahoma State University]]. He lost to [[Nick Flanagan]] in the finals of the 2003 [[U.S. Amateur]].\n\nIn 2004, he finished 13th at the [[Masters Tournament]], the lowest amateur finish in 41 years. He was the only player in the field to improve his score each round. Additionally, he registered the lowest Sunday back 9 score (31) of any amateur in Masters history.\n\nAt the 2004 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] at [[Shinnecock Hills Golf Club|Shinnecock Hills]], he shot a four round total of 296, which was the second best of any amateur in the tournament that year.<ref>[http://www.golfgearreview.com/article-display/1008.html Callaway Golf Signs Rising Young Star Casey Wittenberg to Endorse Company's Golf Clubs and Golf Balls] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106053939/http://www.golfgearreview.com/article-display/1008.html |date=January 6, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nWittenberg turned professional in 2004 and played on the [[PGA Tour]], [[Web.com Tour]] (formerly Nationwide Tour), and mini-tours since. In 2012, Wittenberg won his first title on a major golf tour, the Nationwide Tour's [[Chitimacha Louisiana Open]]. He followed it up three months later with his second win of the season at the [[Preferred Health Systems Wichita Open]], one week after finishing T10 at the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]].\n\nWittenberg was the leading money winner on the Web.com Tour in 2012, earning his 2013 PGA Tour card, and was named [[Web.com Tour Player of the Year]]. In 2013, he made only eight cut in 27 tournaments and finished 150th on the money list and 164th on the [[FedEx Cup]] points list, resulting in the loss of his PGA Tour card.\n\nWittenberg returned to the Web.com Tour in [[2014 Web.com Tour|2014]] and has played there since.

During some years in the 1970s and 1980s, the magazine published eight issues per year.\n\nIn 1975, the magazine underwent a complete overhaul with a new logo, new artists and new features. The late 1970s and early 1980s issues included [[iron-on]]s, a feature which ended in 1983, later replaced by a center poster which often was a larger print of the cover art.\n\nThe original run of ''CARtoons'' magazine folded with the August 1991 issue.\n\nIn 2015, Ontario artist Marc Methot successfully filed for the abandoned ''CARtoons'' trademark. He resumed publication of the magazine in January 2016 and it continues to be published bimonthly.<ref>Williams, Greg.

A [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|''Resident Evil 2'']], it was released for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on January 25, 2019. Players control rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] and student [[Claire Redfield]] as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a [[zombie apocalypse]].  \n\nCapcom considered remaking ''Resident Evil 2'' following the successful release of [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|the remake of the first ''Resident Evil'']] in 2002. It was delayed as series creator [[Shinji Mikami]] did not want to divert development from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005). Capcom announced the ''Resident Evil 2'' remake in August 2015, and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at [[E3 2018]].\n\n''Resident Evil 2'' received acclaim, with praise for its presentation, gameplay, and faithfulness to the original. It was nominated for several awards, including numerous [[game of the year|\"game of the year]]\" awards. By December 2019, it had sold over 5.8 million copies, outselling the original.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 Remake gameplay.png|left|thumb|[[Claire Redfield]] is one of the game's two main playable characters.]]\n''Resident Evil 2'' is a remake of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|of the same name]]. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the re-imagining features \"over-the-shoulder\" [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to ''[[Resident Evil&nbsp;4]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|title=E3 2018: Resident Evil 2 Remake Is Familiar But Terrifying In New Ways|last=Espineli|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2018|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613084807/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the standard difficulty mode allows players to save as often as they would like inside safe rooms. If the player chooses to play on \"Hardcore\" difficulty, players will be required to collect and use a finite number of ink ribbons to save the game's progress, much like in the original game.\n\nAs with the original game, the remake of ''Resident Evil 2'' offers the option to play through the main campaign with one of two protagonists, the rookie cop [[Leon S. Kennedy]] or the college student [[Claire Redfield]]. Depending on the player's choice, the main story will be experienced with variations in subplots, accessible areas, and obtainable items.\n\nSimilar to the \"Scenario B\" feature of the original game, beating the main campaign for the first time unlocks the option to play through a \"2nd Run\" as the other protagonist. 2nd Run is a variation of the main campaign that adds additional content to frame the second playthrough as occurring concurrently with the first playthrough. For example, the protagonist in 2nd Run will enter the police station from a different entrance and find several doors already unlocked by the protagonist from the first playthrough. Completing 2nd Run is also required to experience the true ending of the main campaign.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe game is set in Raccoon City in September 1998, two months after the events of ''[[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. Most of the citizens have been turned into mindless creatures, referred to by survivors as zombies, due to an outbreak of a viral [[bioweapon]] known as the [[T-Virus]], manufactured by [[Umbrella Corporation]].<ref name=\"characters\">{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|pages=117\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|page=253}}</ref> The game begins at a [[gas station]] outside of the city, where rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] meets college student [[Claire Redfield]], who is looking for her brother [[Chris Redfield]].\n\nAfter being separated following a car accident, Leon and Claire agree to meet up at the city's police department. The building is infested by zombies, and other monsters, including the \"[[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]]\",{{efn|Officially known as T-00, but commonly referred to as \"Mr. X\".}} who is dispatched to hunt down and kill any survivors. The creatures and various obstacles prevent Leon and Claire from actually reuniting as they are forced to find a way to escape the city.\n\n=== Claire scenario ===\nClaire encounters a young girl, Sherry Birkin, who is being pursued by a monstrous creature. The two manage to escape into the police station parking garage, where corrupt Police Chief Brian Irons abducts Sherry, and locks her in an abandoned orphanage. Claire soon receives a call from Irons to trade Sherry for a pendant she had dropped during the abduction, threatening to kill the little girl if Claire does not comply. Reluctantly, Claire agrees to do so.\n\nSherry tries to escape on her own, but is soon cornered by Irons. Before Irons can harm her, the creature that had been chasing Sherry returns and implants Irons with a parasite. Claire arrives to save Sherry, and the parasite bursts out of Irons' chest, killing him. As Claire and Sherry attempt to leave, the Tyrant arrives and chases the pair into an elevator, but is killed by the creature stalking Sherry. The creature then tries to attack Claire and Sherry, but accidentally causes the elevator to fall into the sewers. The resulting impact knocks Claire unconscious, and Sherry is forced to abandon her to escape.\n\nClaire is found by Annette, Sherry's mother. Annette reveals that the creature after Sherry is William, her husband. The Birkins developed the G-Virus for Umbrella; however, William planned to sell it to the U.S. military. Umbrella sent its paramilitary force to confiscate his work, leading to William being fatally shot. To avoid death and vowing revenge, William had injected himself with the G-Virus. The infected William hunted down the Umbrella soldiers in the sewers. During the carnage he shattered vials of the T-virus the troops had taken, infecting sewer rats and indirectly causing the Raccoon City outbreak. Now a mindless mutating beast, the G-Virus drives William to infect Sherry, as she is the closest genetic match to William and thus the most suitable host to spread the infection.\n\nClaire finds Sherry trapped in a trash compactor by Annette. Upon reaching her, however, Sherry falls ill. Annette realizes William has already infected Sherry and has Claire bring her to an Umbrella lab called NEST, where a vaccine is stored. Once there, Claire uses Sherry's pendant to unlock the vaccine, but William attacks. Claire sends Annette to administer the vaccine while she fights William. After seemingly killing him, Claire reunites with Annette, who has managed to cure Sherry before dying from internal injuries. Sherry tearfully bids her mother goodbye. As the facility enacts a self-destruct protocol, Claire and Sherry make their way to an evacuation train. William returns yet again, and Claire defeats him just as the train prepares to leave. Upon boarding, Claire discovers Leon there as well.\n\n=== Leon scenario ===\nLeon is saved from an infected dog by FBI agent, [[Ada Wong]]. They find reporter Ben Bertolucci in the holding cells; imprisoned by Irons for investigating Umbrella. As Ben tries to convince Leon to release him, the Tyrant kills Ben. While attempting to escape the police station, Leon is intercepted by the Tyrant but is again saved by Ada. Leon pledges to help Ada retrieve a G-Virus sample to prove Umbrella's corruption.\n\nIn the sewers, Annette Birkin ambushes the pair and shoots at Ada; Leon takes the bullet and passes out. Ada pursues Annette but is knocked into a trash compactor. Leon rescues her, and they descend to NEST via cable car, where Ada kisses Leon.\n\nAda, injured, requests that Leon obtain the G sample. In Birkin's lab, Leon obtains a sample but is attacked by William. Annette tries to kill him, but is mortally wounded. Leon defeats William and tends to Annette, who claims that Ada is a mercenary and will sell the virus to the highest bidder.\n\nLeon confronts Ada as the lab's self-destruct protocol begins, where she admits to being a mercenary. Ada demands the G-Virus sample from Leon at gunpoint, but Annette shoots Ada before succumbing to her injuries. As Ada falls off the bridge; Leon catches her, letting the virus sample fall into the abyss. Leon loses his grip and Ada falls.\n\nAs Leon attempts to escape the lab, he is ambushed by the Tyrant, now transformed into the larger and more powerful Super Tyrant and engages it in a final battle. Ada, having survived the fall, tosses a rocket launcher to him, which Leon uses to finally destroy the Super Tyrant. Leon boards the evacuation train, discovering Claire and Sherry already aboard.\n\n=== Ending ===\nAfter Leon, Claire, and Sherry reunite, William attacks the train, having mutated into a gigantic putrid mass of fangs and flesh. Claire and Leon are almost killed in the fight, but manage to uncouple the carriage occupied by William. The carriage falls behind and is consumed by the exploding lab, destroying William once and for all. As the three survivors finally escape Raccoon City, they vow to continue the fight against Umbrella.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 police car at E3 2018.jpg|thumb|Promotional booth at [[E3 2018]]]]\nThe original ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' was released for the PlayStation in 1998.

A [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|''Resident Evil 2'']], it was released for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on January 25, 2019. Players control rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] and student [[Claire Redfield]] as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a [[zombie apocalypse]].  \n\nCapcom considered remaking ''Resident Evil 2'' following the successful release of [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|the remake of the first ''Resident Evil'']] in 2002. It was delayed as series creator [[Shinji Mikami]] did not want to divert development from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005). Capcom announced the ''Resident Evil 2'' remake in August 2015, and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at [[E3 2018]].\n\n''Resident Evil 2'' received acclaim, with praise for its presentation, gameplay, and faithfulness to the original. It was nominated for several awards, including numerous [[game of the year|\"game of the year]]\" awards. By December 2019, it had sold over 5.8 million copies, outselling the original.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 Remake gameplay.png|left|thumb|[[Claire Redfield]] is one of the game's two main playable characters.]]\n''Resident Evil 2'' is a remake of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|of the same name]]. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the re-imagining features \"over-the-shoulder\" [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to ''[[Resident Evil&nbsp;4]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|title=E3 2018: Resident Evil 2 Remake Is Familiar But Terrifying In New Ways|last=Espineli|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2018|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613084807/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the standard difficulty mode allows players to save as often as they would like inside safe rooms. If the player chooses to play on \"Hardcore\" difficulty, players will be required to collect and use a finite number of ink ribbons to save the game's progress, much like in the original game.\n\nAs with the original game, the remake of ''Resident Evil 2'' offers the option to play through the main campaign with one of two protagonists, the rookie cop [[Leon S. Kennedy]] or the college student [[Claire Redfield]]. Depending on the player's choice, the main story will be experienced with variations in subplots, accessible areas, and obtainable items.\n\nSimilar to the \"Scenario B\" feature of the original game, beating the main campaign for the first time unlocks the option to play through a \"2nd Run\" as the other protagonist. 2nd Run is a variation of the main campaign that adds additional content to frame the second playthrough as occurring concurrently with the first playthrough. For example, the protagonist in 2nd Run will enter the police station from a different entrance and find several doors already unlocked by the protagonist from the first playthrough. Completing 2nd Run is also required to experience the true ending of the main campaign.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe game is set in Raccoon City in September 1998, two months after the events of ''[[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. Most of the citizens have been turned into mindless creatures, referred to by survivors as zombies, due to an outbreak of a viral [[bioweapon]] known as the [[T-Virus]], manufactured by [[Umbrella Corporation]].<ref name=\"characters\">{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|pages=117\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|page=253}}</ref> The game begins at a [[gas station]] outside of the city, where rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] meets college student [[Claire Redfield]], who is looking for her brother [[Chris Redfield]].\n\nAfter being separated following a car accident, Leon and Claire agree to meet up at the city's police department. The building is infested by zombies, and other monsters, including the \"[[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]]\",{{efn|Officially known as T-00, but commonly referred to as \"Mr. X\".}} who is dispatched to hunt down and kill any survivors. The creatures and various obstacles prevent Leon and Claire from actually reuniting as they are forced to find a way to escape the city.\n\n=== Claire scenario ===\nClaire encounters a young girl, Sherry Birkin, who is being pursued by a monstrous creature. The two manage to escape into the police station parking garage, where corrupt Police Chief Brian Irons abducts Sherry, and locks her in an abandoned orphanage. Claire soon receives a call from Irons to trade Sherry for a pendant she had dropped during the abduction, threatening to kill the little girl if Claire does not comply. Reluctantly, Claire agrees to do so.\n\nSherry tries to escape on her own, but is soon cornered by Irons. Before Irons can harm her, the creature that had been chasing Sherry returns and implants Irons with a parasite. Claire arrives to save Sherry, and the parasite bursts out of Irons' chest, killing him. As Claire and Sherry attempt to leave, the Tyrant arrives and chases the pair into an elevator, but is killed by the creature stalking Sherry. The creature then tries to attack Claire and Sherry, but accidentally causes the elevator to fall into the sewers. The resulting impact knocks Claire unconscious, and Sherry is forced to abandon her to escape.\n\nClaire is found by Annette, Sherry's mother. Annette reveals that the creature after Sherry is William, her husband. The Birkins developed the G-Virus for Umbrella; however, William planned to sell it to the U.S. military. Umbrella sent its paramilitary force to confiscate his work, leading to William being fatally shot. To avoid death and vowing revenge, William had injected himself with the G-Virus. The infected William hunted down the Umbrella soldiers in the sewers. During the carnage he shattered vials of the T-virus the troops had taken, infecting sewer rats and indirectly causing the Raccoon City outbreak. Now a mindless mutating beast, the G-Virus drives William to infect Sherry, as she is the closest genetic match to William and thus the most suitable host to spread the infection.\n\nClaire finds Sherry trapped in a trash compactor by Annette. Upon reaching her, however, Sherry falls ill. Annette realizes William has already infected Sherry and has Claire bring her to an Umbrella lab called NEST, where a vaccine is stored. Once there, Claire uses Sherry's pendant to unlock the vaccine, but William attacks. Claire sends Annette to administer the vaccine while she fights William. After seemingly killing him, Claire reunites with Annette, who has managed to cure Sherry before dying from internal injuries. Sherry tearfully bids her mother goodbye. As the facility enacts a self-destruct protocol, Claire and Sherry make their way to an evacuation train. William returns yet again, and Claire defeats him just as the train prepares to leave. Upon boarding, Claire discovers Leon there as well.\n\n=== Leon scenario ===\nLeon is saved from an infected dog by FBI agent, [[Ada Wong]]. They find reporter Ben Bertolucci in the holding cells; imprisoned by Irons for investigating Umbrella. As Ben tries to convince Leon to release him, the Tyrant kills Ben. While attempting to escape the police station, Leon is intercepted by the Tyrant but is again saved by Ada. Leon pledges to help Ada retrieve a G-Virus sample to prove Umbrella's corruption.\n\nIn the sewers, Annette Birkin ambushes the pair and shoots at Ada; Leon takes the bullet and passes out. Ada pursues Annette but is knocked into a trash compactor. Leon rescues her, and they descend to NEST via cable car, where Ada kisses Leon.\n\nAda, injured, requests that Leon obtain the G sample. In Birkin's lab, Leon obtains a sample but is attacked by William. Annette tries to kill him, but is mortally wounded. Leon defeats William and tends to Annette, who claims that Ada is a mercenary and will sell the virus to the highest bidder.\n\nLeon confronts Ada as the lab's self-destruct protocol begins, where she admits to being a mercenary. Ada demands the G-Virus sample from Leon at gunpoint, but Annette shoots Ada before succumbing to her injuries. As Ada falls off the bridge; Leon catches her, letting the virus sample fall into the abyss. Leon loses his grip and Ada falls.\n\nAs Leon attempts to escape the lab, he is ambushed by the Tyrant, now transformed into the larger and more powerful Super Tyrant and engages it in a final battle. Ada, having survived the fall, tosses a rocket launcher to him, which Leon uses to finally destroy the Super Tyrant. Leon boards the evacuation train, discovering Claire and Sherry already aboard.\n\n=== Ending ===\nAfter Leon, Claire, and Sherry reunite, William attacks the train, having mutated into a gigantic putrid mass of fangs and flesh. Claire and Leon are almost killed in the fight, but manage to uncouple the carriage occupied by William. The carriage falls behind and is consumed by the exploding lab, destroying William once and for all. As the three survivors finally escape Raccoon City, they vow to continue the fight against Umbrella.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 police car at E3 2018.jpg|thumb|Promotional booth at [[E3 2018]]]]\nThe original ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' was released for the PlayStation in 1998.

This was the first [[Indianapolis 500]] fully sanctioned by the [[Indy Racing League]] after the IRL relied on [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] to sanction the 1996\u20131997 races. The race was part of the [[1998 Indy Racing League season|1998 Pep Boys Indy Racing League season]].\n\n[[Eddie Cheever, Jr.]], a former [[Formula One]] competitor and Indy rookie in [[1990 Indianapolis 500|1990]], highlighted his racing career with this lone Indianapolis win. Cheever finished three seconds ahead of second place [[Buddy Lazier]], the [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996]] winner. The 1998 race ushered in a compacted, two-week schedule for the Indy 500, omitting an entire week of practice, and trimming qualifying from four days down to two.\n\nDuring time trials, [[Billy Boat]] secured the first pole position at Indy for the [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises|Foyt team]] since 1975.\n\nThis was the first Indianapolis victory for the [[Dallara]] chassis. In the second year utilizing the 4.0 [[Litre|L]], [[Naturally aspirated engine|normally aspirated]], 32-[[Poppet valve|valve]] production-based engines ([[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]] [[Northstar engine series#L47|L47]] and [[Infiniti]] [[Nissan VH engine|VH]]), qualifying speeds climbed, topping out nearly six miles per hour faster than 1997.\n\nAs of 2020, this is the oldest running of the 500 in which all starting drivers are still living.\n\n==Schedule==\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=7|Race schedule \u2014 April, 1998\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Sun\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Mon\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Tue\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Wed\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Thu\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Fri\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Sat\n|-\n|12<br />&nbsp;\n|13<br />&nbsp;\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|14<br /><small>ROP</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|15<br /><small>ROP</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|16<br /><small>Open Test</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|17<br /><small>Open Test</small>\n|18<br />&nbsp;\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=7|Race schedule \u2014 May, 1998\n|-\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| 1<br />&nbsp;\n| 2<br /><small>[[OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon|Mini-Marathon]]</small>\n|-\n| 3<br />&nbsp;\n| 4<br />&nbsp;\n| 5<br />&nbsp;\n| 6<br />&nbsp;\n| 7<br />&nbsp;\n| 8<br />&nbsp;\n| 9<br />&nbsp;\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|10<br /><small>Opening Day</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|11<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|12<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|13<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|14<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|15<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#CFCFFF;\"|16<br /><small>Pole Day</small>\n|-\n|style=\"background:#CFCFFF;\"|17<br /><small>Bump Day</small>\n|18<br />&nbsp;\n|19<br />&nbsp;\n|20<br />&nbsp;\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|21<br /><small>Carb Day</small>\n|22<br />&nbsp;\n|23<br /><small>[[Indianapolis 500 traditions#500 Festival Parade|Parade]]</small>\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\"|24<br /><small>Indy 500</small>\n|25<br /><small>Memorial Day</small>\n|26<br />&nbsp;\n|27<br />&nbsp;\n|28<br />&nbsp;\n|29<br />&nbsp;\n|30<br />&nbsp;\n|-\n|31<br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{|\n|\n{| style=\"margin-right:0; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The two series began moving further apart, and for the second time, no major teams from the [[Champ Car|CART]] ranks entered at Indianapolis. CART teams raced on Saturday at the [[Emerson Indy 250|Motorola 300]].\n\n===Rule changes===\n*After controversy in 1997, the \"25/8 Rule\", which locked in entries to the starting field based on points standings, was scrapped for 1998. The 33-car field would revert to the traditional ''33 fastest'' qualifiers.\n\n*For 1998, the schedule for the month of May was trimmed down, in an effort to reduce costs. An experimental \"two-week\" schedule was proposed, consisting of one full week of practice, and two days of time trials. An open test was scheduled in April which also included rookie orientation.\n\n*During qualifying, once the field is filled to 33, cars that subsequently bump their way into the field on the second day of time trials (Bump Day) will at that moment be (tentatively) slotted in the 33rd starting position, regardless of their overall speed rank on the second day. Previously cars that bumped their way into the field lined up based on speed rank of the day they qualified. The change was made to encourage more cars qualifying on pole day. As a result, the field was lined up the order of: first day (pole day) qualifiers, followed by second day qualifiers (those that qualified before the field was filled to 33), followed by cars that bumped their way into the field on the second day.<ref name=\"Star05-18-1998\">{{cite news|title=The little engine that couldn't|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10510975/|first=Curt|last=Cavin|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=38|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 18, 1998|accessdate=April 24, 2017}}{{Open access}}</ref>\n\n*A new rule change for 1998 allowed cars to return to the garage area to make repairs and subsequently re-enter the race. Previously, all repairs (whether major or minor) had to be done in the pit area only. Prior to 1998, any car that crossed the entrance to Gasoline Alley was ruled out of the race, regardless of its condition. Likewise, any stalled car towed back to the garage area through escape roads in the infield (instead of around the track itself) was ruled out of the race, even if the issue was something as harmless as running out of fuel (that aspect of the rule was the source of controversy in the [[1972 Indianapolis 500#First half|1972 race]] with [[Jim Hurtubise]]). The repair rule change was made at the request of teams, which considered it a safety measure, as well as a fair way to allow more cars to finish the race. Pit crew members working for extended periods of time on the actual pit lane felt exposed to injuries/accidents from other cars entering and exiting the pits literally inches away. It also allowed them access to necessary tools and allowed them to make major repairs. This new rule was similar in practice to the policy that [[NASCAR]] had, where cars are allowed to \"go behind the wall\" to make repairs and re-enter the competition. A limit was enforced, however, such that no car could make repairs and re-enter the race after the leaders completed 190 laps.\n\n==Practice==\n\n===Sunday May 10===\nOpening day saw [[Mike Groff]] take the honor of \"first car on the track.\" Crashes during the day were suffered by [[Jack Hewitt]] and [[Jimmy Kite]], neither were serious. [[Robbie Buhl]] was the fastest car of the day, at 219.325&nbsp;mph.\n\n===Monday May 11===\n[[Tony Stewart]] led the speed chart, with a lap of 223.703&nbsp;mph. It was the fastest lap since the normally aspirated engine formula was adopted in 1997. Eight drivers in total broke the 200&nbsp;mph barrier.\n\n[[Danny Ongais]] suffered the most serious crash thus far for the month, and was sidelined with a concussion. [[Arie Luyendyk]], [[Mike Groff]], [[Raul Boesel]] and [[Tony Stewart]] all suffered mechanical problems, and required tows back to the garage area.\n\nOff the track, [[Eddie Cheever]] announced a sponsorship deal with [[Rachel's Gourmet Potato Chips]].\n\n===Tuesday May 12===\n[[Tony Stewart]] nearly matched his speed from a day before, with a fast lap of 223.691&nbsp;mph. Second best [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] was a full 2&nbsp;mph slower at 221.593&nbsp;mph.\n\nSunny skies, with temperatures in the 70s greeted the Speedway for the third day in a row.\n\n===Wednesday May 13===\nMoisture from an overnight shower delayed the start of practice for about a half-hour. [[Billy Boat]] took the honors for fastest of the day at 221.691&nbsp;mph, while [[Tony Stewart]] sat out the day. Temperatures topped out at 80 degrees late in the day.\n\n===Thursday May 14===\n[[Jimmy Kite]] suffered his second wall contact of the week, backing the car into the wall in turn 4. Another warm, 83 degree afternoon saw [[Tony Stewart]] once again on top of the speed chart (223.430&nbsp;mph).\n\n===\"Fast\" Friday May 15===\nThe final day of practice before pole day was warm, with a high of 81 degrees. [[Tony Stewart]] topped the speed chart with the fastest lap of the month (223.797&nbsp;mph). [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] and [[Billy Boat]] were also over 221&nbsp;mph.\n\nBoat, however, wrecked his primary car in turn 3 shortly after the 11 a.m. start. Also spinning in a separate incident (but not making contact) was [[Jack Hewitt]].\n\nAt the close of practice, [[Tony Stewart]] entered time trials as the favorite for the pole position. Stewart led the speed chart on four of the six days of practice (sitting out one day). [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises|Foyt]] drivers [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] and [[Billy Boat]] were also front row favorites, however, Boat's crash on Friday seemed to dim his chances.\n\n==Time trials==\n\n===Pole Day \u2013 Saturday May 16===\nPole day dawned sunny and clear, with temperatures in the high 70s. Qualifying started on-time promptly at 11 a.m., but saw two early wave-offs. The first two notable runs were put in by [[Robbie Buhl]] (220.236&nbsp;mph) and [[Tony Stewart]] (220.386&nbsp;mph), but the speeds were down from their expectations.\n\nAt noon, [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] took over the provisional pole with a run of 220.982&nbsp;mph. Minutes later, [[Jimmy Kite]] crashed for the third time of the week. At 12:45&nbsp;p.m., [[Billy Boat]] took to the track for his run. His first lap was a remarkable 224.573&nbsp;mph, the fastest lap of the month. The three other laps dropped off, but his four-lap average of 223.503&nbsp;mph was fast enough to secure the pole position.\n\nSixteen cars completed runs before the mid-afternoon down time. Around 4:15&nbsp;p.m., qualifying resumed, with drivers [[Scott Sharp]] and [[Eddie Cheever]] among those making the field. At 5:15&nbsp;p.m., [[Greg Ray]] squeezed onto the front row, as the second-fastest qualifier (221.125&nbsp;mph).\n\nAt the end of the day, the field was filled to 26 cars, after a record 42 qualifying attempts. Among the notables not yet in the field were [[Arie Luyendyk]], [[Lyn St. James]], and [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]]. Luyendyk suffered through engine trouble most of the day.\n\n[[Billy Boat]]'s unexpected speed in qualifying drew the attention of competitors, given that it occurred in the heat of the day, and it was 2\u00bd miles per hour faster than he had run all week. [[Team Menard]] threatened to protest, and accused [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises|Foyt Racing]] of cheating by illegally using [[nitrous]].<ref>{{Cite news \n| url =http://www.theautochannel.com/news/date/19980630/news014024.html\n| title =The Callahan Report: Tony Stewart's Team Owner Should Shut Up and Race\n| publisher =The Auto Channel\n| date = 1998-06-30\n| accessdate = 2009-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news \n| url =http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1998/jul/02/columnist-brian-hilderbrand-bahre-battling-lung-di/\n| title =Columnist Brian Hilderbrand: Bahre battling lung disease\n| publisher =Las Vegas Sun\n| date = 1998-07-02\n| accessdate = 2009-10-09}}</ref> The [[Indy Racing League]] took no action, and Boat was not penalized.\n\n===Bump Day \u2013 Sunday May 17===\nWith seven positions remaining in the field, the second and final day of time trials saw heavy activity. In the first hour, veterans [[Raul Boesel]], [[Arie Luyendyk]] and [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]] were among the early qualifiers. [[Scott Harrington (racing driver)|Scott Harrington]], however, blew an engine and wrecked on his second lap, which put a halt to qualifying for nearly 45 minutes.\n\nIn the heat of the day (1:52&nbsp;p.m.), [[Eliseo Salazar]] completed a run at 216.259&nbsp;mph, the second-slowest in the field. His run was followed by a long down-time, as teams waited for optimum conditions.\n\nAt 4:30&nbsp;p.m., qualifying resumed, and several cars took to the track. During the next hour, 13 attempts were made, but only 5 were run to completion. After three wrecks for the week, [[Jimmy Kite]] found the needed speed, and managed to fill the field to 33 cars at 4:55&nbsp;p.m. With [[Billy Roe]] (215.781&nbsp;mph) the first driver on the bubble, [[Mike Groff]] bumped him out at 5:23&nbsp;p.m. That put Eliseo Salazar (216.259&nbsp;mph) on the bubble. Minutes later, [[Billy Roe|Roe]] went back out and bumped his way back into the field. The move placed [[Johnny Unser]] (216.316&nbsp;mph) now on the bubble.\n\n[[Claude Bourbonnais]], [[Dan Drinan]], and [[Lyn St. James]] all fell short of Johnny Unser's speed, and failed to bump him out. With four minutes remaining, [[Eliseo Salazar]] scrambled into [[Stan Wattles]]' back-up car, but managed only 211&nbsp;mph on the first two laps. The car began smoking, and he was waved off. The 6 o'clock gun fired with [[Hideshi Matsuda]] waiting in line.\n\nWith Lyn St. James having failed to qualify, the 500 had an all-male field for the first time since [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991]].\n\n===Carb Day - Thursday May 21===\nThe final practice session saw the Foyt entries of [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] and [[Billy Boat]] top the speed chart. Br\u00e4ck (220.994&nbsp;mph) was the only driver over 220&nbsp;mph. No incidents were reported, but [[Stan Wattles]] twice stalled on the track with mechanical problems.\n\n[[Panther Racing]] with driver [[Scott Goodyear]] won the Coors Indy Pit Stop Challenge.\n\n==Starting grid==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!Row\n!colspan=2 width=\"195\"|Inside\n!colspan=2 width=\"195\"|Middle\n!colspan=2 width=\"195\"|Outside\n|-\n!1\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''11''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Billy Boat]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''97''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Greg Ray]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''14''' \n|{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]\n|-\n!2\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''1''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tony Stewart]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''3''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Robbie Buhl]] \n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''99''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Sam Schmidt]]\n|-\n!3\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''8''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Scott Sharp]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''6''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Davey Hamilton]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''21''' \n|{{flagicon|COL}} [[Roberto Guerrero]]\n|-\n!4\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''4''' \n|{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Scott Goodyear]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''91''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Buddy Lazier]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''28''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mark Dismore]]\n|-\n!5\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''44''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[J.

While track drying efforts were on-going, a dog sneaked out onto the track in turn four, and began running down the pit lane. It eluded officials, and ran all the way to turn two before being caught. [[Mari Hulman George]] gave the command to start engines at 11:32&nbsp;a.m. EST, and the field pulled away for the parade laps.\n\n===Start===\nAt the start, [[Eddie Cheever]] got loose in turn one, and pitched [[J. J. Yeley]] down to the inside. Yeley did a half-spin in turn one, and made slight contact with Cheever. Cheever continued unharmed while Yeley managed to control and stop the car without hitting the wall. Yeley's engine stalled, and he lost a lap before while we awaited a restart by safety crews.\n\nAt the front of the pack, [[Billy Boat]] led the first dozen laps. On lap 13, [[Greg Ray]] took over the lead, with [[Tony Stewart]] charging in third. On lap 21, [[Robbie Buhl]] became hung up in traffic, and Stewart dove into the lead down the main stretch. One lap later, however, Stewart's engine blew and the car coasted to a stop in turn one. A dejected Stewart, suffering misfortune in his third straight \"500\", blurted out on live television \"This has been my number one goal; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLFffCsOaZg every year I get shit on.\"]\n\n===First half===\n[[Robbie Buhl]] (Stewart's teammate) also blew an engine, dropping out on lap 45. As the green came out on lap 49, a major crash occurred in turn 3. Several cars were running two-wide as they approached turn three. [[Sam Schmidt]], running inside of [[Davey Hamilton]], got into the grass, lost control, and spun backwards into the turn three wall. [[Eddie Cheever]], immediately behind, slipped underneath, and escaped the incident. [[Stan Wattles]] ran into the back of [[Mark Dismore]], and they collected [[Roberto Guerrero]]. [[Billy Roe]] was left with nowhere to go, and was caught up in the incident. [[Jim Guthrie (racing driver)|Jim Guthrie]] then approached the scene and ran over debris, which caused the car to pinch down and cut through the grass. He hit an errant rear wing, and the car shot head-on into the outside wall. Guthrie was transported to [[Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis|Methodist Hospital]] with a broken elbow, broken leg, and cracked ribs.\n \nAfter a long yellow flag, and series of pit stops, [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] and [[Eddie Cheever]] worked into their lead, with [[Arie Luyendyk]] and [[Buddy Lazier]] also amongst the top five.\n\n===Second half===\n[[John Paul, Jr. (racing driver)|John Paul, Jr.]] took the lead at the halfway point, and traded the lead with [[Eddie Cheever]] over the next 50 laps. After earlier gearbox troubles, [[Billy Boat]] finally dropped out for good on lap 132, then [[Arie Luyendyk]] lost a clutch on lap 153.\n\nBy lap 160, [[Eddie Cheever]] led [[Buddy Lazier]] with rookie [[Steve Knapp]] the only other car on the lead lap. [[John Paul, Jr. (racing driver)|John Paul, Jr.]]'s chances for a win died when he stalled four times trying to exit the pits on lap 177. He lost three laps, and was in the pits for almost four minutes.\n\n===Finish===\nWith 17 laps to go, a restart saw [[Eddie Cheever|Cheever]] leading [[Buddy Lazier|Lazier]] by 1.1 seconds. Cheever stretched the lead to over 3 seconds, but another yellow on lap 191 was brought out by the smoking car of [[Marco Greco]].\n\nWith five laps to go, the green came back out, and Lazier was nose-to-tail with Cheever. Cheever held off the challenge, and stretched out to a 3.19-second margin to victory. [[Steve Knapp]], the only other driver to finish on the lead lap, was named [[Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year|rookie of the year]].\n\n==Box score==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Finish\n!Start\n!No\n!Name\n!Qual\n!Rank\n!C\n!E\n!T\n!Laps\n!Led\n!Status\n!Entrant\n|-\n!1\n|17\n|51\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Eddie Cheever]]\n|217.334\n|22\n|D\n|O\n|G\n|200\n|76\n|Running\n|[[Cheever Racing|Team Cheever]]\n|-\n!2\n|11\n|91\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Buddy Lazier]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|218.287\n|14\n|D\n|O\n|G\n|200\n|20\n|Running\n|[[Hemelgarn Racing]]\n|-\n!3\n|23\n|55\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Steve Knapp]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|216.445\n|31\n|G\n|O\n|G\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[ISM Racing]]\n|-\n!4\n|8\n|6\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Davey Hamilton]]\n|219.748\n|8\n|G\n|O\n|G\n|199\n|3\n|Running\n|[[Nienhouse Motorsports]]\n|-\n!5\n|21\n|52\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Robby Unser]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|216.533\n|29\n|D\n|O\n|G\n|198\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Cheever Racing|Team Cheever]]\n|-\n!6\n|3\n|14\n|{{Flagicon|SWE}} [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]\n|220.982\n|3\n|D\n|O\n|G\n|198\n|23\n|Running\n|[[A.

The network, previously known as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network, had changed its name for 1998, to reflect its coverage of the entire Indy Racing League season. At least 541 affiliates carried the broadcast across the United States.<ref>1998 Indianapolis 500 - Daily Trackside Report; pg. 105</ref>\n\n[[Bob Jenkins]] served as chief announcer for the ninth and final year. It would be Jenkins 20th and final year on the radio network crew (until his brief return in 2007-2008). In addition, Jerry Baker celebrated his milestone 25th year on the broadcast.\n\n[[Johnny Rutherford]] served as \"driver expert.\" [[WTHR]] sports director and Speedway public address announcer Dave Calabro joined the crew as a pit reporter, his lone radio network appearance.

[[Paul Page]] served as host and play-by-play announcer with [[Tom Sneva]] as analyst. Longtime color commentator [[Bobby Unser]] left ABC, while [[Danny Sullivan]] was reassigned to cover [[Champ Car|CART]] races exclusively and would no longer be with the broadcast. This would be Page's final 500 for the next three years. After the 1998 season, Page would move exclusively to [[Champ Car|CART]] series broadcasts while being replaced in 1999 by soon to be former voice of the 500 Bob Jenkins.\n\nFor the first time since the early 1980s, one of the pit reporters ([[Gary Gerould]]) rode in the pace car, reporting live at the start of the race. During the broadcast itself, [[Brent Musburger]] had a small role as ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' studio host.\n\nAt the track itself, the Speedway broadcast the race live on a special targeted signal, intended to be picked up by televisions sets within the radius of the grounds.

This was the first [[Indianapolis 500]] fully sanctioned by the [[Indy Racing League]] after the IRL relied on [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] to sanction the 1996\u20131997 races. The race was part of the [[1998 Indy Racing League season|1998 Pep Boys Indy Racing League season]].\n\n[[Eddie Cheever, Jr.]], a former [[Formula One]] competitor and Indy rookie in [[1990 Indianapolis 500|1990]], highlighted his racing career with this lone Indianapolis win. Cheever finished three seconds ahead of second place [[Buddy Lazier]], the [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996]] winner. The 1998 race ushered in a compacted, two-week schedule for the Indy 500, omitting an entire week of practice, and trimming qualifying from four days down to two.\n\nDuring time trials, [[Billy Boat]] secured the first pole position at Indy for the [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises|Foyt team]] since 1975.\n\nThis was the first Indianapolis victory for the [[Dallara]] chassis. In the second year utilizing the 4.0 [[Litre|L]], [[Naturally aspirated engine|normally aspirated]], 32-[[Poppet valve|valve]] production-based engines ([[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]] [[Northstar engine series#L47|L47]] and [[Infiniti]] [[Nissan VH engine|VH]]), qualifying speeds climbed, topping out nearly six miles per hour faster than 1997.\n\n==Schedule==\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=7|Race schedule \u2014 April, 1998\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Sun\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Mon\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Tue\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Wed\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Thu\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Fri\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Sat\n|-\n|12<br />&nbsp;\n|13<br />&nbsp;\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|14<br /><small>ROP</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|15<br /><small>ROP</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|16<br /><small>Open Test</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|17<br /><small>Open Test</small>\n|18<br />&nbsp;\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=7|Race schedule \u2014 May, 1998\n|-\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| 1<br />&nbsp;\n| 2<br /><small>[[OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon|Mini-Marathon]]</small>\n|-\n| 3<br />&nbsp;\n| 4<br />&nbsp;\n| 5<br />&nbsp;\n| 6<br />&nbsp;\n| 7<br />&nbsp;\n| 8<br />&nbsp;\n| 9<br />&nbsp;\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|10<br /><small>Opening Day</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|11<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|12<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|13<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|14<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|15<br /><small>Practice</small>\n|style=\"background:#CFCFFF;\"|16<br /><small>Pole Day</small>\n|-\n|style=\"background:#CFCFFF;\"|17<br /><small>Bump Day</small>\n|18<br />&nbsp;\n|19<br />&nbsp;\n|20<br />&nbsp;\n|style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\"|21<br /><small>Carb Day</small>\n|22<br />&nbsp;\n|23<br /><small>[[Indianapolis 500 traditions#500 Festival Parade|Parade]]</small>\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\"|24<br /><small>Indy 500</small>\n|25<br /><small>Memorial Day</small>\n|26<br />&nbsp;\n|27<br />&nbsp;\n|28<br />&nbsp;\n|29<br />&nbsp;\n|30<br />&nbsp;\n|-\n|31<br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n| <br />&nbsp;\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{|\n|\n{| style=\"margin-right:0; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The two series began moving further apart, and for the second time, no major teams from the [[Champ Car|CART]] ranks entered at Indianapolis. CART teams raced on Saturday at the [[Emerson Indy 250|Motorola 300]].\n\n===Rule changes===\n*After controversy in 1997, the \"25/8 Rule\", which locked in entries to the starting field based on points standings, was scrapped for 1998. The 33-car field would revert to the traditional ''33 fastest'' qualifiers.\n\n*For 1998, the schedule for the month of May was trimmed down, in an effort to reduce costs. An experimental \"two-week\" schedule was proposed, consisting of one full week of practice, and two days of time trials. An open test was scheduled in April which also included rookie orientation.\n\n*During qualifying, once the field is filled to 33, cars that subsequently bump their way into the field on the second day of time trials (Bump Day) will at that moment be (tentatively) slotted in the 33rd starting position, regardless of their overall speed rank on the second day. Previously cars that bumped their way into the field lined up based on speed rank of the day they qualified. The change was made to encourage more cars qualifying on pole day. As a result, the field was lined up the order of: first day (pole day) qualifiers, followed by second day qualifiers (those that qualified before the field was filled to 33), followed by cars that bumped their way into the field on the second day.<ref name=\"Star05-18-1998\">{{cite news|title=The little engine that couldn't|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10510975/|first=Curt|last=Cavin|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=38|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 18, 1998|accessdate=April 24, 2017}}{{Open access}}</ref>\n\n*A new rule change for 1998 allowed cars to return to the garage area to make repairs and subsequently re-enter the race. Previously, all repairs (whether major or minor) had to be done in the pit area only. Prior to 1998, any car that crossed the entrance to Gasoline Alley was ruled out of the race, regardless of its condition. Likewise, any stalled car towed back to the garage area through escape roads in the infield (instead of around the track itself) was ruled out of the race, even if the issue was something as harmless as running out of fuel (that aspect of the rule was the source of controversy in the [[1972 Indianapolis 500#First half|1972 race]] with [[Jim Hurtubise]]). The repair rule change was made at the request of teams, which considered it a safety measure, as well as a fair way to allow more cars to finish the race. Pit crew members working for extended periods of time on the actual pit lane felt exposed to injuries/accidents from other cars entering and exiting the pits literally inches away. It also allowed them access to necessary tools and allowed them to make major repairs. This new rule was similar in practice to the policy that [[NASCAR]] had, where cars are allowed to \"go behind the wall\" to make repairs and re-enter the competition. A limit was enforced, however, such that no car could make repairs and re-enter the race after the leaders completed 190 laps.\n\n==Practice==\n\n===Sunday May 10===\nOpening day saw [[Mike Groff]] take the honor of \"first car on the track.\" Crashes during the day were suffered by [[Jack Hewitt]] and [[Jimmy Kite]], neither were serious. [[Robbie Buhl]] was the fastest car of the day, at 219.325&nbsp;mph.\n\n===Monday May 11===\n[[Tony Stewart]] led the speed chart, with a lap of 223.703&nbsp;mph. It was the fastest lap since the normally aspirated engine formula was adopted in 1997. Eight drivers in total broke the 200&nbsp;mph barrier.\n\n[[Danny Ongais]] suffered the most serious crash thus far for the month, and was sidelined with a concussion. [[Arie Luyendyk]], [[Mike Groff]], [[Raul Boesel]] and [[Tony Stewart]] all suffered mechanical problems, and required tows back to the garage area.\n\nOff the track, [[Eddie Cheever]] announced a sponsorship deal with [[Rachel's Gourmet Potato Chips]].\n\n===Tuesday May 12===\n[[Tony Stewart]] nearly matched his speed from a day before, with a fast lap of 223.691&nbsp;mph. Second best [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] was a full 2&nbsp;mph slower at 221.593&nbsp;mph.\n\nSunny skies, with temperatures in the 70s greeted the Speedway for the third day in a row.\n\n===Wednesday May 13===\nMoisture from an overnight shower delayed the start of practice for about a half-hour. [[Billy Boat]] took the honors for fastest of the day at 221.691&nbsp;mph, while [[Tony Stewart]] sat out the day. Temperatures topped out at 80 degrees late in the day.\n\n===Thursday May 14===\n[[Jimmy Kite]] suffered his second wall contact of the week, backing the car into the wall in turn 4. Another warm, 83 degree afternoon saw [[Tony Stewart]] once again on top of the speed chart (223.430&nbsp;mph).\n\n===\"Fast\" Friday May 15===\nThe final day of practice before pole day was warm, with a high of 81 degrees. [[Tony Stewart]] topped the speed chart with the fastest lap of the month (223.797&nbsp;mph). [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] and [[Billy Boat]] were also over 221&nbsp;mph.\n\nBoat, however, wrecked his primary car in turn 3 shortly after the 11 a.m. start. Also spinning in a separate incident (but not making contact) was [[Jack Hewitt]].\n\nAt the close of practice, [[Tony Stewart]] entered time trials as the favorite for the pole position. Stewart led the speed chart on four of the six days of practice (sitting out one day). [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises|Foyt]] drivers [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] and [[Billy Boat]] were also front row favorites, however, Boat's crash on Friday seemed to dim his chances.\n\n==Time trials==\n\n===Pole Day \u2013 Saturday May 16===\nPole day dawned sunny and clear, with temperatures in the high 70s. Qualifying started on-time promptly at 11 a.m., but saw two early wave-offs. The first two notable runs were put in by [[Robbie Buhl]] (220.236&nbsp;mph) and [[Tony Stewart]] (220.386&nbsp;mph), but the speeds were down from their expectations.\n\nAt noon, [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] took over the provisional pole with a run of 220.982&nbsp;mph. Minutes later, [[Jimmy Kite]] crashed for the third time of the week. At 12:45&nbsp;p.m., [[Billy Boat]] took to the track for his run. His first lap was a remarkable 224.573&nbsp;mph, the fastest lap of the month. The three other laps dropped off, but his four-lap average of 223.503&nbsp;mph was fast enough to secure the pole position.\n\nSixteen cars completed runs before the mid-afternoon down time. Around 4:15&nbsp;p.m., qualifying resumed, with drivers [[Scott Sharp]] and [[Eddie Cheever]] among those making the field. At 5:15&nbsp;p.m., [[Greg Ray]] squeezed onto the front row, as the second-fastest qualifier (221.125&nbsp;mph).\n\nAt the end of the day, the field was filled to 26 cars, after a record 42 qualifying attempts. Among the notables not yet in the field were [[Arie Luyendyk]], [[Lyn St. James]], and [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]]. Luyendyk suffered through engine trouble most of the day.\n\n[[Billy Boat]]'s unexpected speed in qualifying drew the attention of competitors, given that it occurred in the heat of the day, and it was 2\u00bd miles per hour faster than he had run all week. [[Team Menard]] threatened to protest, and accused [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises|Foyt Racing]] of cheating by illegally using [[nitrous]].<ref>{{Cite news \n| url =http://www.theautochannel.com/news/date/19980630/news014024.html\n| title =The Callahan Report: Tony Stewart's Team Owner Should Shut Up and Race\n| publisher =The Auto Channel\n| date = 1998-06-30\n| accessdate = 2009-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news \n| url =http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1998/jul/02/columnist-brian-hilderbrand-bahre-battling-lung-di/\n| title =Columnist Brian Hilderbrand: Bahre battling lung disease\n| publisher =Las Vegas Sun\n| date = 1998-07-02\n| accessdate = 2009-10-09}}</ref> The [[Indy Racing League]] took no action, and Boat was not penalized.\n\n===Bump Day \u2013 Sunday May 17===\nWith seven positions remaining in the field, the second and final day of time trials saw heavy activity. In the first hour, veterans [[Raul Boesel]], [[Arie Luyendyk]] and [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]] were among the early qualifiers. [[Scott Harrington (racing driver)|Scott Harrington]], however, blew an engine and wrecked on his second lap, which put a halt to qualifying for nearly 45 minutes.\n\nIn the heat of the day (1:52&nbsp;p.m.), [[Eliseo Salazar]] completed a run at 216.259&nbsp;mph, the second-slowest in the field. His run was followed by a long down-time, as teams waited for optimum conditions.\n\nAt 4:30&nbsp;p.m., qualifying resumed, and several cars took to the track. During the next hour, 13 attempts were made, but only 5 were run to completion. After three wrecks for the week, [[Jimmy Kite]] found the needed speed, and managed to fill the field to 33 cars at 4:55&nbsp;p.m. With [[Billy Roe]] (215.781&nbsp;mph) the first driver on the bubble, [[Mike Groff]] bumped him out at 5:23&nbsp;p.m. That put Eliseo Salazar (216.259&nbsp;mph) on the bubble. Minutes later, [[Billy Roe|Roe]] went back out and bumped his way back into the field. The move placed [[Johnny Unser]] (216.316&nbsp;mph) now on the bubble.\n\n[[Claude Bourbonnais]], [[Dan Drinan]], and [[Lyn St. James]] all fell short of Johnny Unser's speed, and failed to bump him out. With four minutes remaining, [[Eliseo Salazar]] scrambled into [[Stan Wattles]]' back-up car, but managed only 211&nbsp;mph on the first two laps. The car began smoking, and he was waved off. The 6 o'clock gun fired with [[Hideshi Matsuda]] waiting in line.\n\nWith Lyn St. James having failed to qualify, the 500 had an all-male field for the first time since [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991]].\n\n===Carb Day - Thursday May 21===\nThe final practice session saw the Foyt entries of [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] and [[Billy Boat]] top the speed chart. Br\u00e4ck (220.994&nbsp;mph) was the only driver over 220&nbsp;mph. No incidents were reported, but [[Stan Wattles]] twice stalled on the track with mechanical problems.\n\n[[Panther Racing]] with driver [[Scott Goodyear]] won the Coors Indy Pit Stop Challenge.\n\n==Starting grid==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!Row\n!colspan=2 width=\"195\"|Inside\n!colspan=2 width=\"195\"|Middle\n!colspan=2 width=\"195\"|Outside\n|-\n!1\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''11''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Billy Boat]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''97''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Greg Ray]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''14''' \n|{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]\n|-\n!2\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''1''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tony Stewart]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''3''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Robbie Buhl]] \n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''99''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Sam Schmidt]]\n|-\n!3\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''8''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Scott Sharp]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''6''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Davey Hamilton]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''21''' \n|{{flagicon|COL}} [[Roberto Guerrero]]\n|-\n!4\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''4''' \n|{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Scott Goodyear]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''91''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Buddy Lazier]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''28''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mark Dismore]]\n|-\n!5\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''44''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[J.

While track drying efforts were on-going, a dog sneaked out onto the track in turn four, and began running down the pit lane. It eluded officials, and ran all the way to turn two before being caught. [[Mari Hulman George]] gave the command to start engines at 11:32&nbsp;a.m. EST, and the field pulled away for the parade laps.\n\n===Start===\nAt the start, [[Eddie Cheever]] got loose in turn one, and pitched [[J. J. Yeley]] down to the inside. Yeley did a half-spin in turn one, and made slight contact with Cheever. Cheever continued unharmed while Yeley managed to control and stop the car without hitting the wall. Yeley's engine stalled, and he lost a lap before while we awaited a restart by safety crews.\n\nAt the front of the pack, [[Billy Boat]] led the first dozen laps. On lap 13, [[Greg Ray]] took over the lead, with [[Tony Stewart]] charging in third. On lap 21, [[Robbie Buhl]] became hung up in traffic, and Stewart dove into the lead down the main stretch. One lap later, however, Stewart's engine blew and the car coasted to a stop in turn one. A dejected Stewart, suffering misfortune in his third straight \"500\", blurted out on live television \"This has been my number one goal; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLFffCsOaZg every year I get shit on.\"]\n\n===First half===\n[[Robbie Buhl]] (Stewart's teammate) also blew an engine, dropping out on lap 45. As the green came out on lap 49, a major crash occurred in turn 3. Several cars were running two-wide as they approached turn three. [[Sam Schmidt]], running inside of [[Davey Hamilton]], got into the grass, lost control, and spun backwards into the turn three wall. [[Eddie Cheever]], immediately behind, slipped underneath, and escaped the incident. [[Stan Wattles]] ran into the back of [[Mark Dismore]], and they collected [[Roberto Guerrero]]. [[Billy Roe]] was left with nowhere to go, and was caught up in the incident. [[Jim Guthrie (racing driver)|Jim Guthrie]] then approached the scene and ran over debris, which caused the car to pinch down and cut through the grass. He hit an errant rear wing, and the car shot head-on into the outside wall. Guthrie was transported to [[Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis|Methodist Hospital]] with a broken elbow, broken leg, and cracked ribs.\n \nAfter a long yellow flag, and series of pit stops, [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] and [[Eddie Cheever]] worked into their lead, with [[Arie Luyendyk]] and [[Buddy Lazier]] also amongst the top five.\n\n===Second half===\n[[John Paul, Jr. (racing driver)|John Paul, Jr.]] took the lead at the halfway point, and traded the lead with [[Eddie Cheever]] over the next 50 laps. After earlier gearbox troubles, [[Billy Boat]] finally dropped out for good on lap 132, then [[Arie Luyendyk]] lost a clutch on lap 153.\n\nBy lap 160, [[Eddie Cheever]] led [[Buddy Lazier]] with rookie [[Steve Knapp]] the only other car on the lead lap. [[John Paul, Jr. (racing driver)|John Paul, Jr.]]'s chances for a win died when he stalled four times trying to exit the pits on lap 177. He lost three laps, and was in the pits for almost four minutes.\n\n===Finish===\nWith 17 laps to go, a restart saw [[Eddie Cheever|Cheever]] leading [[Buddy Lazier|Lazier]] by 1.1 seconds. Cheever stretched the lead to over 3 seconds, but another yellow on lap 191 was brought out by the smoking car of [[Marco Greco]].\n\nWith five laps to go, the green came back out, and Lazier was nose-to-tail with Cheever. Cheever held off the challenge, and stretched out to a 3.19-second margin to victory. [[Steve Knapp]], the only other driver to finish on the lead lap, was named [[Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year|rookie of the year]].\n\n==Box score==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Finish\n!Start\n!No\n!Name\n!Qual\n!Rank\n!C\n!E\n!T\n!Laps\n!Led\n!Status\n!Entrant\n|-\n!1\n|17\n|51\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Eddie Cheever]]\n|217.334\n|22\n|D\n|O\n|G\n|200\n|76\n|Running\n|[[Cheever Racing|Team Cheever]]\n|-\n!2\n|11\n|91\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Buddy Lazier]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|218.287\n|14\n|D\n|O\n|G\n|200\n|20\n|Running\n|[[Hemelgarn Racing]]\n|-\n!3\n|23\n|55\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Steve Knapp]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|216.445\n|31\n|G\n|O\n|G\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[ISM Racing]]\n|-\n!4\n|8\n|6\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Davey Hamilton]]\n|219.748\n|8\n|G\n|O\n|G\n|199\n|3\n|Running\n|[[Nienhouse Motorsports]]\n|-\n!5\n|21\n|52\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Robby Unser]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|216.533\n|29\n|D\n|O\n|G\n|198\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Cheever Racing|Team Cheever]]\n|-\n!6\n|3\n|14\n|{{Flagicon|SWE}} [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]\n|220.982\n|3\n|D\n|O\n|G\n|198\n|23\n|Running\n|[[A.

The network, previously known as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network, had changed its name for 1998, to reflect its coverage of the entire Indy Racing League season. At least 541 affiliates carried the broadcast across the United States.<ref>1998 Indianapolis 500 - Daily Trackside Report; pg. 105</ref>\n\n[[Bob Jenkins]] served as chief announcer for the ninth and final year. It would be Jenkins 20th and final year on the radio network crew (until his brief return in 2007-2008). In addition, Jerry Baker celebrated his milestone 25th year on the broadcast.\n\n[[Johnny Rutherford]] served as \"driver expert.\" [[WTHR]] sports director and Speedway public address announcer Dave Calabro joined the crew as a pit reporter, his lone radio network appearance. This was also Gary Lee's final year on the radio network.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|Indy Racing Radio Network]] \n|-\n!Booth Announcers!!Turn Reporters!![[Sideline reporter|Pit/garage reporters]]\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n'''[[Play-by-play|Chief Announcer]]:''' [[Bob Jenkins]]<br />\n'''Driver expert:''' [[Johnny Rutherford]]<br />\n'''[[Statistician]]:''' Howdy Bell<br />\n'''[[Historian]]:''' [[Donald Davidson (historian)|Donald Davidson]]<br />\n'''Commentary:''' [[Chris Economaki]]<br />\n|valign=\"top\"|\n'''Turn 1:''' [[Jerry Baker (announcer)|Jerry Baker]]<br />    \n'''Turn 2:''' Ken Double<br />\n'''Turn 3:''' Gary Lee<br />\n'''Turn 4:''' [[Bob Lamey]]<br />\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Mark Jaynes (north pits)<br />Dave Calabro (center pits)<br />[[Vince Welch]] (south pits)<br />Chuck Marlowe (garages)<br />\n|}\n\n===Television===\nThe race was carried live flag-to-flag coverage in the United States on [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]]. [[Paul Page]] served as host and play-by-play announcer with [[Tom Sneva]] as analyst. Longtime color commentator [[Bobby Unser]] left ABC, while [[Danny Sullivan]] was reassigned to cover [[Champ Car|CART]] races exclusively and would no longer be with the broadcast. This would be Page's final 500 for the next three years. After the 1998 season, Page would move exclusively to [[Champ Car|CART]] series broadcasts while being replaced in 1999 by soon to be former voice of the 500 Bob Jenkins.\n\nFor the first time since the early 1980s, one of the pit reporters ([[Gary Gerould]]) rode in the pace car, reporting live at the start of the race. During the broadcast itself, [[Brent Musburger]] had a small role as ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' studio host.\n\nAt the track itself, the Speedway broadcast the race live on a special targeted signal, intended to be picked up by televisions sets within the radius of the grounds. This was the first and only time this special signal has been used.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|[[ESPN on ABC|ABC]] [[List of Indianapolis 500 broadcasters|Television]]\n|-\n!Booth Announcers!![[Sideline reporter|Pit/garage reporters]]\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n'''Host/[[Play-by-play|Announcer]]:''' [[Paul Page]]<br />\n'''[[Color commentator|Color]]:''' [[Tom Sneva]]<br />\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|[[Jack Arute]]<br />[[Gary Gerould]]<br />[[Jerry Punch|Dr. Jerry Punch]]\n|}\n\nPractice and time trials were carried over three networks: [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]], [[ESPN]], and [[ESPN2]]. \n*Live Daily Reports (ESPN2): Paul Page, Jon Beekhuis, Jerry Punch, Jack Arute, Gary Gerould\n*Time trials ([[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]): Paul Page, Tom Sneva, Jack Arute, Gary Gerould, Brent Musberger (studio host)\n*Time trials ([[ESPN]]/[[ESPN2]]): Paul Page, Jon Beekhuis, Jerry Punch, Gary Gerould\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Commons category|1998 Indianapolis 500}}\n<gallery>\nImage:Indy500pacecar1998.JPG|1998 Chevrolet Corvette pace car\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*''1998 Indianapolis 500 Daily Trackside Report for the Media''\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120427163136/https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/history/stats/ Indianapolis 500 History: Race & All-Time Stats] - Official Site\n*1998 Indianapolis 500 Radio Broadcast, [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]]\n\n\n{{American Championship Car race report footer\n|Series = Indy Racing League\n| Name_of_race            = [[Indianapolis 500]]\n| Year_of_race            = 1998\n| Previous_race_in_season = [[1998 Dura Lube 200]]\n| Next_race_in_season     = [[1998 True Value 500]]\n| Previous_year's_race    = [[1997 Indianapolis 500]]\n| Next_year's_race        = [[1999 Indianapolis 500]]\n}}\n\n{{Indy 500}}\n{{IndyCar Series Seasons}}\n{{IndyCar Series on ABC}}\n\n[[Category:Indianapolis 500 races]]\n[[Category:1998 in IndyCar|Indianapolis 500]]\n[[Category:1998 in motorsport|Indianapolis 500]]\n[[Category:1998 in American motorsport|Indianapolis 500]]\n[[Category:1998 in sports in Indiana|Indianapolis 500]]\n[[Category:May 1998 sports events in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "SincerelySteve", "label": "safe", "comment": "Oldest 500 with all starters living in 2020", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Indianapolis_500"}
