She saw marriage as limiting her choices, although her wedding financially allowed her to be a writer. She believed in raising women's education, and that the education they had been receiving was inferior to men's, making women less capable than they could be. She believed that, with better education, women would have substantial political capabilities to a degree considered \"non-traditional\", but without that education they'd be only as men imagined all women to be, the suppliers of men's and children's \"material needs\". \"[S]he implied ... [that] women and men might well be true equals.\" She believed there had been \"women's supremacy ... [in] pre-revolutionary France, when powerful women never attempted to compete directly with men, but instead drew strength from other areas where they excelled. She favoured women being allowed to vote and favoured keeping the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland#Government|British Parliamentary system]] for the benefit of both women and men, although doubted that voting would provide everything women needed, and thus did not join the [[Women's suffrage|suffrage movement]]. In the 1920s, \"her views on women had become more conservative\", and she made them secondary to her conspiracy writing.<ref>Lee, Martha F.
