Former Christian Democrats are also spread among other parties, including the centre-right [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] and the centre-left [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].\n\nThe DC was a founding member of the [[European People's Party]] in 1976.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nThe party was founded as the revival of the [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI), a political party created in 1919 by [[Luigi Sturzo]], a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest.<ref name=\"Padovani2007\">{{cite book|author=Cinzia Padovani|title=A Fatal Attraction: Public Television and Politics in Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMsiP1HibrkC&pg=PA259|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1950-3|page=259}}</ref> The PPI won over 20% of the votes in the [[1919 Italian general election|1919]] and [[1921 Italian general election|1921 general elections]], but was declared illegal by the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] dictatorship in 1926 despite the presence of some ''Popolari'' in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s first government.\n\nAs [[World War II]] was ending, the Christian Democrats started organizing post-Fascist Italy in coalition with all the other mainstream parties, including the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), the [[Italian Liberal Party]] (PLI), the [[Italian Republican Party]] (PRI), the [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] (Pd'A) and the [[Labour Democratic Party]] (PDL). In December 1945 Christian Democrat [[Alcide De Gasperi]] was appointed [[Prime Minister of Italy]].\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party was used in response to Fascist Italy and used as a mechanism of opposition to communism. The April 18 elections in 1948 were used for and against Communism and the Marshall Plan.

This opened the way for a [[Centrism (Italy)|centrist coalition]] that included the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party|Italian Workers' Socialist Party]] (PSLI), a centrist break-away from the PSI, as well as its usual allies, the PLI and the PRI.\n\nIn the [[1948 Italian general election|1948 general election]] the DC went on to win a decisive victory, with the support of the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[United States]], and obtained 48.5% of the vote, its best result ever. Despite his party's absolute majority in the [[Italian Parliament]], De Gasperi continued to govern at the head of the centrist coalition, which was successively abandoned by the Liberals, who hoped for more right-wing policies, in 1950 and the Democratic Socialists, who hoped for more leftist policies, in 1951.\n\nUnder De Gasperi, major land reforms were carried out in the poorer rural regions in the early postwar years, with farms appropriated from the large landowners and parcelled out to the peasants. In addition, during its years in office, Christian Democrats passed a number of laws safeguarding employees from exploitation, established a national health service, and initiated low-cost housing in Italy\u2019s major cities.<ref>Italy: Library of Nations: Italy, Time-Life Books, 1985</ref>\n\nDe Gasperi served as Prime Minister until 1953 and would die a year later. No Christian Democrat would match his longevity in office and, despite the fact that DC's share of vote was always between 38 and 43% from [[1953 Italian general election|1953]] to [[1979 Italian general election|1979]], the party was more and more fractious. As a result, Prime Ministers changed more frequently.\n\n===Centre-left governments===\n[[File:Amintore Fanfani Senato.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Amintore Fanfani]]]]\n[[File:Aldo Moro headshot.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Aldo Moro]]]]\n\nFrom 1954 the DC was led by progressive Christian Democrats, such as [[Amintore Fanfani]], [[Aldo Moro]] and [[Benigno Zaccagnini]], supported by the influential left-wing factions. In the 1950s the party formed centrist or moderately centre-left coalitions, and even a short-lived government led by [[Fernando Tambroni]] relying on parliamentary support from the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), the post-fascist party.\n\nIn 1963 the party, under Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]], formed a coalition with the PSI, which returned to ministerial roles after 16 years, the PSDI and the PRI. Similar \"[[Organic Centre-left]]\" governments became usual through the 1960s and the 1970s.<ref name=\"Botsiou\">{{cite book|author=Konstantina E.

Moro, who was the party main leader and who had inspired the Compromise, was [[Kidnapping of Aldo Moro|abducted and murdered]] by the [[Red Brigades]].\n\nThe event was a shock for the party. When Moro was abducted, the government, at the time led by [[Giulio Andreotti]], immediately took a hardline position stating that the \"State must not bend\" on terrorist demands. This was a very different position from the one kept in similar cases before (such as the [[kidnapping of Ciro Cirillo]], a [[Campania]]n DC member for whom a ransom was paid thanks to the local ties of the party with [[Camorra]]). It was however supported by all the mainstream parties, including the PCI, with the two notable exceptions of the PSI and the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radicals]]. In the trial for [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] allegations against Andreotti, it was said that he took the chance of getting rid of a dangerous political competitor by sabotaging all of the rescue options and ultimately leaving the captors with no option but killing him.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Francesco Pecorelli|author2=Sommella Roberto|title=I veleni di OP|url=http://www.rifondazione-cinecitta.org/pecorelli-dallachiesa.html|publisher=KAOS Edizioni|language=Italian|access-date=19 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618130605/http://www.rifondazione-cinecitta.org/pecorelli-dallachiesa.html|archive-date=18 June 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> During his captivity Moro wrote a series of letters, at times very critical of Andreotti.<ref>[http://www.apolis.com/moro/moro/lettere/indice.htm Yepa - Dedicated Hosting Solutions].

In the successive [[1983 Italian general election|1983 general election]] DC suffered one of its largest declines in terms of votes at that point, receiving only 32.5% of the vote cast (-5.8%). Subsequently, [[Bettino Craxi]] (leader of the rising PSI) reclaimed for himself the post of Prime Minister, again at the head of a ''Pentapartito'' government.\n\nDC re-gained the post of Prime Minister in 1987, after a mild recovery in the [[1987 Italian general election|1987 general election]] (34.2%), and the ''Pentapartito'' coalition governed Italy almost continuously until 1993. While Italy experienced continuous economic progress in the 1980s, the Italian economy was being undermined by constant devaluation of the [[Italian lira]] and the issuing of excessive amounts of high-interest treasury bonds, so that, between 1982 and 1992, the excessive [[Government budget deficit|budget deficit]] built half of the debt still plaguing the country today.\n\n===Dissolution===\nIn 1992 the ''[[Mani pulite]]'' investigation was started in [[Milan]], uncovering the so-called ''Tangentopoli'' scandals (endemic corruption practices at the highest levels), and causing (often controversial) arrests and resignations. After the dismal result in the [[1992 Italian general election|1992 general election]] (29.7%), also due to the rise of [[Lega Nord]] in [[northern Italy]], and two years of mounting scandals (which included several Mafia investigations which notably touched Andreotti), the party was disbanded in 1994. In the 1990s most of the politicians prosecuted during those investigations were acquitted, sometimes however on the basis of legal formalities or on the basis of [[statute of limitations|statutory time limit]] rules.\n\nThe DC suffered heavy defeats in the 1993 provincial and municipal elections and the subsequent split of the [[Mario Segni]]'s [[Segni Pact|Pact]], and polling suggested heavy losses in the upcoming [[1994 Italian general election|1994 general election]]. In hopes of changing the party's image, the DC's last secretary, [[Mino Martinazzoli]] decided to change the name of the party into [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI). [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]], representing the right-wing faction of the party (previously led by Forlani) decided to launch a new party called [[Christian Democratic Centre]] and form an alliance with [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s new party, [[Forza Italia]] (FI). The left-wing factions stayed within the new PPI (albeit a minority which had formed the [[Social Christians]] in 1993 and would join forces with the post-communist [[Democratic Party of the Left]]), while some right-wingers joined [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]. In 1995 the PPI split in two, the PPI and the centre-right [[United Christian Democrats]], which were led by [[Rocco Buttiglione]] and also entered in alliance with FI. In the following years, most Christian Democrats joined FI, which became the party with the most ex-DC members in absolute terms and joined the [[European People's Party]].\n\n==Ideology==\n[[File:Propaganda Dc.jpg|thumb|right|[[Propaganda]] posters of the DC: they described to potential voters the party's commitment to [[anti-communism]] (in the left poster), [[traditional values|traditionalism]] (in the centre poster), and [[family values]] (in the right poster). Note the use of symbols, especially the crossed shield (representing the DC) protecting [[Italy]] (represented by [[Italia Turrita]]) from the [[Communism|communist]] [[hammer and sickle]] symbol being used as a weapon in the left poster.|360px]]\n\nThe party's ideological sources were principally to be found in [[Catholic social teaching]], the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] doctrines developed from the 19th century and on (see [[Christian democracy]]), the political thought of [[Romolo Murri]] and [[Luigi Sturzo]] and ultimately in the tradition of the defunct [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]]. Two [[Papacy|Papal]] [[encyclical]]s, ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891) of [[Pope Leo XIII]], and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (1931) of [[Pope Pius XI]], offered a basis for social and political doctrine.\n\nIn [[economics]] the DC preferred [[competition]] to [[cooperation]], supported the model of [[social market economy]] and rejected the [[Marxism|Marxist]]'s idea of [[class struggle]]. The party thus advocated collaboration between [[social class]]es and was basically a [[big tent|catch-all party]] which aimed to represent all Italian Catholics, both right-wing and left-wing, under the principle of the \"political unity of Catholics\" against [[socialism]], [[communism]] and [[anarchism]]. It ultimately represented the majority of Italians who were opposed to the [[Italian Communist Party]]. The party was however originally equidistant between the Communists and the hard right represented by the [[Italian Social Movement]].\n\nAs a catch-all party, the DC differed from other European Christian Democratic parties, such as the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] that were mainly [[Conservatism|conservative]] parties, with DC comprising conservative as well as [[social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[liberalism|liberal]] elements. The party was thus divided in many factions and party life was characterised by factionalism and by the double adherence of members to the party and the factions, often identified with individual leaders.\n\n==Factions==\nThe DC was characterised by a number of factions, spanning from left to right and evolving all the time.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.storiadc.it/correnti.html | title=Democrazia Cristiana - Correnti}}</ref>\n\nThe original [[centrism|centrist]] and [[liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], [[Giuseppe Pella]], [[Ezio Vanoni]] and [[Mario Scelba]], was soon replaced by the progressives led by [[Amintore Fanfani]]. They were opposed to a right wing whose main leader was [[Antonio Segni]]. The party's left wing, with its roots in the left of the late [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] ([[Giovanni Gronchi]], [[Achille Grandi]] and controversial [[Fernando Tambroni]]), was reinforced by new leaders such as [[Giuseppe Dossetti]], [[Giorgio La Pira]], [[Giuseppe Lazzati]] and Fanfani himself. Most of them were social democrats by European standards.\n\nThe party was often led by centrist figures unaffiliated to any faction such as [[Aldo Moro]], [[Mariano Rumor]] (both closer to the centre-left) and [[Giulio Andreotti]] (closer to the centre-right). Moreover, often, if the government was led by a centre-right Christian Democrat, the party was led by a left-winger and vice versa. This was what happened in the 1950s when Fanfani was party secretary and the government was led by centre-right figures such as Scelba and Segni and in the late 1970s when [[Benigno Zaccagnini]], a progressive, led the party and Andreotti the government: this custom, in clear contrast with the principles of a [[Westminster system]], deeply weakened DC-led governments, that even with great majorities were de facto unable to conciliate the several factions of the party, and ultimately the office of [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] (defined by the [[Constitution of Italy]] as a ''primus inter pares'' among ministers), turning the Italian party system into a [[particracy]] (''partitocrazia'').\n\nFrom the 1980s the party was divided between the centre-right led by [[Arnaldo Forlani]] (supported also by the party's right wing) and the centre-left led by [[Ciriaco de Mita]] (whose supporters included [[trade union]]ists and the internal left), with Andreotti holding the balance. De Mita, who led the party from 1982 to 1989, curiously tried to transform the party into a mainstream \"conservative party\" in line with the [[European People's Party]] in order to preserve party unity. He was replaced by Forlani in 1989, after that becoming Prime Minister in 1988. Disagreements between de Mita and Forlani brought Andreotti back to prime-ministership from 1989 to 1992.\n\nWith the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the end of great ideologies and ultimately the ''Tangentopoli'' scandals, the heterogeneous nature of the party led it to its collapse. The bulk of the DC joined the new [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI), but immediately several centre-right elements led by [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]] joined the [[Christian Democratic Centre]] (CCD), while others directly joined [[Forza Italia]]. A split from the PPI, the [[United Christian Democrats]] (CDU), joined Forza Italia and the CCD in the centre-right [[Pole of Freedoms]] coalition (later becoming the [[Pole for Freedoms]]), while the PPI was a founding member of [[The Olive Tree (Italy)|The Olive Tree]] centre-left coalition in 1996.\n\n==Popular support==\nIn its early years the party was stronger in [[Northern Italy]], and especially in eastern [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]], due to the strong [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] roots of that areas, than in the [[Southern Italy|South]], where the [[Liberals (Italy)|Liberal]] establishment that had governed Italy for decades before the rise of [[Benito Mussolini]] had still a grip on voters, as also the [[Monarchist National Party]] and the [[Common Man's Front]] did. The DC was very weak in [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Central Italy]], where the [[Italian Communist Party]] was the dominant political force.\n\nIn the [[1948 Italian general election|1948 general election]] the party had its best result ever (48.5%) and the [[absolute majority]] in the [[Italian Parliament]]. The party won 66.8% in eastern Lombardy (73.6% in the [[Province of Bergamo]]), 60.5% in Veneto (71.9% in the [[Province of Vicenza]]), 69.6% in [[Trentino]] and 57.8% in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], that is to say where the late [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] had its strongholds. In the Centre-South the DC gained more than 50% of the vote in [[Lazio]] (51.9%), [[Abruzzo]] (53.7%) and [[Campania]] (50.5%).\n\nFrom the late 1950s the DC started to move South and by the 1980s it was stronger in the South than in the North, with the exception of Veneto, which remained one of the party's strongholds. In the [[1983 Italian general election|1983 general election]] the party suffered a dramatic decrease in term of votes and its electoral geography was very different from 30 or even 10 years before, as the region where it obtained the best result was [[Apulia]] (46.0%).\n\nIn the [[1992 Italian general election|1992 general election]] the shift was even more evident as the party was over the 40% mark only in some Southern regions (41.1% in [[Campania]], 44.5 in [[Basilicata]] and 41.2% in [[Sicily]]), while it barely reached 20-25% of the vote in the North. As a result of the rise of [[Lega Nord]], which was stronger precisely in the traditional Christian Democratic heartlands, the DC was reduced to 21.0% in [[Piedmont]] (with the League at 16.3%), 32.1% in western Lombardy (League at 25.2%), 31.7% in Veneto (League at 17.3%) and 28.0% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (League at 17.0%).\n\nAs the DC's role was ended, the 1919 PPI strongholds and the DC's traditional heartlands were to become Lega Nord's power base, while the successor parties of the DC continued to be key political actors only in the South, where the clientelistic way of government practised by the Christian Democrats and their allies had left a mark. In the [[1996 Italian general election|1996 general election]] the League gained 7 out of 8 single-seat constituencies in the Province of Bergamo and 5 out of 6 in the Province of Vicenza, winning well over 40%, while the combined score of the three main post-DC parties (the new [[Italian People's Party (1994)|PPI]], the [[Christian Democratic Centre|CCD]] and the [[United Christian Democrats|CDU]]) was highest in [[Campania]] (22.3%). In the [[1996 Sicilian regional election]] the combined score of those parties was 26.4%.<ref>Piergiorgio Corbetta; Maria Serena Piretti, ''Atlante storico-elettorale d'Italia'', Zanichelli, [[Bologna]] 2009</ref><ref name=\"Interno\">[http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tp=C Ministero dell'Interno.

In the 1960s scandals involved frauds such as huge illegal profits in the administration of banana import quotas, and preferential allocation of purposely misprinted (and, therefore, rare) postage stamps. [[Giovanni Leone]] was forced to resign as [[President of the Italian Republic]] in 1978, after the [[Lockheed bribery scandals]]. He was later acquitted.\n\nThe party was also invested, like the other parties of the ''Pentapartito'', in the ''Tangentopoli'' scandals and in the subsequent ''[[Mani pulite]]''. Moreover, as in the 1970s and the 1980s [[Southern Italy]] had become the party's stronghold, it was likely that [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] and dishonest politicians may try to collaborate. DC was the party most associated with Mafia among the public. Leaders such as [[Antonio Gava]], [[Calogero Mannino]], [[Vito Ciancimino]], [[Salvo Lima]] and especially [[Giulio Andreotti]] were perceived by many to belong to a grey zone between simple corruption and mafia business, even if most of them were later acquitted.\n\n==Election results==\n===Italian Parliament===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n| colspan=6|[[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]]\n|-\n! width=13%|Election year\n! width=16%|Votes\n! width=6%|% \n! width=1%|Seats\n! width=8%|+/\u2212\n! width=18%|Leader\n|-\n!

In December 1945 Christian Democrat [[Alcide De Gasperi]] was appointed [[Prime Minister of Italy]].\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party was used in response to Fascist Italy and used as a mechanism of opposition to communism. The April 18 elections in 1948 were used for and against Communism and the Marshall Plan. The people of Italy were voting based on a way of life, not just a political party.<ref name=\"reviewofpolitics\">{{Cite journal|last=Einaudi|first=Mario|date=1947|title=Christian Democracy in Italy|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=9|issue=1|pages= 16\u201333|jstor=1404299|doi=10.1017/S003467050003792X}}</ref> Christian ideals were usually paired with the idea of freedom.<ref name=\"foreignaffairs\">{{Cite journal|last=Ivella|first=Vittorio|date=1948|title=Favorable Omens in Italy|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=26|issue=4|pages= 701\u2013708|jstor=20030148|doi=10.2307/20030148}}</ref> The Party found itself in great trouble because if they were to take an extremist stance on communism then they would be seen as pro-fascism.

This opened the way for a [[Centrism (Italy)|centrist coalition]] that included the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party|Italian Workers' Socialist Party]] (PSLI), a centrist break-away from the PSI, as well as its usual allies, the PLI and the PRI.\n\nIn the [[1948 Italian general election|1948 general election]] the DC went on to win a decisive victory, with the support of the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[United States]], and obtained 48.5% of the vote, its best result ever. Despite his party's absolute majority in the [[Italian Parliament]], De Gasperi continued to govern at the head of the centrist coalition, which was successively abandoned by the Liberals, who hoped for more right-wing policies, in 1950 and the Democratic Socialists, who hoped for more leftist policies, in 1951.\n\nUnder De Gasperi, major land reforms were carried out in the poorer rural regions in the early postwar years, with farms appropriated from the large landowners and parcelled out to the peasants. In addition, during its years in office, Christian Democrats passed a number of laws safeguarding employees from exploitation, established a national health service, and initiated low-cost housing in Italy\u2019s major cities.<ref>Italy: Library of Nations: Italy, Time-Life Books, 1985</ref>\n\nDe Gasperi served as Prime Minister until 1953 and would die a year later. No Christian Democrat would match his longevity in office and, despite the fact that DC's share of vote was always between 38 and 43% from [[1953 Italian general election|1953]] to [[1979 Italian general election|1979]], the party was more and more fractious. As a result, Prime Ministers changed more frequently.\n\n===Centre-left governments===\n[[File:Amintore Fanfani Senato.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Amintore Fanfani]]]]\n[[File:Aldo Moro headshot.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Aldo Moro]]]]\n\nFrom 1954 the DC was led by progressive Christian Democrats, such as [[Amintore Fanfani]], [[Aldo Moro]] and [[Benigno Zaccagnini]], supported by the influential left-wing factions. In the 1950s the party formed centrist or moderately centre-left coalitions, and even a short-lived government led by [[Fernando Tambroni]] relying on parliamentary support from the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), the post-fascist party.\n\nIn 1963 the party, under Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]], formed a coalition with the PSI, which returned to ministerial roles after 16 years, the PSDI and the PRI. Similar \"[[Organic Centre-left]]\" governments became usual through the 1960s and the 1970s.<ref name=\"Botsiou\">{{cite book|author=Konstantina E.

Moro, who was the party main leader and who had inspired the Compromise, was [[Kidnapping of Aldo Moro|abducted and murdered]] by the [[Red Brigades]].\n\nThe event was a shock for the party. When Moro was abducted, the government, at the time led by [[Giulio Andreotti]], immediately took a hardline position stating that the \"State must not bend\" on terrorist demands. This was a very different position from the one kept in similar cases before (such as the [[kidnapping of Ciro Cirillo]], a [[Campania]]n DC member for whom a ransom was paid thanks to the local ties of the party with [[Camorra]]). It was however supported by all the mainstream parties, including the PCI, with the two notable exceptions of the PSI and the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radicals]]. In the trial for [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] allegations against Andreotti, it was said that he took the chance of getting rid of a dangerous political competitor by sabotaging all of the rescue options and ultimately leaving the captors with no option but killing him.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Francesco Pecorelli|author2=Sommella Roberto|title=I veleni di OP|url=http://www.rifondazione-cinecitta.org/pecorelli-dallachiesa.html|publisher=KAOS Edizioni|language=Italian|access-date=19 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618130605/http://www.rifondazione-cinecitta.org/pecorelli-dallachiesa.html|archive-date=18 June 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> During his captivity Moro wrote a series of letters, at times very critical of Andreotti.<ref>[http://www.apolis.com/moro/moro/lettere/indice.htm Yepa - Dedicated Hosting Solutions].

In the successive [[1983 Italian general election|1983 general election]] DC suffered one of its largest declines in terms of votes at that point, receiving only 32.5% of the vote cast (-5.8%). Subsequently, [[Bettino Craxi]] (leader of the rising PSI) reclaimed for himself the post of Prime Minister, again at the head of a ''Pentapartito'' government.\n\nDC re-gained the post of Prime Minister in 1987, after a mild recovery in the [[1987 Italian general election|1987 general election]] (34.2%), and the ''Pentapartito'' coalition governed Italy almost continuously until 1993. While Italy experienced continuous economic progress in the 1980s, the Italian economy was being undermined by constant devaluation of the [[Italian lira]] and the issuing of excessive amounts of high-interest treasury bonds, so that, between 1982 and 1992, the excessive [[Government budget deficit|budget deficit]] built half of the debt still plaguing the country today.\n\n===Dissolution===\nIn 1992 the ''[[Mani pulite]]'' investigation was started in [[Milan]], uncovering the so-called ''Tangentopoli'' scandals (endemic corruption practices at the highest levels), and causing (often controversial) arrests and resignations. After the dismal result in the [[1992 Italian general election|1992 general election]] (29.7%), also due to the rise of [[Lega Nord]] in [[northern Italy]], and two years of mounting scandals (which included several Mafia investigations which notably touched Andreotti), the party was disbanded in 1994. In the 1990s most of the politicians prosecuted during those investigations were acquitted, sometimes however on the basis of legal formalities or on the basis of [[statute of limitations|statutory time limit]] rules.\n\nThe DC suffered heavy defeats in the 1993 provincial and municipal elections and the subsequent split of the [[Mario Segni]]'s [[Segni Pact|Pact]], and polling suggested heavy losses in the upcoming [[1994 Italian general election|1994 general election]]. In hopes of changing the party's image, the DC's last secretary, [[Mino Martinazzoli]] decided to change the name of the party into [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI). [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]], representing the right-wing faction of the party (previously led by Forlani) decided to launch a new party called [[Christian Democratic Centre]] and form an alliance with [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s new party, [[Forza Italia]] (FI). The left-wing factions stayed within the new PPI (albeit a minority which had formed the [[Social Christians]] in 1993 and would join forces with the post-communist [[Democratic Party of the Left]]), while some right-wingers joined [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]. In 1995 the PPI split in two, the PPI and the centre-right [[United Christian Democrats]], which were led by [[Rocco Buttiglione]] and also entered in alliance with FI. In the following years, most Christian Democrats joined FI, which became the party with the most ex-DC members in absolute terms and joined the [[European People's Party]].\n\n==Ideology==\n[[File:Propaganda Dc.jpg|thumb|right|[[Propaganda]] posters of the DC: they described to potential voters the party's commitment to [[anti-communism]] (in the left poster), [[traditional values|traditionalism]] (in the centre poster), and [[family values]] (in the right poster). Note the use of symbols, especially the crossed shield (representing the DC) protecting [[Italy]] (represented by [[Italia Turrita]]) from the [[Communism|communist]] [[hammer and sickle]] symbol being used as a weapon in the left poster.|360px]]\n\nThe party's ideological sources were principally to be found in [[Catholic social teaching]], the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] doctrines developed from the 19th century and on (see [[Christian democracy]]), the political thought of [[Romolo Murri]] and [[Luigi Sturzo]] and ultimately in the tradition of the defunct [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]]. Two [[Papacy|Papal]] [[encyclical]]s, ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891) of [[Pope Leo XIII]], and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (1931) of [[Pope Pius XI]], offered a basis for social and political doctrine.\n\nIn [[economics]] the DC preferred [[competition]] to [[cooperation]], supported the model of [[social market economy]] and rejected the [[Marxism|Marxist]]'s idea of [[class struggle]]. The party thus advocated collaboration between [[social class]]es and was basically a [[big tent|catch-all party]] which aimed to represent all Italian Catholics, both right-wing and left-wing, under the principle of the \"political unity of Catholics\" against [[socialism]], [[communism]] and [[anarchism]]. It ultimately represented the majority of Italians who were opposed to the [[Italian Communist Party]]. The party was however originally equidistant between the Communists and the hard right represented by the [[Italian Social Movement]].\n\nAs a catch-all party, the DC differed from other European Christian Democratic parties, such as the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] that were mainly [[Conservatism|conservative]] parties, with DC comprising conservative as well as [[social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[liberalism|liberal]] elements. The party was thus divided in many factions and party life was characterised by factionalism and by the double adherence of members to the party and the factions, often identified with individual leaders.\n\n==Factions==\nThe DC was characterised by a number of factions, spanning from left to right and evolving all the time.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.storiadc.it/correnti.html | title=Democrazia Cristiana - Correnti}}</ref>\n\nThe original [[centrism|centrist]] and [[liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], [[Giuseppe Pella]], [[Ezio Vanoni]] and [[Mario Scelba]], was soon replaced by the progressives led by [[Amintore Fanfani]]. They were opposed to a right wing whose main leader was [[Antonio Segni]]. The party's left wing, with its roots in the left of the late [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] ([[Giovanni Gronchi]], [[Achille Grandi]] and controversial [[Fernando Tambroni]]), was reinforced by new leaders such as [[Giuseppe Dossetti]], [[Giorgio La Pira]], [[Giuseppe Lazzati]] and Fanfani himself. Most of them were social democrats by European standards.\n\nThe party was often led by centrist figures unaffiliated to any faction such as [[Aldo Moro]], [[Mariano Rumor]] (both closer to the centre-left) and [[Giulio Andreotti]] (closer to the centre-right). Moreover, often, if the government was led by a centre-right Christian Democrat, the party was led by a left-winger and vice versa. This was what happened in the 1950s when Fanfani was party secretary and the government was led by centre-right figures such as Scelba and Segni and in the late 1970s when [[Benigno Zaccagnini]], a progressive, led the party and Andreotti the government: this custom, in clear contrast with the principles of a [[Westminster system]], deeply weakened DC-led governments, that even with great majorities were de facto unable to conciliate the several factions of the party, and ultimately the office of [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] (defined by the [[Constitution of Italy]] as a ''primus inter pares'' among ministers), turning the Italian party system into a [[particracy]] (''partitocrazia'').\n\nFrom the 1980s the party was divided between the centre-right led by [[Arnaldo Forlani]] (supported also by the party's right wing) and the centre-left led by [[Ciriaco de Mita]] (whose supporters included [[trade union]]ists and the internal left), with Andreotti holding the balance. De Mita, who led the party from 1982 to 1989, curiously tried to transform the party into a mainstream \"conservative party\" in line with the [[European People's Party]] in order to preserve party unity. He was replaced by Forlani in 1989, after that becoming Prime Minister in 1988. Disagreements between de Mita and Forlani brought Andreotti back to prime-ministership from 1989 to 1992.\n\nWith the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the end of great ideologies and ultimately the ''Tangentopoli'' scandals, the heterogeneous nature of the party led it to its collapse. The bulk of the DC joined the new [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI), but immediately several centre-right elements led by [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]] joined the [[Christian Democratic Centre]] (CCD), while others directly joined [[Forza Italia]]. A split from the PPI, the [[United Christian Democrats]] (CDU), joined Forza Italia and the CCD in the centre-right [[Pole of Freedoms]] coalition (later becoming the [[Pole for Freedoms]]), while the PPI was a founding member of [[The Olive Tree (Italy)|The Olive Tree]] centre-left coalition in 1996.\n\n==Popular support==\nIn its early years the party was stronger in [[Northern Italy]], and especially in eastern [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]], due to the strong [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] roots of that areas, than in the [[Southern Italy|South]], where the [[Liberals (Italy)|Liberal]] establishment that had governed Italy for decades before the rise of [[Benito Mussolini]] had still a grip on voters, as also the [[Monarchist National Party]] and the [[Common Man's Front]] did. The DC was very weak in [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Central Italy]], where the [[Italian Communist Party]] was the dominant political force.\n\nIn the [[1948 Italian general election|1948 general election]] the party had its best result ever (48.5%) and the [[absolute majority]] in the [[Italian Parliament]]. The party won 66.8% in eastern Lombardy (73.6% in the [[Province of Bergamo]]), 60.5% in Veneto (71.9% in the [[Province of Vicenza]]), 69.6% in [[Trentino]] and 57.8% in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], that is to say where the late [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] had its strongholds. In the Centre-South the DC gained more than 50% of the vote in [[Lazio]] (51.9%), [[Abruzzo]] (53.7%) and [[Campania]] (50.5%).\n\nFrom the late 1950s the DC started to move South and by the 1980s it was stronger in the South than in the North, with the exception of Veneto, which remained one of the party's strongholds. In the [[1983 Italian general election|1983 general election]] the party suffered a dramatic decrease in term of votes and its electoral geography was very different from 30 or even 10 years before, as the region where it obtained the best result was [[Apulia]] (46.0%).\n\nIn the [[1992 Italian general election|1992 general election]] the shift was even more evident as the party was over the 40% mark only in some Southern regions (41.1% in [[Campania]], 44.5 in [[Basilicata]] and 41.2% in [[Sicily]]), while it barely reached 20-25% of the vote in the North. As a result of the rise of [[Lega Nord]], which was stronger precisely in the traditional Christian Democratic heartlands, the DC was reduced to 21.0% in [[Piedmont]] (with the League at 16.3%), 32.1% in western Lombardy (League at 25.2%), 31.7% in Veneto (League at 17.3%) and 28.0% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (League at 17.0%).\n\nAs the DC's role was ended, the 1919 PPI strongholds and the DC's traditional heartlands were to become Lega Nord's power base, while the successor parties of the DC continued to be key political actors only in the South, where the clientelistic way of government practised by the Christian Democrats and their allies had left a mark. In the [[1996 Italian general election|1996 general election]] the League gained 7 out of 8 single-seat constituencies in the Province of Bergamo and 5 out of 6 in the Province of Vicenza, winning well over 40%, while the combined score of the three main post-DC parties (the new [[Italian People's Party (1994)|PPI]], the [[Christian Democratic Centre|CCD]] and the [[United Christian Democrats|CDU]]) was highest in [[Campania]] (22.3%). In the [[1996 Sicilian regional election]] the combined score of those parties was 26.4%.<ref>Piergiorgio Corbetta; Maria Serena Piretti, ''Atlante storico-elettorale d'Italia'', Zanichelli, [[Bologna]] 2009</ref><ref name=\"Interno\">[http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tp=C Ministero dell'Interno.

In the 1960s scandals involved frauds such as huge illegal profits in the administration of banana import quotas, and preferential allocation of purposely misprinted (and, therefore, rare) postage stamps. [[Giovanni Leone]] was forced to resign as [[President of the Italian Republic]] in 1978, after the [[Lockheed bribery scandals]]. He was later acquitted.\n\nThe party was also invested, like the other parties of the ''Pentapartito'', in the ''Tangentopoli'' scandals and in the subsequent ''[[Mani pulite]]''. Moreover, as in the 1970s and the 1980s [[Southern Italy]] had become the party's stronghold, it was likely that [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] and dishonest politicians may try to collaborate. DC was the party most associated with Mafia among the public. Leaders such as [[Antonio Gava]], [[Calogero Mannino]], [[Vito Ciancimino]], [[Salvo Lima]] and especially [[Giulio Andreotti]] were perceived by many to belong to a grey zone between simple corruption and mafia business, even if most of them were later acquitted.\n\n==Election results==\n===Italian Parliament===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n| colspan=6|[[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]]\n|-\n! width=13%|Election year\n! width=16%|Votes\n! width=6%|% \n! width=1%|Seats\n! width=8%|+/\u2212\n! width=18%|Leader\n|-\n!

Merseyside, which was created on 1&nbsp;April 1974 as a result of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], takes its name from the [[River Mersey]].\n\nMerseyside spans {{convert|249|sqmi|km2|0}} of land which border [[Lancashire]] (to the north-east), [[Greater Manchester]] (to the east), [[Cheshire]] (to the south and south-east) and the [[Irish Sea]] to the west. [[North Wales]] is across the [[Dee Estuary]]. There is a mix of high density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Merseyside, but overwhelmingly the land use is urban. It has a focused central business district, formed by [[Liverpool City Centre]], but Merseyside is also a polycentric county with five metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs. The [[Liverpool Urban Area]] is the [[List of conurbations in the United Kingdom|fifth most populous conurbation in England]], and dominates the geographic centre of the county, while the smaller [[Birkenhead Urban Area]] dominates the [[Wirral Peninsula]] in the south.\n\nFor the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared power with the [[Merseyside County Council]].

Merseyside lies at the [[River Mersey|Mersey Estuary]]]]\nMerseyside was designated as a \"Special Review\" area in the [[Local Government Act 1958]], and the [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1966)|Local Government Commission for England]] started a review of this area in 1962, based around the core county boroughs of [[Liverpool]], [[Bootle]], [[Birkenhead]] and [[Wallasey]]. Further areas, including [[Widnes]] and [[Runcorn]], were added to the Special Review Area by Order in 1965. Draft proposals were published in 1965, but the commission never completed its final proposals as it was abolished in 1966.\n\nInstead, a [[Royal Commission]] was set up to review English local government entirely, and its report (known as the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]]) proposed a much wider Merseyside metropolitan area covering southwest Lancashire and northwest Cheshire, extending as far south as [[Chester]] and as far north as the [[River Ribble]]. This would have included four districts: [[Southport]]/[[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]], [[Liverpool]]/[[Bootle]], [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]/[[Widnes]] and [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]]/[[Chester]]. In 1970 the [[Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]] (which operates today under the ''[[Merseytravel]]'' brand) was set up, covering Liverpool, Sefton, Wirral and Knowsley, but excluding Southport and St Helens.\n\nThe Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the incoming [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government, but the concept of a two-tier metropolitan area based on the Mersey area was retained. A [[White Paper]] was published in 1971. The [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Bill]] presented to Parliament involved a substantial trimming from the White Paper, excluding the northern and southern fringes of the area, excluding Chester, Ellesmere Port (and, unusually, including Southport, whose council had requested to be included). Further alterations took place in Parliament, with [[Skelmersdale]] being removed from the area, and a proposed district including St Helens and [[Huyton]] being subdivided into what are now the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens|St Helens]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]].\n\nMerseyside was created on 1 April 1974 from areas previously parts of the [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of [[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]], along with the county boroughs of Birkenhead, Wallasey, Liverpool, Bootle, and St Helens. Following the creation of Merseyside, Merseytravel expanded to take in St Helens and Southport.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Local Government Act 1972|post-1974]]\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Local Government Act 1888|pre-1974]]\n|-\n!

The eastern part of Merseyside borders onto [[Lancashire]] to the north, [[Greater Manchester]] to the east, with both parts of the county bordering [[Cheshire]] to the south. The territory comprising the county of Merseyside previously formed part of the [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of Lancashire (east of the River Mersey) and Cheshire (west of the River Mersey).\n[[Birkenhead Park]], opening in 1847, was the first publicly funded civic park in the world.\nThe two parts are linked by the two [[Mersey Tunnels]], the [[Wirral Line]] of [[Merseyrail]], and the [[Mersey Ferry]].\n\n===Green belt===\n{{further|North West Green Belt}}\nMerseyside contains [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] interspersed throughout the county, surrounding the Liverpool urban area, as well as across the Mersey in the Wirral area, with further pockets extending towards and surrounding Southport, as part of the western edge of the North West Green Belt. It was first drawn up from the 1950s. All the county's districts contain some portion of belt.

Merseyside, which was created on 1&nbsp;April 1974 as a result of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], takes its name from the [[River Mersey]].\n\nMerseyside spans {{convert|249|sqmi|km2|0}} of land which border [[Lancashire]] (to the north-east), [[Greater Manchester]] (to the east), [[Cheshire]] (to the south and south-east) and the [[Irish Sea]] to the west. [[North Wales]] is across the [[Dee Estuary]]. There is a mix of high density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Merseyside, but overwhelmingly the land use is urban. It has a focused central business district, formed by [[Liverpool City Centre]], but Merseyside is also a polycentric county with five metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs. The [[Liverpool Urban Area]] is the [[List of conurbations in the United Kingdom|fifth most populous conurbation in England]], and dominates the geographic centre of the county, while the smaller [[Birkenhead Urban Area]] dominates the [[Wirral Peninsula]] in the south.\n\nFor the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared power with the [[Merseyside County Council]]. The county council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) are now effectively [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority areas]].

Merseyside lies at the [[River Mersey|Mersey Estuary]]]]\nMerseyside was designated as a \"Special Review\" area in the [[Local Government Act 1958]], and the [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1966)|Local Government Commission for England]] started a review of this area in 1962, based around the core county boroughs of [[Liverpool]], [[Bootle]], [[Birkenhead]] and [[Wallasey]]. Further areas, including [[Widnes]] and [[Runcorn]], were added to the Special Review Area by Order in 1965. Draft proposals were published in 1965, but the commission never completed its final proposals as it was abolished in 1966.\n\nInstead, a [[Royal Commission]] was set up to review English local government entirely, and its report (known as the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]]) proposed a much wider Merseyside metropolitan area covering southwest Lancashire and northwest Cheshire, extending as far south as [[Chester]] and as far north as the [[River Ribble]]. This would have included four districts: [[Southport]]/[[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]], [[Liverpool]]/[[Bootle]], [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]/[[Widnes]] and [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]]/[[Chester]]. In 1970 the [[Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]] (which operates today under the ''[[Merseytravel]]'' brand) was set up, covering Liverpool, Sefton, Wirral and Knowsley, but excluding Southport and St Helens.\n\nThe Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the incoming [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government, but the concept of a two-tier metropolitan area based on the Mersey area was retained. A [[White Paper]] was published in 1971. The [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Bill]] presented to Parliament involved a substantial trimming from the White Paper, excluding the northern and southern fringes of the area, excluding Chester, Ellesmere Port (and, unusually, including Southport, whose council had requested to be included). Further alterations took place in Parliament, with [[Skelmersdale]] being removed from the area, and a proposed district including St Helens and [[Huyton]] being subdivided into what are now the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens|St Helens]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]].\n\nMerseyside was created on 1 April 1974 from areas previously parts of the [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of [[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]], along with the county boroughs of Birkenhead, Wallasey, Liverpool, Bootle, and St Helens. Following the creation of Merseyside, Merseytravel expanded to take in St Helens and Southport.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Local Government Act 1972|post-1974]]\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Local Government Act 1888|pre-1974]]\n|-\n!

The eastern part of Merseyside borders onto [[Lancashire]] to the north, [[Greater Manchester]] to the east, with both parts of the county bordering [[Cheshire]] to the south. The territory comprising the county of Merseyside previously formed part of the [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of Lancashire (east of the River Mersey) and Cheshire (west of the River Mersey).\n[[Birkenhead Park]], opening in 1847, was the first publicly funded civic park in the world.\nThe two parts are linked by the two [[Mersey Tunnels]], the [[Wirral Line]] of [[Merseyrail]], and the [[Mersey Ferry]].\n\n===Green belt===\n{{further|North West Green Belt}}\nMerseyside contains [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] interspersed throughout the county, surrounding the Liverpool urban area, as well as across the Mersey in the Wirral area, with further pockets extending towards and surrounding Southport, as part of the western edge of the North West Green Belt. It was first drawn up from the 1950s. All the county's districts contain some portion of belt.

According to the USDA's 1955 Household Food Consumption Survey, families of three or more people spent one-third of their after-tax income on food. For these families, poverty thresholds were set at three times the cost of the economy food plan. Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds for two-person households and persons living alone.\n\nHer work appeared at an opportune moment, as [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] declared the War on Poverty just six months later\u2014and Orshanky's work offered a numerical way to measure progress in this effort.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v68n3/v68n3p79.html|title=Remembering Mollie Orshansky\u2014The Developer of the Poverty Thresholds|website=Social Security Administration Research, Statistics, and Policy Analysis|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> The newly formed [[United States Office of Economic Opportunity|Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) adopted the Orshansky poverty thresholds for statistical, planning, and budgetary purposes in May 1965.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/history-poverty-thresholds|title=History of Poverty Thresholds|date=2015-11-23|website=ASPE|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> Officials at the OEO were enthusiastic; as research director Joseph Kershaw remarked, \"Mollie Orshansky says that when you have more people in the family, you need more money.

The [[Bureau of the Budget]] resisted these changes, but formed an interagency committee that, in 1969, decided that poverty thresholds would be adjusted for inflation by being tied to the [[Consumer Price Index]], rather than changes in the standard of living. In August 1969, the Bureau of the Budget designated these revised thresholds as the federal government's official definition of poverty.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nApart from minor changes in 1981 that changed the number of thresholds from 124 to 48,<ref name=\":4\" /> poverty thresholds have remained static for the past fifty years despite criticism that the thresholds may not be completely accurate.

After the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981]], responsibility for issuing the guidelines was transferred to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Poverty guidelines are also referred to as the \"federal poverty level\" (FPL), but the HHS discourages that term.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Supplemental Poverty Measure ===\nIn 1990, a Congressional committee requested the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) to conduct a study on revising the poverty measure.<ref name=\":4\" /> The NRC convened a panel, which published a 1995 report ''Measuring Poverty: A New Approach'' that concluded that the official poverty measure in the United States is flawed. The panel noted that the thresholds are the same irrespective of geography and stated that due to \"rising living standards in the United States, most approaches for developing poverty thresholds (including the original one) would produce higher thresholds today than the current ones.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1995/demo/citro-01.html|title=Measuring Poverty: A New Approach C.

This alternative measure of poverty would also change the income calculation for a family, including certain non-cash benefits that satisfied \"basic needs\" such as food stamps and public housing while excluding \"non-basic needs\" such as medical costs and child care.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/950511/poverty.shtml|title=Poverty definition flawed, more accurate measure needed|website=chronicle.uchicago.edu|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\nThe work of the panel led to the development of Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which was intended to address some of the weaknesses of the existing poverty guidelines. In October 2014, the Census Bureau released a report describing the SPM and stated its intention to publish SPM measures every year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-251.pdf|title=The Supplemental Poverty Measure: 2013|last=Short|first=Kathleen|date=2015-03-10|website=census.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310022700/https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-251.pdf|archive-date=2015-03-10|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> However, SPM is intended to \"supplement\" the existing poverty thresholds, not \"replace\" them, as poverty thresholds will remain the \"official\" Census Bureau measure and poverty guidelines will be derived only from the \"official\" poverty measures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33069.pdf|title=Poverty in the United States: 2013|last=Gabe|first=Thomas|date=2015-01-29|website=Congressional Research Service|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the poverty thresholds, and in line with the NRC recommendations, the SPM both includes certain non-cash benefits in a family's income and adjusts thresholds for differences in housing costs by geographic area. Additionally, the SPM thresholds are based on how much a \"reference\" family with two children spends on food, clothing, shelter, and utilities (FCSU).\n\n===Criticism===\n====Understating poverty====\nMany sociologists and government officials have argued that poverty in the United States is understated, meaning that there are more households living in actual poverty than there are households below the poverty threshold.<ref name=\"Dealing with Diversity\">{{cite book|title=Dealing with Diversity|last=Adams|first=J.Q.|author2=Pearlie Strother-Adams|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7872-8145-8|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> A recent [[National Public Radio|NPR]] report states that as many as 30% of Americans have trouble making ends meet and other advocates have made supporting claims that the rate of actual poverty in the US is far higher than that calculated by using the poverty threshold.<ref name=\"Dealing with Diversity\" /> A study taken in 2012 estimated that roughly 38% of Americans live \"paycheck to paycheck.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consumerfed.org/press_release/many-families-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-but-those-with-a-financial-plan-feel-and-do-better/|title=Many Families Struggle to Make Ends Meet, But Those With a Financial Plan Feel and Do Better \u00b7 Consumer Federation of America|website=Consumer Federation of America|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the Bureau of Labor Statistics put forward suggested budgets for adequate family living. 60% of working-class Americans lived below the \"intermediate\" budget, which allowed for the following:<blockquote>It assumes, for example, that the family will own:\n\n... A toaster that will last for 33 years.\n\n... A vacuum cleaner that will last 14 years.\n\nThe budget assumes that a family will buy a two-year-old car and keep it for four years...\n\nFinally, the budget allows nothing whatever for savings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXdWbwEPIO0C|title=America in Our Time: From World War II to Nixon--what Happened and why|last=Hodgson|first=Godfrey|date=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-691-12288-5|location=|pages=482|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>Given that the \"intermediate\" budget was fairly modest, observers questioned whether poverty levels were really capturing the full extent of prosperity, challenging the long-established view that most Americans had attained an affluent standard of living in the two decades following the end of the Second World War.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2010-10-20|title=That Seventies Show|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/155492/seventies-show?page=full|journal=The Nation}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TWO YOUTHS IN UPTOWN, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, A NEIGHBORHOOD OF POOR WHITE SOUTHERNERS.

Updated thereafter only for inflation, the poverty line lost all connection over time with current consumption patterns of the average family. Quite a few families then didn't have their own private telephone, or a car, or even a mixer in their kitchen... The official poverty line has thus been allowed to fall substantially below a socially decent minimum, even though its intention was to measure such a minimum.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leoHWY-cfOIC|title=Freedom Reclaimed: Rediscovering the American Vision|last=Schwarz|first=John E.|date=2005-01-02|publisher=JHU Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8018-7981-4|location=|pages=50|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>The issue of understating poverty is especially pressing in states with both a [[Real estate pricing|high cost of living]] and a high poverty rate such as California where the [[Real estate pricing|median home price]] \n\n[[File:Seeking human kindness.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Homeless man in [[Boston]]]]in 2006 was $564,430.<ref name=\"California median home price\">{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060627/20060627005927.html?.v=1|title=California median home price|accessdate=July 6, 2006}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In the [[Monterey County, California#Home prices|Monterey area]], where the low-pay industry of agriculture is the largest sector in the economy and the majority of the population lacks a college education, the median home price was $723,790, requiring an [[Household income in the United States|upper middle class income]] only earned by roughly 20% of all households in the county.<ref name=\"California median home price\" /><ref name=\"Monterey County income distribution\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=05000US06053&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP32&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en|title=Monterey County income distribution|accessdate=July 6, 2006|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212041813/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=05000US06053&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP32&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en|archive-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> Such fluctuations in local markets are, however, not considered in the federal poverty threshold and may leave many who live in poverty-like conditions out of the total number of households classified as poor.\n\nThe Supplemental Poverty Measure, introduced in 2011, aims at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent of poverty in the United States by taking account of non-cash benefits and geographic variations.<ref name=\"SPM2016\">{{cite web|url=https://census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-258.html|title=The Supplemental Poverty Measure: 2015|author1=Renwick, Trudi|author2=Fox, Liana|date=September 13, 2016|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|quote=Number and Percentage of People in Poverty by State Using 3-Year Average Over 2013, 2014, and 2015}}</ref> According to this new measure, 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2011, compared with the official figure of 15.2%.

These range in scope from neighborhood efforts to campaigns with a national focus. They target specific groups affected by poverty such as children, people who are autistic, immigrants, or people who are homeless. Efforts to alleviate poverty use a disparate set of methods, such as advocacy, education, social work, legislation, direct service or charity, and [[community organizing]].\n\nRecent debates have centered on the need for policies that focus on both \"income poverty\" and \"asset poverty.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assetsandopportunity.org/scorecard/|title=2016 A&O Scorecard|website=CFED Assets & Opportunity Scorecard|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802093605/http://assetsandopportunity.org/scorecard/|archivedate=August 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor through programs such as [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] (TANF, formerly [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]], AFDC) and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Program). According to the [[Corporation for Enterprise Development|CFED]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20130802093605/http://assetsandopportunity.org/scorecard/ 2012 Assets & Opportunity Scorecard], 27 percent of households \u2013 nearly double the percentage that are income poor \u2013 are living in \"asset poverty.\" These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program under the supervision of the US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement [[Individual Development Account]] or [[Individual Development Account|IDA]] programs, which are an asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in [[Individual Development Account|IDA]] savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home, acquiring a post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ocs/fact-sheet-ocs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506111433/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ocs/fact-sheet-ocs |archivedate=May 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96406,00.html Earned Income Tax Credit] (EITC or EIC) is a credit for people who earn low-to-moderate incomes.

The [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] is viewed as the largest poverty reduction program in the United States. There is an ongoing debate in the U.S. about what the most effective way to fight poverty is,  through the tax code with the EITC, or through the [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage laws]].\n\nGovernment safety-net programs put in place since the [[War on Poverty]] have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself has done little to reduce poverty.

Orshansky introduced the poverty thresholds in a 1963 ''Social Security Bulletin'' article, \"Children of the Poor.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orshansky|first=Mollie|date=|title=Children of the Poor|url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v26n7/v26n7p3.pdf|journal=Social Security Bulletin|volume=July 1963|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n[[File:20111110-OC-AMW-0012 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|The \"Basic Seven\", a food plan developed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].]]\nOrshansky based her thresholds on work she had done with the [[economy food plan]] while at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]. According to the USDA's 1955 Household Food Consumption Survey, families of three or more people spent one-third of their after-tax income on food. For these families, poverty thresholds were set at three times the cost of the economy food plan. Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds for two-person households and persons living alone.\n\nHer work appeared at an opportune moment, as [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] declared the War on Poverty just six months later\u2014and Orshanky's work offered a numerical way to measure progress in this effort.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v68n3/v68n3p79.html|title=Remembering Mollie Orshansky\u2014The Developer of the Poverty Thresholds|website=Social Security Administration Research, Statistics, and Policy Analysis|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> The newly formed [[United States Office of Economic Opportunity|Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) adopted the Orshansky poverty thresholds for statistical, planning, and budgetary purposes in May 1965.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/history-poverty-thresholds|title=History of Poverty Thresholds|date=2015-11-23|website=ASPE|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> Officials at the OEO were enthusiastic; as research director Joseph Kershaw remarked, \"Mollie Orshansky says that when you have more people in the family, you need more money. Isn't that sensible?\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOfficials at the Social Security Administration began to plan on how to adjust poverty thresholds for changes in the standard of living. The [[Bureau of the Budget]] resisted these changes, but formed an interagency committee that, in 1969, decided that poverty thresholds would be adjusted for inflation by being tied to the [[Consumer Price Index]], rather than changes in the standard of living. In August 1969, the Bureau of the Budget designated these revised thresholds as the federal government's official definition of poverty.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nApart from minor changes in 1981 that changed the number of thresholds from 124 to 48,<ref name=\":4\" /> poverty thresholds have remained static for the past fifty years despite criticism that the thresholds may not be completely accurate.

The panel noted that the thresholds are the same irrespective of geography and stated that due to \"rising living standards in the United States, most approaches for developing poverty thresholds (including the original one) would produce higher thresholds today than the current ones.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1995/demo/citro-01.html|title=Measuring Poverty: A New Approach C.

A toaster that will last for 33 years.\n\n... A vacuum cleaner that will last 14 years.\n\nThe budget assumes that a family will buy a two-year-old car and keep it for four years...\n\nFinally, the budget allows nothing whatever for savings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXdWbwEPIO0C|title=America in Our Time: From World War II to Nixon--what Happened and why|last=Hodgson|first=Godfrey|date=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-691-12288-5|location=|pages=482|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>Given that the \"intermediate\" budget was fairly modest, observers questioned whether poverty levels were really capturing the full extent of prosperity, challenging the long-established view that most Americans had attained an affluent standard of living in the two decades following the end of the Second World War.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2010-10-20|title=That Seventies Show|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/155492/seventies-show?page=full|journal=The Nation}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TWO YOUTHS IN UPTOWN, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, A NEIGHBORHOOD OF POOR WHITE SOUTHERNERS.

Additionally, it assumes that Americans spend one third of their income on food; in fact, Americans typically spent less than one tenth of their after-tax income on food in 2000.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clauson|first=Annette|date=September 2000|title=Despite Higher Food Prices, Percent of U.S. Income Spent on Food Remains Constant|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2008-september/despite-higher-food-prices,-percent-of-us-income-spent-on-food-remains-constant.aspx|journal=Amber Waves (U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service)|volume=|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160711050434/https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2008-september/despite-higher-food-prices,-percent-of-us-income-spent-on-food-remains-constant.aspx|archive-date=2016-07-11|via=}}</ref> For many families, the costs of housing, [[health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] and [[Healthcare in the United States|medical care]], transportation, and access to basic telecommunications take a much larger bite out of the family's income today than a half century ago, yet none of these costs are considered in determining the official poverty thresholds.\nAccording to John Schwarz, a political scientist at the University of Arizona:<blockquote>The official poverty line today is essentially what it takes in today's dollars, adjusted for inflation, to purchase the same poverty-line level of living that was appropriate to a half century ago, in 1955 .... Updated thereafter only for inflation, the poverty line lost all connection over time with current consumption patterns of the average family. Quite a few families then didn't have their own private telephone, or a car, or even a mixer in their kitchen... The official poverty line has thus been allowed to fall substantially below a socially decent minimum, even though its intention was to measure such a minimum.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leoHWY-cfOIC|title=Freedom Reclaimed: Rediscovering the American Vision|last=Schwarz|first=John E.|date=2005-01-02|publisher=JHU Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8018-7981-4|location=|pages=50|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>The issue of understating poverty is especially pressing in states with both a [[Real estate pricing|high cost of living]] and a high poverty rate such as California where the [[Real estate pricing|median home price]] \n\n[[File:Seeking human kindness.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Homeless man in [[Boston]]]]in 2006 was $564,430.<ref name=\"California median home price\">{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060627/20060627005927.html?.v=1|title=California median home price|accessdate=July 6, 2006}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In the [[Monterey County, California#Home prices|Monterey area]], where the low-pay industry of agriculture is the largest sector in the economy and the majority of the population lacks a college education, the median home price was $723,790, requiring an [[Household income in the United States|upper middle class income]] only earned by roughly 20% of all households in the county.<ref name=\"California median home price\" /><ref name=\"Monterey County income distribution\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=05000US06053&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP32&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en|title=Monterey County income distribution|accessdate=July 6, 2006|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212041813/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=05000US06053&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP32&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en|archive-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> Such fluctuations in local markets are, however, not considered in the federal poverty threshold and may leave many who live in poverty-like conditions out of the total number of households classified as poor.\n\nThe Supplemental Poverty Measure, introduced in 2011, aims at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent of poverty in the United States by taking account of non-cash benefits and geographic variations.<ref name=\"SPM2016\">{{cite web|url=https://census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-258.html|title=The Supplemental Poverty Measure: 2015|author1=Renwick, Trudi|author2=Fox, Liana|date=September 13, 2016|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|quote=Number and Percentage of People in Poverty by State Using 3-Year Average Over 2013, 2014, and 2015}}</ref> According to this new measure, 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2011, compared with the official figure of 15.2%.

For example, Switzerland has Universal Healthcare and a free system of education for children as young as four years old.<ref>The Swiss education system swissworld.org, Retrieved on June 23, 2009</ref> New Hampshire has no state income tax or sales tax, but does have the nation's highest property taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/468.html|title=Tax Foundation|website=Tax Foundation|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>[[File:US incarceration timeline.gif|thumb|Total [[incarceration in the United States|incarceration]] in the United States by year]]\n*The poor in the United States are [[Incarceration in the United States|incarcerated]] at a much higher rate than their counterparts in other developed nations, with penal confinement being, according to sociologist [[Bruce Western]], \"commonplace for poor men of working age.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Poverty Politics and Crime Control in Europe and America|author=[http://scholar.harvard.edu/brucewestern/home Bruce Western] |journal=[[Contemporary Sociology]] |date= May 2011 |volume=40 |issue=3|pages=283\u2013286 |doi=10.1177/0094306110404514d |jstor=23042281 }}</ref> A 2015 study by the [[Vera Institute of Justice]] contends that jails in the U.S. have become \"massive warehouses\" of the impoverished since the 1980s.<ref>Tom Hall (February 13, 2015).[http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/02/13/pris-f13.html Study says US jails have become \"massive warehouses\" for the poor].

These range in scope from neighborhood efforts to campaigns with a national focus. They target specific groups affected by poverty such as children, people who are autistic, immigrants, or people who are homeless. Efforts to alleviate poverty use a disparate set of methods, such as advocacy, education, social work, legislation, direct service or charity, and [[community organizing]].\n\nRecent debates have centered on the need for policies that focus on both \"income poverty\" and \"asset poverty.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assetsandopportunity.org/scorecard/|title=2016 A&O Scorecard|website=CFED Assets & Opportunity Scorecard|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802093605/http://assetsandopportunity.org/scorecard/|archivedate=August 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor through programs such as [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] (TANF, formerly [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]], AFDC) and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Program). According to the [[Corporation for Enterprise Development|CFED]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20130802093605/http://assetsandopportunity.org/scorecard/ 2012 Assets & Opportunity Scorecard], 27 percent of households \u2013 nearly double the percentage that are income poor \u2013 are living in \"asset poverty.\" These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program under the supervision of the US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement [[Individual Development Account]] or [[Individual Development Account|IDA]] programs, which are an asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in [[Individual Development Account|IDA]] savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home, acquiring a post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ocs/fact-sheet-ocs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506111433/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ocs/fact-sheet-ocs |archivedate=May 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96406,00.html Earned Income Tax Credit] (EITC or EIC) is a credit for people who earn low-to-moderate incomes. This credit allows them to get money from the government if their total tax outlay is less than the total credit earned, meaning it is not just a reduction in total tax paid but can also bring new income to the household.  The [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] is viewed as the largest poverty reduction program in the United States. There is an ongoing debate in the U.S. about what the most effective way to fight poverty is,  through the tax code with the EITC, or through the [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage laws]].\n\nGovernment safety-net programs put in place since the [[War on Poverty]] have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself has done little to reduce poverty.
