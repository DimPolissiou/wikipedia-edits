In March 2014, it was officially announced that a reboot was in the works, with Jeff Buhler set to write the script. In July 2017, filmmaker Nicolas Pesce was hired for rewrites, based on Buhler's script, and to direct the film.

Fiona informs her co-worker that she is returning to America before encountering the ghost of [[Kayako Saeki]]. Fiona arrives at her home on 44 Reyburn Drive in a small town in [[Pennsylvania]], reuniting with her husband Sam and young daughter Melinda. Kayako's curse, however, possesses Fiona, causing her to bludgeon Sam to death and drown Melinda before committing suicide by stabbing herself in the throat.\n\nDetectives Goodman and Wilson investigate the murders. Unsettled by the house, Goodman refuses to enter it while Wilson enters to scope out the scene. Upon exiting, Wilson slowly starts to lose his sanity and eventually becomes hysterical when he spots Fiona's ghost outside Goodman's car; after which he attempts to commit suicide by shooting himself, but is unsuccessful. This leaves Wilson with a disfigured face and committed to a psychiatric asylum while Goodman stops looking into the case.\n\nShortly after the Landers are murdered, but before anyone discovers their deaths, real estate agents Peter and Nina Spencer learn that their unborn child will most likely be born with a rare genetic disorder [[Adrenoleukodystrophy|ALD]], distressing the pair. Peter goes to look into selling 44 Reyburn Drive and stumbles across Melinda's ghost, presuming her to be a lost girl, who is bleeding profusely from her nose. While on the phone with Peter, Nina agrees that they should keep their child. Peter is attacked by Fiona and Melinda's ghosts before fleeing the house and is quickly corrupted by the curse. The possessed Peter returns to his home, where he kills Nina and their unborn child before he drowns himself in the bathtub.\n\nIn 2005, elderly couple Faith and William Matheson move into the house. Faith suffers from [[dementia]] and a terminal illness. After moving in Faith is infected by the curse and starts to see Melinda around the house. Her sanity rapidly declines, causing William to call over Lorna Moody, an assisted suicide consultant. Disturbed, Lorna suggests to William that they leave the house but William reveals that he is aware of the ghosts and suggests that it implies a future where people get to be with their loved ones after death. Lorna later discovers that Faith has killed William and has sliced off her own fingers. Lorna flees in horror only to be attacked by Sam's ghost in her car which crashes, killing her.\n\nIn 2006, rookie detective Muldoon moves to town with her son Burke following her husband's death from cancer. Muldoon along with Goodman, her new partner, are called to the woods where Lorna's corpse has been discovered. Goodman becomes uncomfortable when they learn that Lorna had been visiting 44 Reyburn Drive. Noticing this, Muldoon questions him, and he reveals his suspicion that the house is cursed, and states he wants nothing to do with it.\n\nMuldoon goes to the house, discovering a disoriented Faith and William's corpse. Faith is taken to a hospital, where she sees Melinda and throws herself off a staircase landing, committing suicide. As Muldoon continues her research into the case, she is haunted by the ghosts of the Landers. She visits Wilson in the asylum, who tells her that all people who enter the house will become victims of the curse. Wilson then [[Eye-gouging|gouges out his eyes]] so he can stop seeing the ghosts. Fearful that the curse may make her hurt her son, Muldoon confides in Goodman and learns that the curse began with a family in Japan; Fiona is the one who brought it abroad. After she is attacked by the Landers' ghosts again, Muldoon goes to the house and douses it in gasoline as she sees visions of how Fiona murdered her family. She is tricked into seeing Burke, however she realizes it isn't really him after he fails to repeat a phrase the two of them use regularly. The house burns to the ground as Muldoon embraces her real son outside.\n\nSometime later, Muldoon hugs Burke before he leaves for school, only to see another Burke leave the house. The \"Burke\" she is hugging is revealed to be Melinda. Muldoon is dragged away by Fiona's ghost, leaving her fate unknown. \n\n===International ending===\nAfter Muldoon burns the house to the ground, she sees Burke watching her. Sometime later, the pair are driving on a road toward a new home. As they pull into the driveway of their home and enter, the credits begin rolling.<ref>{{cite web|author=294 |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ej1r13/official_discussion_the_grudge_2020_spoilers/fd1bbgd/ |title=Official Discussion: ''The Grudge'' (2020) [SPOILERS] : movies |website=Reddit.com |date=2020-01-04 |accessdate=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as Detective Muldoon<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com2\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3486655/grudge-re-re-reboot-infects-andrea-riseborough/ |title='The Grudge' Re-re-reboot Infects Andrea Riseborough \u2013 Bloody Disgusting |website=bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]] as Detective Goodman<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com3\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3488689/grudge-reboot-adds-nuns-demian-bichir/ |title='The Grudge' Reboot Adds 'The Nun's' Demian Bichir \u2013 Bloody Disgusting |website=bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=11 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409110000/http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3488689/grudge-reboot-adds-nuns-demian-bichir/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[John Cho]] as Peter Spencer<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com4\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3489081/john-cho-goes-exorcist-grudge/ |title=John Cho Goes From \"Exorcist\" to 'The Grudge' \u2013 Bloody Disgusting |website=bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=11 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409171318/http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3489081/john-cho-goes-exorcist-grudge/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Betty Gilpin]] as Nina Spencer<ref name=\"this\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/the-grudge-betty-gilpin-jacki-weaver-sony-remake-1202379372/ |title='The Grudge': Jacki Weaver, Betty Gilpin, William Sadler & Frankie Faison Join Sony's Remake |access-date=April 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501160457/http://deadline.com/2018/04/the-grudge-betty-gilpin-jacki-weaver-sony-remake-1202379372/ |archive-date=May 1, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Faith Matheson<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com5\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3489663/lin-shaye-continues-career-resurgence-role-grudge-reboot/ |title=Lin Shaye Continues Career Resurgence With Role in 'The Grudge' Reboot \u2013 Bloody Disgusting |website=bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=11 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325045902/http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3489663/lin-shaye-continues-career-resurgence-role-grudge-reboot/ |archive-date=March 25, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Jacki Weaver]] as Lorna Moody<ref name=\"this\" />\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Detective Wilson<ref name=\"this\" />\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as William Matheson<ref name=\"this\" />\n* John J.

Unsettled by the house, Goodman refuses to enter it while Wilson enters to scope out the scene. Upon exiting, Wilson slowly starts to lose his sanity and eventually becomes hysterical when he spots Fiona's ghost outside Goodman's car; after which he attempts to commit suicide by shooting himself, but is unsuccessful. This leaves Wilson with a disfigured face and committed to a psychiatric asylum while Goodman stops looking into the case.\n\nShortly after the Landers are murdered, but before anyone discovers their deaths, real estate agents Peter and Nina Spencer learn that their unborn child will most likely be born with a rare genetic disorder [[Adrenoleukodystrophy|ALD]], distressing the pair. Peter goes to look into selling 44 Reyburn Drive and stumbles across Melinda's ghost, presuming her to be a lost girl, who is bleeding profusely from her nose. While on the phone with Peter, Nina agrees that they should keep their child. Peter is attacked by Fiona and Melinda's ghosts before fleeing the house and is quickly corrupted by the curse. The possessed Peter returns to his home, where he kills Nina and their unborn child before he drowns himself in the bathtub.\n\nIn 2005, elderly couple Faith and William Matheson move into the house. Faith suffers from [[dementia]] and a terminal illness. After moving in Faith is infected by the curse and starts to see Melinda around the house. Her sanity rapidly declines, causing William to call over Lorna Moody, an assisted suicide consultant. Disturbed, Lorna suggests to William that they leave the house but William reveals that he is aware of the ghosts and suggests that it implies a future where people get to be with their loved ones after death. Lorna later discovers that Faith has killed William and has sliced off her own fingers. Lorna flees in horror only to be attacked by Sam's ghost in her car which crashes, killing her.\n\nIn 2006, rookie detective Muldoon moves to town with her son Burke following her husband's death from cancer. Muldoon along with Goodman, her new partner, are called to the woods where Lorna's corpse has been discovered. Goodman becomes uncomfortable when they learn that Lorna had been visiting 44 Reyburn Drive. Noticing this, Muldoon questions him, and he reveals his suspicion that the house is cursed, and states he wants nothing to do with it.\n\nMuldoon goes to the house, discovering a disoriented Faith and William's corpse. Faith is taken to a hospital, where she sees Melinda and throws herself off a staircase landing, committing suicide. As Muldoon continues her research into the case, she is haunted by the ghosts of the Landers. She visits Wilson in the asylum, who tells her that all people who enter the house will become victims of the curse. Wilson then [[Eye-gouging|gouges out his eyes]] so he can stop seeing the ghosts. Fearful that the curse may make her hurt her son, Muldoon confides in Goodman and learns that the curse began with a family in Japan; Fiona is the one who brought it abroad. After she is attacked by the Landers' ghosts again, Muldoon goes to the house and douses it in gasoline as she sees visions of how Fiona murdered her family. She is tricked into seeing Burke, however she realizes it isn't really him after he fails to repeat a phrase the two of them use regularly. The house burns to the ground as Muldoon embraces her real son outside.\n\nSometime later, Muldoon hugs Burke before he leaves for school, only to see another Burke leave the house. The \"Burke\" she is hugging is revealed to be Melinda. Muldoon is dragged away by Fiona's ghost, leaving her fate unknown. \n\n===International ending===\nAfter Muldoon burns the house to the ground, she sees Burke watching her. Sometime later, the pair are driving on a road toward a new home. As they pull into the driveway of their home and enter, the credits begin rolling.<ref>{{cite web|author=294 |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ej1r13/official_discussion_the_grudge_2020_spoilers/fd1bbgd/ |title=Official Discussion: ''The Grudge'' (2020) [SPOILERS] : movies |website=Reddit.com |date=2020-01-04 |accessdate=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as Detective Muldoon<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com2\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3486655/grudge-re-re-reboot-infects-andrea-riseborough/ |title='The Grudge' Re-re-reboot Infects Andrea Riseborough \u2013 Bloody Disgusting |website=bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]] as Detective Goodman<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com3\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3488689/grudge-reboot-adds-nuns-demian-bichir/ |title='The Grudge' Reboot Adds 'The Nun's' Demian Bichir \u2013 Bloody Disgusting |website=bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=11 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409110000/http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3488689/grudge-reboot-adds-nuns-demian-bichir/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[John Cho]] as Peter Spencer<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com4\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3489081/john-cho-goes-exorcist-grudge/ |title=John Cho Goes From \"Exorcist\" to 'The Grudge' \u2013 Bloody Disgusting |website=bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=11 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409171318/http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3489081/john-cho-goes-exorcist-grudge/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Betty Gilpin]] as Nina Spencer<ref name=\"this\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/the-grudge-betty-gilpin-jacki-weaver-sony-remake-1202379372/ |title='The Grudge': Jacki Weaver, Betty Gilpin, William Sadler & Frankie Faison Join Sony's Remake |access-date=April 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501160457/http://deadline.com/2018/04/the-grudge-betty-gilpin-jacki-weaver-sony-remake-1202379372/ |archive-date=May 1, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Faith Matheson<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com5\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3489663/lin-shaye-continues-career-resurgence-role-grudge-reboot/ |title=Lin Shaye Continues Career Resurgence With Role in 'The Grudge' Reboot \u2013 Bloody Disgusting |website=bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=11 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325045902/http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3489663/lin-shaye-continues-career-resurgence-role-grudge-reboot/ |archive-date=March 25, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Jacki Weaver]] as Lorna Moody<ref name=\"this\" />\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Detective Wilson<ref name=\"this\" />\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as William Matheson<ref name=\"this\" />\n* John J.

There seems to have been no truth in these allegations, but they nevertheless worried Abdulaziz and especially his mother, Pertevniyal. On the night when Abdulmejid died and the grand vizier, the kapudan pasha, and the commander-in-chief of the Army conducted Abdulaziz from the heir's suite to the ruler's suite in [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]], Pertevniyal thought they were taking him prisoner. They waited in the sultan's suite until the imperial cliques were ready, and then escorted Abdulaziz to [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], the palace of his forebears, to await the gathering of the council of ministers, some of whom had to be summoned from their homes up the [[Bosphorus]]. Pertevniyal, to reassure herself, followed him there.{{sfn|Davis|1986|p=177}}\n\n===Political influence===\nPertevniyal exerted some influence over her son. When Abdulaziz took his trip to Europe, Pertevniyal was anxious about him the whole time he was away. On his way home he stopped at [[Ruse, Bulgaria]], where Midhat was governor, with the intention of a month and acquainting himself with the Balkan country. But Pertevniyal, a possessive and short-sighted woman, wrote him to come home immediately. Sultan of Turkey though he was, he obeyed his mother's command.{{sfn|Davis|1986|p=178}}\n\nPertevniyal contributed to the instability of her son's rule by meddling in affairs of state. Especially unwise was her alliance with [[Mahmud Nedim Pasha]], the sycophantic grand vizier whose recklessness and incompetence led to further financial chaos. There was such an outcry against Mahmud Nedim that he finally fell from power in 1876 and was succeeded by [[Midhat Pasha]], who did his best to get the Empire on a sounder financial footing. There was sum of 100,000 Turkish lira unaccounted for in the budget, and Midhat discovered that it had been appropriated by Mahmud Nedim.{{sfn|Davis|1986|p=178}}\n\nPrivately Mahmud Nedim disclosed that the money had not been spent by him but had gone to the palace, presumably to the valide sultan. Mahmud Nedim was exiled from the capital for a while, but with the valide's power backing was soon able to return. Midhat's efforts at financial reform were blocked, and he was replaced by Mahmud Nedim. Finally, when talk of Abdulaziz's deposition was in the air, Pertevniyal sent a harem a\u011fa to Midhat requesting him to prepare a document giving his advice on how her son could save his throne. Midhat carefully composed such a document which was approved by the valide, but neither she nor anyone else had the courage at this point, with the sultan in a highly nervous state, to submit to him.{{sfn|Davis|1986|p=178}}\n\n===Visit of the Empress of France===\nIn 1868, [[Empress Eug\u00e9nie]] of France paid a visit to the Ottoman Empire. She was taken by the sultan to his mother in the [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]], but reportedly, Pertevniyal became outraged by the presence of a foreign woman in her [[harem]], and greeted the Empress with a slap in the face, almost provoking an international incident.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Freely|title=Inside the Seraglio: private lives of the sultans in Istanbul|publisher=Penguin|date=July 1, 2001|pages=273|isbn=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Women in Power 1840\u20131870 |url=http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1840.htm |website=Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership |access-date=12 February 2017}}</ref> The visit of the Empress, however, did leave a lasting effect by making Western fashion popular among the harem women.<ref>Oleg Grabar: Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture</ref>\n\n===Abdulaziz\u2019s deposition and murder===\nPertevniyal Sultan witnessed the death of his son from the throne by H\u00fcseyin Avni Pasha and other opponents, whom she hated so much, and his after his death she had very bad days in this time.  She saw her son's ear and ring  while she was seeing that his son was lying in the blood.  Then Necib, one of the sons of N\u00fbreddin Efendi, one of the sons of Sultan Abdulmejid, pulled him by the arm, and took him to the police station square, barefoot, ageless and disastrous. <ref name=\"Pertevniyal\"> {{cite web|title= PERTEVN\u0130YAL V\u00c2L\u0130DE SULTAN (\u00f6. 1884) II.

So they transferred her to Topkap\u0131 Palace and cut off all her communication with the outside. Pertevniyal spent three full months moaning and wailing in the veritable prison of her rooms in Topkap\u0131.

He was more devoted to her than to [[Perestu Kad\u0131n]], who had raised him, and so as soon as he became Sultan his mind turned to the days of torment that Pertevniyal had passed in Topkap\u0131 Palace.

There seems to have been no truth in these allegations, but they nevertheless worried Abdulaziz and especially his mother, Pertevniyal. On the night when Abdulmejid died and the grand vizier, the kapudan pasha, and the commander-in-chief of the Army conducted Abdulaziz from the heir's suite to the ruler's suite in [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]], Pertevniyal thought they were taking him prisoner. They waited in the sultan's suite until the imperial cliques were ready, and then escorted Abdulaziz to [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], the palace of his forebears, to await the gathering of the council of ministers, some of whom had to be summoned from their homes up the [[Bosphorus]]. Pertevniyal, to reassure herself, followed him there.{{sfn|Davis|1986|p=177}}\n\n===Political influence===\nPertevniyal exerted some influence over her son. When Abdulaziz took his trip to Europe, Pertevniyal was anxious about him the whole time he was away. On his way home he stopped at [[Ruse, Bulgaria]], where Midhat was governor, with the intention of a month and acquainting himself with the Balkan country. But Pertevniyal, a possessive and short-sighted woman, wrote him to come home immediately. Sultan of Turkey though he was, he obeyed his mother's command.{{sfn|Davis|1986|p=178}}\n\nPertevniyal contributed to the instability of her son's rule by meddling in affairs of state. Especially unwise was her alliance with [[Mahmud Nedim Pasha]], the sycophantic grand vizier whose recklessness and incompetence led to further financial chaos. There was such an outcry against Mahmud Nedim that he finally fell from power in 1876 and was succeeded by [[Midhat Pasha]], who did his best to get the Empire on a sounder financial footing. There was sum of 100,000 Turkish lira unaccounted for in the budget, and Midhat discovered that it had been appropriated by Mahmud Nedim.{{sfn|Davis|1986|p=178}}\n\nPrivately Mahmud Nedim disclosed that the money had not been spent by him but had gone to the palace, presumably to the valide sultan. Mahmud Nedim was exiled from the capital for a while, but with the valide's power backing was soon able to return. Midhat's efforts at financial reform were blocked, and he was replaced by Mahmud Nedim. Finally, when talk of Abdulaziz's deposition was in the air, Pertevniyal sent a harem a\u011fa to Midhat requesting him to prepare a document giving his advice on how her son could save his throne. Midhat carefully composed such a document which was approved by the valide, but neither she nor anyone else had the courage at this point, with the sultan in a highly nervous state, to submit to him.{{sfn|Davis|1986|p=178}}\n\n===Visit of the Empress of France===\nIn 1868, [[Empress Eug\u00e9nie]] of France paid a visit to the Ottoman Empire. She was taken by the sultan to his mother in the [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]], but reportedly, Pertevniyal became outraged by the presence of a foreign woman in her [[harem]], and greeted the Empress with a slap in the face, almost provoking an international incident.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Freely|title=Inside the Seraglio: private lives of the sultans in Istanbul|publisher=Penguin|date=July 1, 2001|pages=273|isbn=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Women in Power 1840\u20131870 |url=http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1840.htm |website=Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership |access-date=12 February 2017}}</ref> The visit of the Empress, however, did leave a lasting effect by making Western fashion popular among the harem women.<ref>Oleg Grabar: Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture</ref>\n\n===Abdulaziz\u2019s deposition and murder===\nPertevniyal Sultan witnessed the death of his son from the throne by H\u00fcseyin Avni Pasha and other opponents, whom she hated so much, and his after his death she had very bad days in this time.  She saw her son's ear and ring  while she was seeing that his son was lying in the blood.  Then Necib, one of the sons of N\u00fbreddin Efendi, one of the sons of Sultan Abdulmejid, pulled him by the arm, and took him to the police station square, barefoot, ageless and disastrous. <ref name=\"Pertevniyal\"> {{cite web|title= PERTEVN\u0130YAL V\u00c2L\u0130DE SULTAN (\u00f6. 1884) II.

This was the first Mercedes saloon to feature the brand new corporate styling theme which was to be continued until 1993 when the 190 was discontinued.

The model range initially included two versions of the M110 engine (Straight-six with 2746&nbsp;cc displacement)\u2014the 280 S (using a Solex carburetor) and the 280 SE (using Bosch D-Jetronic injection), plus the 350 SE, powered by the M116 engine (V8 with 3499&nbsp;cc displacement). After the 1973 Fuel Crisis, a long-wheelbase version of the 280 was added to the lineup.\n\nHalf a year later, in early 1973, two new models powered by the M117 engine (V8 with 4520&nbsp;cc displacement) were added to the range\u2014the 450 SE and the 450 SEL (with a 100&nbsp;mm longer body). The 450 had {{convert|225|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} in most markets, federalized cars offered {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while Swedish market cars had an [[Exhaust gas recirculation|EGR-valve]] and {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} until 1976.<ref name=KB0516/> The 450s received a plusher interior as well, with velour or leather seats rather than the checkered cloth of the lesser models. The door insides were also of a different design, being pulled up around the windows.<ref name=KBp42>[[#MS16|Stjerna]], p. 42</ref>\n\nThe most notable W116 was the high-performance, limited-production [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|450 SEL 6.9]], which was introduced in 1975. This model boasted by far the largest engine installed in a post-war Mercedes-Benz (and any non-American production automobile) up to that time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/cars/lap-luxury-mercedes-s-class-w116 |title=In the lap of luxury: The Mercedes S-Class W116 &#124; Classic Driver Magazine |publisher=Classicdriver.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref> and also featured [[self-leveling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic suspension]].\n\nThe 300 SD sedan (American market only) had a turbocharged 3.0-litre [[Straight-five engine|inline-five]] [[diesel engine]] developed from the [[Mercedes-Benz C111|C111]] experimental vehicle. \n\nThe 450 SE was named the [[European Car of the Year]] in 1974, even though the W116 range was first introduced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in the fall of 1972.<ref name=KBp39>[[#MS16|Stjerna]], p. 39</ref> The W116 range became the first production car to use an electronic four-wheel multi-channel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] as an option from 1978 on.\n\nProduction totaled 473,035 units. The W116 was succeeded by the [[Mercedes-Benz W126|W126]] S-Class in 1979. The W116 was sold throughout Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia.\n\n==Models==\n[[File:1978 M110 2.8 Litre 6 cylinder Engine.jpg|thumb|1978 M110 Engine, Twin cam straight 6.

A slight power reduction was a result of this update. In 1978, a series of engine upgrades restored original performance levels with new fuel injection systems. Initially the early models (1973-1974) of the W116 with the Twin Cam inline 6 used the D-[[Jetronic]] fuels injection system with computers and MAP sensor that are both prone to failure after more than 20 years of use. From 1975 onward they used the [[K-Jetronic]] mechanical fuel injection system, a less complicated system that proved to be much more reliable in the long run and injectors cost 6x less than the D-jetronic system. The W116 equipped with the K-Jetronic system, used a cast-iron fuel distributor, which can be prone to rust over time if moisture or water is present in the fuel. This was changed to an alloy fuel distributor in the following model [[W126]] and is not subject to corrosion.\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Chassis code\n!Model Years\n!Model\n!Engine\n!No. built<ref name=\"Oswald\">{{cite book |title=Deutsche Autos 1945\u20131990, Band 4 |lang = de | last= Oswald |first=Werner | date =2003 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02131-5 |pages=80, 86}}</ref>\n|-\n|W116.020||1973\u20131980||280 S sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 122,848\n|-\n|W116.024||1973\u20131980||280 SE sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' I6 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 150,593\n|-\n|W116.025||1974\u20131980|| 280 SEL sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' I6 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|7,032\n|-\n|W116.028||1973\u20131980|| 350 SE sedan|| 3.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"|51,100\n|-\n|W116.029||1973\u20131980|| 350 SEL sedan|| 3.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|4,266\n|-\n|W116.032  ||1973\u20131980|| 450 SE sedan|| 4.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|41,604\n|-\n|W116.033  ||1973\u20131980|| 450 SEL sedan|| 4.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|59,578\n|-\n|W116.036||1975\u20131980|| [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|450 SEL 6.9]] || 6.9 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7,380\n|-\n|W116.120||1978\u20131980|| 300 SD sedan||  3.0 L [[Mercedes-Benz OM617 engine|OM617]] [[Straight-five engine|I5]] [[turbodiesel]] <br/> (United States and Canada only) || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 28,634\n|}\n\n=={{anchor|6.9}}450 SEL 6.9==\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 450SELI 0411.jpg\n| image2 = Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 US.jpg\n| caption2 = US market 450 SEL 6.9\n}}\n\nThe high-performance 450 SEL 6.9 version of the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse|S-Class]] was built on its own assembly line by [[Daimler-Benz]] in [[Stuttgart]], Germany and based on the long-wheelbase version of the W116 chassis. The model was generally referred to in the company's literature as the \"6.9\", to separate it from the regular 450 SEL.\n\nThe 6.9 was first shown to the motoring press at the [[Geneva Auto Show#1974|Geneva Auto Show]] in 1974, and produced between 1975 and 1981 in extremely limited numbers. It was billed as the flagship of the Mercedes-Benz car line, and the successor to [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s original high-performance sedan, the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3|300 SEL 6.3]]. The 6.9's successor\u2014the top of range [[Mercedes-Benz W126|500 SEL]]\u2014continued the 6.9's remarkable [[self-levelling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic]] suspension as an extra-cost option.\n\n===Special features===\nThe 6.9 was the first Mercedes-Benz to be fitted with the [[hydropneumatic]] [[self-levelling suspension]] system introduced by [[Citro\u00ebn]] in 1954, unlike the 600 and 6.3 which employed [[air suspension]]s. Using a combination of fluid-filled struts and nitrogen-filled pressure vessels or \"[[hydraulic accumulator|accumulators]]\" in lieu of conventional [[shock absorber]]s and springs, the system was pressurized by a hydraulic pump driven by the engine's timing chain. Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citro\u00ebn's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citro\u00ebn system thus might result in loss of suspension. Conversely, every unit of the 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven in the event of a hydraulic failure. The special [[hydraulic fluid]] required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Not only was the system totally self-adjusting, [[ride height]] could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50&nbsp;mm) for increased ground clearance.\n\nThe suspension system gave the {{convert|4200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} car the benefits of a both a [[ride quality|smooth ride]] and [[car handling|handling]] that allowed it, in the words of automotive journalist [[David E. Davis]], to be \"tossed about like a [[Mini]].\" The car also featured a model W3B 050 three-speed [[automatic transmission]] unique to the 6.9 and a standard ZF [[limited slip differential]] both for enhanced [[roadholding]] performance on dry pavement and enhanced [[traction (engineering)|traction]] in inclement weather.\n\nFour-wheel [[disc brake]]s and four-wheel independent suspension were standard on these top-of-the-line models. The [[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100 engine]] is a [[cast iron]] [[V8 engine|V8]] with single overhead camshafts which was a bigger version of the engine also used in the [[Mercedes-Benz 600]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3]]. Notable is the Bosch [[K-jetronic|K-Jetronic]] electromechanical [[fuel injection]], forged crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, and a \"[[dry sump]]\" engine [[lubrication]] system. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached to the inside of the tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at [[operating temperature]]. The non-American market trim version of the 6.9&nbsp;[[litre|l]] (6,834&nbsp;cc or 417&nbsp;in\u00b3) power plant was rated at {{convert|286|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and 405&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (549&nbsp;N\u00b7m) of [[torque]], helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final [[mechanical advantage|drive ratio]] necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000&nbsp;km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 relatively easy to maintain and service for its first 50,000 miles (80,500&nbsp;km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes, and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power steering filters.\n\n===Performance===\nTop speed was factory-rated at 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h), but some journalists testing the car saw speeds approaching 150&nbsp;mph (241&nbsp;km/h). Among those journalists was [[Brock Yates]]. Yates was approached by the factory to write promotional literature about the 6.9 for advertising purposes. He agreed under the condition that he could list the car's faults as well as its positives and create a genuine extensive review. Daimler-Benz agreed in turn, and Yates was given an American-market spec 6.9 to drive from [[Manhattan]] to the [[Road Atlanta]] grand prix race track in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. There, Yates would drive the car in as-arrived condition at racing speeds for a full 40 laps or just over 100 miles (160&nbsp;km). His complaint on this long drive on public roads was that the magnetic CB antenna blew off at 130 miles per hour. The only change made to the car upon its arrival at Road Atlanta was an adjustment of tire pressure. Driving 40 laps was a difficult task for the street-legal full size luxury sedan primarily designed and geared for comfortable [[Autobahn]] cruising. The 6.9 suffered no major mechanical problems and averaged a respectable 72&nbsp;mph (116&nbsp;km/h) throughout the test, completing it with little more than excess dust on the bodywork from the [[Michelin]] [[radial tyre|radial]] street tires on which the car was driven to Atlanta. Yates was so comfortable driving the 6.9 around the track that he reported having run at least one lap with the sunroof open and the radio on, but the high price of the car made him think better of such risky driving and he finished the test with the radio off and both hands on the wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/brochure/brockyates/index.html|title=6.9 Brochure \u2013 Brock Yates Story|work=m-100.cc}}</ref>\n\n===Price and interior features===\n[[File:450SEL6.9 dash.jpg|thumb|Interior]]\n\nAll of this technology came at a very high price. At a time when the most expensive [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]]s, the mid-sized [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] and [[full-size]]d [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] [[Cadillac Series 70#1971\u20131976|Series Seventy-Five]] [[limousine]] each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]s. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull suspension control knob just under the speedometer, a low suspension pressure warning and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled [[walnut]] veneer on the dash and console. The rest of the W116 lineup was trimmed in striated [[zebrano]] veneer.\n\nThe 6.9 lacked expected luxury touches such as power-adjustable outside mirrors or front seats, although a unique power rear seat, heated seats and even orthopedically designed front seats were options. Buyers outside North America could also opt for headlight wipers and washers and/or headlights with a special vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. There was also a new standard feature in 1976: most Mercedes-Benz automobiles that year were equipped with a sophisticated electronic climate control system developed for [[Chrysler Corporation]] for use in their top models. The system turned on the heater, air conditioner or both, depending on the thermostat's setting and ambient temperature, automatically maintaining whatever temperature the driver selected. The compressor was an American import as well, supplied by the Harrison division of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]].\n\nFar more modern than the contemporary Cadillac, which still had a [[live axle|live rear axle]], and both faster and larger inside than the either the Rolls-Royce or Cadillac, the 6.9 was indistinguishable from its W116 stablemates save for a modest \"6.9\" badge on the decklid and wider tires.<ref name=\"candd77\">{{citation|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/archive/mercedes-benz_450sel_6.9-archived_road_test|title=Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 \u2013 Archived Road Test|author=David E. Davis Jr.|date=July 1977|publisher=Car and Driver}}</ref> US models also had different bumper rubbers fitted to the more protruding \"park bench\" impact absorbing bumpers. As discreet as the badge was, it could be deleted/ordered with option 261 ''omission of the displacement figure on the trunk lid'' at extra cost for those who wanted to avoid attention either from drivers of other high-performance cars or from law enforcement. In the words of [[David E. Davis]], the 6.9 was \"a $50,000 exercise in going fast.\"\n\nStill, for fans of the discontinued 6.3 or for those who simply had to have a car which ''Car and Driver'' proclaimed to be \"the greatest Mercedes-Benz ever built,\" it seemed that money was no object. At its launch in 1975, the 450 SEL 6.9 cost [[German mark|DM]] 69,930. In the last year of production, 1979, the car was available at a price of DM 81,247. Even though this was far from inexpensive, the courage of the Mercedes-Benz strategists in launching the car onto the market paid off. A total of 7,380 units were built by 1980, and most of these were exported to the USA. This volume is quite respectable considering the overall sales trend of powerful luxury cars following the [[1973 energy crisis]].\n\n===Today===\nIn a poll conducted by Britain's ''Classic & Sports Car'' magazine and printed in their April 1999 edition, the Mercedes-Benz 6.9 ranked fourth on their list of the \"world's greatest [[sedan (car)|saloons]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/magazines/classicandsportscar_0499/index.html|title=Classic & Sports Car, April 1997 \u2013 Best Saloons Ever|work=m-100.cc|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129191324/http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/magazines/classicandsportscar_0499/index.html|archive-date=2018-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> The May 2004 edition of another British publication, ''Mercedes Enthusiast'' magazine, ranked the 6.9 number fifteen on their all-time top twenty list of great Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Even with such accolades, a 6.9 is a reasonably priced collectible automobile despite its rarity. The online NADA Used Car Guide lists a top value of US$40,000. At present, the market for cars of this type is somewhat soft, and a prime example can be had for considerably less. As is often the case with older cars that contain exotic engineering and parts unique to that one model, however, running and maintenance costs for a 6.9 can quickly overshadow a low initial purchase price.\n\n===== LeMons Racing =====\nIn September 2013, a 1979 W116 300 SD was campaigned in the [[24 Hours of LeMons]] at Carolina Motorsports Park, where it completed 166 laps at an average speed of 54.8 MPH.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylaps.com/en/classification/2961871|title=Classification \u2013 details \u2013 MYLAPS Sports Timing|work=mylaps.com}}</ref> It won the highest prize of the event, the Index of Effluency. Other than mild issues relating to brake and tire wear, no mechanical issues were encountered. After numerous modifications to handling, the car was again run in February 2014 at Barber Motorsports park in Birmingham, AL. It placed 44th, but turned 281 laps at an average pace of 59.6 MPH. One of the key advantages of the 300 SD in long distance racing is its exceptional fuel economy on track, where it burns just 2.5 GPH (Roughly 18MPG). In July 2014 it placed first in class at Sebring. It is still active in the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylaps.com/en/classification/2879916|title=Classification \u2013 details \u2013 MYLAPS Sports Timing|work=mylaps.com}}</ref>\n\n==Technical data==\nTechnical data Mercedes-Benz W116 <ref name=Oswald4>{{cite book |last=Oswald |first=Werner |authorlink= |title= Deutsche Autos 1945\u20131990, Band 4|year=2001 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02131-5}}</ref> (Manufacturer's figures except where stated)\n\n<div class=\"NavContent\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Mercedes-Benz\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|280&nbsp;S <br/> (W116 V28)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|280&nbsp;SE <br/>(W116 E28)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|350&nbsp;SE <br/>(W116 E35)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|450&nbsp;SE <br/>(W116 E45)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|450&nbsp;SEL 6.9 <br/>(W116 E69)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|300&nbsp;SD <br/>(W116 D30A)\n|- \n| Chassis code:&nbsp; || style=\"text-align:center;\"|116.020 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| SE: 116.024 <br/> SEL: 116.025 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|SE: 116.028 <br/> SEL: 116.029 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| SE: 116.032 <br/> SEL: 116.033 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|116.036 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|116.120\n|- \n| Produced:&nbsp; || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1972\u20131980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| SE: 1972 \u2013 1980 <br/> SEL: 1974 \u2212 1980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|SE: 1972 \u2013 1980 <br/> SEL: 1973 \u2212 1980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1972\u20131980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1975\u20131980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1977\u20131980\n|- \n| Engine:&nbsp; || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Straight-six engine|6-cylinder-inline engine]] ([[four-stroke]]), front-mounted || colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 90\u00b0 [[V8 engine|8-cylinder-V engine]] ([[four-stroke]]), front-mounted || style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Straight-5|5-cylinder-inline engine]] ([[four-stroke]]), front-mounted \n|- \n| Bore x Stroke:&nbsp; || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|86&nbsp;mm x 78.8&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|92&nbsp;mm x 65.8&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|92&nbsp;mm x 85&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|107&nbsp;mm x 95&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|90.9&nbsp;mm x 92.4&nbsp;mm\n|- \n| Displacement:&nbsp; || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2746 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"|3499 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"|4520 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"|6834 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3005 cc before 1979<br>2998 cc after 1979\n|- \n| Engine code:&nbsp; || style=\"text-align:center;\"|M110.922 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| D-Jet: M110.983 <br/> K-Jet: M110.985 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|D-Jet: M116.983 <br/> K-Jet: M116.985 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| D-Jet: M117.983 <br/> K-Jet: M117.986 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|M100.985 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|OM617.950\n|- \n| Max.

This system prevents the wheels from locking while braking. The system improves steering control during hard braking situations, and to shorten brake distances.\n* Strengthened body structure.

The model range initially included two versions of the M110 engine (Straight-six with 2746&nbsp;cc displacement)\u2014the 280 S (using a Solex carburetor) and the 280 SE (using Bosch D-Jetronic injection), plus the 350 SE, powered by the M116 engine (V8 with 3499&nbsp;cc displacement). After the 1973 Fuel Crisis, a long-wheelbase version of the 280 was added to the lineup.\n\nHalf a year later, in early 1973, two new models powered by the M117 engine (V8 with 4520&nbsp;cc displacement) were added to the range\u2014the 450 SE and the 450 SEL (with a 100&nbsp;mm longer body). The 450 had {{convert|225|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} in most markets, federalized cars offered {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while Swedish market cars had an [[Exhaust gas recirculation|EGR-valve]] and {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} until 1976.<ref name=KB0516/> The 450s received a plusher interior as well, with velour or leather seats rather than the checkered cloth of the lesser models. The door insides were also of a different design, being pulled up around the windows.<ref name=KBp42>[[#MS16|Stjerna]], p. 42</ref>\n\nThe most notable W116 was the high-performance, limited-production [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|450 SEL 6.9]], which was introduced in 1975. This model boasted by far the largest engine installed in a post-war Mercedes-Benz (and any non-American production automobile) up to that time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/cars/lap-luxury-mercedes-s-class-w116 |title=In the lap of luxury: The Mercedes S-Class W116 &#124; Classic Driver Magazine |publisher=Classicdriver.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref> and also featured [[self-leveling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic suspension]].\n\nThe 300 SD sedan (American market only) had a turbocharged 3.0-litre [[Straight-five engine|inline-five]] [[diesel engine]] developed from the [[Mercedes-Benz C111|C111]] experimental vehicle. \n\nThe 450 SE was named the [[European Car of the Year]] in 1974, even though the W116 range was first introduced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in the fall of 1972.<ref name=KBp39>[[#MS16|Stjerna]], p. 39</ref> The W116 range became the first production car to use an electronic four-wheel multi-channel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] as an option from 1978 on.\n\nProduction totaled 473,035 units. The W116 was succeeded by the [[Mercedes-Benz W126|W126]] S-Class in 1979. The W116 was sold throughout Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia.\n\n==Models==\n[[File:1978 M110 2.8 Litre 6 cylinder Engine.jpg|thumb|1978 M110 Engine, Twin cam straight 6.

A slight power reduction was a result of this update. In 1978, a series of engine upgrades restored original performance levels with new fuel injection systems. Initially the early models (1973-1974) of the W116 with the Twin Cam inline 6 used the D-[[Jetronic]] fuels injection system with computers and MAP sensor that are both prone to failure after more than 20 years of use. From 1975 onward they used the [[K-Jetronic]] mechanical fuel injection system, a less complicated system that proved to be much more reliable in the long run and injectors cost 6x less than the D-jetronic system. The W116 equipped with the K-Jetronic system, used a cast-iron fuel distributor, which can be prone to rust over time if moisture or water is present in the fuel. This was changed to an alloy fuel distributor in the following model [[W126]] and is not subject to corrosion.\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Chassis code\n!Model Years\n!Model\n!Engine\n!No. built<ref name=\"Oswald\">{{cite book |title=Deutsche Autos 1945\u20131990, Band 4 |lang = de | last= Oswald |first=Werner | date =2003 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02131-5 |pages=80, 86}}</ref>\n|-\n|W116.020||1973\u20131980||280 S sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 122,848\n|-\n|W116.024||1973\u20131980||280 SE sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' I6 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 150,593\n|-\n|W116.025||1974\u20131980|| 280 SEL sedan|| 2.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M110 engine|M110]]'' I6 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|7,032\n|-\n|W116.028||1973\u20131980|| 350 SE sedan|| 3.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"|51,100\n|-\n|W116.029||1973\u20131980|| 350 SEL sedan|| 3.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|4,266\n|-\n|W116.032  ||1973\u20131980|| 450 SE sedan|| 4.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|41,604\n|-\n|W116.033  ||1973\u20131980|| 450 SEL sedan|| 4.5 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"|59,578\n|-\n|W116.036||1975\u20131980|| [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|450 SEL 6.9]] || 6.9 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100]]'' V8 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7,380\n|-\n|W116.120||1978\u20131980|| 300 SD sedan||  3.0 L [[Mercedes-Benz OM617 engine|OM617]] [[Straight-five engine|I5]] [[turbodiesel]] <br/> (United States and Canada only) || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 28,634\n|}\n\n=={{anchor|6.9}}450 SEL 6.9==\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 450SELI 0411.jpg\n| image2 = Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 US.jpg\n| caption2 = US market 450 SEL 6.9\n}}\n\nThe high-performance 450 SEL 6.9 version of the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse|S-Class]] was built on its own assembly line by [[Daimler-Benz]] in [[Stuttgart]], Germany and based on the long-wheelbase version of the W116 chassis. The model was generally referred to in the company's literature as the \"6.9\", to separate it from the regular 450 SEL.\n\nThe 6.9 was first shown to the motoring press at the [[Geneva Auto Show#1974|Geneva Auto Show]] in 1974, and produced between 1975 and 1981 in extremely limited numbers. It was billed as the flagship of the Mercedes-Benz car line, and the successor to [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s original high-performance sedan, the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3|300 SEL 6.3]]. The 6.9's successor\u2014the top of range [[Mercedes-Benz W126|500 SEL]]\u2014continued the 6.9's remarkable [[self-levelling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic]] suspension as an extra-cost option.\n\n===Special features===\nThe 6.9 was the first Mercedes-Benz to be fitted with the [[hydropneumatic]] [[self-levelling suspension]] system introduced by [[Citro\u00ebn]] in 1954, unlike the 600 and 6.3 which employed [[air suspension]]s. Using a combination of fluid-filled struts and nitrogen-filled pressure vessels or \"[[hydraulic accumulator|accumulators]]\" in lieu of conventional [[shock absorber]]s and springs, the system was pressurized by a hydraulic pump driven by the engine's timing chain. Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citro\u00ebn's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citro\u00ebn system thus might result in loss of suspension. Conversely, every unit of the 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven in the event of a hydraulic failure. The special [[hydraulic fluid]] required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Not only was the system totally self-adjusting, [[ride height]] could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50&nbsp;mm) for increased ground clearance.\n\nThe suspension system gave the {{convert|4200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} car the benefits of a both a [[ride quality|smooth ride]] and [[car handling|handling]] that allowed it, in the words of automotive journalist [[David E. Davis]], to be \"tossed about like a [[Mini]].\" The car also featured a model W3B 050 three-speed [[automatic transmission]] unique to the 6.9 and a standard ZF [[limited slip differential]] both for enhanced [[roadholding]] performance on dry pavement and enhanced [[traction (engineering)|traction]] in inclement weather.\n\nFour-wheel [[disc brake]]s and four-wheel independent suspension were standard on these top-of-the-line models. The [[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100 engine]] is a [[cast iron]] [[V8 engine|V8]] with single overhead camshafts which was a bigger version of the engine also used in the [[Mercedes-Benz 600]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3]]. Notable is the Bosch [[K-jetronic|K-Jetronic]] electromechanical [[fuel injection]], forged crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, and a \"[[dry sump]]\" engine [[lubrication]] system. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached to the inside of the tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at [[operating temperature]]. The non-American market trim version of the 6.9&nbsp;[[litre|l]] (6,834&nbsp;cc or 417&nbsp;in\u00b3) power plant was rated at {{convert|286|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and 405&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (549&nbsp;N\u00b7m) of [[torque]], helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final [[mechanical advantage|drive ratio]] necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000&nbsp;km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 relatively easy to maintain and service for its first 50,000 miles (80,500&nbsp;km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes, and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power steering filters.\n\n===Performance===\nTop speed was factory-rated at 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h), but some journalists testing the car saw speeds approaching 150&nbsp;mph (241&nbsp;km/h). Among those journalists was [[Brock Yates]]. Yates was approached by the factory to write promotional literature about the 6.9 for advertising purposes. He agreed under the condition that he could list the car's faults as well as its positives and create a genuine extensive review. Daimler-Benz agreed in turn, and Yates was given an American-market spec 6.9 to drive from [[Manhattan]] to the [[Road Atlanta]] grand prix race track in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. There, Yates would drive the car in as-arrived condition at racing speeds for a full 40 laps or just over 100 miles (160&nbsp;km). His complaint on this long drive on public roads was that the magnetic CB antenna blew off at 130 miles per hour. The only change made to the car upon its arrival at Road Atlanta was an adjustment of tire pressure. Driving 40 laps was a difficult task for the street-legal full size luxury sedan primarily designed and geared for comfortable [[Autobahn]] cruising. The 6.9 suffered no major mechanical problems and averaged a respectable 72&nbsp;mph (116&nbsp;km/h) throughout the test, completing it with little more than excess dust on the bodywork from the [[Michelin]] [[radial tyre|radial]] street tires on which the car was driven to Atlanta. Yates was so comfortable driving the 6.9 around the track that he reported having run at least one lap with the sunroof open and the radio on, but the high price of the car made him think better of such risky driving and he finished the test with the radio off and both hands on the wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/brochure/brockyates/index.html|title=6.9 Brochure \u2013 Brock Yates Story|work=m-100.cc}}</ref>\n\n===Price and interior features===\n[[File:450SEL6.9 dash.jpg|thumb|Interior]]\n\nAll of this technology came at a very high price. At a time when the most expensive [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]]s, the mid-sized [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] and [[full-size]]d [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] [[Cadillac Series 70#1971\u20131976|Series Seventy-Five]] [[limousine]] each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]s. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull suspension control knob just under the speedometer, a low suspension pressure warning and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled [[walnut]] veneer on the dash and console. The rest of the W116 lineup was trimmed in striated [[zebrano]] veneer.\n\nThe 6.9 lacked expected luxury touches such as power-adjustable outside mirrors or front seats, although a unique power rear seat, heated seats and even orthopedically designed front seats were options. Buyers outside North America could also opt for headlight wipers and washers and/or headlights with a special vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. There was also a new standard feature in 1976: most Mercedes-Benz automobiles that year were equipped with a sophisticated electronic climate control system developed for [[Chrysler Corporation]] for use in their top models. The system turned on the heater, air conditioner or both, depending on the thermostat's setting and ambient temperature, automatically maintaining whatever temperature the driver selected. The compressor was an American import as well, supplied by the Harrison division of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]].\n\nFar more modern than the contemporary Cadillac, which still had a [[live axle|live rear axle]], and both faster and larger inside than the either the Rolls-Royce or Cadillac, the 6.9 was indistinguishable from its W116 stablemates save for a modest \"6.9\" badge on the decklid and wider tires.<ref name=\"candd77\">{{citation|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/archive/mercedes-benz_450sel_6.9-archived_road_test|title=Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 \u2013 Archived Road Test|author=David E. Davis Jr.|date=July 1977|publisher=Car and Driver}}</ref> US models also had different bumper rubbers fitted to the more protruding \"park bench\" impact absorbing bumpers. As discreet as the badge was, it could be deleted/ordered with option 261 ''omission of the displacement figure on the trunk lid'' at extra cost for those who wanted to avoid attention either from drivers of other high-performance cars or from law enforcement. In the words of [[David E. Davis]], the 6.9 was \"a $50,000 exercise in going fast.\"\n\nStill, for fans of the discontinued 6.3 or for those who simply had to have a car which ''Car and Driver'' proclaimed to be \"the greatest Mercedes-Benz ever built,\" it seemed that money was no object. At its launch in 1975, the 450 SEL 6.9 cost [[German mark|DM]] 69,930. In the last year of production, 1979, the car was available at a price of DM 81,247. Even though this was far from inexpensive, the courage of the Mercedes-Benz strategists in launching the car onto the market paid off. A total of 7,380 units were built by 1980, and most of these were exported to the USA. This volume is quite respectable considering the overall sales trend of powerful luxury cars following the [[1973 energy crisis]].\n\n===Today===\nIn a poll conducted by Britain's ''Classic & Sports Car'' magazine and printed in their April 1999 edition, the Mercedes-Benz 6.9 ranked fourth on their list of the \"world's greatest [[sedan (car)|saloons]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/magazines/classicandsportscar_0499/index.html|title=Classic & Sports Car, April 1997 \u2013 Best Saloons Ever|work=m-100.cc|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129191324/http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/magazines/classicandsportscar_0499/index.html|archive-date=2018-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> The May 2004 edition of another British publication, ''Mercedes Enthusiast'' magazine, ranked the 6.9 number fifteen on their all-time top twenty list of great Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Even with such accolades, a 6.9 is a reasonably priced collectible automobile despite its rarity. The online NADA Used Car Guide lists a top value of US$40,000. At present, the market for cars of this type is somewhat soft, and a prime example can be had for considerably less. As is often the case with older cars that contain exotic engineering and parts unique to that one model, however, running and maintenance costs for a 6.9 can quickly overshadow a low initial purchase price.\n\n===== Lemons Racing =====\nIn September 2013, a 1979 W116 300 SD was campaigned in the [[24 Hours of LeMons]] at Carolina Motorsports Park, where it completed 166 laps at an average speed of 54.8 MPH.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylaps.com/en/classification/2961871|title=Classification \u2013 details \u2013 MYLAPS Sports Timing|work=mylaps.com}}</ref> It won the highest prize of the event, the Index of Effluency. Other than mild issues relating to brake and tire wear, no mechanical issues were encountered. After numerous modifications to handling, the car was again run in February 2014 at Barber Motorsports park in Birmingham, AL. It placed 44th, but turned 281 laps at an average pace of 59.6 MPH. One of the key advantages of the 300 SD in long distance racing is its exceptional fuel economy on track, where it burns just 2.5 GPH (Roughly 18MPG). In July 2014 it placed first in class at Sebring. It is still active in the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylaps.com/en/classification/2879916|title=Classification \u2013 details \u2013 MYLAPS Sports Timing|work=mylaps.com}}</ref>\n\n==Technical data==\nTechnical data Mercedes-Benz W116 <ref name=Oswald4>{{cite book |last=Oswald |first=Werner |authorlink= |title= Deutsche Autos 1945\u20131990, Band 4|year=2001 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02131-5}}</ref> (Manufacturer's figures except where stated)\n\n<div class=\"NavContent\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Mercedes-Benz\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|280&nbsp;S <br/> (W116 V28)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|280&nbsp;SE <br/>(W116 E28)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|350&nbsp;SE <br/>(W116 E35)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|450&nbsp;SE <br/>(W116 E45)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|450&nbsp;SEL 6.9 <br/>(W116 E69)\n! style=\"width:14%;\"|300&nbsp;SD <br/>(W116 D30A)\n|- \n| Chassis code:&nbsp; || style=\"text-align:center;\"|116.020 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| SE: 116.024 <br/> SEL: 116.025 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|SE: 116.028 <br/> SEL: 116.029 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| SE: 116.032 <br/> SEL: 116.033 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|116.036 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|116.120\n|- \n| Produced:&nbsp; || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1972\u20131980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| SE: 1972 \u2013 1980 <br/> SEL: 1974 \u2212 1980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|SE: 1972 \u2013 1980 <br/> SEL: 1973 \u2212 1980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1972\u20131980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1975\u20131980 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1977\u20131980\n|- \n| Engine:&nbsp; || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Straight-six engine|6-cylinder-inline engine]] ([[four-stroke]]), front-mounted || colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 90\u00b0 [[V8 engine|8-cylinder-V engine]] ([[four-stroke]]), front-mounted || style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Straight-5|5-cylinder-inline engine]] ([[four-stroke]]), front-mounted \n|- \n| Bore x Stroke:&nbsp; || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|86&nbsp;mm x 78.8&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|92&nbsp;mm x 65.8&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|92&nbsp;mm x 85&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|107&nbsp;mm x 95&nbsp;mm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|90.9&nbsp;mm x 92.4&nbsp;mm\n|- \n| Displacement:&nbsp; || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2746 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"|3499 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"|4520 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"|6834 cc || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3005 cc before 1979<br>2998 cc after 1979\n|- \n| Engine code:&nbsp; || style=\"text-align:center;\"|M110.922 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| D-Jet: M110.983 <br/> K-Jet: M110.985 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|D-Jet: M116.983 <br/> K-Jet: M116.985 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| D-Jet: M117.983 <br/> K-Jet: M117.986 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|M100.985 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|OM617.950\n|- \n| Max.

The W116 featured a more stable security passenger cell with a stiffened roof frame structure.

The outlet, which is owned by Dick Broadcasting, operates at 107.5&nbsp;MHz with an ERP of 100&nbsp;kW.  It has studio facilities and offices in downtown Greensboro alongside its sister station [[WKRR]], and a transmitter site is near [[Stokesdale, North Carolina]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1958, '''WYFS''' became the first Winston-Salem station to play [[classical music]].

DJs on the air from 1975-1977 included Steve Gold (Marshall), Alan Cameron, Mitch Clarke, Nick Archer, Bruce Key, Ron Spivey, Kitty Kinnin, Reid Stott, Steve Norris, and Steve Day. Production chores were handled by Jack Shaw and Rowell Gormon. The late \u201970s era of WKZL\u2019s programming was a mix of Top 40 and album cuts formulated into playlists based on focus groups created under the direction of eccentric owner Bob Brown.\n\nProgram hosts included Morning Show Host Doug Paul, Rod Davis, Chris Angel, Kitty Kinnin, J.J. Hemingway, D.D. Thornton, and Chuck Holloway, who also served as Music Director. Doug Paul served as Program Director during his time at WKZL between 1978 and 1982. During this period, the station was pioneering music research that included weekly focus groups of 18- to 49-year-old listeners assembled by Owner Bob Brown and Sharon Paul. The format of the station was a unique hybrid of Deep Tracks, [[Top 40]] and [[Jazz]]. Local music artists were featured in the programming mix and live concerts were broadcast weekly via NBC's THE SOURCE and other radio program syndicators. Known for a keen spot production sound and aggressive demo sales, the WKZL of the late 70's won many local and regional advertising awards and had up to three full-time copywriters on staff.\n\nBrown eventually sold WAAA to '''Mutter Evans''', who made history at age 25 by becoming the youngest black woman to own a commercial radio station in the US. Soon afterwards Brown sold WKZL to Nationwide Broadcasting, while maintaining ownership of the building that housed both stations.\n\nWhen Nationwide took control and installed Station Manager Rick Fromme and Program Director Tom Daniels, the station changed its format to the more classic AOR ([[Album-oriented rock]]) under the guidance of the radio consultant firm Burkhart/Abrams. By 1982, WKZL was known by its slogan as \u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s Best Rock\u201d. The playlist was built around well-known stadium artists such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Who]], and [[Led Zeppelin]] along with Southern Rock favorites [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[the Allman Brothers Band]], and [[Molly Hatchet]]. Heavy metal artists [[AC/DC]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and copycat artists also shared the spotlight with AOR pop artists [[REO Speedwagon]] and [[Journey (band)|Journey]].\n\nSome of the original staff remained - including Chuck Holloway and Kitty Kinnin - but most of the new staff brought on board came from other AOR stations. DJs included DD Thornton, Danno Lopez, Charlie McGee, Tim Hogan and Neal Cassady.\n\nAlthough WKZL branded itself as a classic rock station, it also distinguished itself as a leader with a new music program launched in March 1982 called the \"New Generation Show\". Former WKZL DJ DD Thornton submitted a proposal for a one-hour Sunday evening show to introduce new, innovative artists to the classic rock audience. Her proposal was considered so risky WKZL had to present it to Burkhart/Abrams asking for approval. [[Lee Abrams]] granted approval to give the show a test run.\n\nThe show debuted in March 1982 on Sunday evenings from 11:00 to midnight. Among the featured artists were [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Pretenders]], and [[XTC]]. The show became so popular that station manager Fromme decided to expand the show from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 1:00&nbsp;a.m. Around the same time, local nightclub \"Casablanca\" asked to try a live version of the show on Monday nights. That weekly event drew large crowds and ran for several years. Eventually the \"New Generation Show\" was expanded to Sundays from 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 1:00&nbsp;a.m. and was live at several clubs in Winston-Salem and Greensboro.\n\nThe popularity of many of the new artists that were played on \"New Generation,\" the introduction of MTV, and the dedication of record and radio professionals who recognized the value of these new artists, prompted WKZL to open its format a bit and bring new artists such as X, the [[English Beat]], [[the Psychedelic Furs]], [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], [[Gary Numan]], [[Wall of Voodoo]], [[Duran Duran]], [[U2]], and [[R.E.M.]], into regular rotation. Because of Thornton's persistence, R.E.M.'s song \"Radio Free Europe\" was allowed into WKZL's playlist, making WKZL one of the first major commercial stations to play R.E.M.'s music in high rotation.\n\nWKZL went through a series of Program Directors grappling with the emergence of pop bands gaining popularity through MTV and how to balance these modern bands with the traditional \u201cclassic rock\u201d format. By 1984, the hard-edge sound gave way to the pop sounds of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Michael Jackson]], and other artists who frequented Billboard\u2019s Top 40 charts. On June 1st, 1985, WKZL became an affiliate of [[American Top 40]] with [[Casey Kasem]].\n\nWhile the \"New Generation Show\" remained popular, as the station format and management evolved towards mainstream, program creator and producer DD Thornton altered the program name to \"Choice Cuts\" as a way of keeping pace with WKZL's changing facade, although the show's format remained the same. Yet as WKZL's format increasingly moved away from rock and into [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]], the juxtaposition of a show featuring groundbreaking artists with formulaic hits became more incongruous. Thornton cancelled the show and eventually left WKZL.\n\nFor most of the 90s, WKZL called itself \"107.5 The Eagle\", playing [[adult contemporary music]]. For a brief time, the station was [[modern adult contemporary]], competing directly with \"[[WSMW|98-7 The Point]]\" (which changed to [[variety hits]] in 2005). Eventually the decision was made to return to [[Top 40]]. That came in 1999, around Labor Day weekend, when the station stunted, with recordings by management saying that the station was underperforming and that all the deejays were suspended until a new plan could be worked out. Morning man Jack Murphy was with the station from 1993 until 2012. The core of the Murphy in the Morning Show for most of the 90's was Jack, joined by Terrie Knight (who also did news) and Chris Kelly (who also produced the show). Eric Christopher (1996-1998) was a weekend part-timer who became the morning show producer. Knight and Kelly exited in 1999, when Kelly went to do the \"2 Guys Named Chris\" show on Dick Broadcasting's other property, Rock 92 ([[WKRR]]). Knight went to do afternoons (at KZL), where she stayed until 2005 when she left the station and radio, altogether. Following Kelly and Knight, Jack Murphy was joined by cohosts Jeff Corbett, Britt Whitmire (1999-2003), Heather B. (2000-2002), Josie Cothran (2002-2007), John Garrett (2003-2004), Josh \"in the Box\" Anderson (2004-2010), Jared Pike (2007-current) and Katie O'Brien Tesh (2005-current). \n\nJared (Jared Pike) and Katie (Katie Tesh) took over the morning show in June 2012 and quickly took the show back to #1 in key demographics.  Known for Jared and Katie's Phonetap, War of the Roses, Torture Tuesday, Hot Seat, Late Night in the Morning, Hollywood News, Man Panel,Urban Dictionary Word of the Day, Local Talent Tuesday, sharing everything about their lives and crazy on the street stunts -  keeping their audience engaged and entertained. They are joined on air by Man Kisser Matt (Matt Wells),intern Hugs O'Houlihan (Thomas Marvin), and Jason Goodman. They can be heard Monday through Saturday from 6\u201310am and Jared and Katie also host their very own Hometown Countdown on Sundays from 8am\u201311am where they countdown the top 40 hits in the Triad. Josie Cothran follows Jared and Katie in the morning from 10a-3p, Jason Goodman hosts afternoon drive from 3p-7p, Tripper is the night host from 7p\u2013midnight and overnights are covered by Chase Myers.\n\n==Jared and Katie in the Morning Show Milestones==\n\nIn 2012 Jared and Katie came up with a viral video campaign idea they dubbed \"Fat Girl Dancing\" on their YouTube Channel that consisted of having Producer [[Whitney Way Thore|Whitney]] dance to Top 40 music. After about a year of posting these videos on their page the videos went viral and Producer Whitney was offered and accepted her own reality show on TLC, ''[[My Big Fat Fabulous Life]]''. In 2013, Jared lost a Super Bowl bet to intern Hugs O'Houlihan and had to stand on the streets of Winston-Salem in nothing but an adult diaper.  The story made international news including being featured as the top story on AOL.com. Katie surprised the audience in Jan of 2014 by announcing her engagement to now husband Ben; they wed during a gorgeous ceremony in October 2014. She later surprised the audience in February 2015 by announcing that she was expecting a baby in August of the same year. Conversely Jared surprised their audience once again by announcing his proposal and marriage to Kelli (Hunt) Pike in December 2015. The show made industry news in 2015 with their iLove 1075 KZL Awards Show running during a competitors award show on NBC. Jared and Katie in the Morning were honored in June 2017 by the North Carolina Association of Broadcasters (NCAB) with the Morning Show of the Year Award in a large market for the entire state of North Carolina. 107.5 WKZL also took the award home for Best Radio Station in a large market for the state of North Carolina at the NCAB award show.  Jared and Katie in the Morning is now syndicated to both Savannah, Georgia and Myrtle Beach radio markets.\n\n==Controversy==\nIn August 2015, Jared Pike and Jason Goodman were suspended after an on-air altercation erupted during \"the baby bottle challenge.\"<ref name=\"bottle1\">{{cite web|title=Morning radio hosts fight during \"Baby Bump Challenge\"|url=http://legacy.wtsp.com/story/entertainment/2015/08/13/morning-radio-hosts-fight-during-baby-bump-challenge/31611903/|publisher=[[WTSP]]|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref> After apologizing to the staff and to their audience they were back on the air a week later.<ref name=\"bottle2\">{{cite web|title=Jared And Katie -- And Jason Goodman Return From Suspensions At WKZL/Greensboro|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/144571/jared-and-katie----and-jason-goodman-return-from-s|publisher=All Access Music Group|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{FM station data|WKZL}}\n\n{{Piedmont Triad radio}}\n{{Contemporary Hit Radio Stations in North Carolina}}\n\n{{coord|36.276|N|79.941|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Piedmont Triad|KZL]]\n[[Category:Contemporary hit radio stations in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=July 2008}}\n{{Infobox Radio Station |\n  name       = WKZL | \n  image      = 1075_KZL_Station_Logo.png|\n  city       = [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] |\n  area       = [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] / [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]] / [[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]]|\n  branding  = 1075 KZL|\n  slogan    = The #1 Hit Music Station|\n  frequency = 107.5 [[Megahertz|MHz]] |\n  airdate   = 1958 (as WYFS)|\n  format    = [[Top 40 Mainstream]] |\n  erp       = 100,000 [[watt]]s|\n  haat      = 1000 feet (305 meters) |\n  class     = C |\n  facility_id = 16891|\n  callsign_meaning = |\n  former_callsigns = WYFS (1958-1966)<br>WAAA-FM (1966-1972)<br>WSGH (1972-1975)|\n  owner     = Dick Broadcasting |\n  webcast = [http://player.radioloyalty.com/Universal/stationPreview.php?stationID=6708 Listen Live] |\n  website   = [http://www.1075kzl.com  1075kzl.com] |\n}}\n'''WKZL''' (\"1075 KZL\") is a [[Top 40 Mainstream]] station licensed to [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] and serves the [[Piedmont Triad]] area, which also includes [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] and [[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]].

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.
