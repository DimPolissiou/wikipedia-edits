Dagobert also commissioned a new shrine to house the saint's remains, which was created by his chief councillor, [[Saint Eligius|Eligius]], a [[goldsmith]] by training. An early ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'' of Saint Eligius describes the shrine:\n\n:Above all, Eligius fabricated a mausoleum for the holy martyr Denis in the city of Paris with a wonderful marble [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] over it marvelously decorated with gold and gems. He composed a crest [at the top of a tomb] and a magnificent frontal and surrounded the throne of the altar with golden axes in a circle. He placed golden apples there, round and jeweled. He made a pulpit and a gate of silver and a roof for the throne of the altar on silver axes. He made a covering in the place before the tomb and fabricated an outside altar at the feet of the holy martyr. So much industry did he lavish there, at the king's request, and poured out so much that scarcely a single ornament was left in [[Gaul]] and it is the greatest wonder of all to this very day.<ref>\n''Vita S.

Before the term \"Gothic\" came into common use, it was known as the \"French Style\" (''Opus Francigenum'').\n\nAs it now stands, the church is a large cruciform building of \"basilica\" form; that is, it has a central nave with lower aisles and [[clerestory]] windows. It has an additional aisle on the northern side formed of a row of chapels. The west front has three portals, a rose window and one tower, on the southern side. The eastern end, which is built over a crypt, is [[apse|apsidal]], surrounded by an [[ambulatory]] and a [[chevet]] of nine radiating chapels. The basilica retains stained glass of many periods (although most of the panels from Suger's time have been removed for long-term conservation and replaced with photographic transparencies), including exceptional modern glass, and a set of twelve [[misericords]]. The basilica measures 108 meters long, and its width is 39 meters.\n\n===The Carolingian church===\nLittle is known about the earliest buildings on the site. The first church mentioned in the chronicles was begun in 754 under [[Pepin the Short]] and completed under [[Charlemagne]], who was present at its consecration in 775. By 832 the Abbey had been granted a remunerative whaling concession on the [[Cotentin Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=DeSmet|first1=W.M.A.|title=Mammals in the Seas: General papers and large cetaceans.

Before leaving, Christ healed the leper, tearing off his diseased skin to reveal a perfect complexion underneath. A misshapen patch on a marble column was said to be the leper's former skin, which stuck there when Christ discarded it. Having been consecrated by Christ, the fabric of the building was itself regarded as sacred.<ref>Lindy Grant, ''Abbot Suger of St.Denis: Church and State in Early Twelfth-century France'', Longman, 1998</ref>\n\n===The Early Gothic Rebuilding===\n[[Abbot Suger]] (c. 1081 \u2013 1151), friend and confidant of French kings and Abbot of St Denis from 1122, began work around 1135 on rebuilding and enlarging the abbey to which he had been given as an [[oblate]] at the age of 10. In his famous account of the work undertaken during his administration, Suger was careful to explain and justify his decision to rebuild the church, complaining at length about the parlous state of the old structure and its inability to cope with the crowds of pilgrims visiting the shrine of St Denis, particularly \n[[File:FelixBenoistStDenis.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Apse and northern facade, lithography by Felix Benoist]]\n<blockquote>...on special days such as the feast of the blessed Denis [...] when the narrowness of the place forced women to run to the altar on the heads of men as on a pavement with great anguish and confusion.<ref>''Fordham College Medieval Sourcebook'', [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/sugar.html \"Abbot Suger: ON WHAT WAS DONE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION\"], Chapter XXV: Concerning the First Addition to the Church</ref></blockquote>\n\nSuger's fascination with light was not merely aesthetic. Like many French clerics in the 12th century AD, he was a follower of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], a 6th-century mystic who equated the slightest reflection or glint with divine light. When renovated, the Saint-Denis basilica included Suger's own words carved in the nave: \"For bright is that which is brightly coupled with the bright/and bright is the noble edifice which is pervaded by the new light.\"<ref>Bruce Watson, Light: A Radiant History from Creation to the Quantum Age. Bloomsbury, 2016, p 52.</ref>\n\nIt is important to emphasise that Suger was the patron of the rebuilding of St Denis but not the architect, as was often assumed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>Lindy Grant, ''Abbot Suger of St. Denis: Church and State in Early Twelfth-Century France'', Addison Wesley Longman Limited, 1998</ref> In fact it appears that two distinct architects, or master masons, were involved in the 12th-century changes. Both remain anonymous but their work can be distinguished on stylistic grounds. The first, who was responsible for the initial work at the western end, favoured conventional Romanesque capitals and moulding profiles with rich and individualised detailing. His successor, who completed the western facade and upper stories of the [[narthex]], before going on to build the new choir, displayed a more restrained approach to decorative effects, relying on a simple repertoire of motifs, which may have proved more suitable for the lighter Gothic style that he helped to create.<ref>Stephen Gardner, \"Two Campaigns in Suger's Western Block at Saint-Denis\", ''Art Bulletin'', Vol.44, part 4, 1984, pp. 574\u201387</ref>\n\n====First Phase: the west front, ''c''. 1135\u20131140====\n[[File:P3050226 Basilique Saint-Denis Portail central reduct.JPG|thumb|right|Tympanum and lintel of the central portal, showing Last Judgement iconography (c. 1135, restored 1839)]]\nSuger began his rebuilding project at the western end of St Denis, demolishing the old Carolingian [[westwork]], with its single, centrally located door. He extended the old nave westwards by an additional four bays and added a massive western narthex, incorporating a new fa\u00e7ade and three chapels on the first floor level. This new fa\u00e7ade, {{convert|34|m}} wide and {{convert|20|m}} deep, has three portals, the central one larger than those either side, reflecting the relative width of the central nave and lateral aisles. This tripartite arrangement was clearly influenced by the late 11th-century fa\u00e7ades of the abbey churches of [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|St Etienne]] and [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|La Trinit\u00e9, Caen]],  with which it also shared a three-story elevation and [[flanking tower]]s.  Only the south tower survives; the north tower was dismantled following a tornado which struck in 1846.\n\nThe major innovation in the fa\u00e7ade at St Denis is the way the unknown architects have chosen to emphasise the divisions between the different parts with massive vertical buttresses separating the three doorways and horizontal string-courses and window arcades clearly marking out the divisions.  This clear delineation of parts was to influence subsequent west fa\u00e7ade designs as a common theme in the development of Gothic architecture and a marked departure from the Romanesque.  The [[rose window]] at the centre of the upper story of the west portal was also innovative and influential.  Although small circular windows (oculi) within triangular tympana were common on the west facades of Italian Romanesque churches, this was probably the first example of a rose window within a square frame, which was to become a dominant feature of the Gothic facades of northern France (soon to be imitated at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and many others).<ref>William Chester Jordan, ''A Tale of Two Monasteries: Westminster and Saint-Denis in the thirteenth century'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2009) Chapters 2\u20137.</ref> The overall design of the fa\u00e7ade has an obvious resemblance to a Roman city gatehouse (an impression strengthened by the buttresses and by the [[Battlement|crenellations]] around the top), which helps to emphasise the traditional notion of great churches as earthly embodiments of the [[New Jerusalem|Heavenly City]], as described in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].\n\n[[File:Basilique Saint-Denis portail nord tympan archivolte.jpg|thumb|left|The tympanum of the portal of the north transept depicts the martyrdom of St Denis.]]\n[[File:St denis montfauconD.jpg|thumb|upright|Some of Montfaucon's drawings of the Old Testament jamb figures from the west fa\u00e7ade (destroyed 1771)]]\n\nThe many influential features of the new fa\u00e7ade include the tall, thin statues of Old Testament prophets and kings attached to columns (''jamb figures'') flanking the portals (destroyed in 1771 but recorded in [[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon]]'s drawings). These were also adopted at the cathedrals of Paris and Chartres, constructed a few years later, and became a feature of almost every Gothic portal thereafter. Above the doorways, the central [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] was carved with [[Christ in Majesty]] displaying his wounds with the dead emerging from their tombs below. Scenes from the martyrdom of St Denis were carved above the south (right hand) portal, while above the north portal was a mosaic (lost), even though this was, as Suger put it 'contrary to the modern custom'. Of the original sculpture, very little remains, most of what is now visible being the result of rather clumsy restoration work in 1839.<ref>. Pamela Blum, ''Early Gothic Saint-Denis: Restorations and Survivals'', Berkeley, 1992</ref> Some fragments of the original sculptures survive in the collection of the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]].\nThe portals themselves were sealed by gilded bronze doors, ornamented with scenes from Christ's Passion and clearly recording Suger's patronage with the following inscription; \n<blockquote>\nFor the glory of the church which nurtured and raised him, Suger strove for the glory of the church, Sharing with you what is yours, oh martyr Denis. He prays that by your prayers he should become a sharer in Paradise. The year when it was consecrated was the one thousand, one hundred and fortieth year of the Word.<ref>''Fordham College Medieval Sourcebook'', [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/sugar.html \"Abbot Suger: ON WHAT WAS DONE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION\"], Chapter XXVII: Concerning the Cast and Gilded Doors</ref>\n</blockquote> \nOn the lintel below the great tympanum showing the Last Judgement, beneath a carved figure of the kneeling Abbot, was inscribed the more modest plea;\n<blockquote>Receive, stern Judge, the prayers of your Suger, Let me be mercifully numbered among your sheep.</blockquote>\n\nSuger's western extension was completed in 1140 and the three new chapels in the narthex were consecrated on 9 June of that year.\n\n[[File:Coeur de la Basilique de Saint-Senis.jpg|thumb|left|The choir]]\n\n====Second Phase: the new choir, 1140\u20131144====\nOn completion of the west front, Abbot Suger moved on to the reconstruction of the eastern end, leaving the Carolingian nave in use.  He wanted a ''choir'' (chancel) that would be suffused with light. To achieve his aims, Suger's masons drew on the several new elements which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture: the pointed arch, the [[rib vault]], the [[ambulatory]] with radiating chapels, the clustered columns supporting ribs springing in different directions and the [[flying buttress]]es which enabled the insertion of large [[clerestory]] windows.\n\nIt was the first time that these features had all been drawn together, and the style evolved radically from the previous Romanesque architecture by the lightness of the structure and the unusually large size of the stained glass windows. \n\n[[File:st denis nave.jpg|thumb|right|The [[nave]]]]\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King.<ref>H.

Both the nave and the upper parts of Suger's choir were replaced in the [[Rayonnant]] Gothic style. From the start it appears that Abbot Odo, with the approval of the Regent [[Blanche of Castile]] and her son, the young [[King Louis IX]], planned for the new nave and its large crossing to have a much clearer focus as the French 'royal necropolis'. That plan was fulfilled in 1264 when the bones of 16 former kings and queens were relocated to new tombs arranged around the crossing, eight Carolingian monarchs to the south and eight Capetians to the north.<ref>Georgia Sommers Wright, \"A Royal Tomb Program in the Reign of St Louis\", in ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol.56, No.2 (Jun 1974) pp.224\u201343</ref> These tombs, featuring lifelike carved recumbent [[Effigy|effigies]] or ''gisants'' lying on raised bases, were badly damaged during the French revolution though all but two were subsequently restored by Viollet le Duc in 1860.\n\nThe dark Romanesque nave, with its thick walls and small window-openings, was rebuilt using the very latest techniques, in what is now known as [[French Gothic architecture|Rayonnant Gothic]]. This new style, which differed from Suger's earlier works as much as they had differed from their Romanesque precursors, reduced the wall area to an absolute minimum. Solid masonry was replaced with vast window openings filled with brilliant stained glass (all destroyed in the Revolution) and interrupted only by the most slender of bar [[tracery]]\u2014not only in the clerestory but also, perhaps for the first time, in the normally dark [[triforium]] level. The upper facades of the two much-enlarged transepts were filled with two spectacular 12m-wide [[rose window]]s.<ref>Christopher Wilson, ''The Gothic Cathedral: The Architecture of the Great Church 1130\u20131530'', Thames & Hudson, 1992</ref> \nAs with Suger's earlier rebuilding work, the identity of the architect or master mason remains unknown. Although often attributed to [[Pierre de Montreuil]], the only evidence for his involvement is an unrelated document of 1247 which refers to him as 'a mason from Saint-Denis'.<ref>Caroline Bruzelius, ''The Thirteenth-century Church at St-Denis'', New Haven, 1985</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===The Valois Mortuary Chapel===\nA plan of circa 1700 by F\u00e9libien shows the [[Valois Chapel]], a large mortuary chapel in the form of a domed colonnaded \"[[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]\", adjoining the north transept of the basilica and containing the tomb of the [[House of Valois|Valois]].<ref>[http://vrcoll.fa.pitt.edu/medart/image/France/St-denis/plans/sdenmap.html Images of Medieval Art and Architecture \u2013 F\u00e9libien] accessed March 29, 2009</ref>\n\n===St. Denis and the French Revolution===\nDue to its connections to the French monarchy and proximity to Paris, the abbey of Saint-Denis was a prime target of revolutionary vandalism. The medieval monastic buildings were demolished in 1792. Although the church itself was left standing, it was deconsecrated, its treasury confiscated and its reliquaries and liturgical furniture melted down for their metallic value (although some objects, including a chalice and aquamanile donated to the abbey in Suger\u2019s time, were successfully hidden and survive to this day) and the royal tombs desecrated. The jamb figures of the fa\u00e7ade representing [[Old Testament]] royalty, mistakenly identified as images of royal French kings and queens, were removed from the portals and the tympana sculpture defaced. The tombs and effigies were relocated to the Mus\u00e9e des Monuments Fran\u00e7ais by Alexandre Lenoir in 1798.\n\nThe church was reconsecrated by Napol\u00e9on in 1806 and the tomb sculptures returned to Saint-Denis after the restoration of the monarchy. The church, including the architectural sculpture and stained glass windows (of which very little medieval glass survives) was heavily restored in the mid-nineteenth century by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], the same architect responsible for the restoration of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. The present location of the tomb effigies does not correspond to their medieval locations.<ref>http://www.aviewoncities.com/paris/basiliquesaintdenis.htm</ref>\n\n===Removal and reconstruction of the north tower===\nIn the early 1840s, cracks appeared in the north tower's masonry following several extreme weather events. A violent storm on 19 August 1845, notable for spawning a tornado, proved critical, and the tower's walls were soon found to have flexed and become dangerously unstable. With [[Fran\u00e7ois Debret]]'s reconstructive works, carried out after an 1837 lightning strike, proving inadequate, in February 1846 the authorities decided to \"temporarily\" dismantle the north tower to avoid a catastrophic collapse, with the stones stored for later reconstruction.<ref name=\"L'affaire\">{{cite web |title=L'affaire de la tour nord : La querelle des anciens et des modernes |url=https://www.tourisme93.com/basilique/l-affaire-de-la-tour-nord.html |website=Basilique Cath\u00e9drale de Saint-Denis |publisher=Seine-Saint-Denis Tourisme |accessdate=26 September 2018 |language=French}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2016, 170 years after the North Tower's dismantlement and following several false starts, the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] again proposed its reconstruction after concluding it was technically feasible\u2014albeit without public funding.<ref name=\"parisien_tour_nord\">{{cite news |last1=Bourdon |first1=Gwena\u00ebl |title=Basilique Saint-Denis : le chantier de la fl\u00e8che frein\u00e9 dans son \u00e9lan |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/saint-denis-93200/basilique-saint-denis-le-chantier-de-la-fleche-freine-dans-son-elan-30-01-2017-6640494.php |accessdate=26 September 2018 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |date=30 January 2017 |language=French}}</ref> An association, ''Suivez la fl\u00e8che'' (\"Follow the Spire\"), chaired by [[Patrick Braouezec]], has since been established to support the reconstruction, with the aim of raising the necessary funds by opening the reconstruction works to the general public, along the model of the [[Gu\u00e9delon Castle]].

Some monarchs, like [[Clovis I]] (465\u2013511), were not originally buried at this site. The remains of Clovis I were exhumed from the despoiled [[Abbey of St Genevieve]] which he founded.\n\nThe abbey church contains some fine examples of [[cadaver tomb]]s. The effigies of many of the kings and queens are on their tombs, but their bodies were removed during the [[French Revolution]]. The ancient monarchs were removed in August 1793 to celebrate the revolutionary Festival of Reunion, then the Bourbon and Valois monarchs were removed to celebrate the execution of [[Marie Antoinette]] in October 1793. The bodies were dumped into three trenches and covered with lime to destroy them.<ref name=lindsay>{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Suzanne Glover|title=The Revolutionary Exhumations at St-Denis, 1793|url=http://mavcor.yale.edu/conversations/essays/revolutionary-exhumations-st-denis-1793|website=Center for the Study of Material & Visual Cultures of Religion|publisher=Yale University}}</ref> Archaeologist [[Alexandre Lenoir]] saved many of the monuments by claiming them as artworks for his [[Monument historique|Museum of French Monuments]].

In 1817 the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|restored Bourbons]] ordered the mass graves to be opened, but only portions of three bodies remained intact. The remaining bones from 158 bodies were collected into an [[ossuary]] in the crypt of the church, behind marble plates bearing their names.<ref name=lindsay/>\n\n=== Bourbon crypt ===\n[[File:Louis XVI et Marie-Antoinette.jpg|thumb|Louis XVI And Marie-Antoinette d'Autriche|left|250px|Memorial to King [[Louis XVI]] and Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], sculptures (1830) by [[Edme Gaulle]] and [[Pierre Petitot]]]]\n\nThe bodies of the [[Guillotine|beheaded]] King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], his wife [[Marie Antoinette of Austria]], and his sister [[Madame \u00c9lisabeth]] were not initially buried in Saint-Denis, but rather in the churchyard of the [[Church of the Madeleine|Madeleine]], where they were covered with [[quicklime]]. The body of the [[Louis XVII of France|Dauphin]], who died of illness and neglect at the hands of his revolutionary captors, was buried in an unmarked grave in a Parisian churchyard near the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]. During Napoleon's exile in [[Elba]], the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|restored Bourbons]] ordered a search for the corpses of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The few remains, a few bones that were presumably the king's and a clump of greyish matter containing a lady's garter, were found on 21 January 1815, brought to Saint-Denis and buried in the new Bourbon [[crypt]].\n\n[[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]], upon his death in 1824, was buried in the center of the crypt, near the graves of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The coffins of royal family members who died between 1815 and 1830 were also placed in the vaults. Under the direction of architect [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], famous for his work on [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], church monuments that had been taken to the Museum of French Monuments were returned to the church. The corpse of [[Louis VII of France|King Louis VII]], who had been buried at [[Barbeau Abbey]] and whose tomb had not been touched by the revolutionaries, was brought to Saint-Denis and buried in the crypt. In 2004, the mummified heart of the Dauphin, the boy who would have been [[Louis XVII]], was sealed into the wall of the crypt.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Furniture==\n===Organ===\n[[File:Basilique_Saint-Denis_02.jpg|thumb|right|The Cavaill\u00e9-Coll organ of the Cathedral-Basilica of Saint-Denis]]\nThe organ of the Basilica of Saint-Denis was the first organ built by [[Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll]] in 1841, when he was 23 years old. It contains numerous innovations opening the romantic area, in particular the very first [[Barker lever]].

(It was not used for the coronations of kings, that function being reserved for the [[Notre-Dame de Reims|Cathedral of Reims]]; however, [[France|French]] Queens were commonly crowned there.) \"Saint-Denis\" soon became the abbey church of a growing monastic complex.\n\nIn the 12th century, the [[Abbot Suger]] rebuilt portions of the abbey church using innovative structural and decorative features. In doing so, he is said to have created the first truly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building.<ref>Banister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.</ref> The basilica's 13th-century nave is the prototype for the [[Rayonnant]] Gothic style, and provided an architectural model for many medieval cathedrals and abbeys of northern [[France]], [[Germany]], [[England]] and a great many other countries.\n\nThe abbey church became a cathedral in 1966 and is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint-Denis|Bishop of Saint-Denis]], [[Pascal Michel Ghislain Delannoy]].

He was decapitated on the hill of [[Montmartre]] in the mid-third century with two of his followers, and is said to have subsequently carried his head to the site of the current church, indicating where he wanted to be buried.

Dagobert also commissioned a new shrine to house the saint's remains, which was created by his chief councillor, [[Saint Eligius|Eligius]], a [[goldsmith]] by training. An early ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'' of Saint Eligius describes the shrine:\n\n:Above all, Eligius fabricated a mausoleum for the holy martyr Denis in the city of Paris with a wonderful marble [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] over it marvelously decorated with gold and gems. He composed a crest [at the top of a tomb] and a magnificent frontal and surrounded the throne of the altar with golden axes in a circle. He placed golden apples there, round and jeweled. He made a pulpit and a gate of silver and a roof for the throne of the altar on silver axes. He made a covering in the place before the tomb and fabricated an outside altar at the feet of the holy martyr. So much industry did he lavish there, at the king's request, and poured out so much that scarcely a single ornament was left in [[Gaul]] and it is the greatest wonder of all to this very day.<ref>\n''Vita S.

Before the term \"Gothic\" came into common use, it was known as the \"French Style\" (''Opus Francigenum'').\n\nAs it now stands, the church is a large cruciform building of \"basilica\" form; that is, it has a central nave with lower aisles and [[clerestory]] windows. It has an additional aisle on the northern side formed of a row of chapels. The west front has three portals, a rose window and one tower, on the southern side. The eastern end, which is built over a crypt, is [[apse|apsidal]], surrounded by an [[ambulatory]] and a [[chevet]] of nine radiating chapels. The basilica retains stained glass of many periods (although most of the panels from Suger's time have been removed for long-term conservation and replaced with photographic transparencies), including exceptional modern glass, and a set of twelve [[misericords]]. The basilica measures 108 meters long, and its width is 39 meters.\n\n===The Carolingian church===\nLittle is known about the earliest buildings on the site. The first church mentioned in the chronicles was begun in 754 under [[Pepin the Short]] and completed under [[Charlemagne]], who was present at its consecration in 775. By 832 the Abbey had been granted a remunerative whaling concession on the [[Cotentin Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=DeSmet|first1=W.M.A.|title=Mammals in the Seas: General papers and large cetaceans.

Before leaving, Christ healed the leper, tearing off his diseased skin to reveal a perfect complexion underneath. A misshapen patch on a marble column was said to be the leper's former skin, which stuck there when Christ discarded it. Having been consecrated by Christ, the fabric of the building was itself regarded as sacred.<ref>Lindy Grant, ''Abbot Suger of St.Denis: Church and State in Early Twelfth-century France'', Longman, 1998</ref>\n\n===The Early Gothic Rebuilding===\n[[Abbot Suger]] (c. 1081 \u2013 1151), friend and confidant of French kings and Abbot of St Denis from 1122, began work around 1135 on rebuilding and enlarging the abbey to which he had been given as an [[oblate]] at the age of 10. In his famous account of the work undertaken during his administration, Suger was careful to explain and justify his decision to rebuild the church, complaining at length about the parlous state of the old structure and its inability to cope with the crowds of pilgrims visiting the shrine of St Denis, particularly \n[[File:FelixBenoistStDenis.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Apse and northern facade, lithography by Felix Benoist]]\n<blockquote>...on special days such as the feast of the blessed Denis [...] when the narrowness of the place forced women to run to the altar on the heads of men as on a pavement with great anguish and confusion.<ref>''Fordham College Medieval Sourcebook'', [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/sugar.html \"Abbot Suger: ON WHAT WAS DONE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION\"], Chapter XXV: Concerning the First Addition to the Church</ref></blockquote>\n\nSuger's fascination with light was not merely aesthetic. Like many French clerics in the 12th century AD, he was a follower of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], a 6th-century mystic who equated the slightest reflection or glint with divine light. When renovated, the Saint-Denis basilica included Suger's own words carved in the nave: \"For bright is that which is brightly coupled with the bright/and bright is the noble edifice which is pervaded by the new light.\"<ref>Bruce Watson, Light: A Radiant History from Creation to the Quantum Age. Bloomsbury, 2016, p 52.</ref>\n\nIt is important to emphasise that Suger was the patron of the rebuilding of St Denis but not the architect, as was often assumed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>Lindy Grant, ''Abbot Suger of St. Denis: Church and State in Early Twelfth-Century France'', Addison Wesley Longman Limited, 1998</ref> In fact it appears that two distinct architects, or master masons, were involved in the 12th-century changes. Both remain anonymous but their work can be distinguished on stylistic grounds. The first, who was responsible for the initial work at the western end, favoured conventional Romanesque capitals and moulding profiles with rich and individualised detailing. His successor, who completed the western facade and upper stories of the [[narthex]], before going on to build the new choir, displayed a more restrained approach to decorative effects, relying on a simple repertoire of motifs, which may have proved more suitable for the lighter Gothic style that he helped to create.<ref>Stephen Gardner, \"Two Campaigns in Suger's Western Block at Saint-Denis\", ''Art Bulletin'', Vol.44, part 4, 1984, pp. 574\u201387</ref>\n\n====First Phase: the west front, ''c''. 1135\u20131140====\n[[File:P3050226 Basilique Saint-Denis Portail central reduct.JPG|thumb|right|Tympanum and lintel of the central portal, showing Last Judgement iconography (c. 1135, restored 1839)]]\nSuger began his rebuilding project at the western end of St Denis, demolishing the old Carolingian [[westwork]], with its single, centrally located door. He extended the old nave westwards by an additional four bays and added a massive western narthex, incorporating a new fa\u00e7ade and three chapels on the first floor level. This new fa\u00e7ade, {{convert|34|m}} wide and {{convert|20|m}} deep, has three portals, the central one larger than those either side, reflecting the relative width of the central nave and lateral aisles. This tripartite arrangement was clearly influenced by the late 11th-century fa\u00e7ades of the abbey churches of [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|St Etienne]] and [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|La Trinit\u00e9, Caen]],  with which it also shared a three-story elevation and [[flanking tower]]s.  Only the south tower survives; the north tower was dismantled following a tornado which struck in 1846.\n\nThe major innovation in the fa\u00e7ade at St Denis is the way the unknown architects have chosen to emphasise the divisions between the different parts with massive vertical buttresses separating the three doorways and horizontal string-courses and window arcades clearly marking out the divisions.  This clear delineation of parts was to influence subsequent west fa\u00e7ade designs as a common theme in the development of Gothic architecture and a marked departure from the Romanesque.  The [[rose window]] at the centre of the upper story of the west portal was also innovative and influential.  Although small circular windows (oculi) within triangular tympana were common on the west facades of Italian Romanesque churches, this was probably the first example of a rose window within a square frame, which was to become a dominant feature of the Gothic facades of northern France (soon to be imitated at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and many others).<ref>William Chester Jordan, ''A Tale of Two Monasteries: Westminster and Saint-Denis in the thirteenth century'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2009) Chapters 2\u20137.</ref> The overall design of the fa\u00e7ade has an obvious resemblance to a Roman city gatehouse (an impression strengthened by the buttresses and by the [[Battlement|crenellations]] around the top), which helps to emphasise the traditional notion of great churches as earthly embodiments of the [[New Jerusalem|Heavenly City]], as described in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].\n\n[[File:Basilique Saint-Denis portail nord tympan archivolte.jpg|thumb|left|The tympanum of the portal of the north transept depicts the martyrdom of St Denis.]]\n[[File:St denis montfauconD.jpg|thumb|upright|Some of Montfaucon's drawings of the Old Testament jamb figures from the west fa\u00e7ade (destroyed 1771)]]\n\nThe many influential features of the new fa\u00e7ade include the tall, thin statues of Old Testament prophets and kings attached to columns (''jamb figures'') flanking the portals (destroyed in 1771 but recorded in [[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon]]'s drawings). These were also adopted at the cathedrals of Paris and Chartres, constructed a few years later, and became a feature of almost every Gothic portal thereafter. Above the doorways, the central [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] was carved with [[Christ in Majesty]] displaying his wounds with the dead emerging from their tombs below. Scenes from the martyrdom of St Denis were carved above the south (right hand) portal, while above the north portal was a mosaic (lost), even though this was, as Suger put it 'contrary to the modern custom'. Of the original sculpture, very little remains, most of what is now visible being the result of rather clumsy restoration work in 1839.<ref>. Pamela Blum, ''Early Gothic Saint-Denis: Restorations and Survivals'', Berkeley, 1992</ref> Some fragments of the original sculptures survive in the collection of the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]].\nThe portals themselves were sealed by gilded bronze doors, ornamented with scenes from Christ's Passion and clearly recording Suger's patronage with the following inscription; \n<blockquote>\nFor the glory of the church which nurtured and raised him, Suger strove for the glory of the church, Sharing with you what is yours, oh martyr Denis. He prays that by your prayers he should become a sharer in Paradise. The year when it was consecrated was the one thousand, one hundred and fortieth year of the Word.<ref>''Fordham College Medieval Sourcebook'', [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/sugar.html \"Abbot Suger: ON WHAT WAS DONE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION\"], Chapter XXVII: Concerning the Cast and Gilded Doors</ref>\n</blockquote> \nOn the lintel below the great tympanum showing the Last Judgement, beneath a carved figure of the kneeling Abbot, was inscribed the more modest plea;\n<blockquote>Receive, stern Judge, the prayers of your Suger, Let me be mercifully numbered among your sheep.</blockquote>\n\nSuger's western extension was completed in 1140 and the three new chapels in the narthex were consecrated on 9 June of that year.\n\n[[File:Coeur de la Basilique de Saint-Senis.jpg|thumb|left|The choir]]\n\n====Second Phase: the new choir, 1140\u20131144====\nOn completion of the west front, Abbot Suger moved on to the reconstruction of the eastern end, leaving the Carolingian nave in use.  He wanted a ''choir'' (chancel) that would be suffused with light. To achieve his aims, Suger's masons drew on the several new elements which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture: the pointed arch, the [[rib vault]], the [[ambulatory]] with radiating chapels, the clustered columns supporting ribs springing in different directions and the [[flying buttress]]es which enabled the insertion of large [[clerestory]] windows.\n\nIt was the first time that these features had all been drawn together, and the style evolved radically from the previous Romanesque architecture by the lightness of the structure and the unusually large size of the stained glass windows. \n\n[[File:st denis nave.jpg|thumb|right|The [[nave]]]]\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King.<ref>H.

Both the nave and the upper parts of Suger's choir were replaced in the [[Rayonnant]] Gothic style. From the start it appears that Abbot Odo, with the approval of the Regent [[Blanche of Castile]] and her son, the young [[King Louis IX]], planned for the new nave and its large crossing to have a much clearer focus as the French 'royal necropolis'. That plan was fulfilled in 1264 when the bones of 16 former kings and queens were relocated to new tombs arranged around the crossing, eight Carolingian monarchs to the south and eight Capetians to the north.<ref>Georgia Sommers Wright, \"A Royal Tomb Program in the Reign of St Louis\", in ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol.56, No.2 (Jun 1974) pp.224\u201343</ref> These tombs, featuring lifelike carved recumbent [[Effigy|effigies]] or ''gisants'' lying on raised bases, were badly damaged during the French revolution though all but two were subsequently restored by Viollet le Duc in 1860.\n\nThe dark Romanesque nave, with its thick walls and small window-openings, was rebuilt using the very latest techniques, in what is now known as [[French Gothic architecture|Rayonnant Gothic]]. This new style, which differed from Suger's earlier works as much as they had differed from their Romanesque precursors, reduced the wall area to an absolute minimum. Solid masonry was replaced with vast window openings filled with brilliant stained glass (all destroyed in the Revolution) and interrupted only by the most slender of bar [[tracery]]\u2014not only in the clerestory but also, perhaps for the first time, in the normally dark [[triforium]] level. The upper facades of the two much-enlarged transepts were filled with two spectacular 12m-wide [[rose window]]s.<ref>Christopher Wilson, ''The Gothic Cathedral: The Architecture of the Great Church 1130\u20131530'', Thames & Hudson, 1992</ref> \nAs with Suger's earlier rebuilding work, the identity of the architect or master mason remains unknown. Although often attributed to [[Pierre de Montreuil]], the only evidence for his involvement is an unrelated document of 1247 which refers to him as 'a mason from Saint-Denis'.<ref>Caroline Bruzelius, ''The Thirteenth-century Church at St-Denis'', New Haven, 1985</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===The Valois Mortuary Chapel===\nA plan of circa 1700 by F\u00e9libien shows the [[Valois Chapel]], a large mortuary chapel in the form of a domed colonnaded \"[[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]\", adjoining the north transept of the basilica and containing the tomb of the [[House of Valois|Valois]].<ref>[http://vrcoll.fa.pitt.edu/medart/image/France/St-denis/plans/sdenmap.html Images of Medieval Art and Architecture \u2013 F\u00e9libien] accessed March 29, 2009</ref>\n\n===St. Denis and the French Revolution===\nDue to its connections to the French monarchy and proximity to Paris, the abbey of Saint-Denis was a prime target of revolutionary vandalism. The medieval monastic buildings were demolished in 1792. Although the church itself was left standing, it was deconsecrated, its treasury confiscated and its reliquaries and liturgical furniture melted down for their metallic value (although some objects, including a chalice and aquamanile donated to the abbey in Suger\u2019s time, were successfully hidden and survive to this day) and the royal tombs desecrated. The jamb figures of the fa\u00e7ade representing [[Old Testament]] royalty, mistakenly identified as images of royal French kings and queens, were removed from the portals and the tympana sculpture defaced. The tombs and effigies were relocated to the Mus\u00e9e des Monuments Fran\u00e7ais by Alexandre Lenoir in 1798.\n\nThe church was reconsecrated by Napol\u00e9on in 1806 and the tomb sculptures returned to Saint-Denis after the restoration of the monarchy. The church, including the architectural sculpture and stained glass windows (of which very little medieval glass survives) was heavily restored in the mid-nineteenth century by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], the same architect responsible for the restoration of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. The present location of the tomb effigies does not correspond to their medieval locations.<ref>http://www.aviewoncities.com/paris/basiliquesaintdenis.htm</ref>\n\n===Removal and reconstruction of the north tower===\nIn the early 1840s, cracks appeared in the north tower's masonry following several extreme weather events. A violent storm on 19 August 1845, notable for spawning a tornado, proved critical, and the tower's walls were soon found to have flexed and become dangerously unstable. With [[Fran\u00e7ois Debret]]'s reconstructive works, carried out after an 1837 lightning strike, proving inadequate, in February 1846 the authorities decided to \"temporarily\" dismantle the north tower to avoid a catastrophic collapse, with the stones stored for later reconstruction.<ref name=\"L'affaire\">{{cite web |title=L'affaire de la tour nord : La querelle des anciens et des modernes |url=https://www.tourisme93.com/basilique/l-affaire-de-la-tour-nord.html |website=Basilique Cath\u00e9drale de Saint-Denis |publisher=Seine-Saint-Denis Tourisme |accessdate=26 September 2018 |language=French}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2016, 170 years after the North Tower's dismantlement and following several false starts, the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] again proposed its reconstruction after concluding it was technically feasible\u2014albeit without public funding.<ref name=\"parisien_tour_nord\">{{cite news |last1=Bourdon |first1=Gwena\u00ebl |title=Basilique Saint-Denis : le chantier de la fl\u00e8che frein\u00e9 dans son \u00e9lan |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/saint-denis-93200/basilique-saint-denis-le-chantier-de-la-fleche-freine-dans-son-elan-30-01-2017-6640494.php |accessdate=26 September 2018 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |date=30 January 2017 |language=French}}</ref> An association, ''Suivez la fl\u00e8che'' (\"Follow the Spire\"), chaired by [[Patrick Braouezec]], has since been established to support the reconstruction, with the aim of raising the necessary funds by opening the reconstruction works to the general public, along the model of the [[Gu\u00e9delon Castle]].

Some monarchs, like [[Clovis I]] (465\u2013511), were not originally buried at this site. The remains of Clovis I were exhumed from the despoiled [[Abbey of St Genevieve]] which he founded.\n\nThe abbey church contains some fine examples of [[cadaver tomb]]s. The effigies of many of the kings and queens are on their tombs, but their bodies were removed during the [[French Revolution]]. The ancient monarchs were removed in August 1793 to celebrate the revolutionary Festival of Reunion, then the Bourbon and Valois monarchs were removed to celebrate the execution of [[Marie Antoinette]] in October 1793. The bodies were dumped into three trenches and covered with lime to destroy them.<ref name=lindsay>{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Suzanne Glover|title=The Revolutionary Exhumations at St-Denis, 1793|url=http://mavcor.yale.edu/conversations/essays/revolutionary-exhumations-st-denis-1793|website=Center for the Study of Material & Visual Cultures of Religion|publisher=Yale University}}</ref> Archaeologist [[Alexandre Lenoir]] saved many of the monuments by claiming them as artworks for his [[Monument historique|Museum of French Monuments]].

In 1817 the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|restored Bourbons]] ordered the mass graves to be opened, but only portions of three bodies remained intact. The remaining bones from 158 bodies were collected into an [[ossuary]] in the crypt of the church, behind marble plates bearing their names.<ref name=lindsay/>\n\n=== Bourbon crypt ===\n[[File:Louis XVI et Marie-Antoinette.jpg|thumb|Louis XVI And Marie-Antoinette d'Autriche|left|250px|Memorial to King [[Louis XVI]] and Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], sculptures (1830) by [[Edme Gaulle]] and [[Pierre Petitot]]]]\n\nThe bodies of the [[Guillotine|beheaded]] King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], his wife [[Marie Antoinette of Austria]], and his sister [[Madame \u00c9lisabeth]] were not initially buried in Saint-Denis, but rather in the churchyard of the [[Church of the Madeleine|Madeleine]], where they were covered with [[quicklime]]. The body of the [[Louis XVII of France|Dauphin]], who died of illness and neglect at the hands of his revolutionary captors, was buried in an unmarked grave in a Parisian churchyard near the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]. During Napoleon's exile in [[Elba]], the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|restored Bourbons]] ordered a search for the corpses of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The few remains, a few bones that were presumably the king's and a clump of greyish matter containing a lady's garter, were found on 21 January 1815, brought to Saint-Denis and buried in the new Bourbon [[crypt]].\n\n[[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]], upon his death in 1824, was buried in the center of the crypt, near the graves of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The coffins of royal family members who died between 1815 and 1830 were also placed in the vaults. Under the direction of architect [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], famous for his work on [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], church monuments that had been taken to the Museum of French Monuments were returned to the church. The corpse of [[Louis VII of France|King Louis VII]], who had been buried at [[Barbeau Abbey]] and whose tomb had not been touched by the revolutionaries, was brought to Saint-Denis and buried in the crypt. In 2004, the mummified heart of the Dauphin, the boy who would have been [[Louis XVII]], was sealed into the wall of the crypt.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Furniture==\n===Organ===\n[[File:Basilique_Saint-Denis_02.jpg|thumb|right|The Cavaill\u00e9-Coll organ of the Cathedral-Basilica of Saint-Denis]]\nThe organ of the Basilica of Saint-Denis was the first organ built by [[Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll]] in 1841, when he was 23 years old. It contains numerous innovations opening the romantic area, in particular the very first [[Barker lever]]. With 3 [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedals]], it is protected by the [[Monument historique]] label.
