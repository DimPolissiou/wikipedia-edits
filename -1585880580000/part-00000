It belonged to the estate of the Aba clan. After 1370 Aba Estates in the area became the property of King [[Sigismund of Luxemburg|Sigismund]] and then of Queen [[Mary of Hungary|Mary]]. At this time Sziksz\u00f3 was already a royal town. The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church of the town was also built around this time.\n\nIn the 16th century Sziksz\u00f3 and its landowners converted to the [[Protestant]] faith and its church became a Protestant one.\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman occupation of Hungary]] the town was ransacked and burnt down several times. The citizens fortified the strongest building of the town, the church. Several battles of the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars]] were fought in and around the town. In 1588 there was a battle near the town, where the Hungarian army defeated the Turks. In 1679 the town witnessed another battle, this time against the imperial army of the [[Habsburg]]s; this battle too brought Hungarian victory but the imperials burnt down the town as revenge.\n\nDuring the freedom fight against Habsburg rule in 1848, a third battle was fought near Sziksz\u00f3. Again the Hungarians won.\n\nIn 1852, a house caught fire and the whole town burnt down. Rebuilding the town was very expensive and the citizens couldn't afford the expenses of Sziksz\u00f3 being classified as a town, so in 1866, they asked the government to re-classify Sziksz\u00f3 as a [[village]].\n\nIn 1920, after the [[Treaty of Trianon]], [[Ko\u0161ice]] (Kassa in Hungarian) became part of [[Czechoslovakia]], and Sziksz\u00f3 became the capital of [[Aba\u00faj-Torna]] county.

It belonged to the estate of the Aba clan. After 1370 Aba Estates in the area became the property of King [[Sigismund of Luxemburg|Sigismund]] and then of Queen [[Mary of Hungary|Mary]]. At this time Sziksz\u00f3 was already a royal town. The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church of the town was also built around this time.\n\nIn the 16th century Sziksz\u00f3 and its landowners converted to the [[Protestant]] faith and its church became a Protestant one.\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman occupation of Hungary]] the town was ransacked and burnt down several times. The citizens fortified the strongest building of the town, the church. Several battles of the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars]] were fought in and around the town. In 1588 there was a battle near the town, where the Hungarian army defeated the Turks. In 1679 the town witnessed another battle, this time against the imperial army of the [[Habsburg]]s; this battle too brought Hungarian victory but the imperials burnt down the town as revenge.\n\nDuring the freedom fight against Habsburg rule in 1848, a third battle was fought near Sziksz\u00f3. Again the Hungarians won.\n\nIn 1852, a house caught fire and the whole town burnt down. Rebuilding the town was very expensive and the citizens couldn't afford the expenses of Sziksz\u00f3 being classified as a town, so in 1866, they asked the government to re-classify Sziksz\u00f3 as a [[village]].\n\nIn 1920, after the [[Treaty of Trianon]], [[Ko\u0161ice]] (Kassa in Hungarian) became part of [[Czechoslovakia]], and Sziksz\u00f3 became the capital of [[Aba\u00faj-Torna]] county.
