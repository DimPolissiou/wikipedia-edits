She also had three half-siblings: Sarah, Nadir and Saad. She and her siblings grew up in [[Islands Brygge]], a district area in Copenhagen.  At age 13, Natasja first started her music career in Copenhagen, where she performed live with her long-time friend, Danish singer [[Karen Mukupa]] and [[McEmzee]] under the name [[No Name Requested]]. The band broke up in 1996. \nNatasja was also inspired by Jamaican culture and music. During that period, she performed along with [[Queen Latifah]] and gained popularity in Jamaica. In 1998 at age 24, while in training to become a professional jockey, she fell off her horse, slowing her career.\n\nNatasja later became the first female jockey to win a horse race in [[Sudan]]. In 2006, she won the reggae/Irie FM Big Break Contest in Jamaica, which gave her a new start and a big boost in her music career.\n\n==Personal life==\nAs a child, Saad had a love for nature and for horses, which led her to become a professional jockey as a young adult. \nAt age 7, she went to [[Sudan]] with her father to get in touch with her family on her father's side. \nSaad was also inspired by [[Jamaican culture]] and [[Music of Jamaica|music]] during her youth, which led to her becoming a reggae and dancehall singer as an adult.\n<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE475245/natasja-portraet-den-lille-fighter-fra-bryggen/ Natasja-portr\u00e6t: Den lille fighter fra Bryggen].

Her father moved to Denmark to study. He learned the Danish language quickly and became a Danish citizen. Natasja's parents soon divorced, and her father moved back to Sudan. She also had three half-siblings: Sarah, Nadir and Saad. It is uncertain that her family members are still alive. She and her siblings grew up in [[Islands Brygge]], a district area in Copenhagen. As a child, she had a love for nature and for horses, which led her to become a professional jockey as a young adult. \nAt age 7, she went to [[Sudan]] with her father to get in touch with her family on her father's side. At age 13, Natasja first started her music career in Copenhagen, where she performed live with her long-time friend, Danish singer [[Karen Mukupa]] and [[McEmzee]] under the name [[No Name Requested]]. The band broke up in 1996. \nNatasja was also inspired by Jamaican culture and music. During that period, she performed along with [[Queen Latifah]] and gained popularity in Jamaica. In 1998 at age 24, while in training to become a professional jockey, she fell off her horse, slowing her career.\n\nNatasja later became the first female jockey to win a horse race in [[Sudan]]. In 2006, she won the reggae/Irie FM Big Break Contest in Jamaica, which gave her a new start and a big boost in her music career.\n<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE475245/natasja-portraet-den-lille-fighter-fra-bryggen/ Natasja-portr\u00e6t: Den lille fighter fra Bryggen].

From its beginnings in 1892 as a small grocery store, it has grown to include 415 stores chain-wide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stop & Shop |url=https://www.aholddelhaize.com/en/brands/united-states/stop-shop/ |website=AholdDelhaize.com |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStop & Shop has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] supermarket operator [[Ahold]] since 1995 and was part of the [[Stop & Shop/Giant-Landover]] division with sister chain [[Giant-Landover]] between 2004 and 2011. Ahold announced on June 24, 2015, that it would merge with [[Brussels]]-based [[Delhaize Group]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] grocery store conglomerate whose U.S. grocery operations included [[Hannaford Brothers Company|Hannaford]] of [[Scarborough, Maine]] and [[Food Lion]] of [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. The merger was completed on July 24, 2016, with the new holding company being named [[Ahold Delhaize]].\n\n==History==\n===Beginning===\nStop & Shop's roots can be traced back to 1892, when Solomon and Jeanie Rabinowitz opened a grocery shop, called the \"Greenie Store\", at 134 Salem Street, in Boston's [[North End, Boston|North End]]. This store lasted at this location until 1908.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northendboston.com/north-end-history-volume-4/ |title=North End History: Our Jewish Heritage |first=Guild |last=Nichols |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> According to the company's web site, Stop & Shop was founded in 1914 in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], Massachusetts by the [[Rabinovitz/Rabb family|Rabinowitz family]] as the Economy Grocery Stores Company. Four years later, the store adopted the new self-service supermarket model recently pioneered by [[Piggly Wiggly]]. A second store opened later in 1914, several stores opened a year later and by 1917, the chain had 15 stores. Initially the stores sold only grocery items but soon after added meats, produce, milk, dairy, and some frozen foods. Like [[A & P]], they were pioneers of the modern grocery store selling all types of food items under one roof. Stores were 10,000 to 15,000 square feet and in downtown and inner city areas in the [[Boston]] and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] metro areas. The chain had grown to 86 supermarkets by 1946, when the name was officially changed to Stop & Shop, Inc.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stopandshop.com/about/ |title=About Us |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1950s\u20131970s===\nIn 1959, Stop & Shop had 100 stores by opening in Natick, Massachusetts. In 1961, Stop & Shop purchased the now-defunct [[department store]] chain [[Bradlees]], based in Connecticut. Later, in the 60s, they bought the three-store chain ORBIT'S stores and merged them into Bradlees. Stop & Shop stores in Massachusetts were opening in suburban areas and in shopping plazas. In the early 1950s, Stop & Shop entered Connecticut and Rhode Island, in the early 1960s in New York, and the late 1960s in New Jersey. With Bradlees in the company, Stop & Shop began offering non-food items in their supermarkets. In many areas Stop & Shop and Bradlees were adjacent, allowing one-stop shopping; several of these combination stores were designated Family Centers. Stop & Shop also operated the Medi-Mart pharmacy chain and the Perkins Tobacco chain.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980, Stop & Shop had supermarkets in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and southern New York state. The stores were then typical in size at about {{convert|30000|sqft|m2}} on average. Many were next door to their then-co-owned Bradlees Department stores. In the New York and Philadelphia metro areas, Stop & Shop was not able to compete successfully. In 1982, Stop & Shop exited New Jersey, selling most of the stores that were profitable to [[A&P]], which would use these stores to replace their aging fleet of stores. A few stores were sold to [[ShopRite (United States)|Shop Rite]] owners as well as [[Foodtown]] owners. Other stores were closed and converted to other uses. In New York State, they sold some of their stores to A&P while selling others to [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]] and closing others, converting them also to other uses.\n\nIn 1982, Stop & Shop built its first superstore in the [[Pembroke, Massachusetts]], area. Superstores were between {{convert|45000|sqft|m2}} and {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}}. In addition to traditional supermarket offerings, these stores featured bakeries, pharmacies, moderate selections of general merchandise one would not expect to find at a supermarket, expanded deli departments, cafes, and a salad bar. Some of these stores would feature a bank, expanded liquor and beer, video rentals, etc. Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, the traditional supermarkets were converted into superstores. Some were remodeled, others were torn down and a new store rebuilt in the same location, while others were closed and replaced with a superstore within two miles. By 1990, Stop & Shop operated in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and in the Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts. areas, with one store in New York state.\n\nIn the late 1980s, following an attempt hostile takeover bid by [[Herbert Haft]]'s [[Dart Drug|Dart Group]], The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company was acquired by [[leveraged buyout]] specialists [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] and was taken private. Shortly thereafter, Medi-Mart was sold to Walgreens; Bradlees was spun off as its own corporation. After several years, while KKR explored merger possibilities with Safeway (which it also controlled at the time), Stop & Shop was sold at public offering.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Image:Super Stop & Shop 1024.jpg|thumb|A typical older location, using the old logo, since replaced. This location is in [[Yonkers, New York]].]]\n\nStop & Shop was acquired by the American branch of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] food giant [[Ahold]] in 1995. Ahold had previously acquired First National Supermarkets, whose '''Edwards Super Food Stores''' and '''[[Finast]]''' chains also had a strong presence in Connecticut; Ahold planned to operate both Edwards and Stop & Shop there. However, in the wake of the acquisition, [[Connecticut Attorney General]] [[Richard Blumenthal]] raised [[antitrust]] questions, as Stop & Shop and Edwards combined had more than half of the grocery share in Connecticut. Following negotiations with Blumenthal, Ahold decided to convert its New England stores to the Stop & Shop banner, while selling some locations to other chains such as [[Shaw's]], [[ShopRite (United States)|Shop Rite]], and [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]]. Ahold also began building a few stores under the Edwards Super Food Stores banner in New York state and New Jersey. Ahold also acquired 26 independent Mayfair [[Foodtown (United States)|Foodtown]] stores in that area, converting them to Edwards. In 1998 and 1999, several Super Stop & Shop stores were built in the Poughkeepsie area.\n\n[[File:Stop & Shop.JPG|thumb|A newer Stop & Shop in [[Saugus, Massachusetts]].]]\n\nIn 1999, Ahold announced its plan to acquire [[Pathmark]] supermarkets. Under that deal Edwards stores would be renamed Pathmark along with both sets of Giant stores. Late in 2000, after Grand Union was about to enter [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy and liquidate (by coincidence that the Bradlees chain was liquidating), Ahold walked away from the Pathmark deal; it proposed acquiring many of the Grand Union locations instead. At that point, Ahold continued the transition of its Edwards stores, converting all of its New York and New Jersey locations to the Stop & Shop format late in 2000. In 2001, Ahold acquired most of the Grand Union locations in New Jersey and New York state south of Kingston. These were all renamed Stop & Shop. Other locations went to other supermarket chains, non-food chains, or closed altogether. In 2003, Ahold acquired many of the A&P Foodmart locations in the [[Hartford, Connecticut]] area, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and the one remaining New Hampshire store. Other A&P locations in that region closed or were sold to other supermarket chains. In 2004, Ahold integrated Stop & Shop Supermarkets with [[Giant Food of Landover, Maryland|Giant Food LLC]] and created one combined company with the name of [[Stop & Shop/Giant-Landover]].\n\nIn 1994, Giant-Landover began northern expansion by opening stores in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[New Jersey]] under the '''Super G''' trade name. This was done to differentiate itself from future sister company Giant Food Stores of [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. During 2005, the newly formed Stop & Shop/Giant made the decision to phase out the Super G name in New Jersey and Delaware. In New Jersey, four Super G stores were shuttered and the remaining eight stores were converted to the '''Super Stop & Shop''' banner and became a part of Stop & Shop's New York Sales Division in an attempt to revive sales at the stores. These stores continued to underperform and were subsequently sold in 2007 to ShopRite franchise owners.  The Delaware Super G stores were to be remodeled under the Super Stop & Shop format and reopened under the Super Giant banner. Super G stores in Pennsylvania were generally close to Giant-Carlisle locations and were converted to Giant of Carlisle stores but continued to be unionized unlike most of the other Carlisle bannered stores.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2006, Stop & Shop signed a contract with [[Starbucks]], placing the coffee shop chain's licensed stores inside certain supermarkets. Many Stop & Shop stores feature [[Dunkin' Donuts]] outlets inside the store. Also in May 2006, Stop & Shop began piloting the Shopping Buddy program in select stores in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The Shopping Buddy is a [[Personal shopping assistants|personal shopping assistant]] that allows customers to track their purchases and to do in-cart bagging as they move through the store.\n\nIn October 2007, Stop & Shop launched an advertising campaign which was intended to have users submit stories and videos to a website detailing their grocery store experiences. The campaign was significant in that it is an early example of a regional traditional brand employing [[Web 2.0]] concepts such as [[user-generated content]] to promote their stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/expand-brand-community-online/122867 |title=Expand your brand community online |first=Patrick |last=Hanlon |publisher=Advertising Age |date=January 7, 2008 |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Stop & Shop made an attempt to expand further into northern New England. They built, but did not operate, a single [[Vermont]] store in Rutland before selling it to rival supermarket operator [[Delhaize]]. Delhaize opened the store under its [[Hannaford Bros. Co.|Hannaford]] banner in February 2008.\n\nIn July 2007, Stop & Shop opened a single [[Maine]] store in Kennebunk. The store was closed in October 2009, citing slow sales as the primary reason. At the same time, they abandoned plans to build a second Maine store in Portland.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://updates.pressherald.mainetoday.com/updates/stop-shop-backing-out-of-maine |title=Stop & Shop backing out of Maine |newspaper=Portland Press Herald |date=October 6, 2009 |access-date=April 21, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227172806/http://updates.mainetoday.com/updates/stop-shop-backing-out-of-maine |archive-date=February 27, 2012}}</ref> [[Delhaize]] purchased the vacant Kennebunk location in December 2009 and later reopened the property under the [[Hannaford Bros.

The restrictions state that the property cannot be used to sell fresh fruits and vegetables, baked goods, dairy products, frozen foods, fish, poultry, and meat. The restrictions remain in effect for a total of 99 years. The property, which was purchased by Daniel J. Quirk and developed as a car dealership, sits directly across the highway from a Super Stop & Shop.<ref name=\"CapeCod\">{{cite news |url=https://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20150906/NEWS/150909695 |title=Stop & Shop's land grab on Cape Cod |first=Madeleine |last=List |date=September 6, 2015|access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> In 2003 Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who has since become a U.S. senator, opened an investigation into Stop & Shop for its land-acquisition practices and allegations of anti-competitive behavior in the early 1990s, said Jaclyn Falkowskie, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Attorney General. Investigators, however, found that Stop & Shop\u2019s actions did not violate the state\u2019s antitrust laws and the investigation was closed, she said. Regardless of the strategy's legality, consumer advocates find fault because it limits the potential number of supermarkets in an area, reducing competition and selection for consumers.<ref name=\"CapeCod\" /> Another shell company with ties to Stop & Shop placed similar deed restrictions on a property in Harwich before selling it to Eastward Homes Business Trust in 2006. The wording is materially similar, going so far as to list specific brands of pet food under restriction. The restrictions can remain in place for up to 90 years.<ref name=\"CapeCod\" />\n\n==Contract negotiations and complications==\n===2007===\nOn February 17, 2007, the collective bargaining agreements between Stop & Shop management and its employees expired after three years. In an attempt to maintain their current [[health care]] benefits, union workers threatened to strike. Stop & Shop wanted employees to share the cost of health care, but union workers believed Stop & Shop should pay it in full.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wtnh.com/Global/story.asp?S=6117858&nav=3YeX |title=Still no contract for Stop & Shop workers |work=WHTN |date=February 21, 2007 |access-date=April 21, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090956/http://www.wtnh.com/Global/story.asp?S=6117858&nav=3YeX |archive-date=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Workers were paying co-payments for office visits and medical procedures, as well as deductibles for health care costs and hospital costs.

These fees would increase over the course of the three-year contract.\n\nAt midnight on February 23, 2007, grocery workers at the Stop & Shop supermarket chain in Connecticut, [[Rhode Island]], and Massachusetts had voted overwhelmingly to reject a contract proposal and to authorize a [[Strike action|strike]] against the grocery chain.

The locals delivered a comprehensive contract to Stop & Shop negotiators Saturday and the two sides took a break from bargaining to allow the company to go over the proposal.

From its beginnings in 1892 as a small grocery store, it has grown to include 415 stores chain-wide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stop & Shop |url=https://www.aholddelhaize.com/en/brands/united-states/stop-shop/ |website=AholdDelhaize.com |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStop & Shop has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] supermarket operator [[Ahold]] since 1995 and was part of the [[Stop & Shop/Giant-Landover]] division with sister chain [[Giant-Landover]] between 2004 and 2011. Ahold announced on June 24, 2015, that it would merge with [[Brussels]]-based [[Delhaize Group]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] grocery store conglomerate whose U.S. grocery operations included [[Hannaford Brothers Company|Hannaford]] of [[Scarborough, Maine]] and [[Food Lion]] of [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. The merger was completed on July 24, 2016, with the new holding company being named [[Ahold Delhaize]].\n\n==History==\n===Beginning===\nStop & Shop's roots can be traced back to 1892, when Solomon and Jeanie Rabinowitz opened a grocery shop, called the \"Greenie Store\", at 134 Salem Street, in Boston's [[North End, Boston|North End]]. This store lasted at this location until 1908.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northendboston.com/north-end-history-volume-4/ |title=North End History: Our Jewish Heritage |first=Guild |last=Nichols |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> According to the company's web site, Stop & Shop was founded in 1914 in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], Massachusetts by the [[Rabinovitz/Rabb family|Rabinowitz family]] as the Economy Grocery Stores Company. Four years later, the store adopted the new self-service supermarket model recently pioneered by [[Piggly Wiggly]]. A second store opened later in 1914, several stores opened a year later and by 1917, the chain had 15 stores. Initially the stores sold only grocery items but soon after added meats, produce, milk, dairy, and some frozen foods. Like [[A & P]], they were pioneers of the modern grocery store selling all types of food items under one roof. Stores were 10,000 to 15,000 square feet and in downtown and inner city areas in the [[Boston]] and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] metro areas. The chain had grown to 86 supermarkets by 1946, when the name was officially changed to Stop & Shop, Inc.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stopandshop.com/about/ |title=About Us |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1950s\u20131970s===\nIn 1959, Stop & Shop had 100 stores by opening in Natick, Massachusetts. In 1961, Stop & Shop purchased the now-defunct [[department store]] chain [[Bradlees]], based in Connecticut. Later, in the 60s, they bought the three-store chain ORBIT'S stores and merged them into Bradlees. Stop & Shop stores in Massachusetts were opening in suburban areas and in shopping plazas. In the early 1950s, Stop & Shop entered Connecticut and Rhode Island, in the early 1960s in New York, and the late 1960s in New Jersey. With Bradlees in the company, Stop & Shop began offering non-food items in their supermarkets. In many areas Stop & Shop and Bradlees were adjacent, allowing one-stop shopping; several of these combination stores were designated Family Centers. Stop & Shop also operated the Medi-Mart pharmacy chain and the Perkins Tobacco chain.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980, Stop & Shop had supermarkets in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and southern New York state. The stores were then typical in size at about {{convert|30000|sqft|m2}} on average. Many were next door to their then-co-owned Bradlees Department stores. In the New York and Philadelphia metro areas, Stop & Shop was not able to compete successfully. In 1982, Stop & Shop exited New Jersey, selling most of the stores that were profitable to [[A&P]], which would use these stores to replace their aging fleet of stores. A few stores were sold to [[ShopRite (United States)|Shop Rite]] owners as well as [[Foodtown]] owners. Other stores were closed and converted to other uses. In New York State, they sold some of their stores to A&P while selling others to [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]] and closing others, converting them also to other uses.\n\nIn 1982, Stop & Shop built its first superstore in the [[Pembroke, Massachusetts]], area. Superstores were between {{convert|45000|sqft|m2}} and {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}}. In addition to traditional supermarket offerings, these stores featured bakeries, pharmacies, moderate selections of general merchandise one would not expect to find at a supermarket, expanded deli departments, cafes, and a salad bar. Some of these stores would feature a bank, expanded liquor and beer, video rentals, etc. Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, the traditional supermarkets were converted into superstores. Some were remodeled, others were torn down and a new store rebuilt in the same location, while others were closed and replaced with a superstore within two miles. By 1990, Stop & Shop operated in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and in the Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts. areas, with one store in New York state.\n\nIn the late 1980s, following an attempt hostile takeover bid by [[Herbert Haft]]'s [[Dart Drug|Dart Group]], The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company was acquired by [[leveraged buyout]] specialists [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] and was taken private. Shortly thereafter, Medi-Mart was sold to Walgreens; Bradlees was spun off as its own corporation. After several years, while KKR explored merger possibilities with Safeway (which it also controlled at the time), Stop & Shop was sold at public offering.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Image:Super Stop & Shop 1024.jpg|thumb|A typical older location, using the old logo, since replaced. This location is in [[Yonkers, New York]].]]\n\nStop & Shop was acquired by the American branch of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] food giant [[Ahold]] in 1995. Ahold had previously acquired First National Supermarkets, whose '''Edwards Super Food Stores''' and '''[[Finast]]''' chains also had a strong presence in Connecticut; Ahold planned to operate both Edwards and Stop & Shop there. However, in the wake of the acquisition, [[Connecticut Attorney General]] [[Richard Blumenthal]] raised [[antitrust]] questions, as Stop & Shop and Edwards combined had more than half of the grocery share in Connecticut. Following negotiations with Blumenthal, Ahold decided to convert its New England stores to the Stop & Shop banner, while selling some locations to other chains such as [[Shaw's]], [[ShopRite (United States)|Shop Rite]], and [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]]. Ahold also began building a few stores under the Edwards Super Food Stores banner in New York state and New Jersey. Ahold also acquired 26 independent Mayfair [[Foodtown (United States)|Foodtown]] stores in that area, converting them to Edwards. In 1998 and 1999, several Super Stop & Shop stores were built in the Poughkeepsie area.\n\n[[File:Stop & Shop.JPG|thumb|A newer Stop & Shop in [[Saugus, Massachusetts]].]]\n\nIn 1999, Ahold announced its plan to acquire [[Pathmark]] supermarkets. Under that deal Edwards stores would be renamed Pathmark along with both sets of Giant stores. Late in 2000, after Grand Union was about to enter [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy and liquidate (by coincidence that the Bradlees chain was liquidating), Ahold walked away from the Pathmark deal; it proposed acquiring many of the Grand Union locations instead. At that point, Ahold continued the transition of its Edwards stores, converting all of its New York and New Jersey locations to the Stop & Shop format late in 2000. In 2001, Ahold acquired most of the Grand Union locations in New Jersey and New York state south of Kingston. These were all renamed Stop & Shop. Other locations went to other supermarket chains, non-food chains, or closed altogether. In 2003, Ahold acquired many of the A&P Foodmart locations in the [[Hartford, Connecticut]] area, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and the one remaining New Hampshire store. Other A&P locations in that region closed or were sold to other supermarket chains. In 2004, Ahold integrated Stop & Shop Supermarkets with [[Giant Food of Landover, Maryland|Giant Food LLC]] and created one combined company with the name of [[Stop & Shop/Giant-Landover]].\n\nIn 1994, Giant-Landover began northern expansion by opening stores in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[New Jersey]] under the '''Super G''' trade name. This was done to differentiate itself from future sister company Giant Food Stores of [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. During 2005, the newly formed Stop & Shop/Giant made the decision to phase out the Super G name in New Jersey and Delaware. In New Jersey, four Super G stores were shuttered and the remaining eight stores were converted to the '''Super Stop & Shop''' banner and became a part of Stop & Shop's New York Sales Division in an attempt to revive sales at the stores. These stores continued to underperform and were subsequently sold in 2007 to ShopRite franchise owners.  The Delaware Super G stores were to be remodeled under the Super Stop & Shop format and reopened under the Super Giant banner. Super G stores in Pennsylvania were generally close to Giant-Carlisle locations and were converted to Giant of Carlisle stores but continued to be unionized unlike most of the other Carlisle bannered stores.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2006, Stop & Shop signed a contract with [[Starbucks]], placing the coffee shop chain's licensed stores inside certain supermarkets. Many Stop & Shop stores feature [[Dunkin' Donuts]] outlets inside the store. Also in May 2006, Stop & Shop began piloting the Shopping Buddy program in select stores in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The Shopping Buddy is a [[Personal shopping assistants|personal shopping assistant]] that allows customers to track their purchases and to do in-cart bagging as they move through the store.\n\nIn October 2007, Stop & Shop launched an advertising campaign which was intended to have users submit stories and videos to a website detailing their grocery store experiences. The campaign was significant in that it is an early example of a regional traditional brand employing [[Web 2.0]] concepts such as [[user-generated content]] to promote their stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/expand-brand-community-online/122867 |title=Expand your brand community online |first=Patrick |last=Hanlon |publisher=Advertising Age |date=January 7, 2008 |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Stop & Shop made an attempt to expand further into northern New England. They built, but did not operate, a single [[Vermont]] store in Rutland before selling it to rival supermarket operator [[Delhaize]]. Delhaize opened the store under its [[Hannaford Bros. Co.|Hannaford]] banner in February 2008.\n\nIn July 2007, Stop & Shop opened a single [[Maine]] store in Kennebunk. The store was closed in October 2009, citing slow sales as the primary reason.

The restrictions state that the property cannot be used to sell fresh fruits and vegetables, baked goods, dairy products, frozen foods, fish, poultry, and meat. The restrictions remain in effect for a total of 99 years. The property, which was purchased by Daniel J.

Investigators, however, found that Stop & Shop\u2019s actions did not violate the state\u2019s antitrust laws and the investigation was closed, she said. Regardless of the strategy's legality, consumer advocates find fault because it limits the potential number of supermarkets in an area, reducing competition and selection for consumers.<ref name=\"CapeCod\" /> Another shell company with ties to Stop & Shop placed similar deed restrictions on a property in Harwich before selling it to Eastward Homes Business Trust in 2006.

The film was produced by oil millionaire [[Jack Wrather]], the husband of lead actress [[Bonita Granville]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film tells the story of two roommates, Mike Carr and Johnny Dixon. Johnny, who suffered a head injury during the war, meets a girl named Estelle Mitchell, and begins to date her. When he finds out she's dating other men around town he dumps her and starts dating her sweet twin sister, Linda.\n\nThe story picks up when Mike Carr goes into Tim McGinnis\u2019 bar in New York, to wait for Estelle, a woman he hasn't met since her twin sister Linda was murdered six months earlier. He sits down and start having flashbacks of the events around Linda's death:\n\nJohnny Dixon, who once served together with Mike in the Army, and was his roommate at this point in time, had frequent nervous breakdowns. Johnny and Linda were a couple, and they were very much in love, but the twin sister, Estelle, wanted Johnny for herself. Estelle was quite determined to break the happy couple up, but in the meantime she was seeing Mike, who had a hard time resisting the vampy Estelle.\n\nMike only met Linda once, but in doing so, he realized that she was the sister he should have been putting his energy into catching, as she was the more innocently virtuous of the two twins.\n\nBut the twin sisters both wanted Johnny, and one night they got into a fight over him, after which Linda went to see Johnny on her own. Estelle tries to intercept and get to Johnny's first. Mike saw Estelle arrive at Johnny's before Linda had arrived. He stops Estelle from coming in between the two lovers, but when Mike returns home a couple of hours later, Estelle telephones Mike at her mother's request to say that Linda never came home and has been reported missing.\n\nMike sees Johnny, and he turns out to be drunk and distraught. He begs Mike to verify his alibi, and that he heard Linda whistle for a taxi and saw her leave. When the police arrive to the scene they find a buckle from Linda's trenchcoat on Johnny's apartment floor, and after finding Linda's body in the apartment building, they take Johnny in for questioning.\n\nMike passes by McGinniss's and finds another buckle outside the bathroom window. He goes to Johnny and mentions the possibility that Johnny's memory might have failed him the night of the murder. While they are talking, the police arrive to arrest Johnny, and he panics. Mike helps out his friend, letting him escape out the back. In order to persuade Mike to give Johnny up, police detective Heller takes Mike to the morgue to show him Linda's trashed body. Heller then recounts the horrible details of Linda's death: After being choked, Linda was pushed, still alive, into the chute of the trash incinerator, and when he was unable to fit her in the tight space, the murderer shoved her in and broke her neck. The murderer then pulled her out and put her in a barrel on the roof.\n\nMike is disgusted by this, but still doesn't believe his friend murdered Linda. He convinces Johnny to come out of hiding and clear his name. As they arrive home, Estelle is waiting for them with a man called Alex Tremholt, who has been renting a room at the Mitchells' since the twins were young.\n\nWhile they are there, Mike hears a woman whistle for a taxi, and realizes that must be the same woman they heard the night of the murder. When Tremholt sees Johnny, he insists on calling the police to arrest him, but Johnny escapes once more. Detective Heller arrives and suggests Tremholt of having a long-standing, unrequited love for Estelle and of killing the innocent Linda, whom he mistook for Estelle, the object of his desire. With the truth being revealed, Mike hurries off to tell Johnny he is in the clear and just manages to stop him from hanging himself.\n\nBack in the present, Mike drags Estelle to his old apartment and insinuates that she committed the murder. When he enters the flat, however, Heller is waiting to arrest him. He reveals that Jake, the apartment janitor, recently found Linda's neck scarf in the incinerator chute with Mike's fingerprints all over it. It turns out that Mike killed Linda, believing she was Estelle. After telling Mike that Tremholt's arrest was only a trick, Heller accompanies Mike down the stairs and past Estelle into the night.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bonita Granville]] as Estelle Mitchell/Linda Mitchell\n* [[Don Castle]] as Mike Carr\n* [[Regis Toomey]] as Detective Heller\n* [[John Litel]] as Alex Tremholt\n* [[Wally Cassell]] as Johnny Dixon\n* [[Thomas E.
