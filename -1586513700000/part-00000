They came from an order of 8 ''Minotaur''-class cruisers in 1941-2; work on the second group of three ships was effectively suspended in mid 1944. The cruisers were finally completed, with new armament, after a very long delay entering service in the 1960s as the ''Tiger'' class.\n\nCancellation of other ship class designs due to post war austerity left the three hulls available for finishing but reconstructions were delayed by both the [[Korean War]] and [[Suez Crisis]]. By the time final approval was given to complete the ''Tiger'' cruisers in November 1954 as interim anti-aircraft cruisers with automatic 6-inch and 3-inch armament the hull and machinery of the cruisers was too dated. The effective replacement for the Tigers, the guided missile equipped [[County class destroyer]]s were ordered less than two years later in 1956 and entered service only four years after HMS ''Tiger''. The building of the Tigers was political as was retention as anti-submarine helicopters carriers. They maintained a few more large ships and command positions, allowing the institutional structure of the old carrier and cruiser navy to be preserved.\n\nIn the 1964s the ''Tigers'' were approved for conversion into helicopters carriers to plans that were rapidly upgraded from operating [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters for amphibious operations, to anti-submarine and command cruisers carrying four [[Westland Sea King]] helicopters. The conversion of HMS ''Blake'' and HMS ''Tiger'' from 1965-1972 was expensive and difficult; with limited manpower and resources and better ships for their roles it was not possible to justify their place in the fleet, and they were taken out of service in the late 1970s . ''Lion'' was scrapped by 1975 as a source of spares for her sisters. Return to service of ''Blake'' and ''Tiger'' was considered in the aftermath of the [[Falklands War]] but not proceeded with and the last RN cruisers were scrapped by 1986.\n\n==Design and commissioning==\n\n===Development of the ''Tiger'' class===\nThe ''Tiger''-class cruisers developed from the {{sclass-|Minotaur|cruiser (1943)|0}} (later renamed ''Swiftsure''-class) [[light cruiser]]s, laid down in 1942\u20133, but production of the [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier|Light Fleet Carrier]] was given priority{{by whom|date=April 2019}} and the Tiger design was viewed as obsolete by 1944 - the extra weight required by war requirements for radar, electronics and AA armament exceeding the structural strength and deep-water stability limits. The design also lacked the speed and size for Pacific and Arctic action, as even the [[Town-class cruiser (1936)|Town]] and [[County-class cruiser|County]] class vessels had inadequate speed against German warships in the [[Battle of the North Cape]] in December 1943, or the extra armour to protect added wiring and electronics. Accordingly, only the first Tiger, HMS ''Superb'', was completed, largely fitted out to the earlier Minotaur specifications of HMS ''Swiftsure'' and ''Minotaur''. ''Minotaur'', and the [[Crown Colony-class cruiser|late Colony (1943) class]] HMS ''Uganda'' were given to Canada in April 1944. [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] strongly supported and approved a similar plan to transfer two incomplete Tiger cruisers to Australia <ref>D. Day. The Politics of War. Australia at War 1939\u201345. From Churchill to MacArthur. Harper Collins(2002)Sydney,pp589-591</ref> Australia's War Cabinet had approved new construction of a cruiser and destroyer for 6.5 million pounds on 4 April 1944, partly to replace the sunk HMAS ''Sydney'' and seriously damaged HMAS ''Hobart''.

London (2010) p58-9</ref> The RAN strongly supported the ''Tiger purchase'', but General MacArthur, the Pacific War commander, advised that Australia in reality depended on the US Navy and should prioritise its own land bases' air defence, not small carriers and cruisers. The Australian government feared they were being sold unwanted pups and preferred to build locally. However, in February 1945, the Australian government and its Defence Committee accepted the two-Tiger offer. However, the British Treasury now refused to gift the cruisers to Australia, as they had done so for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. On 11 April 1945 the UK Exchequer demanded 9 million pounds for the later ''Lion'' and ''Blake''.<ref>D. Stevens. ''The RAN in WW2''. Allen & Unwin. 1996. Sydney, p 14-16</ref> Despite Australia's contribution, the UK Treasury viewed Canada as Britain's main Commonwealth support partner in ships, men, food, industry and repayment.\n\nThe Royal Navy's last wartime-built cruiser, HMS ''Minotaur'', was handed over on schedule to the RCN in June 1945. It was the first British cruiser with both Type 275/274 'lock and follow', air and surface fire control and USN quadruple Bofors gun emplacements. Despite the fact the first RN transferred cruiser, the ''Ceylon''-class, HMS ''Uganda'', volunteer crew, voted to retire from the Pacific War after success in anti-kamikaze action- with the British fleet in early 1945. In mid-1945 the UK faced ruination from Lend-Lease payments, which led in September 1945 to the cancellation of the second batch of 25 US-supplied Mk 37 Type 275 DP directors for the ''Tiger''s. The UK wanted payment for the two ''Tiger''s or equivalent writing-off of RN repair bills in Australian dockyards. The RN had sufficient cruisers of quality and insufficient skilled naval ratings, the Tigers had been suspended by late 1944 after ''Defence''' (later ''Lion''), was launched in September 1944.\n\nImmediately post-war, sufficient work was done that ''Tiger'' and ''Blake'' could be launched, albeit in a lesser state of completion. In June 1945 the Australian government rejected the purchase of ''Defence'' and [[HMS Blake|''Blake'']], it had insufficient manpower for the cruisers in addition to new carriers and destroyers. As the ''Tiger''s were nowhere near commissioning, the RAN were offered the transfer of two cruisers, one Town and one Colony class, while the ''Tiger''s were completed; this was rejected as the two RAN County-class heavy cruisers were deemed good to 1950.<ref>T.Frame & J Goldrick /[Ed] \"Reflections on the RAN\". Papers from Seminar Australian Navy History at ADF Academy Canberra. Kangaroo Press. NSW(1991) & H G Gill. \"Royal Australian Navy 1942\u201345\". Australian War Memorial Museum Publication (1968) Canberra pp469-472.</ref>\nIn 1944-45 it had been hoped that the new large Battle- and Daring-class destroyers would be developed as substitutes for cruisers in many roles, but First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham realised the UK budget could not support increasing the destroyers size from 2800 to 3500 tons required for a three-turret ships with adequate AA and A/S fire control.\nWith the ''Neptune''-class scrapped, the suspended Tigers were the only cruiser hull option viable past 1965 and worth considering for rearmament. By 1946, nine Mk 24 turrets were 75\u201380% percent complete with three further turrets partially complete for either the ''Tiger'' or ''Neptune''-class cruisers. These turrets were a more advanced version of the Mk&nbsp;23 wartime triple 6-inch. The new Mk&nbsp;24 6-inch mounts were interim electric turrets with remote power-control and power-worked breech. The heavier Mk&nbsp;24 offered a [[Dual purpose gun]] with just 60 degree elevation. A full electric powered turret first being fitted in HMS ''Diadem'' in 1944 and with power ramming, the shells fired at consistent intervals, and sufficient training and elevation speed to have some DP capacity against jets and missiles like the German [[Fritz X]].  The ''Tiger'' design had a broader {{convert|64|ft|m|abbr= on}} beam from {{HMS|Superb|25|6}} on which to accommodate the larger turrets. But it was preferred to complete ''Superb'' with the older Mk 23 turrets in 1945, a 64ft beam 'Swiftsure'. The 1942 ''Tiger'' design was redesigned with better protection and internal division to take advantage of a three turret design with four STAAG 40&nbsp;mm [[close-in weapon system]]s with type 262 radar, AIO, and more pumps and generators. However by early 1944 it was obvious the turret weight, crewing and electrical requirements of the ''Tiger'' design required a larger design, and by March 1944 HMS ''Defence'' and the later HMS ''Blake'', were all, but signed off for transfer to the RAN to be completed, as 5.25-inch gun cruisers with 5.25 RP 10.<ref>G.H Gill.

The fact they were years from commissioning, guaranteed Australia rejected the deal.\n\nAnother two ''Tiger''-class cruisers were cancelled. HMS ''Hawke'' was laid down in July 1943, and HMS ''Bellerophon'' possibly had a keel laid down. Work on all the Tiger cruisers other than ''Superb'' effectively stopped after mid-1944. It appears that the 1942 programme  ''Hawke'' and ''Bellerophon'', were destroyed in 1944,and reordered as, Improved Belfast and Neptune class cruisers in Feb 1944 and February 1945.

Warship 2006,p51</ref> The naval staff in 1946-1950 planned to refit some existing 5.25 RP10 turrets from  ''Dido'' cruisers to Town and ''Fiji'' cruisers as four turret 5.25 N2 Mod. This proved too costly at 250,000 pounds per turret and the Town cruisers aged 13-15 yrs in 1951, were already too old for reconstruction. Cold War warships cost fifty percent more to reconstruct after 12 years service life. While the slightly newer Colony and Dido class, were space limited war emergency cruisers, designed for a maximum of 20 years,  hull, boiler and steam turbines, and reconstruction, only extended, briefly their Royal Navy service as late British shipyard war construction and steel quality was often poor. Britain failed to take up the opportunity for subsidised refitting of cruisers with the new USN auto 5/54 and 3/50 in 1950-52, but considered the Dutch, Bofor twin 4.7. But non British armament equipment for the RN would have removed the point of the British Naval industry and empire and maintenance of the [[sterling zone]]. Reconstruction of ''Newcastle'' and ''Birmingham'', cost 3.5m pounds each and gave only 7 years more service. Similar structural and electrical reconstruction of cramped but newer, Colony class ships HMS ''Ceylon'' and ''Newfoundland'', in 1949\u20131956, was still expensive for marginal return in 1959 they were, sold to Peru for a third of the refit cost, as the [[1957 Defence White Paper]] only required one cruiser with each carrier task force. The hull of HMS ''Swiftsure'', the final cruiser reconstruction to start, collapsed in 1957, the cruisers structure unable to carry, AA other than six twin 40mm, as well as three MK 23 6 inch turrets, with space for modern radar and processing. [[HMS Bermuda]] recommissioned in December 1957 after the last RN extended refit on a Fiji cruiser,and intense roll stability tests in which the cruisers was repeatedly rolled, near capsize, the weight of its new Mk 62 AA Fire Control intended for HMS Vanguard's and USN 3/50 mounts rather wasted on Bermuda's obsolete old twin 4 inch DP guns.\n\nLarger cruisers had been seen necessary to carry a conventional cruiser gun armament with modern systems since 1944, but never seemed realistic projects, affordable in post war conditions. First, there was the  ''Neptune class''  designed and started but abandoned in 1946, replaced by a paper design the British''Minotaur'' 15,000-ton class. With automatic and unproven twin 6 inch and twin 3/70 which did not exist, as prototypes and aimed for far higher rates of fire than the guns of the late 1940s, new USN Worchester and Swedish Navy cruisers. The completed Minotaur design of 1951 with 5x2, twin 6 inch and 4 twin 3/70. was considered by the Attlee Cabinet under, the 1951 Korean war, expanded programme, but was far too large and expensive. The Tiger cruisers, were back on the building programme. Before the start of the war in Korea the Royal Navy's had planned to replace the new cruisers and large destroyers with 50 cruiser destroyers.<ref>Brown and Moore. Redesigning the RN (2012) p 29 & Admiral Philip Edwards. Ships of the Future RN (1949) TNA Admiralty 1161-5362-(1948-52)</ref> The Admiralty offered the government two such proposals in 1951, a new broad beam, model of the Bellona class with 4 twin Mk 6 4.5 and an enlarged RN version of USN Mitscher and Forest Sherman destroyers, with British machinery and sensors with 3 single US 5/54 and two twin US 3/50. \nHowever the second Churchill Government,  favoured the RAF and reduced the Naval budget, with the RN priority of anti submarine frigates,  restart of work on the Tiger cruisers was delayed 3 years, as was any further cruiser reconstructions, to 1954, notably that of HMS Royalist, Belfast and Ceylon. Reconstructing the 5500 ton Bellona cruiser, HMS Royalist which had powerful and reliable guns for high level AA engagement, seemed less risk than adopting the still troublesome USN 5/54 <ref>N.Freidman.

In some ways it was the powerful light gunship, 'cruiser destroyers' was meant to be, but over equipped with guns and radar processing,  leaving the crew little space and comfort.

The {{sclass-|Sverdlov|cruiser|4}} 6.9-inch armour and speed and range also outclassed the two turret Tigers. Even six-inch GFS was increasingly unacceptable to the Royal Navy after Korea and was allowed only on the first day of Operation Musketeer, after strong political opposition. The RN staff, were completely divided over the development of new AA guns larger than 4 inch post war, including the DNC Lillicrap in 1946 who saw the new 3/70 as eliminating the need for the new Mk 26 DP and advocating suspending cruiser design due to irrevocable divisions within the RN, over future gun development, as much as lack of finance<ref>G.Moore \"Post war cruiser design for the Royal Navy 1946-1956\" in ''Warship 2006'' (Conway) London, p p41, 42 - line 2</ref> and the fact the new twin 3/70 and twin Mk 26 6 inch were 6 years from test, led to the ''Tiger'' class and ''Minotaur''s being suspended in 1947,and slowed work on the new six inch and proposed new 5 inch guns.  The proven Mk 23 seemed more than adequate for GFS and its efficiency was improved in the 1950s .In the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]] action against Japanese cruisers suggested that manually operated 6-inch triples at low elevation could sustain high rates of fire of 8\u201310 rpm in the heat of the battle in action, and HMS Bermuda in 1960 achieved 12rpm for a couple of minutes, at low elevation at close range (up to 5 miles) at a cost of higher barrel-wear.<ref group=Note>The USN maintained the similar {{sclass-|Cleveland|cruiser|4}} triple 6-inch turret on its post-war missile conversions, including {{USS|Galveston|CL-93|6}}, not completed until 1958. ''Galveston'' maintained half its original 6- and 5-inch armament with twin [[RIM-8 Talos|Talos]] [[surface-to-air missile]] launchers and was far more capable than HMS ''Tiger'', if very, overweight.</ref> While the 1945 names finally selected for the ''Tiger'' class, ''Lion'', ''Tiger'', ''Hawke'' and ''Blake'', suggest strong Admiralty support for the class, many of the leading RN naval architects favored scrapping them all in 1947. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC) informed the Acting Chief of Naval Staff that the ''Tiger''s were nearly structurally complete, making substantial modernization or adding real aircraft direction capability impossible,<ref>N.Freidman. ''British Cruisers'' (2010), p 293</ref> and the later war priority of heavy 6-inch turrets and close-range AA weaponry to counter the Japanese air threat meant they were the least suitable Royal Navy cruiser class for modernization. Unlike the Colony class, the ''Minotaur'' class could only be rearmed with three medium main turrets due to weight and internal-volume restrictions,<ref>D.Murfin, AA to AA, The Fiji's, Warship 2010</ref> whereas all the other cruiser types could be refitted with four modern medium turrets on the centreline. A decision to approve rearming the ''Tiger''s with fully automatic Mk 26s was made in late 1954. Of the suspended ''Minotaur''s, ''Bellerophon'' was completed as ''Tiger'', the name-ship of the new ''Tiger'' class, ''Blake'' was completed under her own name,<ref group=Note>Although she had been named ''Tiger'' halfway through the process, then renamed ''Blake''.\n</ref> and ''Defence'' was completed as ''Lion''. Conversion of ''Blake'' and ''Tiger'' to helicopter cruisers in the 1960s left no money to convert ''Lion'', and she was scrapped in 1975, after spending eight years in reserve.\n\n===Revised design===\nConstruction of the three suspended ships resumed in 1954, to a revised design known as the ''Tiger'' class, as a platform to mount new automatic 6-inch and 3-inch guns. It had always been intended to fit a tertiary battery of 3\u20134 twin 40mm CIWS guns particularly to guarantee available weapons to counter head-on air attack over the bow, with ac STAAG Mk 2 and then twin L70s under the bridge wings, but the RN abandoned both systems in 1959 and the twin L60/MRS8 fitting to Hermes and Belfast in 1959 looked dated and required too much space, weight and crew.  Completing the cruisers was a controversial decision, reflecting exaggerated concern about [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] {{sclass-|Sverdlov|cruiser|5}} cruiser construction, described as \"chilling\" by the director plans.<ref>N.Freidman. British Cruisers. Seaforth (2010), p 309</ref> The threat of the new ''Sverdlov''-class cruisers was to be countered by the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] strike-aircraft, the Tigers lacking the speed, range, armament and armour required and cruisers in number too expensive and an outdated solution.<ref>A.

But it was too late, the RN cruiser fleet had been reduced to HMS Belfast and Bermuda and the 3 flawed Tiger and while a case for a more modern gunship, with more compact turrets might have existed it was clearly not these cruisers.

They approved conversion into helicopter carriers; carrying Westland Wessex helicopters primarily to land troops in Marine operations. A large hangar replaced the 'Y' turret, the forward turrets were retained for gunfire support and anti-surface vessel warfare. Intended provide extra powerful vessels to support and conduct amphibious operations east of Suez where it was difficult logistically for the Royal Navy to sustain even one operational carrier and one commando carrier in 1963-64. The original plan retained the full three twin 3-inch mounts or CIWS with full update of the sonar and radar including [[Type 965|965M]] AW but replacing the 992 target indicator radar with the slower 993.

At the time the Royal Navy was mostly concentrated on [[east of Suez]] operations and the anti-submarine deterrent role was chiefly to counter slow Indonesian and Chinese diesel submarines. In theory even one ''Tiger'' might be available to threaten nuclear [[depth charge]] use and free space on aircraft carriers like ''Hermes'' and ''Victorious'' for strike and air combat aircraft. However, major exercises conducted in 1965 with modernised WWII-era cruisers like the {{USS|Topeka|CL-67|6}} and [[HMS Royalist (89)|HMNZS ''Royalist'']] suggested they were not suitable platforms for tracking modern submarines.<ref>Proceedings- HMNZS Royalist 1958\u20131966. NZ National Archives. Wgtn. NZ ,</ref>\n\nThe [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] Labour Government continued the conversion of ''Tiger'' and ''Blake'', after deciding on further ship cuts and a faster phase-out of carriers in 1968. However, during the conversion of ''Blake'' the plan was changed to allow the cruisers to operate four of the more capable [[Westland Sea King]] helicopters, although only three Sea Kings could actually ever be accommodated and serviced in the longer hangar which extended further into the main structure of the ship, and greater cost and forcing the replacement of the side 3-inch gun mounts (which fire arcs were now too restricted) with much less effective [[Seacat (missile)|Seacat GWS22]].<ref>Freidman (2012) p321</ref><ref>D.Wettern. Tiger Class in Janes Defence Annual. Janes.(1973) London</ref> The low priority given to deterrence of Soviet submarines in the Northern Atlantic by the MOD is reflected in the decision to convert a suitable anti-submarine helicopter platform, the carrier ''Hermes'' into an [[amphibious carrier]]. The suggestion of the captain of the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|2}} in 1966 that ''Bulwark'' and the other light fleet carriers be developed for the 'cruiser' role, carrying [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] VSTOL aircraft and anti-submarine helicopters, as well as troop- and commando-carrying helicopters was rejected despite the argument their capacity was under-utilised.<ref>E. Hampshire. ''East of Suez to East Atlantic''.</ref> The later advent of the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s would seem to add weight to this proposal. ''Hermes'' and ''Bulwark'' were larger, and offered better silencing and hangar capacity. The Labour Government's priority was to arm aircraft in [[West Germany]] with tactical and thermonuclear weapons and, secondly, amphibious support of the [[British Army]] in [[Norway]]. Provision of nuclear depth charges for anti-submarine, aircraft carriers and destroyers and frigates was limited and late, although approval to wire all the {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|5}}, {{sclass-|Rothesay|frigate|5}} and {{sclass2-|County|destroyer|4}} ships for triggering NDB was given in 1969, and frigates and destroyers offered quieter listening platforms than the old ''Tiger''s. The proposed class of four large [[Type 82 destroyer]]s fitted with nuclear [[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]] anti-submarine missiles could have been a more reliable nuclear deterrent, but the British [[Ikara missile]] was ultimately fitted only to carry conventional [[Mark 46 torpedo]]es, while only one Type 82, {{HMS|Bristol|D23|6}}, was built; this ship lacked even a helicopter hangar, and was plagued by problems common with dated and complex steam propulsion. Crewing and developing large cruiser size warships with steam propulsion was becoming more difficult in the RN, contributing to the issues in ''Tiger'' and the much later Type 82 destroyer. With no other approved option, in 1965, work began on ''Blake'' to convert her to a helicopter cruiser while ''Tiger'' began her conversion in 1968. The structural modernisation work on these old hulls was difficult and expensive. However, the ships successfully served as helicopter command cruisers and provided an argument to justify construction of their replacement, the ''Invincible'' class 'through deck cruisers'. ''Lion''{{'}}s conversion was cancelled, due to rising cost and obvious fact by 1969 that ''Blake''{{'}}s conversion was unsatisfactory. ''Lion'' remained operational until late 1965, after which she was placed in reserve, although in the event she was used as a parts source for the conversion of ''Tiger''. The conversion of two or three County-class guided missile destroyers as anti-submarine helicopter cruisers might have provided a quite effective anti submarine vessel, as [[Chile]] did with two of its second-hand County class. Running on their steam turbines alone, the County GMD was a quiet anti submarine platform and three RN County-class vessels were expensively updated in the late 1970s with [[Exocet]] and improved C4 and {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|2}} proved useful in the 'cruiser' role in the [[Falklands War]], being faster through rough seas than even ''Hermes''. Without proper modernisation and removal of the [[Sea Slug (missile)|Sea Slug]] missile system, their helicopter capabilities were cumbersome and limited.\nHad the last two County class {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} and {{HMS|Norfolk|D21|6}}, which commissioned in 1970, been redesigned early in their construction as helicopter carrier a very good anti-submarine helicopter carrier might have resulted with Sea King capacity, and it is not inconceivable HMS ''Bristol'' could have been redesigned with the single Sea Launcher forward and a hangar for 4 Sea King in place of where Sea Dart and [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] and pad were actually sited on the T82. The conversion of the destroyer {{HMS|Devonshire|D02|2}}, proposed for [[Egypt]] in 1978, would have had both a deck hangar and below deck hangar (in the area of the former Sea Slug magazine) to operate 4 Lynx or 3 Wessex and might have produced a flawed anti-submarine helicopter cruiser. The ''Tiger''s as half heavy gun cruiser and half short life anti-submarine carrier, suited the RN as flagships with good communications and some modern sensors, but they did not really add to task force defence and needed protection themselves,<ref>A. Clarke. Sverdlov Cruisers and the RN Response, in British Naval History 12-5-2014</ref> and by 1979, the USN had mothballed its last 6-inch gun cruiser {{USS|Oklahoma City|CL-91|6}}.\n\nThe conversions left ''Tiger'' and ''Blake'' some 380 tons heavier with a full displacement of 12,080 tons and their crew complements increased by 169 to 885. Originally, ''Lion'' was also to have been converted, although this never materialised: ''Blake''{{'}}s conversion had been more expensive than envisaged (\u00a35.5 million) and so funds were no longer available. Ironically ''Tiger''{{'}}s conversion cost even more (\u00a313.25 million), such was the level of inflation at the time. After much material was stripped off her for use as spares for her sisters, ''Lion'' was subsequently sold for breaking up in 1975.\n\n==Obsolescence and decommissioning==\n[[File:HMS Tiger (1945) at Portsmouth Navy Day 1980 2.jpg|thumb|right|The decommissioned HMS ''Tiger'' at [[Portsmouth]] [[Navy Day#United Kingdom|Navy Days]] in 1980, showing the helicopter deck and hangar added in 1968\u201371.]]\n[[File:HMS Tiger (1945) at Portsmouth Navy Day 1980.jpg|thumb|right|Another view of HMS ''Tiger'' on the same day, showing the 6-inch guns which were retained in the conversion.]]\n\nIn 1969, ''Blake'' returned to service followed by ''Tiger'' in 1972. However, the large crews and limited helicopter capacity made ''Tiger''{{'}}s further fleet service limited to less than nine years. After spending seven years in reserve, the decision was made in 1973 to strip ''Lion'' for spares to maintain ''Blake'' and ''Tiger'', and ''Lion'' was sold for scrap in 1975.\n\nThe cutback in operating funds and manpower, faced by the Royal Navy when the new Conservative government limited fuel and operating allowances in a policy of tight monetary control, and the belief in the economy of [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] aircraft and submarines for anti-submarine operations quickened their demise.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The recommissioning of the carrier {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|2}} and conversion of {{HMS|Hermes|R12|2}} meant that they could carry twice as many Sea Kings as could the ''Tiger''s in anti-submarine warfare, vital against the [[Soviet Union]] submarine threat in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and decreased the importance of the ''Tiger''s even further. As well armed command ships, inc twin 45rpm twin 4.7 guns and standard SM2 the Dutch {{ship|HNLMS|Tromp|1973|2}} and {{ship|HNLMS|De Ruyter|1974|2}} were particularly vital stand-in, destroyer leader ships working with RN carriers from the mid-1970s. Operating alone as a RN task force, carriers could not be risked in blue water operations without an escort of [[Type 42 destroyer]]s, [[Type 22 frigate]]s or [[Sea Wolf (missile)|Sea Wolf]]-fitted {{sclass-|Leander|frigate}}s. The true manpower requirements for open water and power projection were too high in terms of fiscal cost, for UK spending 5.2 percent of GNP on defence in 1981 to justify hulls like the ''Tiger''s the USN withdrawing its last 6 inch gun hybrid cruisers in 1976 and 1979.  During the [[Falklands War]], the Belgarno's ability to efficiently fight her armament is doubtful and her two Exocet-armed FRAM 2 {{sclass-|Allen M. Sumner|destroyer|0}} escorts may have represented a greater threat to the Task Force.<ref>{{citation |first=C |last=Moore |title=Margaret Thatcher. The authorised biography.

When ''Blake'' was decommissioned in 1979, she had the distinction of being the last cruiser to serve the Royal Navy and her passing was marked on 6 December 1979 when she ceremonially fired her 6-inch guns for the last time in the [[English Channel]]. Just a few days after the Falklands War started, both ''Blake'' and ''Tiger'' were rapidly surveyed to determine their condition for reactivation. The survey determined both ships to be in very good condition; they were put into dry-dock (''Blake'' at Chatham, and ''Tiger'' at Portsmouth) and round-the-clock work reactivation work was immediately begun. By mid-May it was determined that the ships would not be completed in time to take part in the war and the work was stopped.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Ships such as the ''Tiger''s required large crews, their Seacat missile was useless and 6-inch guns, too unreliable for useful GFS and the cruisers, needed heavy repairs to machinery and rewiring. Attempts to maintain more modern hulls for emergency reactivation, such as {{HMS|Intrepid|L11|2}} and {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} (amphibious assault ships), proved useful, and retaining HMS Devonshire and HMS Kent, first group County-class destroyers, with a cheap extended flight deck (replacing the Sea Slug launcher) for Sea Kings at Chatham dockyard, similarly half-manned and permanently maintained might have allowed a heavier GFS capability to actually fight in the Falklands War.

They came from an order of 8 ''Minotaur''-class cruisers in 1941-2; work on the second group of three ships was effectively suspended in mid 1944. The cruisers were finally completed, with new armament, after a very long delay entering service in the 1960s as the ''Tiger'' class.\n\nCancellation of other ship class designs due to post war austerity left the three hulls available for finishing but reconstructions were delayed by both the [[Korean War]] and [[Suez Crisis]]. By the time final approval was given to complete the ''Tiger'' cruisers in November 1954 as interim anti-aircraft cruisers with automatic 6-inch and 3-inch armament the hull and machinery of the cruisers was too dated. The effective replacement for the Tigers, the guided missile equipped [[County class destroyer]]s were ordered less than two years later in 1956 and entered service only four years after HMS ''Tiger''. The building of the Tigers was political as was retention as anti-submarine helicopters carriers. They maintained a few more large ships and command positions, allowing the institutional structure of the old carrier and cruiser navy to be preserved.\n\nIn the 1964s the ''Tigers'' were approved for conversion into helicopters carriers to plans that were rapidly upgraded from operating [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters for amphibious operations, to anti-submarine and command cruisers carrying four [[Westland Sea King]] helicopters. The conversion of HMS ''Blake'' and HMS ''Tiger'' from 1965-1972 was expensive and difficult; with limited manpower and resources and better ships for their roles it was not possible to justify their place in the fleet, and they were taken out of service in the late 1970s . ''Lion'' was scrapped by 1975 as a source of spares for her sisters. Return to service of ''Blake'' and ''Tiger'' was considered in the aftermath of the [[Falklands War]] but not proceeded with and the last RN cruisers were scrapped by 1986.\n\n==Design and commissioning==\n\n===Development of the ''Tiger'' class===\nThe ''Tiger''-class cruisers developed from the {{sclass-|Minotaur|cruiser (1943)|0}} (later renamed ''Swiftsure''-class) [[light cruiser]]s, laid down in 1942\u20133, but production of the [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier|Light Fleet Carrier]] was given priority{{by whom|date=April 2019}} and the Tiger design was viewed as obsolete by 1944 - the extra weight required by war requirements for radar, electronics and AA armament exceeding the structural strength and deep-water stability limits. The design also lacked the speed and size for Pacific and Arctic action, as even the [[Town-class cruiser (1936)|Town]] and [[County-class cruiser|County]] class vessels had inadequate speed against German warships in the [[Battle of the North Cape]] in December 1943, or the extra armour to protect added wiring and electronics. Accordingly, only the first Tiger, HMS ''Superb'', was completed, largely fitted out to the earlier Minotaur specifications of HMS ''Swiftsure'' and ''Minotaur''. ''Minotaur'', and the [[Crown Colony-class cruiser|late Colony (1943) class]] HMS ''Uganda'' were given to Canada in April 1944. [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] strongly supported and approved a similar plan to transfer two incomplete Tiger cruisers to Australia <ref>D. Day. The Politics of War. Australia at War 1939\u201345.

The Australian government feared they were being sold unwanted pups and preferred to build locally. However, in February 1945, the Australian government and its Defence Committee accepted the two-Tiger offer. However, the British Treasury now refused to gift the cruisers to Australia, as they had done so for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. On 11 April 1945 the UK Exchequer demanded 9 million pounds for the later ''Lion'' and ''Blake''.<ref>D. Stevens. ''The RAN in WW2''. Allen & Unwin. 1996. Sydney, p 14-16</ref> Despite Australia's contribution, the UK Treasury viewed Canada as Britain's main Commonwealth support partner in ships, men, food, industry and repayment.\n\nThe Royal Navy's last wartime-built cruiser, HMS ''Minotaur'', was handed over on schedule to the RCN in June 1945. It was the first British cruiser with both Type 275/274 'lock and follow', air and surface fire control and USN quadruple Bofors gun emplacements. Despite the fact the first RN transferred cruiser, the ''Ceylon''-class, HMS ''Uganda'', volunteer crew, voted to retire from the Pacific War after success in anti-kamikaze action- with the British fleet in early 1945. In mid-1945 the UK faced ruination from Lend-Lease payments, which led in September 1945 to the cancellation of the second batch of 25 US-supplied Mk 37 Type 275 DP directors for the ''Tiger''s. The UK wanted payment for the two ''Tiger''s or equivalent writing-off of RN repair bills in Australian dockyards. The RN had sufficient cruisers of quality and insufficient skilled naval ratings, the Tigers had been suspended by late 1944 after ''Defence''' (later ''Lion''), was launched in September 1944.\n\nImmediately post-war, sufficient work was done that ''Tiger'' and ''Blake'' could be launched, albeit in a lesser state of completion. In June 1945 the Australian government rejected the purchase of ''Defence'' and [[HMS Blake|''Blake'']], it had insufficient manpower for the cruisers in addition to new carriers and destroyers. As the ''Tiger''s were nowhere near commissioning, the RAN were offered the transfer of two cruisers, one Town and one Colony class, while the ''Tiger''s were completed; this was rejected as the two RAN County-class heavy cruisers were deemed good to 1950.<ref>T.Frame & J Goldrick /[Ed] \"Reflections on the RAN\".

Australian War Memorial Museum Publication (1968) Canberra pp469-472.</ref>\nIn 1944-45 it had been hoped that the new large Battle- and Daring-class destroyers would be developed as substitutes for cruisers in many roles, but First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham realised the UK budget could not support increasing the destroyers size from 2800 to 3500 tons required for a three-turret ships with adequate AA and A/S fire control.\nWith the ''Neptune''-class scrapped, the suspended Tigers were the only cruiser hull option viable past 1965 and worth considering for rearmament. By 1946, nine Mk 24 turrets were 75\u201380% percent complete with three further turrets partially complete for either the ''Tiger'' or ''Neptune''-class cruisers. These turrets were a more advanced version of the Mk&nbsp;23 wartime triple 6-inch. The new Mk&nbsp;24 6-inch mounts were interim electric turrets with remote power-control and power-worked breech. The heavier Mk&nbsp;24 offered a [[Dual purpose gun]] with just 60 degree elevation. A full electric powered turret first being fitted in HMS ''Diadem'' in 1944 and with power ramming, the shells fired at consistent intervals, and sufficient training and elevation speed to have some DP capacity against jets and missiles like the German [[Fritz X]].  The ''Tiger'' design had a broader {{convert|64|ft|m|abbr= on}} beam from {{HMS|Superb|25|6}} on which to accommodate the larger turrets. But it was preferred to complete ''Superb'' with the older Mk 23 turrets in 1945, a 64ft beam 'Swiftsure'. The 1942 ''Tiger'' design was redesigned with better protection and internal division to take advantage of a three turret design with four STAAG 40&nbsp;mm [[close-in weapon system]]s with type 262 radar, AIO, and more pumps and generators. However by early 1944 it was obvious the turret weight, crewing and electrical requirements of the ''Tiger'' design required a larger design, and by March 1944 HMS ''Defence'' and the later HMS ''Blake'', were all, but signed off for transfer to the RAN to be completed, as 5.25-inch gun cruisers with 5.25 RP 10.<ref>G.H Gill.

The fact they were years from commissioning, guaranteed Australia rejected the deal.\n\nAnother two ''Tiger''-class cruisers were cancelled. HMS ''Hawke'' was laid down in July 1943, and HMS ''Bellerophon'' possibly had a keel laid down. Work on all the Tiger cruisers other than ''Superb'' effectively stopped after mid-1944.

Warship 2006,p51</ref> The naval staff in 1946-1950 planned to refit some existing 5.25 RP10 turrets from  ''Dido'' cruisers to Town and ''Fiji'' cruisers as four turret 5.25 N2 Mod. This proved too costly at 250,000 pounds per turret and the Town cruisers aged 13-15 yrs in 1951, were already too old for reconstruction. Cold War warships cost fifty percent more to reconstruct after 12 years service life. While the slightly newer Colony and Dido class, were space limited war emergency cruisers, designed for a maximum of 20 years,  hull, boiler and steam turbines, and reconstruction, only extended, briefly their Royal Navy service as late British shipyard war construction and steel quality was often poor. Britain failed to take up the opportunity for subsidised refitting of cruisers with the new USN auto 5/54 and 3/50 in 1950-52, but considered the Dutch, Bofor twin 4.7. But non British armament equipment for the RN would have removed the point of the British Naval industry and empire and maintenance of the [[sterling zone]]. Reconstruction of ''Newcastle'' and ''Birmingham'', cost 3.5m pounds each and gave only 7 years more service. Similar structural and electrical reconstruction of cramped but newer, Colony class ships HMS ''Ceylon'' and ''Newfoundland'', in 1949\u20131956, was still expensive for marginal return in 1959 they were, sold to Peru for a third of the refit cost, as the [[1957 Defence White Paper]] only required one cruiser with each carrier task force. The hull of HMS ''Swiftsure'', the final cruiser reconstruction to start, collapsed in 1957, the cruisers structure unable to carry, AA other than six twin 40mm, as well as three MK 23 6 inch turrets, with space for modern radar and processing. [[HMS Bermuda]] recommissioned in December 1957 after the last RN extended refit on a Fiji cruiser,and intense roll stability tests in which the cruisers was repeatedly rolled, near capsize, the weight of its new Mk 62 AA Fire Control intended for HMS Vanguard's and USN 3/50 mounts rather wasted on Bermuda's obsolete old twin 4 inch DP guns.\n\nLarger cruisers had been seen necessary to carry a conventional cruiser gun armament with modern systems since 1944, but never seemed realistic projects, affordable in post war conditions. First, there was the  ''Neptune class''  designed and started but abandoned in 1946, replaced by a paper design the British''Minotaur'' 15,000-ton class. With automatic and unproven twin 6 inch and twin 3/70 which did not exist, as prototypes and aimed for far higher rates of fire than the guns of late 1940s, new USN Worchester and Swedish Navy cruisers. The completed Minotaur design of 1951 with 5x2, twin 6 inch and 4 twin 3/70. was considered by the Attlee Cabinet under, the 1951 Korean war, expanded programme, but was far too large and expensive. The Tiger cruisers, were back on the building programme. Before the start of the war in Korea the Royal Navy's had planned to replace the new cruisers and large destroyers with 50 cruiser destroyers.<ref>Brown and Moore.

Reconstructing the 5500 ton Bellona cruiser, HMS Royalist which had powerful and reliable guns for high level AA engagement, seemed less risk than adopting the still troublesome USN 5/54 <ref>N.Freidman.

The {{sclass-|Sverdlov|cruiser|4}} 6.9-inch armour and speed and range also outclassed the two turret Tigers. Even six-inch GFS was increasingly unacceptable to the Royal Navy after Korea and was allowed only on the first day of Operation Musketeer, after strong political opposition. The RN staff, were completely divided over the development of new AA guns larger than 4 inch post war, including the DNC Lillicrap in 1946 who saw the new 3/70 as eliminating the need for the new Mk 26 DP and advocating suspending cruiser design due to irrevocable divisions within the RN, over future gun development, as much as lack of finance<ref>G.Moore \"Post war cruiser design for the Royal Navy 1946-1956\" in ''Warship 2006'' (Conway) London, p p41, 42 - line 2</ref> and the fact the new twin 3/70 and twin Mk 26 6 inch were 6 years from test, led to the ''Tiger'' class and ''Minotaur''s being suspended in 1947,and slowed work on the new six inch and proposed new 5 inch guns.  The proven Mk 23 seemed more than adequate for GFS and its efficiency was improved in the 1950s .In the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]] action against Japanese cruisers suggested that manually operated 6-inch triples at low elevation could sustain high rates of fire of 8\u201310 rpm in the heat of the battle in action, and HMS Bermuda in 1960 achieved 12rpm for a couple of minutes, at low elevation at close range (up to 5 miles) at a cost of higher barrel-wear.<ref group=Note>The USN maintained the similar {{sclass-|Cleveland|cruiser|4}} triple 6-inch turret on its post-war missile conversions, including {{USS|Galveston|CL-93|6}}, not completed until 1958. ''Galveston'' maintained half its original 6- and 5-inch armament with twin [[RIM-8 Talos|Talos]] [[surface-to-air missile]] launchers and was far more capable than HMS ''Tiger'', if very, overweight.</ref> While the 1945 names finally selected for the ''Tiger'' class, ''Lion'', ''Tiger'', ''Hawke'' and ''Blake'', suggest strong Admiralty support for the class, many of the leading RN naval architects favored scrapping them all in 1947. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC) informed the Acting Chief of Naval Staff that the ''Tiger''s were nearly structurally complete, making substantial modernization or adding real aircraft direction capability impossible,<ref>N.Freidman. ''British Cruisers'' (2010), p 293</ref> and the later war priority of heavy 6-inch turrets and close-range AA weaponry to counter the Japanese air threat meant they were the least suitable Royal Navy cruiser class for modernization. Unlike the Colony class, the ''Minotaur'' class could only be rearmed with three medium main turrets due to weight and internal-volume restrictions,<ref>D.Murfin, AA to AA, The Fiji's, Warship 2010</ref> whereas all the other cruiser types could be refitted with four modern medium turrets on the centreline. A decision to approve rearming the ''Tiger''s with fully automatic Mk 26s was made in late 1954. Of the suspended ''Minotaur''s, ''Bellerophon'' was completed as ''Tiger'', the name-ship of the new ''Tiger'' class, ''Blake'' was completed under her own name,<ref group=Note>Although she had been named ''Tiger'' halfway through the process, then renamed ''Blake''.\n</ref> and ''Defence'' was completed as ''Lion''. Conversion of ''Blake'' and ''Tiger'' to helicopter cruisers in the 1960s left no money to convert ''Lion'', and she was scrapped in 1975, after spending eight years in reserve.\n\n===Revised design===\nConstruction of the three suspended ships resumed in 1954, to a revised design known as the ''Tiger'' class, as a platform to mount new automatic 6-inch and 3-inch guns. It had always been intended to fit a tertiary battery of 3\u20134 twin 40mm CIWS guns particularly to guarantee available weapons to counter head-on air attack over the bow, with ac STAAG Mk 2 and then twin L70s under the bridge wings, but the RN abandoned both systems in 1959 and the twin L60/MRS8 fitting to Hermes and Belfast in 1959 looked dated and required too much space, weight and crew.  Completing the cruisers was a controversial decision, reflecting exaggerated concern about [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] {{sclass-|Sverdlov|cruiser|5}} cruiser construction, described as \"chilling\" by the director plans.<ref>N.Freidman. British Cruisers. Seaforth (2010), p 309</ref> The threat of the new ''Sverdlov''-class cruisers was to be countered by the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] strike-aircraft, the Tigers lacking the speed, range, armament and armour required and cruisers in number too expensive and an outdated solution.<ref>A.

The original plan retained the full three twin 3-inch mounts or CIWS with full update of the sonar and radar including [[Type 965|965M]] AW but replacing the 992 target indicator radar with the slower 993. The Army preference in 1964 with the Indonesian confrontation building, was actually, to retain the Tigers with their full two turret 6-inch gun armament for NFGS,<ref>P. Darby.

At the time the Royal Navy was mostly concentrated on [[east of Suez]] operations and the anti-submarine deterrent role was chiefly to counter slow Indonesian and Chinese diesel submarines. In theory even one ''Tiger'' might be available to threaten nuclear [[depth charge]] use and free space on aircraft carriers like ''Hermes'' and ''Victorious'' for strike and air combat aircraft. However, major exercises conducted in 1965 with modernised WWII-era cruisers like the {{USS|Topeka|CL-67|6}} and [[HMS Royalist (89)|HMNZS ''Royalist'']] suggested they were not suitable platforms for tracking modern submarines.<ref>Proceedings- HMNZS Royalist 1958\u20131966. NZ National Archives. Wgtn. NZ ,</ref>\n\nThe [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] Labour Government continued the conversion of ''Tiger'' and ''Blake'', after deciding on further ship cuts and a faster phase-out of carriers in 1968. However, during the conversion of ''Blake'' the plan was changed to allow the cruisers to operate four of the more capable [[Westland Sea King]] helicopters, although only three Sea Kings could actually ever be accommodated and serviced in the longer hangar which extended further into the main structure of the ship, and greater cost and forcing the replacement of the side 3-inch gun mounts (which fire arcs were now too restricted) with much less effective [[Seacat (missile)|Seacat GWS22]].<ref>Freidman (2012) p321</ref><ref>D.Wettern. Tiger Class in Janes Defence Annual. Janes.(1973) London</ref> The low priority given to deterrence of Soviet submarines in the Northern Atlantic by the MOD is reflected in the decision to convert a suitable anti-submarine helicopter platform, the carrier ''Hermes'' into an [[amphibious carrier]]. The suggestion of the captain of the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|2}} in 1966 that ''Bulwark'' and the other light fleet carriers be developed for the 'cruiser' role, carrying [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] VSTOL aircraft and anti-submarine helicopters, as well as troop- and commando-carrying helicopters was rejected despite the argument their capacity was under-utilised.<ref>E. Hampshire. ''East of Suez to East Atlantic''.</ref> The later advent of the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s would seem to add weight to this proposal. ''Hermes'' and ''Bulwark'' were larger, and offered better silencing and hangar capacity. The Labour Government's priority was to arm aircraft in [[West Germany]] with tactical and thermonuclear weapons and, secondly, amphibious support of the [[British Army]] in [[Norway]]. Provision of nuclear depth charges for anti-submarine, aircraft carriers and destroyers and frigates was limited and late, although approval to wire all the {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|5}}, {{sclass-|Rothesay|frigate|5}} and {{sclass2-|County|destroyer|4}} ships for triggering NDB was given in 1969, and frigates and destroyers offered quieter listening platforms than the old ''Tiger''s. The proposed class of four large [[Type 82 destroyer]]s fitted with nuclear [[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]] anti-submarine missiles could have been a more reliable nuclear deterrent, but the British [[Ikara missile]] was ultimately fitted only to carry conventional [[Mark 46 torpedo]]es, while only one Type 82, {{HMS|Bristol|D23|6}}, was built; this ship lacked even a helicopter hangar, and was plagued by problems common with dated and complex steam propulsion. Crewing and developing large cruiser size warships with steam propulsion was becoming more difficult in the RN, contributing to the issues in ''Tiger'' and the much later Type 82 destroyer. With no other approved option, in 1965, work began on ''Blake'' to convert her to a helicopter cruiser while ''Tiger'' began her conversion in 1968. The structural modernisation work on these old hulls was difficult and expensive. However, the ships successfully served as helicopter command cruisers and provided an argument to justify construction of their replacement, the ''Invincible'' class 'through deck cruisers'. ''Lion''{{'}}s conversion was cancelled, due to rising cost and obvious fact by 1969 that ''Blake''{{'}}s conversion was unsatisfactory. ''Lion'' remained operational until late 1965, after which she was placed in reserve, although in the event she was used as a parts source for the conversion of ''Tiger''. The conversion of two or three County-class guided missile destroyers as anti-submarine helicopter cruisers might have provided a quite effective anti submarine vessel, as [[Chile]] did with two of its second-hand County class. Running on their steam turbines alone, the County GMD was a quiet anti submarine platform and three RN County-class vessels were expensively updated in the late 1970s with [[Exocet]] and improved C4 and {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|2}} proved useful in the 'cruiser' role in the [[Falklands War]], being faster through rough seas than even ''Hermes''. Without proper modernisation and removal of the [[Sea Slug (missile)|Sea Slug]] missile system, their helicopter capabilities were cumbersome and limited.\nHad the last two County class {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} and {{HMS|Norfolk|D21|6}}, which commissioned in 1970, been redesigned early in their construction as helicopter carrier a very good anti-submarine helicopter carrier might have resulted with Sea King capacity, and it is not inconceivable HMS ''Bristol'' could have been redesigned with the single Sea Launcher forward and a hangar for 4 Sea King in place of where Sea Dart and [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] and pad were actually sited on the T82. The conversion of the destroyer {{HMS|Devonshire|D02|2}}, proposed for [[Egypt]] in 1978, would have had both a deck hangar and below deck hangar (in the area of the former Sea Slug magazine) to operate 4 Lynx or 3 Wessex and might have produced a flawed anti-submarine helicopter cruiser. The ''Tiger''s as half heavy gun cruiser and half short life anti-submarine carrier, suited the RN as flagships with good communications and some modern sensors, but they did not really add to task force defence and needed protection themselves,<ref>A. Clarke. Sverdlov Cruisers and the RN Response, in British Naval History 12-5-2014</ref> and by 1979, the USN had mothballed its last 6-inch gun cruiser {{USS|Oklahoma City|CL-91|6}}.\n\nThe conversions left ''Tiger'' and ''Blake'' some 380 tons heavier with a full displacement of 12,080 tons and their crew complements increased by 169 to 885. Originally, ''Lion'' was also to have been converted, although this never materialised: ''Blake''{{'}}s conversion had been more expensive than envisaged (\u00a35.5 million) and so funds were no longer available. Ironically ''Tiger''{{'}}s conversion cost even more (\u00a313.25 million), such was the level of inflation at the time. After much material was stripped off her for use as spares for her sisters, ''Lion'' was subsequently sold for breaking up in 1975.\n\n==Obsolescence and decommissioning==\n[[File:HMS Tiger (1945) at Portsmouth Navy Day 1980 2.jpg|thumb|right|The decommissioned HMS ''Tiger'' at [[Portsmouth]] [[Navy Day#United Kingdom|Navy Days]] in 1980, showing the helicopter deck and hangar added in 1968\u201371.]]\n[[File:HMS Tiger (1945) at Portsmouth Navy Day 1980.jpg|thumb|right|Another view of HMS ''Tiger'' on the same day, showing the 6-inch guns which were retained in the conversion.]]\n\nIn 1969, ''Blake'' returned to service followed by ''Tiger'' in 1972. However, the large crews and limited helicopter capacity made ''Tiger''{{'}}s further fleet service limited to less than nine years. After spending seven years in reserve, the decision was made in 1973 to strip ''Lion'' for spares to maintain ''Blake'' and ''Tiger'', and ''Lion'' was sold for scrap in 1975.\n\nThe cutback in operating funds and manpower, faced by the Royal Navy when the new Conservative government limited fuel and operating allowances in a policy of tight monetary control, and the belief in the economy of [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] aircraft and submarines for anti-submarine operations quickened their demise.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The recommissioning of the carrier {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|2}} and conversion of {{HMS|Hermes|R12|2}} meant that they could carry twice as many Sea Kings as could the ''Tiger''s in anti-submarine warfare, vital against the [[Soviet Union]] submarine threat in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and decreased the importance of the ''Tiger''s even further. As well armed command ships, inc twin 45rpm twin 4.7 guns and standard SM2 the Dutch {{ship|HNLMS|Tromp|1973|2}} and {{ship|HNLMS|De Ruyter|1974|2}} were particularly vital stand-in, destroyer leader ships working with RN carriers from the mid-1970s. Operating alone as a RN task force, carriers could not be risked in blue water operations without an escort of [[Type 42 destroyer]]s, [[Type 22 frigate]]s or [[Sea Wolf (missile)|Sea Wolf]]-fitted {{sclass-|Leander|frigate}}s. The true manpower requirements for open water and power projection were too high in terms of fiscal cost, for UK spending 5.2 percent of GNP on defence in 1981 to justify hulls like the ''Tiger''s the USN withdrawing its last 6 inch gun hybrid cruisers in 1976 and 1979.  During the [[Falklands War]], the Belgarno's ability to efficiently fight her armament is doubtful and her two Exocet-armed FRAM 2 {{sclass-|Allen M. Sumner|destroyer|0}} escorts may have represented a greater threat to the Task Force.<ref>{{citation |first=C |last=Moore |title=Margaret Thatcher. The authorised biography. V1, Not for Turning. |publisher=Allen Lane |date=2013 |location=London |pages=711\u2013713}}</ref> The rapid-firing guns of 'Tiger' and 'Blake', and their flight-decks and facilities to refuel and maintain on station Sea King helicopters and possibly Harrier jumpjets, were arguments used to justify approving emergency reactivation as landing pads during the Falklands War. The stock of 3-inch ammunition held for the ''Tiger''s, however was more useful for the Canadian {{sclass-|St. Laurent|destroyer|4}}.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn April 1978, ''Tiger'' was withdrawn from service, followed by ''Blake'' in 1979; both ships were laid up in reserve at Chatham Dockyard. When ''Blake'' was decommissioned in 1979, she had the distinction of being the last cruiser to serve the Royal Navy and her passing was marked on 6 December 1979 when she ceremonially fired her 6-inch guns for the last time in the [[English Channel]]. Just a few days after the Falklands War started, both ''Blake'' and ''Tiger'' were rapidly surveyed to determine their condition for reactivation. The survey determined both ships to be in very good condition; they were put into dry-dock (''Blake'' at Chatham, and ''Tiger'' at Portsmouth) and round-the-clock work reactivation work was immediately begun. By mid-May it was determined that the ships would not be completed in time to take part in the war and the work was stopped.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Ships such as the ''Tiger''s required large crews, their Seacat missile was useless and 6-inch guns, too unreliable for useful GFS and the cruisers, needed heavy repairs to machinery and rewiring. Attempts to maintain more modern hulls for emergency reactivation, such as {{HMS|Intrepid|L11|2}} and {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} (amphibious assault ships), proved useful, and retaining HMS Devonshire and HMS Kent, first group County-class destroyers, with a cheap extended flight deck (replacing the Sea Slug launcher) for Sea Kings at Chatham dockyard, similarly half-manned and permanently maintained might have allowed a heavier GFS capability to actually fight in the Falklands War. The Tiger' helicopter cruisers' were often described and viewed in the Royal Navy as ' hideous and useless hybrids' <ref>P Smith & J Domiby. Cruisers in Action 1939-1945. William Kimber. !981. London, p 240</ref>\n\nThough [[Chile]] showed some interest in acquiring both ships, the sale did not proceed and the ships sat at anchor in an unmaintained condition until sold.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} ''Blake'' was then sold for breaking up in late 1982, followed by ''Tiger'' in 1986.\n\n==Ships of the class==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-valign=top\n!
