The game combines gameplay, narrative and aesthetic elements from Atlus's ''[[Megami Tensei|Shin Megami Tensei]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series. It was released in Japan in December 2015, and worldwide in June 2016. An enhanced port for the [[Nintendo Switch]], '''''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE Encore''''',{{efn|{{nihongo|Known in Japan as '''''Genei Ibunroku \u266fFE Encore'''''|\u5e7b\u5f71\u7570\u805e\u9332\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30d7\u30a8\u30d5\u30a4\u30fc Encore|Genei Ibunroku Sh\u0101pu Efu \u012a Encore|lit. ''Illusory Revelations \u266fFE Encore''}}, \u266f is pronounced as \"[[Sharp (music)|sharp]]\"}} was released on January 17, 2020.\n\nTaking place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and featuring real-life locations such as [[Shibuya]] and [[Harajuku]], the game centres around hostile beings known as Mirages who seek to harvest energy known as Performa from humans and are responsible for several disappearances. The story follows a group of teenagers who become allied with friendly Mirages, based on characters from the ''Fire Emblem'' series, and merge with them to become Mirage Masters. Under the guise of the Fortuna Entertainment [[talent agency]], the Mirage Masters fight to protect innocent people from the Mirages and find out who is behind the attacks.\n\nThe game was first proposed by Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who envisioned a crossover between the ''Fire Emblem'' and the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' series. Although initially reluctant due to their workload, Atlus agreed to the collaboration, and much of the early work went into deciding what genre of game it was going to be and how best to incorporate both series while creating an original game. The production period lasted five years. A notable feature was musical numbers produced by Japanese entertainment company [[Avex Group]].\n\nThe game was announced two months after full development began. Its Western release retains the Japanese voice track with subtitles rather than an English dub. Reception of the game was generally positive; many praised the battle system, reactions to the story were mixed to positive, and other elements such as dungeon designs and a lack of ''Fire Emblem''-related elements were criticized along with technical problems. The game was later chosen by critics as one of the best games for the Wii U.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' is a [[role-playing video game]] (RPG), and a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] between the ''[[Megami Tensei|Shin Megami Tensei]]'' and ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series. Set in modern-day [[Tokyo]], the game follows the members of a [[talent agency]] during their conflicts with hostile beings from another world called Mirages. To help them, the main cast are allied with friendly Mirages inspired by characters from multiple ''Fire Emblem'' games.<ref name=\"GIpreview\"/><ref name=\"FamRoundup\"/> The game's story is split up into several chapters, with the player also able to participate inside stories for various playable and supporting characters, as well as take quests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) in Tokyo.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/> The game alternates between real-world Tokyo and the Idolaspheres\u2014alternate dimensions where enemy Mirages roam.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/>\n\nPlayers control the main protagonist Itsuki as he explores both worlds, interacting with various characters. Players can spend money earned from battles to purchase restorative items that replenish health points (HP) and energy points (EP). Players can also purchase protective accessories, with shops offering lottery tickets allowing players to win additional items. Players can also find various items in the Idolospheres, either by finding hidden treasure chests or defeating enemies in battle. The [[Wii U GamePad]] displays an in-game social app known as Topic where players can receive messages from other characters, keep updated on available Unity fusions, and view a map of each area.<ref name=\"GIpreview\"/><ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/>\n\n===Unity system===\nBy utilizing a place called the Bloom Palace, players can perform two kinds of Unity ritual to strengthen their party: Carnage Unity and Radiant Unity. Carnage Unity uses Performa, which are obtained in battle by defeating monsters and performing crowd-pleasing techniques, to create new weapons for each character. Each weapon carries four skills which a party member can inherit by earning experience in battle. These include Command Skills, which allow the party member to perform various attacks and spells, Passive Skills, which offer passive stat boosts and effects, and Session Skills, which are used to chain together Session Attacks. Each character can only hold six skills of each type, but if they inherit a skill they already have, it is stacked on top and becomes more effective. Radiant Unity uses Performa that is born from within each party member, either through plot progression and clearing side stories, or by increasing a character's Star Ranking in a battle to grant them Radiant Skills. These are permanent skills separate from those inherited from weapons, and include passive effects such as increased health or extended Session Attacks as well as skills that can be performed in battle.<ref name=\"GIpreview\"/><ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/>\n\n===Battle system===\n[[File:Genei Ibunroku Gameplay.png|thumb|left|A battle from ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'', showing the battle arena, main characters, current enemies, and HUD display]]\nThe party's activities alternate between events in the real world and exploration through dungeons in the Idolospheres, each designed around a specific theme. Unlocked by progressing through the story, the party navigates through multiple floors, activating switches and devices to solve puzzles and advance while avoiding traps and encountering or avoiding enemies represented by sprites on the field. The dungeon map is displayed on the GamePad. Once cleared, dungeons can be replayed at any time.<ref name=\"FamRoundup\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/><ref name=\"NinManual\"/> Friendly NPC mirages also act as merchants within dungeons.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/> Battles are triggered when an enemy touches the party touched. The player can attack a Mirage on the field to stun it, allowing them to perform a pre-emptive attack or avoid battle.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/>\n\nThe game features a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system in which party members and enemy Mirages take turns to perform actions such as attacking, casting spells, and using items. The player's party consists of three main characters which, except main character Itsuki, can be swapped out both inside and outside of battle.<ref name=\"GIpreview\"/><ref name=\"NinManual\"/> Similar to both ''Fire Emblem'' and ''Shin Megami Tensei''{{'}}s battle systems, party members and enemies each have strengths and weaknesses against certain types of physical attacks, such as swords and arrows, and elemental attacks, such as fire and ice. The affinities of each party member change depending on the weapon they have equipped.<ref name=\"FamRoundup\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/>\n\nSession Attacks are [[Combo (video gaming)|combination]] attacks that can be triggered by targeting an enemy's weakness. If another party member possesses a Session Skill linking to the type of attack used, they will automatically perform a pursuit attack, which may then trigger another attack and so on. For example, if one party member attacks with an ice attack, another party member with an Ice-Elec skill will follow up with an electrical attack. Session Attacks may also be carried out by the enemy if they target a party member's weakness.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/> By building up a special meter through attacks, players can earn SP which can be used to trigger Performance attacks, which can be earned through Unity and by completing side-stories. These are called Duo Attacks which are performed by a partner's Mirage. Dual Attacks, on the other hand, can be triggered during a Session Attack to extend the combo at random times. Additionally, party members can learn Ad-lib Performances which may randomly activate while performing certain skills.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name= \"GemSkills\"/>\n\nAlong with items and money earned from battles, winning battles earn experience points which increase each party member's level and allows them to learn skills from their weapons. Performing well in battles, such as achieving quick victories or successful Session Attacks, increases party members' Stage Level, which unlock Performa for Radiant Skills and opens up new side stories. The game ends, sending the player back to the title screen, if all party members are knocked unconscious by running out of HP.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, [[Japan]]. The story moves between multiple well-known city districts, such as [[Shibuya]] and [[Harajuku]].<ref name= \"E3Demo\"/> In the universe of ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'', everyone holds energy called Performa that enables them to pursue their dreams. Performa attracts beings called Mirages, who hail from an alternate dimension called the Idolasphere: while some Mirages harvest Performa for malicious motives, others form alliances with humans to protect the real world. Those who form alliances with friendly Mirages are referred to as Mirage Masters. The main casts are employees and associates of Fortuna Entertainment, a [[talent agency]] that secretly acts as a hub and recruiting organization for Mirage Masters.<ref name=\"FamRoundup\"/><ref name= \"SilStory\"/>\n\nThe main protagonist is Itsuki Aoi,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u84bc\u4e95\u6a39||Aoi Itsuki}}}} a young boy who by chance becomes involved with Fortuna Entertainment, and is initially uninterested in the business. The other human main characters are Tsubasa Oribe,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u7e54\u90e8\u3064\u3070\u3055||Oribe Tsubasa}}}} an optimistic and hard-working classmate of Itsuki who seeks to become a pop idol; Touma Akagi,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u8d64\u57ce\u6597\u99ac||Akagi Touma}}}} an impulsive friend of Itsuki and Tsubasa working to become an actor in a [[tokusatsu]] show; Kiria Kurono,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u9ed2\u4e43\u9727\u4e9c||Kurono Kiria}}}} a famous idol and veteran Mirage Master; Eleonora Yumizuru,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u5f13\u5f26 \u30a8\u30ec\u30aa\u30ce\u30fc\u30e9||Yumizuru Eleonora}}}} a successful half-[[Scandinavia]]n actress; Mamori Minamoto,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u6e90 \u307e\u3082\u308a||Minamoto Mamori}}}} a cooking show host with a taste for [[Sh\u014dwa period]] clothing and music; and Yashiro Tsurugi,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u5263\u5f25\u4ee3||Tsurugi Yashiro}}}} a superstar male idol who is initially hostile towards the party and their ambitions. The group are aided by Maiko Shimazaki,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u5fd7\u6469\u5d0e \u821e\u5b50||Shimazaki Maiko}}}} a former model who is the head of Fortuna Entertainment;{{efn|Maiko is a former [[Model (person)#Gravure idols|Gravure idol]] in the Japanese version.}} and Barry Goodman,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u30d0\u30ea\u30a3\u30fb\u30b0\u30c3\u30c9\u30de\u30f3||Bar\u012b Guddoman}}}} a strict instructor from overseas with a love of otaku culture.<ref name= \"SilMain1\"/><ref name= \"SilMain2\"/><ref name= \"SilMain3\"/> The Mirages who ally with the cast are Chrom, Virion and Tharja from ''[[Fire Emblem Awakening]]'', and Caeda, Cain, Draug and Navarre from ''[[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light]]''.<ref name= \"SilMain2\"/><ref name= \"SilMirages\"/> A different Mirage is Tiki, who provides assistance to the Mirage Masters and is portrayed in the real world as a popular \"[[Utau|utaloid]]\".<ref name= \"SilMain1\"/>\n\n===Plot===\n''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' opens five years before the game's main events: at an opera attended by a young Tsubasa and Yashiro, everyone apart from Tsubasa vanishes without a trace. In the present, Itsuki encounters Tsubasa at the One of Millennium talent audition event, where she is hoping to begin her career as an idol. The compare is possessed by a hostile Mirage, and everyone in the building apart from Itsuki and Tsubasa is stripped of their Performa. Itsuki follows Tsubasa into the Idolasphere, and both are attacked by hostile Mirages. Awakening to their Performa, they use it to cleanse the Mirages: their attackers are revealed to be Chrom and Caeda, who ally with Itsuki and Tsubasa respectively. With help from Touma, who is the Mirage Master to Cain, the party free the pair from the hostile Mirage's control.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms1\"/> Leaving the Idolasphere, they encounter Maiko, who offers them positions alongside Touma in Fortuna Entertainment so they can both forward their entertainment careers and help fight Mirage attacks alongside Kiria and her Mirage Tharja. They are aided by Tiki, who is suffering from amnesia similar to the other allied Mirages.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms1\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms2\"/>\n\nFurther attacks follow at multiple locations throughout Tokyo, each focusing on leading entertainment and media figureheads being possessed by hostile Mirages: these Mirages are revealed to be servants of a greater power.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms2\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms3\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms4\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms5\"/> During one mission, the group rescue producer Yatsufusa Hatanaka, who later keeps a close watch on them.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms4\"/> They also gather new allies in the form of Elenora and her partner Virion; and Mamori and her partner Draug, who was the former partner of and initially possessed Barry.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms4\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms5\"/> On many missions, Yashiro and his partner Navarre watches and sometimes acts as an antagonistic force, before Itsuki's leadership and strength persuade him that he can help him avenge his father, who was the lead singer in the opera five years before.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms5\"/> The group find an item called a Dragonstone, which restores some of Tiki's memories. She reveals that she and the other friendly Mirages unsuccessfully attempted to stop the dark mage Gharnef summoning the Shadow Dragon Medeus into their native realm with a ceremony called the Opera of Shadows. Tiki was banished into the Idolasphere, which acted as an intermediate dimension between the real world and her world, and she was instrumental in preventing Gharnef from performing the Opera of Shadows a second time to enter the real world as his native realm had become drained of artistic energy. His attempt sparked the mass disappearance of five years before, and Tiki shielded both Tsubasa and Yashiro at the cost of her memories.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms6\"/>\n\nAfter this, the Cosmic Egg Stadium is consumed by an Idolasphere portal. Heading to the Cosmic Egg, the party are stopped by Hatanaka, who reveals himself to be the willing Mirage Master of Gharnef: the two are planning to perform the Opera of Shadows, summoning Medeus to consume the real world's Performa.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms6\"/> The group recover Dragonstones from the conquered Idolosphere realms and restore Tiki's memory: she reveals that they must find the pieces of the Fire Emblem and perform the Opera of Light to summon the power of the Divine Dragon Naga, the only force capable of stopping Medeus. Collecting the Fire Emblem pieces, they learn the story of the Hero-King [[Marth (Fire Emblem)|Marth]], a warrior from ancient times who bested and sealed away Gharnef and Medeus. The group encounter and defeats Hatanaka and Gharnef, but their sacrifice coupled with the offering of Marth's soul completes the Opera of Shadows and summons Medeus. Traveling to the final Idolasphere realm, Itsuki is fatally injured by Medeus, but the Fire Emblem gems free Marth's soul, which saves Itsuki and allows the group to perform the Opera of Light and defeat Medeus. The Mirages, with their memories, restored and Medeus was gone forever, return with Tiki to their native realm.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms6\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms7\"/>\n\nAlongside the main narrative are side stories involving various members of Fortuna Entertainment, which Itsuki can help as he learns from working in various sectors of the agency's business. These quests' storylines include Tsubasa working to create her idol persona;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms8\"/> Touma's wish to become an inspirational actor;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms9\"/> Kiria's discomfort with her softer side, which clashes with her professional identity;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms10\"/> Eleanora's attempts to polish her abilities as an actress in preparation for a hoped-for Hollywood career;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms11\"/> Mamori pushing to expand her professional range beyond her cooking host role;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms12\"/> Yashiro breaking out of his self-imposed personal and professional isolation, culminating in a battle with his father's spirit;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms13\"/> the often-tipsy Maiko's efforts to maintain Fortuna's public and private functions;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms14\"/> Barry's antics and his growing insecurity after losing his Mirage Master abilities;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms15\"/> and Tiki wanting the chance to experience the real world.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms16\"/> If all the side stories are completed, a post-credits scene is unlocked where Maiko returns to modelling, and Itsuki is unanimously instated as the new manager of Fortuna Entertainment.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms17\"/>\n\n===Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE Encore===\nStarting After Event of Original version, Itsuki Annouced the Official tournament combat Sports Named ''Fortuna League Championship'' Itsuki Invite Fortuna Entertainment's Competitors and New challengers Join the League at Fortuna Stadium Mr.Zark is the Host of Tournament.\n\n==Development==\n''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' was the brainchild of Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who voiced her wish to make a ''Fire Emblem'' crossover to fellow producer Hitoshi Yamagami in 2010. Ando's initial vision was for a collaboration between the ''Fire Emblem'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series, but this was rejected as a similar collaboration was being developed in the form of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Conquest]]''. Ando redrafted her proposal and submitted it a week later as a crossover between ''Fire Emblem'' and ''Shin Megami Tensei''.<ref name=\"GeneiPoki\"/> [[Atlus]], the developer of the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' series, had previously worked with Nintendo on a game titled ''Itsumo Purikura \u2606 Kuradeko Premium'' for the [[Nintendo DSi]] and [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]]. When the project was originally pitched to Atlus in 2010, it was assumed that they were not interested after their unenthusiastic response and later said they were too busy to undertake the collaboration. Over a year later, Atlus inquired as to whether the subject was still open for discussion, and it transpired that they had been highly enthusiastic while still being too busy with other projects. Shinjiro Takada, who was also working on ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2]]'', was appointed as a producer. While he had viewed ''Fire Emblem'' as a rival and quality goal for his work, he was honored to be given the chance to develop a title related to ''Fire Emblem''.<ref name= \"KotakuBeginnings\"/><ref name= \"OriginBlog\"/> The game's directors were Mitsuru Hirata, who was supporting director on ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey]]'', and Eiji Ishida, who worked on both ''Strange Journey'' and ''[[Shin Megami Tensei IV]]''. Hirata was originally the project's sole director, but seven months after the game's public announcement, Ishida was brought on to co-direct so the amount of work needed for the title could be managed. According to Ishida, it was the company's first original game for [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth-generation consoles]].<ref name= \"SilDirector1\"/><ref name= \"SilDirector2\"/> Full development began in 2013.<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/> From conception to release, production on ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' lasted five years.<ref name= \"OriginBlog\"/>\n\nDuring the early production, what type of game it would become crucial to whether Atlus or ''Fire Emblem'' developer [[Intelligent Systems]] would develop it. One of the problems that needed to be overcome was the form of the initial proposal, which was for a simulation game similar to ''Fire Emblem'' developed by Atlus. Atlus, who was better known for making traditional role-playing games, was unsure which series to emulate. The decision was eventually made to create something along the lines of a traditional RPG, so Atlus took on primary development. Their first concept turned out to be a grid-based strategy game with strategic positioning elements similar to ''Fire Emblem'', but they were eventually convinced by Yamagami and staff from [[Intelligent Systems]] to keep within their skill set rather than attempting anything radically different. The final product was visualized as a game only Atlus could make, incorporating elements from both series while standing as an original title that could be enjoyed by fans of both ''Shin Megami Tensei'' and ''Fire Emblem''.<ref name=\"GeneiPoki\"/><ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/><ref name= \"SilProducer\"/> The game's platform was chosen based on the recent successful ''Fire Emblem'' entries for the 3DS: as ''Fire Emblem'' had appeared on the 3DS, ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' was to be a different \"expression\" designed for the [[Wii U]].<ref name=\"GSpost\"/> During these early stages, proposals were also made for a 3DS version, but this never materialized.<ref name=\"GeneiPoki\"/> Despite its ultimate form, some of the conceptual ideas were taken from early plans for ''Fire Emblem Awakening'' to take place in a modern-day setting.<ref name=\"FEbookInfo\"/> The inclusion of a sharp symbol in the title, which represents a semitone increase in the pitch of a note in [[musical notation]], denoted the game's status as a unique hybrid of the two series. The inclination of the logo was also designed to represent the game's altered perspective on the ''Fire Emblem'' series.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> The game's cutscenes were created by Studio Anima and [[Studio 4\u00b0C]].<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/><ref name= \"FamInterview\"/>\n\n===Scenario and design===\n[[File:Shibuya 109 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE''{{'}}s setting makes use of contemporary locations in Tokyo, such as the [[109 (department store)|Shibuya 109 department store]], which was used as the thematic inspiration for a dungeon.<ref name= \"E3Demo\"/><ref name= \"FamInterview\"/>]]\nThe scenario was written by Yoh Haduki and Makoto Miyauchi. Haduki was in charge of the main narrative, while Miyauchi handled the side stories for the main cast. During the early scenario development, it was thought that the main characters would be reincarnations of ''Fire Emblem'' characters, but this was dismissed as it would link it too strongly to the ''Fire Emblem'' series. When going through how to help incorporate ''Fire Emblem'' characters within the \"Atlus mythos\", they decided to use a concept from [[Shamanism#Japan|Japanese Shamanism]] called the \"kami oroshi\", which stands for a deity possessing and communicating through a priest or ritual dancer. A further extension of this was the incorporation of the [[Kagura|kagura ritual dance]], which in turn led to the inclusion of the entertainment theme.<ref name= \"WritersBlog\"/> Inspiration was also from traditional [[Noh]] theater.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> The character of Itsuki Aoi, who is not directly associated with any branch of Japanese media and entertainment, was created to introduce the setting and characters from an outsider's point of view.<ref name= \"WritersBlog\"/> Itsuki was also a rarity among Atlus protagonists in that he took an active role in conversations with other characters rather than being a silent protagonist.<ref name=\"NinDreamShibuya\"/>\n\nThe side stories were created so the player could better understand and empathize with the struggles of entertainers in the industry and their private lives.<ref name= \"WritersBlog\"/> Part of the team's struggle was balancing the main story and side missions and making both appealing to players. During an earlier stage, there was no divide between these two mission types, which ended up clashing with major story events and prompting players to ignore the side stories. To counter this, \"Intermission\" periods were created where side story chapters could be accessed. In the end, the side stories became a large part of the game's thematic base, causing Yamagami to consider them something more.<ref name=\"NinDreamShibuya\"/> The general infusion of [[Japanese idol#Culture|Japanese pop idol culture]] and the [[performing arts]] into the title was Atlus's take on traditions within Japanese Shamanism where the dancing of priestesses brought them closer to the gods they worshiped: in the game, it is through their performances that the main characters draw the attention of the Mirages and summon them into the real world.<ref name= \"GSinterview\"/> Also working on the scenario was Aoi Akashiro, a writer whose resume included anime and video games.<ref name=\"TMSwriter\"/>\n\nAesthetically, the game used ''Fire Emblem'' elements as motifs, but took its setting and premise of a clash between worlds from ''Shin Megami Tensei''. The battle system was originally going to be similar to a ''Fire Emblem'' game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system.<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/> After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together.<ref name= \"SilProducer\"/> Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark scenarios of the ''Megami Tensei'' series.<ref name=\"GSpost\"/> The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating ''Fire Emblem'' characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping into a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing ''Fire Emblem'' characters as human party members. In the end, it was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of ''Shin Megami Tensei'', drawn into the real world from their Idolosphere dimension.<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/><ref name= \"GSinterview\"/>\n\nTo make real-world locations as realistic as possible, the team went on multiple scouting trips, taking photographs of locations like the [[109 (department store)|Shibuya 109 department store]]. They originally wanted to mimic the chosen areas of Tokyo very closely, but they needed to consider how this might make travel times between locations overly long for players: this was done by incrementally reducing the scale of environments while keeping the scenery and aesthetic intact. According to Hirata, the process of designing Shibuya alone took between one and two years.<ref name=\"NinDreamShibuya\"/> Battles were designed around the concept of a stage, with an audience made up of Mirages raised into excitement by the party's performance. In-battle rewards of money were designed to be \"ohineri\" (paper-wrapped offerings) rewarded to the party for their performance. An early version of the battle transition screen was an \"assistant director\" using a [[clapperboard]], then offering in-battle commentary. These elements were completely cut from the game. Other elements that were cut included a high amount of camera movement during battles and [[booing]] from the audience when the party made mistakes.<ref name=\"NinDreamShibuya\"/>\n\nThe game's art director was Fumitaka Yano of Atlus.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> The main aesthetic chosen for the game revolved around bright colors, a noted shift from the majority of Atlus's previous games.<ref name= \"SummeryBlog\"/> The bright colors were designed to emulate the focus on the entertainment industry, with various shades and effects portraying a colorful world. In contrast, the dungeons were designed around fantasy motifs and meant to embody the Mirages having been robbed of \"expression\". The game's dungeons were based around real-world locations within Tokyo, and had gimmicks inspired by a chosen location: for instance, one dungeon inspired by Shibuya 109 was themed around fashion.<ref name= \"E3Demo\"/><ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> The main characters were designed by [[toi8]],{{efn|Pronounced \"toi-Hachi\"}} a Japanese artist noted for his work on ''[[.hack//The Movie]]''. When he was approached, he was finishing work on the cover of a light novel and wondering what he would be doing next. While his previous work used a low [[Colorfulness|color saturation]], for ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' he used high color saturation suited to its setting.<ref name= \"SilArtist\"/> According to Takada, the team asked toi8 to design the world in this way to create \"a feeling of both friendliness and splendor\".<ref name= \"SilProducer\"/> The Mirage characters were designed by Hideo Minaba of Japanese design company CyDesignation, and were based on characters from ''Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light'' and ''Awakening''. They were designed to contrast with toi8's character designs with the deliberate exception of Tiki, having a machine-like appearance.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> This was due to the long battle the characters had been facing: their armor reflected the dark events they had faced, and parts of themselves unneeded for survival have degenerated.<ref name= \"DirectorsBlog\"/> Minaba had been a fan of the ''Fire Emblem'' series and encountered difficulties designing the characters. His main aim was to remain true to the original characters while emulating the sharp and dark character style of Atlus games.<ref name= \"MinabaBlog\"/>\n\n===Audio===\n====Music====\nFrom an early stage, Atlus wanted to have [[Avex Group]] cooperating on musical numbers. The planned style, which would have vocal themes performed like music videos or sample trailers, needed a level of professionalism the team felt only Avex could provide.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> The in-game music was composed by Yoshiaki Fujisawa, who was famous for his work on the Japanese multimedia project ''[[Love Live!]]''. Fujisawa was contacted in late 2013 by George Aburai, an in-house composer who also worked with multiple well-known entertainers at Avex Group. Fujisawa found the composition difficult as he was more used to composing for television series rather than video games. To help him, Atlus's sound team gave him advice about aspects such as the timing, feel, and emotive elements of tracks. Ultimately, he found the working environment fun and was pleased when he first saw a test video featuring one of his songs. As a central story theme was the entertainment industry, the soundtrack was filled with vocal tunes and \"[[Groove (music)|groovy]]\" tracks.<ref name= \"MusicInterview\"/><ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/> The game features stage performances involving the main characters, which were produced and choreographed by Aburai for Avex Group.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/><ref name= \"AburaiBlog1\"/> The performances made use of full-motion capture, and the 3D animation for the choreographed performances was handled by Studio Anima.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/>\n\nAburai formed a group from various areas of Avex Group to work on production. After forming his team, Aburai worked to analyze the personalities and traits of the main cast to determine how their performances would play out, in addition to other factors such as their professions' impact on their portrayal.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/> The only vocal theme composed by Fujisawa was \"Fire Emblem ~Drama of Light~\", which used an arranged version of the ''Fire Emblem'' theme composed by [[Yuka Tsujiyoko]]. The remaining vocal themes each handled by different composers, many either working with or with previous ties to Avex Group.<ref name=\"OSTliners\"/> A prominent theme was \"Reincarnation\", which was the first song to be created and gave Aburai the most trouble as it would set the standard of the game's music.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> Two notable songs not performed by the main cast were \"Distance between you and me\" by the fictional idol group Emotional Key, performed by Karin Nanami, Yumi Wakatsuki and Mina Nakazawa; and the in-game anime theme \"Dia Sweet Witch\" performed by former ''[[Idoling!!!]]'' singer Mayu Sekiya.<ref name=\"SongBlog\"/><ref name=\"AvexAlbumA\"/>\n\nA commercial CD release featuring all the game's vocal themes, ''Genei Ibunroku \u266fFE Vocal Collection'', was released February 10, 2016 by Avex Group's music label [[Avex Trax]].<ref name=\"AvexAlbumA\"/> The CD included eighteen songs, all full versions mainly not heard in the game itself.<ref name=\"SongBlog\"/> A full soundtrack album, ''Genei Ibunroku \u266fFE Encore Best Sound Collection'', was released by Avex Trax on January 17, 2020. The 3-CD album included all the original vocal themes, official versions of the in-game music, and new music and the song \"She Is...\" from ''Encore''.<ref name=\"AvexAlbumB\"/>\n\n====Casting====\nDue to the performing aspect of the game, the team were faced with the difficulty of finding voice actors and actresses who could both act and sing.<ref name= \"E3Demo\"/> Voice actor [[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]] was given the role of Itsuki, which he played so Itsuki would lack a strong personality as he was essentially the player's avatar.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog1\"/> Itsuki's only two songs were \"Fire Emblem ~Drama of Light~\" and \"Smile Smile\", which both focused on strong bonds with the other cast members.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> Actress and singer [[Inori Minase]] voiced Tsubasa; Minase played Tsubasa as the opposite of her normal persona, and encountered difficulties portraying her as \"normal\".<ref name=\"VoiceBlog2\"/> Touma was voiced by actor [[Y\u016bki Ono]], who called the role \"straight and refreshing\". Ono also sang Touma's theme \"Jump! \u014cga!\".<ref name=\"VoiceBlog3\"/> Kiria's actress [[Yoshino Nanj\u014d]] strove to portray her character in a \"cool\" way without her coming off as cold, reflecting the character's inner softness. Nanj\u014d found recording the songs strenuous as she was unused to character-based singles.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog4\"/> Nanj\u014d's performance of Kiria's song \"Reincarnation\" needed to be redone around ten times until it fitted properly with the character's personality.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/> [[Ayane Sakura]] voices Eleanora, who despite being nervous made an effort to portray the character in a bullish yet clumsy way, pushing to balance her forward manner with making her appealing for players.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog5\"/>\n\n[[Kaori Fukuhara]], the actress for Mamori, portrayed her role so the character would sound childlike without being overly childish in her manner and tone.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog6\"/> Yashiro's voice actor [[Yoshimasa Hosoya]] found singing for the role difficult as he lacked a natural sense of rhythm.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog7\"/> Yashiro's main song was made deliberately complex, as the character singing it on stage would emphasise his skills.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> Tiki's voice actress [[Sumire Morohoshi]] found the role difficult due to Tiki's role as an explanatory figure, together with the dramatic elements of her amnesia and wish to experience the real world.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog10\"/> Tiki's first song \"Beastie Game\" drew from multiple musical genres to reflect her status as a Vocaloid.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/> When recording \"Beastie Game\", Morohoshi was surprised upon hearing her voice processed to sound like a vocaloid. For her second song, \"Not A Phantom World\", Morohoshi had to record multiple chorus elements which were then layered as backing for the main song, encountering difficulties making all her harmonies work together properly.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog10\"/> [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]] portrayed Barry as the group's mood maker,<ref name=\"VoiceBlog8\"/> while Maiko's actress [[Ami Koshimizu]] worked to make her character both aloof and charming.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog9\"/> During voice and song recording, Aburai actively talked with the cast about their vocal nuances and interpretations of each song.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/>\n\n==Release and promotion==\n[[File:Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem logo.png|thumb|left|The game was announced under the title ''Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem'']]\nThe game was announced in January 2013 as part of a [[List of Nintendo Direct presentations|Nintendo Direct]] presentation under the English working title ''Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem'', announced as one of many planned collaboration projects with third-party developers for the Wii U. The trailer featured artwork of characters from the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' and ''Fire Emblem'' series, and concluded with the message \"Development in Progress\".<ref name= \"GemAnnounce\"/> There was much initial speculation by journalists as to the game's genre due to the trailer's vague nature.<ref name= \"KotakuSpeculation\"/><ref name= \"DesSpeculation\"/> Atlus confirmed the following day that the game was an RPG, and that it would be developed by Atlus and produced by Nintendo.<ref name= \"GemConfirmation\"/><ref name=\"SilAnnouncement\"/> At the time of its announcement, many parts of the game had yet to be developed and finalized, as it had only been two months since the beginning of development.<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/>\n\nThe lack of reports after the initial announcement raised concerns that the game had been cancelled. During an interview at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014]] concerning ''[[Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.]]'' and whether its development was affecting ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'', Yamagami confirmed that the game was still in development and on schedule.<ref name= \"SilYamagami\"/> In April 2015, a gameplay trailer was released during a Nintendo Direct broadcast, which also confirmed the game's Japanese title and release window.<ref name= \"GemReveal\"/> The Japanese title, ''Genei Ibunroku \u266fFE'', translates to \"''Illusory Revelations \u266fFE''\".<ref name=\"TMSjptitle\"/> First-print runs of the Japanese release included codes for special costumes inspired by other Atlus games. In addition, Atlus produced a \"Fortissimo Edition\", containing a special box, an original artbook, a six-track CD release including \"Reincarnation\", and [[downloadable content]] (DLC) outfits for the playable characters. A Wii U bundle was also created, featuring similar content in addition to special stickers and special lyric cards.<ref name= \"GeneiJPrelease\"/> Between its original reveal and the retail release, Kiria's stage costume for her number \"Reincarnation\" was altered to be less revealing.<ref name= \"KiriaChange\"/> DLC was created for the title as both promotional material and post-release content, which included downloadable scenarios including a \"[[Onsen|Hot Spring]]\" scenario.<ref name= \"SilDLC\"/>\n\nAn English version was announced at E3 2015, with the release date being revealed in a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation in March 2016.<ref name= \"GemRelease\"/><ref name=\"ReleaseWest\"/> It was released in North America and Europe on June 24, 2016, and in Australia the following day.<ref name=\"ReleaseWest\"/><ref name=\"ReleaseAus\"/> A limited edition similar to Japan's \"Fortissimo Edition\" was made available as an online exclusive through [[Amazon.com]] and [[GameStop]]: it is titled the \"Special Edition\" in North America and \"Fortissimo Edition\" in Europe.<ref name=\"WestSpecial\"/> Aside from the Hot Springs scenario and its associated [[Swimsuit|swimwear outfits]], all Japanese DLC was released in the West for the game's launch.<ref name=\"TMSdlcWest\"/>\n\n===Localization===\nDue to the game's Japanese setting and focus, in addition to people preferring overseas songs in their original languages, the Western version of the game features Japanese audio with subtitles rather than an English dub. Finding English actors to perform the game's songs would also have lengthened the estimated localization time by a whole year.<ref name=\"ReleaseWest\"/><ref name=\"GSpost\"/> Its localization was handled by Atlus staff rather than Nintendo's internal localization division Nintendo Treehouse. Atlus was chosen over Nintendo due to fan expectation of the type of localization common to an Atlus-published title, and the wish to make the game appeal to long-term fans of the company's work.<ref name=\"GSpost\"/><ref name=\"AtlusLocal\"/> This placed the game in contrast with the majority of other Nintendo titles localized for the West, where Nintendo's attitude was described as \"very hands-on\".<ref name=\"GSpost\"/>\n\nSome aspects of the game were changed for its Western release:<ref name=\"GSpost\"/> these changes included the removal or alteration of several revealing costumes, the removal of visual and dialogue references to [[Model (person)#Gravure idols|Gravure modelling]], and changes to the ages of certain characters. Multiple sections of dialogue were re-recorded to match these changes.<ref name=\"ShackChanges\"/> The game's Hot Springs scenario and associated costumes also went unreleased.<ref name=\"TMSdlcWest\"/><ref name=\"ShackChanges\"/> The removed outfits were replaced with Western-exclusive outfits.<ref name=\"TMSoutfits\"/> Changes to content were attributed to Nintendo's varying content requirements and regulations for the regions the game was released in.<ref name=\"AtlusLocal\"/> Staff later defended these changes as necessary adjustments based on the regions they would be releasing the game in, while working on keeping the core identity intact.<ref name=\"GSpost\"/> After the game's Western release, staff were divided on the issue: Yamagami was positive about the game's adaption for a Western audience, while Hirata was initially disappointed with the alterations before seeing positive responses to the game from Western fans.<ref name=\"GSpost\"/><ref name=\"LocalComment\"/> Following the game's Western release, a fan-developed patch was released that reverted all the localization changes, ranging from cosmetic alteration to script changes.<ref name=\"TMSpatch\"/>\n\n===''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE Encore''===\nAn expanded port of the game for the [[Nintendo Switch]], titled ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE Encore'', was released on January 17, 2020. The port includes new story content and additional party members along with new music.<ref name=\"GeneiEncoreA\"/><ref name=\"GeneiEncoreB\"/> Some new content was also incorporated from more recent ''Fire Emblem'' and Atlus titles such as unlockable costumes based on ''[[Persona 5]]'' and ''[[Fire Emblem: Three Houses]]''.<ref>http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/joker_costume_spotted_on_the_back_of_tokyo_mirage_sessions_fe_encore_box_art</ref> Content that was previously DLC was now incorporated into the base game. As Nintendo were aiming for a simultaneous worldwide release, they decided to use the Western version\u2014including its localization changes\u2014as their base. Nintendo later issued a formal apology and offered pre-order cancellation options to Japanese buyers for failing to provide information regarding the changes ahead of time.<ref

gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' found the story's premise entertaining and interesting, and praised the side stories' focus on the supporting cast.<ref name=\"FamReview\"/> Chris Carter of

mess\", but positively compared side stories to the Social Link systems from the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> David Roberts\u2014writing for [[GamesRadar]]\u2014noted the story's lighthearted tone compared to other Atlus projects despite its dark opening premise,<ref name=\"GRrerview\"/> and Meghan Sullivan of [[IGN]] found the characters bland and the narrative poor compared to other aspects of the game.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> [[Nintendo Life]]'s Conor McMahon noted the story's blatant use of its contemporary setting and entertainment theme, praised the side stories and praised the way the personalities of ''Fire Emblem'' characters were preserved.<ref name=\"NLreview\"/> Daan Koopman of Nintendo World Report enjoyed the narrative due to its brisk pace and highlights of the Japanese entertainment industry,<ref name=\"NWRreview\"/> while [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s Janine Hawkins positively compared the story to [[magical girl]] anime, calling it \"a co-ed version of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' for the ''Love Live!'' age\".<ref name=\"PolyReview\"/> Multiple reviewers noted a lack of ''Fire Emblem'' references, with several expressing disappointment with this imbalance.<ref name=\"DesReview\"/><ref name=\"EuroReview\"/><ref name=\"FamReview\"/><ref name=\"GIreview\"/><ref name=\"GRevReview\"/><ref name=\"NLreview\"/> \n\n''Famitsu'' praised the aesthetics and user interface design,<ref name=\"FamReview\"/> while Cartar enjoyed the art design despite clear technical limitations.<ref name=\"DesReview\"/> Khaw praised the animated cutscenes,<ref name=\"EuroReview\"/> and Wallace praised the character and monster designs despite finding the graphics dated and environments lacking detail.<ref name=\"GIreview\"/> McMahon positively referred to

progression,<ref name=\"DesReview\"/> Wallace praised the controls and combat, finding satisfying depth in its systems despite a need to grind for experience points.<ref name=\"GIreview\"/> Khaw enjoyed the mechanics and style of the combat system, and praised the game for its relaxed pace.<ref name=\"EuroReview\"/> Kozanitis praised the blending of elements from both series, praising the combo mechanics and character growth systems.<ref name=\"GRevReview\"/> Corriea found the overall experience entertaining and engaging, but found boss fights brought down the experience due to becoming endurance tests rather than requiring any strategy.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> Despite criticizing the limit on skills, Roberts enjoyed the complexity and strategy of combat, praising it for removing the more tedious elements of its parent series.<ref name=\"GRrerview\"/> Sullivan praised the combat, calling the Session attacks its best feature and enjoying the overall spectacle and customization systems.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> McMahon praised the game's unique systems along with its blend of series elements, but found the GamePad difficult to use.<ref name=\"NLreview\"/>

name=\"NWRreview\"/> Hawkins also enjoyed the Session attacks, and praised the combat system and growth systems.<ref name=\"PolyReview\"/> Several reviewers found dungeon progression difficult due to backtracking or bland puzzles.<ref name=\"GIreview\"/><ref name=\"GRrerview\"/><ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"PolyReview\"/>\n\n===Sales===\nAccording to ''Famitsu'', the game debuted at #13

The game combines gameplay, narrative and aesthetic elements from Atlus's ''[[Megami Tensei|Shin Megami Tensei]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series. It was released in Japan in December 2015, and worldwide in June 2016. An enhanced port for the [[Nintendo Switch]], '''''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE Encore''''',{{efn|{{nihongo|Known in Japan as '''''Genei Ibunroku \u266fFE Encore'''''|\u5e7b\u5f71\u7570\u805e\u9332\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30d7\u30a8\u30d5\u30a4\u30fc Encore|Genei Ibunroku Sh\u0101pu Efu \u012a Encore|lit. ''Illusory Revelations \u266fFE Encore''}}, \u266f is pronounced as \"[[Sharp (music)|sharp]]\"}} was released on January 17, 2020.\n\nTaking place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and featuring real-life locations such as [[Shibuya]] and [[Harajuku]], the game centres around hostile beings known as Mirages who seek to harvest energy known as Performa from humans and are responsible for several disappearances. The story follows a group of teenagers who become allied with friendly Mirages, based on characters from the ''Fire Emblem'' series, and merge with them to become Mirage Masters. Under the guise of the Fortuna Entertainment [[talent agency]], the Mirage Masters fight to protect innocent people from the Mirages and find out who is behind the attacks.\n\nThe game was first proposed by Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who envisioned a crossover between the ''Fire Emblem'' and the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' series. Although initially reluctant due to their workload, Atlus agreed to the collaboration, and much of the early work went into deciding what genre of game it was going to be and how best to incorporate both series while creating an original game. The production period lasted five years. A notable feature was musical numbers produced by Japanese entertainment company [[Avex Group]].\n\nThe game was announced two months after full development began. Its Western release retains the Japanese voice track with subtitles rather than an English dub. Reception of the game was generally positive; many praised the battle system, reactions to the story were mixed to positive, and other elements such as dungeon designs and a lack of ''Fire Emblem''-related elements were criticized along with technical problems. The game was later chosen by critics as one of the best games for the Wii U.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' is a [[role-playing video game]] (RPG), and a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] between the ''[[Megami Tensei|Shin Megami Tensei]]'' and ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series. Set in modern-day [[Tokyo]], the game follows the members of a [[talent agency]] during their conflicts with hostile beings from another world called Mirages. To help them, the main cast are allied with friendly Mirages inspired by characters from multiple ''Fire Emblem'' games.<ref name=\"GIpreview\"/><ref name=\"FamRoundup\"/> The game's story is split up into several chapters, with the player also able to participate inside stories for various playable and supporting characters, as well as take quests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) in Tokyo.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/> The game alternates between real-world Tokyo and the Idolaspheres\u2014alternate dimensions where enemy Mirages roam.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/>\n\nPlayers control the main protagonist Itsuki as he explores both worlds, interacting with various characters. Players can spend money earned from battles to purchase restorative items that replenish health points (HP) and energy points (EP). Players can also purchase protective accessories, with shops offering lottery tickets allowing players to win additional items. Players can also find various items in the Idolospheres, either by finding hidden treasure chests or defeating enemies in battle. The [[Wii U GamePad]] displays an in-game social app known as Topic where players can receive messages from other characters, keep updated on available Unity fusions, and view a map of each area.<ref name=\"GIpreview\"/><ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/>\n\n===Unity system===\nBy utilizing a place called the Bloom Palace, players can perform two kinds of Unity ritual to strengthen their party: Carnage Unity and Radiant Unity. Carnage Unity uses Performa, which are obtained in battle by defeating monsters and performing crowd-pleasing techniques, to create new weapons for each character. Each weapon carries four skills which a party member can inherit by earning experience in battle. These include Command Skills, which allow the party member to perform various attacks and spells, Passive Skills, which offer passive stat boosts and effects, and Session Skills, which are used to chain together Session Attacks. Each character can only hold six skills of each type, but if they inherit a skill they already have, it is stacked on top and becomes more effective. Radiant Unity uses Performa that is born from within each party member, either through plot progression and clearing side stories, or by increasing a character's Star Ranking in a battle to grant them Radiant Skills. These are permanent skills separate from those inherited from weapons, and include passive effects such as increased health or extended Session Attacks as well as skills that can be performed in battle.<ref name=\"GIpreview\"/><ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/>\n\n===Battle system===\n[[File:Genei Ibunroku Gameplay.png|thumb|left|A battle from ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'', showing the battle arena, main characters, current enemies, and HUD display]]\nThe party's activities alternate between events in the real world and exploration through dungeons in the Idolospheres, each designed around a specific theme. Unlocked by progressing through the story, the party navigates through multiple floors, activating switches and devices to solve puzzles and advance while avoiding traps and encountering or avoiding enemies represented by sprites on the field. The dungeon map is displayed on the GamePad. Once cleared, dungeons can be replayed at any time.<ref name=\"FamRoundup\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/><ref name=\"NinManual\"/> Friendly NPC mirages also act as merchants within dungeons.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/> Battles are triggered when an enemy touches the party touched. The player can attack a Mirage on the field to stun it, allowing them to perform a pre-emptive attack or avoid battle.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/>\n\nThe game features a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system in which party members and enemy Mirages take turns to perform actions such as attacking, casting spells, and using items. The player's party consists of three main characters which, except main character Itsuki, can be swapped out both inside and outside of battle.<ref name=\"GIpreview\"/><ref name=\"NinManual\"/> Similar to both ''Fire Emblem'' and ''Shin Megami Tensei''{{'}}s battle systems, party members and enemies each have strengths and weaknesses against certain types of physical attacks, such as swords and arrows, and elemental attacks, such as fire and ice. The affinities of each party member change depending on the weapon they have equipped.<ref name=\"FamRoundup\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/>\n\nSession Attacks are [[Combo (video gaming)|combination]] attacks that can be triggered by targeting an enemy's weakness. If another party member possesses a Session Skill linking to the type of attack used, they will automatically perform a pursuit attack, which may then trigger another attack and so on. For example, if one party member attacks with an ice attack, another party member with an Ice-Elec skill will follow up with an electrical attack. Session Attacks may also be carried out by the enemy if they target a party member's weakness.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/> By building up a special meter through attacks, players can earn SP which can be used to trigger Performance attacks, which can be earned through Unity and by completing side-stories. These are called Duo Attacks which are performed by a partner's Mirage. Dual Attacks, on the other hand, can be triggered during a Session Attack to extend the combo at random times. Additionally, party members can learn Ad-lib Performances which may randomly activate while performing certain skills.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name= \"GemSkills\"/>\n\nAlong with items and money earned from battles, winning battles earn experience points which increase each party member's level and allows them to learn skills from their weapons. Performing well in battles, such as achieving quick victories or successful Session Attacks, increases party members' Stage Level, which unlock Performa for Radiant Skills and opens up new side stories. The game ends, sending the player back to the title screen, if all party members are knocked unconscious by running out of HP.<ref name=\"NinManual\"/><ref name=\"SilPreview\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, [[Japan]]. The story moves between multiple well-known city districts, such as [[Shibuya]] and [[Harajuku]].<ref name= \"E3Demo\"/> In the universe of ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'', everyone holds energy called Performa that enables them to pursue their dreams. Performa attracts beings called Mirages, who hail from an alternate dimension called the Idolasphere: while some Mirages harvest Performa for malicious motives, others form alliances with humans to protect the real world. Those who form alliances with friendly Mirages are referred to as Mirage Masters. The main casts are employees and associates of Fortuna Entertainment, a [[talent agency]] that secretly acts as a hub and recruiting organization for Mirage Masters.<ref name=\"FamRoundup\"/><ref name= \"SilStory\"/>\n\nThe main protagonist is Itsuki Aoi,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u84bc\u4e95\u6a39||Aoi Itsuki}}}} a young boy who by chance becomes involved with Fortuna Entertainment, and is initially uninterested in the business. The other human main characters are Tsubasa Oribe,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u7e54\u90e8\u3064\u3070\u3055||Oribe Tsubasa}}}} an optimistic and hard-working classmate of Itsuki who seeks to become a pop idol; Touma Akagi,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u8d64\u57ce\u6597\u99ac||Akagi Touma}}}} an impulsive friend of Itsuki and Tsubasa working to become an actor in a [[tokusatsu]] show; Kiria Kurono,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u9ed2\u4e43\u9727\u4e9c||Kurono Kiria}}}} a famous idol and veteran Mirage Master; Eleonora Yumizuru,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u5f13\u5f26 \u30a8\u30ec\u30aa\u30ce\u30fc\u30e9||Yumizuru Eleonora}}}} a successful half-[[Scandinavia]]n actress; Mamori Minamoto,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u6e90 \u307e\u3082\u308a||Minamoto Mamori}}}} a cooking show host with a taste for [[Sh\u014dwa period]] clothing and music; and Yashiro Tsurugi,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u5263\u5f25\u4ee3||Tsurugi Yashiro}}}} a superstar male idol who is initially hostile towards the party and their ambitions. The group are aided by Maiko Shimazaki,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u5fd7\u6469\u5d0e \u821e\u5b50||Shimazaki Maiko}}}} a former model who is the head of Fortuna Entertainment;{{efn|Maiko is a former [[Model (person)#Gravure idols|Gravure idol]] in the Japanese version.}} and Barry Goodman,{{efn|{{Nihongo|\u30d0\u30ea\u30a3\u30fb\u30b0\u30c3\u30c9\u30de\u30f3||Bar\u012b Guddoman}}}} a strict instructor from overseas with a love of otaku culture.<ref name= \"SilMain1\"/><ref name= \"SilMain2\"/><ref name= \"SilMain3\"/> The Mirages who ally with the cast are Chrom, Virion and Tharja from ''[[Fire Emblem Awakening]]'', and Caeda, Cain, Draug and Navarre from ''[[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light]]''.<ref name= \"SilMain2\"/><ref name= \"SilMirages\"/> A different Mirage is Tiki, who provides assistance to the Mirage Masters and is portrayed in the real world as a popular \"[[Utau|utaloid]]\".<ref name= \"SilMain1\"/>\n\n===Plot===\n''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' opens five years before the game's main events: at an opera attended by a young Tsubasa and Yashiro, everyone apart from Tsubasa vanishes without a trace. In the present, Itsuki encounters Tsubasa at the One of Millennium talent audition event, where she is hoping to begin her career as an idol. The compare is possessed by a hostile Mirage, and everyone in the building apart from Itsuki and Tsubasa is stripped of their Performa. Itsuki follows Tsubasa into the Idolasphere, and both are attacked by hostile Mirages. Awakening to their Performa, they use it to cleanse the Mirages: their attackers are revealed to be Chrom and Caeda, who ally with Itsuki and Tsubasa respectively. With help from Touma, who is the Mirage Master to Cain, the party free the pair from the hostile Mirage's control.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms1\"/> Leaving the Idolasphere, they encounter Maiko, who offers them positions alongside Touma in Fortuna Entertainment so they can both forward their entertainment careers and help fight Mirage attacks alongside Kiria and her Mirage Tharja. They are aided by Tiki, who is suffering from amnesia similar to the other allied Mirages.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms1\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms2\"/>\n\nFurther attacks follow at multiple locations throughout Tokyo, each focusing on leading entertainment and media figureheads being possessed by hostile Mirages: these Mirages are revealed to be servants of a greater power.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms2\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms3\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms4\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms5\"/> During one mission, the group rescue producer Yatsufusa Hatanaka, who later keeps a close watch on them.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms4\"/> They also gather new allies in the form of Elenora and her partner Virion; and Mamori and her partner Draug, who was the former partner of and initially possessed Barry.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms4\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms5\"/> On many missions, Yashiro and his partner Navarre watches and sometimes acts as an antagonistic force, before Itsuki's leadership and strength persuade him that he can help him avenge his father, who was the lead singer in the opera five years before.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms5\"/> The group find an item called a Dragonstone, which restores some of Tiki's memories. She reveals that she and the other friendly Mirages unsuccessfully attempted to stop the dark mage Gharnef summoning the Shadow Dragon Medeus into their native realm with a ceremony called the Opera of Shadows. Tiki was banished into the Idolasphere, which acted as an intermediate dimension between the real world and her world, and she was instrumental in preventing Gharnef from performing the Opera of Shadows a second time to enter the real world as his native realm had become drained of artistic energy. His attempt sparked the mass disappearance of five years before, and Tiki shielded both Tsubasa and Yashiro at the cost of her memories.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms6\"/>\n\nAfter this, the Cosmic Egg Stadium is consumed by an Idolasphere portal. Heading to the Cosmic Egg, the party are stopped by Hatanaka, who reveals himself to be the willing Mirage Master of Gharnef: the two are planning to perform the Opera of Shadows, summoning Medeus to consume the real world's Performa.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms6\"/> The group recover Dragonstones from the conquered Idolosphere realms and restore Tiki's memory: she reveals that they must find the pieces of the Fire Emblem and perform the Opera of Light to summon the power of the Divine Dragon Naga, the only force capable of stopping Medeus. Collecting the Fire Emblem pieces, they learn the story of the Hero-King [[Marth (Fire Emblem)|Marth]], a warrior from ancient times who bested and sealed away Gharnef and Medeus. The group encounter and defeats Hatanaka and Gharnef, but their sacrifice coupled with the offering of Marth's soul completes the Opera of Shadows and summons Medeus. Traveling to the final Idolasphere realm, Itsuki is fatally injured by Medeus, but the Fire Emblem gems free Marth's soul, which saves Itsuki and allows the group to perform the Opera of Light and defeat Medeus. The Mirages, with their memories, restored and Medeus was gone forever, return with Tiki to their native realm.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms6\"/><ref name=\"QUOTEtms7\"/>\n\nAlongside the main narrative are side stories involving various members of Fortuna Entertainment, which Itsuki can help as he learns from working in various sectors of the agency's business. These quests' storylines include Tsubasa working to create her idol persona;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms8\"/> Touma's wish to become an inspirational actor;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms9\"/> Kiria's discomfort with her softer side, which clashes with her professional identity;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms10\"/> Eleanora's attempts to polish her abilities as an actress in preparation for a hoped-for Hollywood career;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms11\"/> Mamori pushing to expand her professional range beyond her cooking host role;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms12\"/> Yashiro breaking out of his self-imposed personal and professional isolation, culminating in a battle with his father's spirit;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms13\"/> the often-tipsy Maiko's efforts to maintain Fortuna's public and private functions;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms14\"/> Barry's antics and his growing insecurity after losing his Mirage Master abilities;<ref name=\"QUOTEtms15\"/> and Tiki wanting the chance to experience the real world.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms16\"/> If all the side stories are completed, a post-credits scene is unlocked where Maiko returns to modelling, and Itsuki is unanimously instated as the new manager of Fortuna Entertainment.<ref name=\"QUOTEtms17\"/>\n\n==Development==\n''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' was the brainchild of Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who voiced her wish to make a ''Fire Emblem'' crossover to fellow producer Hitoshi Yamagami in 2010. Ando's initial vision was for a collaboration between the ''Fire Emblem'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series, but this was rejected as a similar collaboration was being developed in the form of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Conquest]]''. Ando redrafted her proposal and submitted it a week later as a crossover between ''Fire Emblem'' and ''Shin Megami Tensei''.<ref name=\"GeneiPoki\"/> [[Atlus]], the developer of the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' series, had previously worked with Nintendo on a game titled ''Itsumo Purikura \u2606 Kuradeko Premium'' for the [[Nintendo DSi]] and [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]]. When the project was originally pitched to Atlus in 2010, it was assumed that they were not interested after their unenthusiastic response and later said they were too busy to undertake the collaboration. Over a year later, Atlus inquired as to whether the subject was still open for discussion, and it transpired that they had been highly enthusiastic while still being too busy with other projects. Shinjiro Takada, who was also working on ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2]]'', was appointed as a producer. While he had viewed ''Fire Emblem'' as a rival and quality goal for his work, he was honored to be given the chance to develop a title related to ''Fire Emblem''.<ref name= \"KotakuBeginnings\"/><ref name= \"OriginBlog\"/> The game's directors were Mitsuru Hirata, who was supporting director on ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey]]'', and Eiji Ishida, who worked on both ''Strange Journey'' and ''[[Shin Megami Tensei IV]]''. Hirata was originally the project's sole director, but seven months after the game's public announcement, Ishida was brought on to co-direct so the amount of work needed for the title could be managed. According to Ishida, it was the company's first original game for [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth-generation consoles]].<ref name= \"SilDirector1\"/><ref name= \"SilDirector2\"/> Full development began in 2013.<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/> From conception to release, production on ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' lasted five years.<ref name= \"OriginBlog\"/>\n\nDuring the early production, what type of game it would become crucial to whether Atlus or ''Fire Emblem'' developer [[Intelligent Systems]] would develop it. One of the problems that needed to be overcome was the form of the initial proposal, which was for a simulation game similar to ''Fire Emblem'' developed by Atlus. Atlus, who was better known for making traditional role-playing games, was unsure which series to emulate. The decision was eventually made to create something along the lines of a traditional RPG, so Atlus took on primary development. Their first concept turned out to be a grid-based strategy game with strategic positioning elements similar to ''Fire Emblem'', but they were eventually convinced by Yamagami and staff from [[Intelligent Systems]] to keep within their skill set rather than attempting anything radically different. The final product was visualized as a game only Atlus could make, incorporating elements from both series while standing as an original title that could be enjoyed by fans of both ''Shin Megami Tensei'' and ''Fire Emblem''.<ref name=\"GeneiPoki\"/><ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/><ref name= \"SilProducer\"/> The game's platform was chosen based on the recent successful ''Fire Emblem'' entries for the 3DS: as ''Fire Emblem'' had appeared on the 3DS, ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' was to be a different \"expression\" designed for the [[Wii U]].<ref name=\"GSpost\"/> During these early stages, proposals were also made for a 3DS version, but this never materialized.<ref name=\"GeneiPoki\"/> Despite its ultimate form, some of the conceptual ideas were taken from early plans for ''Fire Emblem Awakening'' to take place in a modern-day setting.<ref name=\"FEbookInfo\"/> The inclusion of a sharp symbol in the title, which represents a semitone increase in the pitch of a note in [[musical notation]], denoted the game's status as a unique hybrid of the two series. The inclination of the logo was also designed to represent the game's altered perspective on the ''Fire Emblem'' series.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> The game's cutscenes were created by Studio Anima and [[Studio 4\u00b0C]].<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/><ref name= \"FamInterview\"/>\n\n===Scenario and design===\n[[File:Shibuya 109 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE''{{'}}s setting makes use of contemporary locations in Tokyo, such as the [[109 (department store)|Shibuya 109 department store]], which was used as the thematic inspiration for a dungeon.<ref name= \"E3Demo\"/><ref name= \"FamInterview\"/>]]\nThe scenario was written by Yoh Haduki and Makoto Miyauchi. Haduki was in charge of the main narrative, while Miyauchi handled the side stories for the main cast. During the early scenario development, it was thought that the main characters would be reincarnations of ''Fire Emblem'' characters, but this was dismissed as it would link it too strongly to the ''Fire Emblem'' series. When going through how to help incorporate ''Fire Emblem'' characters within the \"Atlus mythos\", they decided to use a concept from [[Shamanism#Japan|Japanese Shamanism]] called the \"kami oroshi\", which stands for a deity possessing and communicating through a priest or ritual dancer. A further extension of this was the incorporation of the [[Kagura|kagura ritual dance]], which in turn led to the inclusion of the entertainment theme.<ref name= \"WritersBlog\"/> Inspiration was also from traditional [[Noh]] theater.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> The character of Itsuki Aoi, who is not directly associated with any branch of Japanese media and entertainment, was created to introduce the setting and characters from an outsider's point of view.<ref name= \"WritersBlog\"/> Itsuki was also a rarity among Atlus protagonists in that he took an active role in conversations with other characters rather than being a silent protagonist.<ref name=\"NinDreamShibuya\"/>\n\nThe side stories were created so the player could better understand and empathize with the struggles of entertainers in the industry and their private lives.<ref name= \"WritersBlog\"/> Part of the team's struggle was balancing the main story and side missions and making both appealing to players. During an earlier stage, there was no divide between these two mission types, which ended up clashing with major story events and prompting players to ignore the side stories. To counter this, \"Intermission\" periods were created where side story chapters could be accessed. In the end, the side stories became a large part of the game's thematic base, causing Yamagami to consider them something more.<ref name=\"NinDreamShibuya\"/> The general infusion of [[Japanese idol#Culture|Japanese pop idol culture]] and the [[performing arts]] into the title was Atlus's take on traditions within Japanese Shamanism where the dancing of priestesses brought them closer to the gods they worshiped: in the game, it is through their performances that the main characters draw the attention of the Mirages and summon them into the real world.<ref name= \"GSinterview\"/> Also working on the scenario was Aoi Akashiro, a writer whose resume included anime and video games.<ref name=\"TMSwriter\"/>\n\nAesthetically, the game used ''Fire Emblem'' elements as motifs, but took its setting and premise of a clash between worlds from ''Shin Megami Tensei''. The battle system was originally going to be similar to a ''Fire Emblem'' game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system.<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/> After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together.<ref name= \"SilProducer\"/> Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark scenarios of the ''Megami Tensei'' series.<ref name=\"GSpost\"/> The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating ''Fire Emblem'' characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping into a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing ''Fire Emblem'' characters as human party members. In the end, it was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of ''Shin Megami Tensei'', drawn into the real world from their Idolosphere dimension.<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/><ref name= \"GSinterview\"/>\n\nTo make real-world locations as realistic as possible, the team went on multiple scouting trips, taking photographs of locations like the [[109 (department store)|Shibuya 109 department store]]. They originally wanted to mimic the chosen areas of Tokyo very closely, but they needed to consider how this might make travel times between locations overly long for players: this was done by incrementally reducing the scale of environments while keeping the scenery and aesthetic intact. According to Hirata, the process of designing Shibuya alone took between one and two years.<ref name=\"NinDreamShibuya\"/> Battles were designed around the concept of a stage, with an audience made up of Mirages raised into excitement by the party's performance. In-battle rewards of money were designed to be \"ohineri\" (paper-wrapped offerings) rewarded to the party for their performance. An early version of the battle transition screen was an \"assistant director\" using a [[clapperboard]], then offering in-battle commentary. These elements were completely cut from the game. Other elements that were cut included a high amount of camera movement during battles and [[booing]] from the audience when the party made mistakes.<ref name=\"NinDreamShibuya\"/>\n\nThe game's art director was Fumitaka Yano of Atlus.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> The main aesthetic chosen for the game revolved around bright colors, a noted shift from the majority of Atlus's previous games.<ref name= \"SummeryBlog\"/> The bright colors were designed to emulate the focus on the entertainment industry, with various shades and effects portraying a colorful world. In contrast, the dungeons were designed around fantasy motifs and meant to embody the Mirages having been robbed of \"expression\". The game's dungeons were based around real-world locations within Tokyo, and had gimmicks inspired by a chosen location: for instance, one dungeon inspired by Shibuya 109 was themed around fashion.<ref name= \"E3Demo\"/><ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> The main characters were designed by [[toi8]],{{efn|Pronounced \"toi-Hachi\"}} a Japanese artist noted for his work on ''[[.hack//The Movie]]''. When he was approached, he was finishing work on the cover of a light novel and wondering what he would be doing next. While his previous work used a low [[Colorfulness|color saturation]], for ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'' he used high color saturation suited to its setting.<ref name= \"SilArtist\"/> According to Takada, the team asked toi8 to design the world in this way to create \"a feeling of both friendliness and splendor\".<ref name= \"SilProducer\"/> The Mirage characters were designed by Hideo Minaba of Japanese design company CyDesignation, and were based on characters from ''Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light'' and ''Awakening''. They were designed to contrast with toi8's character designs with the deliberate exception of Tiki, having a machine-like appearance.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> This was due to the long battle the characters had been facing: their armor reflected the dark events they had faced, and parts of themselves unneeded for survival have degenerated.<ref name= \"DirectorsBlog\"/> Minaba had been a fan of the ''Fire Emblem'' series and encountered difficulties designing the characters. His main aim was to remain true to the original characters while emulating the sharp and dark character style of Atlus games.<ref name= \"MinabaBlog\"/>\n\n===Audio===\n====Music====\nFrom an early stage, Atlus wanted to have [[Avex Group]] cooperating on musical numbers. The planned style, which would have vocal themes performed like music videos or sample trailers, needed a level of professionalism the team felt only Avex could provide.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> The in-game music was composed by Yoshiaki Fujisawa, who was famous for his work on the Japanese multimedia project ''[[Love Live!]]''. Fujisawa was contacted in late 2013 by George Aburai, an in-house composer who also worked with multiple well-known entertainers at Avex Group. Fujisawa found the composition difficult as he was more used to composing for television series rather than video games. To help him, Atlus's sound team gave him advice about aspects such as the timing, feel, and emotive elements of tracks. Ultimately, he found the working environment fun and was pleased when he first saw a test video featuring one of his songs. As a central story theme was the entertainment industry, the soundtrack was filled with vocal tunes and \"[[Groove (music)|groovy]]\" tracks.<ref name= \"MusicInterview\"/><ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/> The game features stage performances involving the main characters, which were produced and choreographed by Aburai for Avex Group.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/><ref name= \"AburaiBlog1\"/> The performances made use of full-motion capture, and the 3D animation for the choreographed performances was handled by Studio Anima.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/>\n\nAburai formed a group from various areas of Avex Group to work on production. After forming his team, Aburai worked to analyze the personalities and traits of the main cast to determine how their performances would play out, in addition to other factors such as their professions' impact on their portrayal.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/> The only vocal theme composed by Fujisawa was \"Fire Emblem ~Drama of Light~\", which used an arranged version of the ''Fire Emblem'' theme composed by [[Yuka Tsujiyoko]]. The remaining vocal themes each handled by different composers, many either working with or with previous ties to Avex Group.<ref name=\"OSTliners\"/> A prominent theme was \"Reincarnation\", which was the first song to be created and gave Aburai the most trouble as it would set the standard of the game's music.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> Two notable songs not performed by the main cast were \"Distance between you and me\" by the fictional idol group Emotional Key, performed by Karin Nanami, Yumi Wakatsuki and Mina Nakazawa; and the in-game anime theme \"Dia Sweet Witch\" performed by former ''[[Idoling!!!]]'' singer Mayu Sekiya.<ref name=\"SongBlog\"/><ref name=\"AvexAlbumA\"/>\n\nA commercial CD release featuring all the game's vocal themes, ''Genei Ibunroku \u266fFE Vocal Collection'', was released February 10, 2016 by Avex Group's music label [[Avex Trax]].<ref name=\"AvexAlbumA\"/> The CD included eighteen songs, all full versions mainly not heard in the game itself.<ref name=\"SongBlog\"/> A full soundtrack album, ''Genei Ibunroku \u266fFE Encore Best Sound Collection'', was released by Avex Trax on January 17, 2020. The 3-CD album included all the original vocal themes, official versions of the in-game music, and new music and the song \"She Is...\" from ''Encore''.<ref name=\"AvexAlbumB\"/>\n\n====Casting====\nDue to the performing aspect of the game, the team were faced with the difficulty of finding voice actors and actresses who could both act and sing.<ref name= \"E3Demo\"/> Voice actor [[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]] was given the role of Itsuki, which he played so Itsuki would lack a strong personality as he was essentially the player's avatar.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog1\"/> Itsuki's only two songs were \"Fire Emblem ~Drama of Light~\" and \"Smile Smile\", which both focused on strong bonds with the other cast members.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> Actress and singer [[Inori Minase]] voiced Tsubasa; Minase played Tsubasa as the opposite of her normal persona, and encountered difficulties portraying her as \"normal\".<ref name=\"VoiceBlog2\"/> Touma was voiced by actor [[Y\u016bki Ono]], who called the role \"straight and refreshing\". Ono also sang Touma's theme \"Jump! \u014cga!\".<ref name=\"VoiceBlog3\"/> Kiria's actress [[Yoshino Nanj\u014d]] strove to portray her character in a \"cool\" way without her coming off as cold, reflecting the character's inner softness. Nanj\u014d found recording the songs strenuous as she was unused to character-based singles.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog4\"/> Nanj\u014d's performance of Kiria's song \"Reincarnation\" needed to be redone around ten times until it fitted properly with the character's personality.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/> [[Ayane Sakura]] voices Eleanora, who despite being nervous made an effort to portray the character in a bullish yet clumsy way, pushing to balance her forward manner with making her appealing for players.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog5\"/>\n\n[[Kaori Fukuhara]], the actress for Mamori, portrayed her role so the character would sound childlike without being overly childish in her manner and tone.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog6\"/> Yashiro's voice actor [[Yoshimasa Hosoya]] found singing for the role difficult as he lacked a natural sense of rhythm.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog7\"/> Yashiro's main song was made deliberately complex, as the character singing it on stage would emphasise his skills.<ref name=\"SongInterview\"/> Tiki's voice actress [[Sumire Morohoshi]] found the role difficult due to Tiki's role as an explanatory figure, together with the dramatic elements of her amnesia and wish to experience the real world.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog10\"/> Tiki's first song \"Beastie Game\" drew from multiple musical genres to reflect her status as a Vocaloid.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/> When recording \"Beastie Game\", Morohoshi was surprised upon hearing her voice processed to sound like a vocaloid. For her second song, \"Not A Phantom World\", Morohoshi had to record multiple chorus elements which were then layered as backing for the main song, encountering difficulties making all her harmonies work together properly.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog10\"/> [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]] portrayed Barry as the group's mood maker,<ref name=\"VoiceBlog8\"/> while Maiko's actress [[Ami Koshimizu]] worked to make her character both aloof and charming.<ref name=\"VoiceBlog9\"/> During voice and song recording, Aburai actively talked with the cast about their vocal nuances and interpretations of each song.<ref name= \"AburaiBlog2\"/>\n\n==Release and promotion==\n[[File:Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem logo.png|thumb|left|The game was announced under the title ''Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem'']]\nThe game was announced in January 2013 as part of a [[List of Nintendo Direct presentations|Nintendo Direct]] presentation under the English working title ''Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem'', announced as one of many planned collaboration projects with third-party developers for the Wii U. The trailer featured artwork of characters from the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' and ''Fire Emblem'' series, and concluded with the message \"Development in Progress\".<ref name= \"GemAnnounce\"/> There was much initial speculation by journalists as to the game's genre due to the trailer's vague nature.<ref name= \"KotakuSpeculation\"/><ref name= \"DesSpeculation\"/> Atlus confirmed the following day that the game was an RPG, and that it would be developed by Atlus and produced by Nintendo.<ref name= \"GemConfirmation\"/><ref name=\"SilAnnouncement\"/> At the time of its announcement, many parts of the game had yet to be developed and finalized, as it had only been two months since the beginning of development.<ref name= \"VentureInterview\"/>\n\nThe lack of reports after the initial announcement raised concerns that the game had been cancelled. During an interview at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014]] concerning ''[[Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.]]'' and whether its development was affecting ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE'', Yamagami confirmed that the game was still in development and on schedule.<ref name= \"SilYamagami\"/> In April 2015, a gameplay trailer was released during a Nintendo Direct broadcast, which also confirmed the game's Japanese title and release window.<ref name= \"GemReveal\"/> The Japanese title, ''Genei Ibunroku \u266fFE'', translates to \"''Illusory Revelations \u266fFE''\".<ref name=\"TMSjptitle\"/> First-print runs of the Japanese release included codes for special costumes inspired by other Atlus games. In addition, Atlus produced a \"Fortissimo Edition\", containing a special box, an original artbook, a six-track CD release including \"Reincarnation\", and [[downloadable content]] (DLC) outfits for the playable characters. A Wii U bundle was also created, featuring similar content in addition to special stickers and special lyric cards.<ref name= \"GeneiJPrelease\"/> Between its original reveal and the retail release, Kiria's stage costume for her number \"Reincarnation\" was altered to be less revealing.<ref name= \"KiriaChange\"/> DLC was created for the title as both promotional material and post-release content, which included downloadable scenarios including a \"[[Onsen|Hot Spring]]\" scenario.<ref name= \"SilDLC\"/>\n\nAn English version was announced at E3 2015, with the release date being revealed in a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation in March 2016.<ref name= \"GemRelease\"/><ref name=\"ReleaseWest\"/> It was released in North America and Europe on June 24, 2016, and in Australia the following day.<ref name=\"ReleaseWest\"/><ref name=\"ReleaseAus\"/> A limited edition similar to Japan's \"Fortissimo Edition\" was made available as an online exclusive through [[Amazon.com]] and [[GameStop]]: it is titled the \"Special Edition\" in North America and \"Fortissimo Edition\" in Europe.<ref name=\"WestSpecial\"/> Aside from the Hot Springs scenario and its associated [[Swimsuit|swimwear outfits]], all Japanese DLC was released in the West for the game's launch.<ref name=\"TMSdlcWest\"/>\n\n===Localization===\nDue to the game's Japanese setting and focus, in addition to people preferring overseas songs in their original languages, the Western version of the game features Japanese audio with subtitles rather than an English dub. Finding English actors to perform the game's songs would also have lengthened the estimated localization time by a whole year.<ref name=\"ReleaseWest\"/><ref name=\"GSpost\"/> Its localization was handled by Atlus staff rather than Nintendo's internal localization division Nintendo Treehouse. Atlus was chosen over Nintendo due to fan expectation of the type of localization common to an Atlus-published title, and the wish to make the game appeal to long-term fans of the company's work.<ref name=\"GSpost\"/><ref name=\"AtlusLocal\"/> This placed the game in contrast with the majority of other Nintendo titles localized for the West, where Nintendo's attitude was described as \"very hands-on\".<ref name=\"GSpost\"/>\n\nSome aspects of the game were changed for its Western release:<ref name=\"GSpost\"/> these changes included the removal or alteration of several revealing costumes, the removal of visual and dialogue references to [[Model (person)#Gravure idols|Gravure modelling]], and changes to the ages of certain characters. Multiple sections of dialogue were re-recorded to match these changes.<ref name=\"ShackChanges\"/> The game's Hot Springs scenario and associated costumes also went unreleased.<ref name=\"TMSdlcWest\"/><ref name=\"ShackChanges\"/> The removed outfits were replaced with Western-exclusive outfits.<ref name=\"TMSoutfits\"/> Changes to content were attributed to Nintendo's varying content requirements and regulations for the regions the game was released in.<ref name=\"AtlusLocal\"/> Staff later defended these changes as necessary adjustments based on the regions they would be releasing the game in, while working on keeping the core identity intact.<ref name=\"GSpost\"/> After the game's Western release, staff were divided on the issue: Yamagami was positive about the game's adaption for a Western audience, while Hirata was initially disappointed with the alterations before seeing positive responses to the game from Western fans.<ref name=\"GSpost\"/><ref name=\"LocalComment\"/> Following the game's Western release, a fan-developed patch was released that reverted all the localization changes, ranging from cosmetic alteration to script changes.<ref name=\"TMSpatch\"/>\n\n===''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE Encore''===\nAn expanded port of the game for the [[Nintendo Switch]], titled ''Tokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE Encore'', was released on January 17, 2020. The port includes new story content and additional party members along with new music.<ref name=\"GeneiEncoreA\"/><ref name=\"GeneiEncoreB\"/> Some new content was also incorporated from more recent ''Fire Emblem'' and Atlus titles such as unlockable costumes based on ''[[Persona 5]]'' and ''[[Fire Emblem: Three Houses]]''.<ref>http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/joker_costume_spotted_on_the_back_of_tokyo_mirage_sessions_fe_encore_box_art</ref> Content that was previously DLC was now incorporated into the base game. As Nintendo were aiming for a simultaneous worldwide release, they decided to use the Western version\u2014including its localization changes\u2014as their base. Nintendo later issued a formal apology and offered pre-order cancellation options to Japanese buyers for failing to provide information regarding the changes ahead of time.<ref

gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' found the story's premise entertaining and interesting, and praised the side stories' focus on the supporting cast.<ref name=\"FamReview\"/> Chris Carter of

mess\", but positively compared side stories to the Social Link systems from the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> David Roberts\u2014writing for [[GamesRadar]]\u2014noted the story's lighthearted tone compared to other Atlus projects despite its dark opening premise,<ref name=\"GRrerview\"/> and Meghan Sullivan of [[IGN]] found the characters bland and the narrative poor compared to other aspects of the game.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> [[Nintendo Life]]'s Conor McMahon noted the story's blatant use of its contemporary setting and entertainment theme, praised the side stories and praised the way the personalities of ''Fire Emblem'' characters were preserved.<ref name=\"NLreview\"/> Daan Koopman of Nintendo World Report enjoyed the narrative due to its brisk pace and highlights of the Japanese entertainment industry,<ref name=\"NWRreview\"/> while [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s Janine Hawkins positively compared the story to [[magical girl]] anime, calling it \"a co-ed version of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' for the ''Love Live!'' age\".<ref name=\"PolyReview\"/> Multiple reviewers noted a lack of ''Fire Emblem'' references, with several expressing disappointment with this imbalance.<ref name=\"DesReview\"/><ref name=\"EuroReview\"/><ref name=\"FamReview\"/><ref name=\"GIreview\"/><ref name=\"GRevReview\"/><ref name=\"NLreview\"/> \n\n''Famitsu'' praised the aesthetics and user interface design,<ref name=\"FamReview\"/> while Cartar enjoyed the art design despite clear technical limitations.<ref name=\"DesReview\"/> Khaw praised the animated cutscenes,<ref name=\"EuroReview\"/> and Wallace praised the character and monster designs despite finding the graphics dated and environments lacking detail.<ref name=\"GIreview\"/> McMahon positively referred to

progression,<ref name=\"DesReview\"/> Wallace praised the controls and combat, finding satisfying depth in its systems despite a need to grind for experience points.<ref name=\"GIreview\"/> Khaw enjoyed the mechanics and style of the combat system, and praised the game for its relaxed pace.<ref name=\"EuroReview\"/> Kozanitis praised the blending of elements from both series, praising the combo mechanics and character growth systems.<ref name=\"GRevReview\"/> Corriea found the overall experience entertaining and engaging, but found boss fights brought down the experience due to becoming endurance tests rather than requiring any strategy.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> Despite criticizing the limit on skills, Roberts enjoyed the complexity and strategy of combat, praising it for removing the more tedious elements of its parent series.<ref name=\"GRrerview\"/> Sullivan praised the combat, calling the Session attacks its best feature and enjoying the overall spectacle and customization systems.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> McMahon praised the game's unique systems along with its blend of series elements, but found the GamePad difficult to use.<ref name=\"NLreview\"/>

name=\"NWRreview\"/> Hawkins also enjoyed the Session attacks, and praised the combat system and growth systems.<ref name=\"PolyReview\"/> Several reviewers found dungeon progression difficult due to

Teaching and scholarship in the school take place across campuses in [[Leiden]] and [[The Hague]] in the Netherlands.\n\nInstruction in [[law]] began with the university's founding in 1575. Alongside the disciplines of [[theology]] and [[medicine]], it was considered a 'higher' faculty of great importance. It also established itself as the most international faculty due, originally, to the proportion of academics arriving from Germany in the mid-17th century. The law school has played a substantial role in wider Dutch society from its earliest years, being consulted in an official capacity on all manner of subjects from wills to piracy and privateering.\n\nThe school's present form has its roots in the 1980s when a reformation of the division of legal disciplines took place. Sacrifices were made in the 'meta-legal' disciplines, e.g. jurisprudence and sociology of law, to focus on 'positive law', particularly civil and international law which are considered traditional fields of strength of the law school. The faculty completed its move into the refurbished {{ill|Kamerlingh Onnes Building|nl|Kamerlingh Onnes Gebouw}} in Leiden in 2004 where it is housed to this day.<ref name=\"Bergvelt Jansen Klooster Simons p. 43\">{{cite book | last=Bergvelt | first=D. | last2=Jansen | first2=C. | last3=van 't Klooster | first3=I. | last4=Simons | first4=C. | title=Architectuur Lokaal #72 Bouwen op Ambitie | publisher=Architectuur Lokaal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bC4lOLnHWLYC&pg=PA43 | language=nl | access-date=June 17, 2018 | page=43}}</ref>\n\nAnnually, the school has an intake of approximately 900 [[Bachelor's degree]] students and 1000 [[Master's degree|Master's]] and Advanced Master's degree students. Around 425 staff are employed in academic and administrative roles with approximately 325 in a teaching role. Approximately 18% of the academic staff are from outwith the Netherlands. The majority of school activity takes place in Leiden, the minority based in The Hague is chiefly within the Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/rechtsgeleerdheid/faculteitsbestuur-en--bureau/mc/jaarbericht-rechten-2016-engels_universiteit-leiden-def.pdf |title=Leiden Law School Annual Report 2016 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Leiden University |access-date=June 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Medieval and early modern faculty (1575\u20131799) ===\n\nThe medieval curriculum was based, whether one was studying law, medicine or theology, around [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought. The doctrine of the 'golden mean', in which virtue is the mean between two extreme vices, was central to legal studies. The [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] strands of Aristotelian thought were particularly influential in law, primarily his emphasis on common sense and the parallel between the 'natural equilibrium' of the physical body and {{lang|la|[[aequitas]]}}, the Roman conception of justice manifested in the blindfolded goddess holding a set of scales.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=12}}\n\nThe 16th century Leiden academic year contained 160 to 170 days for lectures with other time taken up by holidays, fairs and book auctions. There were no lectures on Wednesdays or Saturdays which were occupied by private classes, disputations and demonstrations by lecturers hoping to secure a post at the university. Generally, law was taught in the [[didactic]] tradition, professors were expected to profess from memory, not dictate, and students were expected to take notes. The conservative nature of teaching in the early law school is exemplified in the traditional nature of the faculty's treatment of [[Justinian I|Justinian's]] [[Institutes of Justinian|''Institutions'']]. As well as theoretical work law students would partake in disputations which involved practical application of law in situations such as contracts or wills.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=68\u201372}}\n\nIt was during the late 16th and early 17th century that the faculty housed one of its most influential scholars, [[Hugo Grotius]] (or Hugo de Groot). In 1594, at age eleven Grotius was a student in the faculty and soon proved himself prodigious in liberal arts, sciences and law. Grotius went on to establish his own legal practice in The Hague and in 1607 was made Attorney General of Holland. His first great work: ''[[Mare Liberum]]'' (or the Freedom of the Seas), was published in 1609 and lay the foundation for the sea as [[Freedom of the seas|international territory]]. The second of his magna opera: ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (On the Law of War and Peace), was published in 1625 and is also considered a foundational work of international law. It is remarkable for its explicit affirmation of the fact that the validity of the laws on war was not contingent on the existence of God, a departure for a scholar of [[natural law]] following [[Francisco de Vitoria|de Vitoria]] and [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez|Su\u00e1rez]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Miller |first=Jon |title=Hugo Grotius |date=2014 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/grotius/ |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Spring 2014 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=June 16, 2018 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/grotius/#H1 |title=Grotius, Hugo  {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 25 years from its foundation in 1575 to 1599, the law school had an average of 27 new students registered per year. The enrollment steadily increased, from 1625\u20131649 average initial registrations were 116 which decreased slightly to 106 by 1675\u20131699. The 18th century saw a decline in the enrollment overall from 93 from 1700\u20131724 to 47 from 1750\u20131774. Comparing the first two centuries of the faculty's existence in terms of doctorate degrees awarded (which was the only type of degree awarded at that time), the proportion of law students being awarded the degree increased from 8% to 84% perhaps being explained by the purpose of study at Leiden shifting toward preparation for a specific profession rather than socialisation with a view toward taking a place in the Dutch or wider European cultural elite.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=80\u201385}} Toward the end of the 18th century the university had built its reputation to be considered, according to [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' published in 1765, as \"the leading university in Europe\"{{efn|'L'acad\u00e9mie de Leyde est la premi\u00e8re de l'Europe. Il semble que tous les hommes c\u00e9lebres dans la r\u00e9publique de lettres, s'y font rendus pour la faire fleurir, depuis son \u00e9tablissement jusqu'\u00e0 nos jours.'}} with the teaching of law of a high standard.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=104}}{{sfn |Diderot |Alembert |Mouchon |1765 |p=451}}\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nTurning to the early 19th century, the advent of the scientific method gave rise to a predominantly 'hybrid' method of teaching and research. This hybrid was characterised by a mixture of the new methods of science and the old Christian-derived ideas of harmony and reality as God-given. The first half of the century saw great scholars at Leiden in the burgeoning fields of natural history, physics and medicine. This was less so in law, with the exception of [[Joan Melchior Kemper]] who taught in the [[natural law]] tradition relying on [[philology]]. In terms of enrolment, law remained the largest faculty at Leiden; from 1775\u20131812, 1,270 students enrolled in law, the next largest being medicine at 953.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=150\u2013152}}\n\nThe 1815 Education Act made it compulsory for all students intending to study law to take a 'general foundation' course in humanities, the act also added the choice of a bachelor's degree to the existing doctorate. By 1876 the foundation course established in the Education Act was abolished for prospective law students. The bachelor's degree required courses on jurisprudence, Roman law and principles of the political economy. The doctorate required courses on Dutch civil law and civil procedure, commercial law, criminal law and procedure and Dutch constitutional law. From 1815\u20131845, 7% of law students were awarded doctorates while from 1876\u20131905 this increased to 75%. This was due to the lowering of academic demands in law; while medical students had to produce dissertation representing years of research, law students merely had to write a few pages of propositions or a compilation. This discrepancy led to the doctors of law being ridiculed as 'donkeys' by those more rigorously tested in the university.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=160\u2013163}}\n\nBy the mid-19th century, certain scholars were starting to question the importance of analogy and the status quo, choosing instead to idealise development and progress. In the law faculty, the [[liberalism|liberal]] professor and future reviser of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]], [[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]] personified this attitudinal shift. Following in Thorbecke's constitutionalist footsteps at Leiden were, notably, {{ill|Johannes Theodoor Buys|nl}}, {{ill|Jo\u00ebl Emanuel Goudsmit|nl}} and {{ill|Simon Vissering|nl}}. Later in the 1870s opposition reformed against positivism around new treatments of classical notions, such as justice, through academics including [[Hendrik Lodewijk Drucker]], {{ill|Willem van der Vlugt|nl}} and [[Tobias Asser]].{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=155}} Other notable faculty members of this period were Anthony Modderman and  Henri van der Hoeven, the law school of the late 19th century had a considerable range of great scholars. During this time the law faculty dominated the university in terms of student numbers and it was not until after the 1876 Education Act that medical numbers increased steeply and overtook law.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=159}}\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nMoving into the 20th century, there was a division in the academic study of law between those pursuing a scientific, descriptive, positivist version of law and those seeking a normative and prescriptive version. Following the [[First World War]], the faculty had maintained its strength in scholarship, names such as [[Cornelis van Vollenhoven]] in the field of [[Adat]] law in the [[Dutch East Indies]], Hugo Krabbe with his contribution to the idea of pluralistic sovereignty, [[Eduard Meijers]] in legal history, and Willem Jan Mari van Eysinga in international law. It was after 1925 that student numbers sharply increased across the entire university (doubling from 1925\u20131960) with law only steadily increasing to around 1,000 in 1960.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=159}}\n\nIn the wake of the [[Battle of the Netherlands|German invasion and occupation of May 1940]] the law faculty continued to teach and research for several months. This started to change on October 23 when a declaration requiring the dismissal of 'non-Aryan' staff was made. A planned senate meeting on the subject, prompted by Professor of International Law, Benjamin Marius Telders, was prevented by the Germans. However, smaller groups of Leiden faculty members met subsequently and lodged individual objections to the policy. On November 23, two 'non-Aryan' law professors were dismissed including Eduard Meijers, later father of the [[Burgerlijk Wetboek]] (Dutch Civil Code). On November 26, [[Rudolph Cleveringa|Professor Rudolph Cleveringa]], the dean of the law school and former graduate student of Professor Meijers, gave a speech of dissent in which he read out the Meijers' letter of dismissal 'in all its stark grossness'. Cleveringa did not note the ideological underpinnings of the dismissal choosing instead to speak of the greatness of his mentor with the intention of preventing any reckless actions by his students. On November 27, the university was closed by the occupying Germans. Professor Telders was arrested and expelled to a concentration camp, he would die in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] in April 1945. Professor Meijers was also sent to a concentration camp but survived the war. Professor Cleveringa was imprisoned at [[Scheveningen]] and later joined the Dutch resistance, also surviving the war. Further dismissals ensued during the war and the faculty, as part of the university, was refashioned to be more sympathetic to the Germans. Notably, Professor [[Roelof Kranenburg]] was arrested in March 1942 because his book on administrative law ignored imperatives of the occupying government.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=122\u2013125}}\n\nIn the post-war period, the faculty recovered from its wartime occupation with names such as Meijers and Cleveringa returning. [[Julius Christiaan van Oven]], Frederik Mari van Asbeck,  Jan Volkert Rijpperda Wierdsma, Jan Drion and Robert Feenstra consolidated the faculty's reputation, each held in high regard in their own fields.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=160}} Turning to the legal curriculum, the image of law students as 'donkeys' resulting from their light academic requirements led to change in the Education Act of 1960 in which different specialisms were defined within law. The new 'master's degree' could be taken in Dutch law, notarial law or constitutional law. The university commissioned the building or conversion of many buildings with Leiden itself and recently in The Hague. The Gravensteen building was converted into a legal study area in 1955 and the Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies found a home in the former laboratories in the Vreewijk area of Leiden.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=163\u2013171}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\n[[File:Kamerlingh Onnes Gebouw Leiden.jpg|thumb|Kamerlingh Onnes Building, the Law School's home since 2004]]\nIn 1927, van Vollenhoven conceived the idea of extending the university campus around the Rapenburg Canal, this involved the purchase as well as the conversion of old buildings. As a result of this policy, the old Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory, named after physicist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], was restyled into a new home for the law school; the move was completed in 2004.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=239}} A reorganisation of the faculty, which began in the 1980s, realigned the faculty's focus to major fields such as civil, corporate, notarial, criminal, European and international law; these areas remain Leiden's traditional areas of scholarly strength. The Cleveringa Institute was established in 2001 to maintain the integrity of teaching and intellectual rigour in courses. The faculty's research was moved to the E.M. Meijers Institute in 1997 and emphasised interdisciplinary scholarship as opposed to the classification of research by department. In response to growing internationalisation in the university research sector the law school jointly established the Strategic Alliance of Research Faculties of Law in 2003 with faculties at [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], [[KU Leuven|Leuven]], [[Faculty of Law, University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg]].{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=252\u2013257}}\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe faculty has five institutes; each institute is split into departments:<ref name=\"Organisation\" />\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n* Institute of Private Law\n** Department of Civil Law\n** Department of Civil Procedure Law\n** Department of Private International Law\n** Department of Child Law\n** Department of Notarial Law\n** Department of Company Law\n** Department of Financial Law\n** Department of Intellectual Property Law\n** Institute of Anglo-American Law\n* Institute of Public Law\n** Europa Institute\n** Institute of Immigration Law\n** Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies\n** International Institute of Air and Space Law\n** Department of Labour Law and Social Security\n** Department of Constitutional and Administrative Law\n\n{{col-break}}\n* Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology\n** Department of Criminal Law and Procedure\n** Department of Criminology\n* Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of the Law\n** Center for Law and Digital Technologies\n** Department of Jurisprudence\n** Department of Legal History\n** Moot Court and Advocacy\n** Department of the Philosophy of Law\n** Van Vollenhoven Institute for Law, Governance and Society\n* Institute of Tax Law and Economics\n** Department of Economics\n** Department of Tax Law\n** Department of Business Studies\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Academic profile ==\n\n{{Infobox European university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 51\u201375 <small>(2018)</small> | ARWU_W_ref =<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/law.html |title=ShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2017 \u2013 Law {{!}} Shanghai Ranking \u2013 2017|website=www.shanghairanking.com|access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>\n| THE_W = 27 <small>(2019)</small> | THE_W_ref =<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2019/subject-ranking/law#!/page/1/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/scores|title=World University Rankings 2019 by subject: law|date=2018-10-08|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}</ref>\n| QS_W = 26 <small>(2019)</small> | QS_W_ref =<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/leiden-university |title=Leiden University |date=July 16, 2015 |work=Top Universities |access-date=February 28, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe law school is ranked within the top 75 law faculties in the world across the three major global rankings by subject (''Academic Ranking of World Universities'', ''Times Higher Education'' and ''Quacquarelli Symonds'').

The faculty completed its move into the refurbished {{ill|Kamerlingh Onnes Building|nl|Kamerlingh Onnes Gebouw}} in Leiden in 2004 where it is housed to this day.<ref name=\"Bergvelt Jansen Klooster Simons p. 43\">{{cite book | last=Bergvelt | first=D. | last2=Jansen | first2=C. | last3=van 't Klooster | first3=I. | last4=Simons | first4=C. | title=Architectuur Lokaal #72 Bouwen op Ambitie | publisher=Architectuur Lokaal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bC4lOLnHWLYC&pg=PA43 | language=nl | access-date=June 17, 2018 | page=43}}</ref>\n\nAnnually, the school has an intake of approximately 900 [[Bachelor's degree]] students and 1000 [[Master's degree|Master's]] and Advanced Master's degree students. Around 425 staff are employed in academic and administrative roles with approximately 325 in a teaching role. Approximately 18% of the academic staff are from outwith the Netherlands. The majority of school activity takes place in Leiden, the minority based in The Hague is chiefly within the Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/rechtsgeleerdheid/faculteitsbestuur-en--bureau/mc/jaarbericht-rechten-2016-engels_universiteit-leiden-def.pdf |title=Leiden Law School Annual Report 2016 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Leiden University |access-date=June 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Medieval and early modern faculty (1575\u20131799) ===\n\nThe medieval curriculum was based, whether one was studying law, medicine or theology, around [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought. The doctrine of the 'golden mean', in which virtue is the mean between two extreme vices, was central to legal studies. The [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] strands of Aristotelian thought were particularly influential in law, primarily his emphasis on common sense and the parallel between the 'natural equilibrium' of the physical body and {{lang|la|[[aequitas]]}}, the Roman conception of justice manifested in the blindfolded goddess holding a set of scales.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=12}}\n\nThe 16th century Leiden academic year contained 160 to 170 days for lectures with other time taken up by holidays, fairs and book auctions. There were no lectures on Wednesdays or Saturdays which were occupied by private classes, disputations and demonstrations by lecturers hoping to secure a post at the university. Generally, law was taught in the [[didactic]] tradition, professors were expected to profess from memory, not dictate, and students were expected to take notes. The conservative nature of teaching in the early law school is exemplified in the traditional nature of the faculty's treatment of [[Justinian I|Justinian's]] [[Institutes of Justinian|''Institutions'']]. As well as theoretical work law students would partake in disputations which involved practical application of law in situations such as contracts or wills.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=68\u201372}}\n\nIt was during the late 16th and early 17th century that the faculty housed one of its most influential scholars, [[Hugo Grotius]] (or Hugo de Groot). In 1594, at age eleven Grotius was a student in the faculty and soon proved himself prodigious in liberal arts, sciences and law. Grotius went on to establish his own legal practice in The Hague and in 1607 was made Attorney General of Holland. His first great work: ''[[Mare Liberum]]'' (or the Freedom of the Seas), was published in 1609 and lay the foundation for the sea as [[Freedom of the seas|international territory]]. The second of his magna opera: ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (On the Law of War and Peace), was published in 1625 and is also considered a foundational work of international law. It is remarkable for its explicit affirmation of the fact that the validity of the laws on war was not contingent on the existence of God, a departure for a scholar of [[natural law]] following [[Francisco de Vitoria|de Vitoria]] and [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez|Su\u00e1rez]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Miller |first=Jon |title=Hugo Grotius |date=2014 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/grotius/ |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Spring 2014 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=June 16, 2018 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/grotius/#H1 |title=Grotius, Hugo  {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 25 years from its foundation in 1575 to 1599, the law school had an average of 27 new students registered per year. The enrollment steadily increased, from 1625\u20131649 average initial registrations were 116 which decreased slightly to 106 by 1675\u20131699. The 18th century saw a decline in the enrollment overall from 93 from 1700\u20131724 to 47 from 1750\u20131774. Comparing the first two centuries of the faculty's existence in terms of doctorate degrees awarded (which was the only type of degree awarded at that time), the proportion of law students being awarded the degree increased from 8% to 84% perhaps being explained by the purpose of study at Leiden shifting toward preparation for a specific profession rather than socialisation with a view toward taking a place in the Dutch or wider European cultural elite.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=80\u201385}} Toward the end of the 18th century the university had built its reputation to be considered, according to [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' published in 1765, as \"the leading university in Europe\"{{efn|'L'acad\u00e9mie de Leyde est la premi\u00e8re de l'Europe. Il semble que tous les hommes c\u00e9lebres dans la r\u00e9publique de lettres, s'y font rendus pour la faire fleurir, depuis son \u00e9tablissement jusqu'\u00e0 nos jours.'}} with the teaching of law of a high standard.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=104}}{{sfn |Diderot |Alembert |Mouchon |1765 |p=451}}\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nTurning to the early 19th century, the advent of the scientific method gave rise to a predominantly 'hybrid' method of teaching and research. This hybrid was characterised by a mixture of the new methods of science and the old Christian-derived ideas of harmony and reality as God-given. The first half of the century saw great scholars at Leiden in the burgeoning fields of natural history, physics and medicine. This was less so in law, with the exception of [[Joan Melchior Kemper]] who taught in the [[natural law]] tradition relying on [[philology]]. In terms of enrolment, law remained the largest faculty at Leiden; from 1775\u20131812, 1,270 students enrolled in law, the next largest being medicine at 953.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=150\u2013152}}\n\nThe 1815 Education Act made it compulsory for all students intending to study law to take a 'general foundation' course in humanities, the act also added the choice of a bachelor's degree to the existing doctorate. By 1876 the foundation course established in the Education Act was abolished for prospective law students. The bachelor's degree required courses on jurisprudence, Roman law and principles of the political economy. The doctorate required courses on Dutch civil law and civil procedure, commercial law, criminal law and procedure and Dutch constitutional law. From 1815\u20131845, 7% of law students were awarded doctorates while from 1876\u20131905 this increased to 75%. This was due to the lowering of academic demands in law; while medical students had to produce dissertation representing years of research, law students merely had to write a few pages of propositions or a compilation. This discrepancy led to the doctors of law being ridiculed as 'donkeys' by those more rigorously tested in the university.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=160\u2013163}}\n\nBy the mid-19th century, certain scholars were starting to question the importance of analogy and the status quo, choosing instead to idealise development and progress. In the law faculty, the [[liberalism|liberal]] professor and future reviser of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]], [[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]] personified this attitudinal shift. Following in Thorbecke's constitutionalist footsteps at Leiden were, notably, {{ill|Johannes Theodoor Buys|nl}}, {{ill|Jo\u00ebl Emanuel Goudsmit|nl}} and {{ill|Simon Vissering|nl}}. Later in the 1870s opposition reformed against positivism around new treatments of classical notions, such as justice, through academics including [[Hendrik Lodewijk Drucker]], {{ill|Willem van der Vlugt|nl}} and [[Tobias Asser]].{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=155}} Other notable faculty members of this period were Anthony Modderman and  Henri van der Hoeven, the law school of the late 19th century had a considerable range of great scholars. During this time the law faculty dominated the university in terms of student numbers and it was not until after the 1876 Education Act that medical numbers increased steeply and overtook law.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=159}}\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nMoving into the 20th century, there was a division in the academic study of law between those pursuing a scientific, descriptive, positivist version of law and those seeking a normative and prescriptive version. Following the [[First World War]], the faculty had maintained its strength in scholarship, names such as [[Cornelis van Vollenhoven]] in the field of [[Adat]] law in the [[Dutch East Indies]], Hugo Krabbe with his contribution to the idea of pluralistic sovereignty, [[Eduard Meijers]] in legal history, and Willem Jan Mari van Eysinga in international law. It was after 1925 that student numbers sharply increased across the entire university (doubling from 1925\u20131960) with law only steadily increasing to around 1,000 in 1960.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=159}}\n\nIn the wake of the [[Battle of the Netherlands|German invasion and occupation of May 1940]] the law faculty continued to teach and research for several months. This started to change on October 23 when a declaration requiring the dismissal of 'non-Aryan' staff was made. A planned senate meeting on the subject, prompted by Professor of International Law, Benjamin Marius Telders, was prevented by the Germans. However, smaller groups of Leiden faculty members met subsequently and lodged individual objections to the policy. On November 23, two 'non-Aryan' law professors were dismissed including Eduard Meijers, later father of the [[Burgerlijk Wetboek]] (Dutch Civil Code). On November 26, [[Rudolph Cleveringa| Professor Rudolph Cleveringa]], the dean of the law school and former graduate student of Professor Meijers, gave a speech of dissent in which he read out the Meijers' letter of dismissal 'in all its stark grossness'. Cleveringa did not note the ideological underpinnings of the dismissal choosing instead to speak of the greatness of his mentor with the intention of preventing any reckless actions by his students. On November 27, the university was closed by the occupying Germans. Professor Telders was arrested and expelled to a concentration camp, he would die in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] in April 1945. Professor Meijers was also sent to a concentration camp but survived the war. Professor Cleveringa was imprisoned at [[Scheveningen]] and later joined the Dutch resistance, also surviving the war. Further dismissals ensued during the war and the faculty, as part of the university, was refashioned to be more sympathetic to the Germans. Notably, Professor [[Roelof Kranenburg]] was arrested in March 1942 because his book on administrative law ignored imperatives of the occupying government.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=122\u2013125}}\n\nIn the post-war period, the faculty recovered from its wartime occupation with names such as Meijers and Cleveringa returning. [[Julius Christiaan van Oven]], Frederik Mari van Asbeck,  Jan Volkert Rijpperda Wierdsma, Jan Drion and Robert Feenstra consolidated the faculty's reputation, each held in high regard in their own fields.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=160}} Turning to the legal curriculum, the image of law students as 'donkeys' resulting from their light academic requirements led to change in the Education Act of 1960 in which different specialisms were defined within law. The new 'master's degree' could be taken in Dutch law, notarial law or constitutional law. The university commissioned the building or conversion of many buildings with Leiden itself and recently in The Hague. The Gravensteen building was converted into a legal study area in 1955 and the Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies found a home in the former laboratories in the Vreewijk area of Leiden.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=163\u2013171}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\n[[File:Kamerlingh Onnes Gebouw Leiden.jpg|thumb|Kamerlingh Onnes Building, the Law School's home since 2004]]\nIn 1927, van Vollenhoven conceived the idea of extending the university campus around the Rapenburg Canal, this involved the purchase as well as the conversion of old buildings. As a result of this policy, the old Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory, named after physicist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], was restyled into a new home for the law school; the move was completed in 2004.{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |p=239}} A reorganisation of the faculty, which began in the 1980s, realigned the faculty's focus to major fields such as civil, corporate, notarial, criminal, European and international law; these areas remain Leiden's traditional areas of scholarly strength. The Cleveringa Institute was established in 2001 to maintain the integrity of teaching and intellectual rigour in courses. The faculty's research was moved to the E.M. Meijers Institute in 1997 and emphasised interdisciplinary scholarship as opposed to the classification of research by department. In response to growing internationalisation in the university research sector the law school jointly established the Strategic Alliance of Research Faculties of Law in 2003 with faculties at [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], [[KU Leuven|Leuven]], [[Faculty of Law, University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg]].{{sfn |Otterspeer |2008 |pp=252\u2013257}}\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe faculty has five institutes; each institute is split into departments:<ref name=\"Organisation\" />\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n* Institute of Private Law\n** Department of Civil Law\n** Department of Civil Procedure Law\n** Department of Private International Law\n** Department of Child Law\n** Department of Notarial Law\n** Department of Company Law\n** Department of Financial Law\n** Department of Intellectual Property Law\n** Institute of Anglo-American Law\n\n* Institute of Public Law\n** Europa Institute\n** Institute of Immigration Law\n** Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies\n** International Institute of Air and Space Law\n** Department of Labour Law and Social Security\n** Department of Constitutional and Administrative Law\n\n{{col-break}}\n* Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology\n** Department of Criminal Law and Procedure\n** Department of Criminology\n\n* Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of the Law\n** Center for Law and Digital Technologies\n** Department of Jurisprudence\n** Department of Legal History\n** Moot Court and Advocacy\n** Department of the Philosophy of Law\n** Van Vollenhoven Institute for Law, Governance and Society\n\n* Institute of Tax Law and Economics\n** Department of Economics\n** Department of Tax Law\n** Department of Business Studies\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Academic profile ==\n\n{{Infobox European university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 51\u201375 <small>(2018)</small> | ARWU_W_ref =<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/law.html |title=ShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2017 \u2013 Law {{!}} Shanghai Ranking \u2013 2017|website=www.shanghairanking.com|access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>\n| THE_W = 27 <small>(2019)</small> | THE_W_ref =<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2019/subject-ranking/law#!/page/1/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/scores|title=World University Rankings 2019 by subject: law|date=2018-10-08|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}</ref>\n| QS_W = 26 <small>(2019)</small> | QS_W_ref =<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/leiden-university |title=Leiden University |date=July 16, 2015 |work=Top Universities |access-date=February 28, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe law school is ranked within the top 75 law faculties in the world across the three major global rankings by subject (''Academic Ranking of World Universities'', ''Times Higher Education'' and ''Quacquarelli Symonds'').

This process consisted of [[human trafficking|trafficking in people]] of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|African]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] origin, first by the [[Spanish colonization of America|European colonizers]] from Spain and later by the commercial elites of the [[Republic of New Granada]], the country that contained what is today Colombia.\n\n== Indigenous slavery ==\n[[File:Jean_baptiste_debret_-_ca\u00e7ador_escravos.jpg|right|thumb|300x300px| Indigenous peoples were subjected to forced labor and other abuses by the Spanish conquerors.]]\nThe enslavement of indigenous peoples in what is now Colombia began with the colonization of the country by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in the early 16th century, and with the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in 1830. With the advance of the [[Conquistador|Conquistadors]] the defeated indigenous peoples were subjected to slavery as prisoners of war, as was the Spanish custom.{{Sfn|Miguel Angel|2012}} [[Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez  de Quesada]], for example, distributed some eighteen thousand conquered prisoners among its captains and soldiers.{{sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=128}} This process would continue without any state intervention or legal justification until  the expedition of the llamas [[Laws of Burgos]] by the Spanish crown, which eliminated the slavery of the indigenous peoples in 1512 \"[[de jure]]\". The legal status of the conquered American population would be improved again  by the calls [[New Laws]] of 1542, which would establish new protections for these people.\n\nThese protections, however, this should not be construed as an abolition ''[[de facto]] '' of slavery by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]]s. Among the European colonizers of the time an aphorism arose, \"the law is obeyed, but it is not followed\", in reference to the contempt of the laws issued in Europe.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|2019}} The slavery of the native peoples would continue on the margin  of the law, with the conquered being frequently subjected to the same treatment by the Spanish.\n\nBeyond the informal practice of slavery, forced labor would continue even within the framework of the law, with institutions known as the [[Mit'a|mita]] and the [[encomienda]].  The new laws as well as the Burgos laws still contemplated forced labor and, although this was not formally the very institution of slavery, materially it was not far from the slave trade.  The mita established labor quotas that the native population had to fulfill as a [[tribute]] according to the assignment made by the corregidor, while the encomienda was a form of [[clientelism]] in which the indigenous people were forced to pay  an encomendero the services supposedly provided by the same.  The main service that the encomendero had to render as contemplated by colonial legislation was evangelization, but even in this there was negligence;  For example, around the 16th century, there was only one encomendero de tapia church in all [[Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1]]. {{sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=132}} Meanwhile, in Tunja, the encomenderos not only neglected  their duty to educate but actively sabotaged it, strongly opposing indigenous people learning to read and write. {{sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=132}}\n\nThe application of [[New Laws]] of 1542 was suspended and with it his intention to leave the private encomenderos without power.  Towards October 1545 the Malina Law [[repeal]] ia this intention to weaken the encomenderos, again allowing the viceroys and governors to establish new encomiendas. {{Sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=33|Navarrete|2005}} This reached a new dimension with the colonization of the [[New World]], since the subjugated native population was insufficient for the exploitation of natural resources and their number was reduced day by day.  day, either because of the spread of disease or death from abuse by Europeans.  Thus the massive trafficking of African slaves to the provinces that would be the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] would begin only after the indigenous population was decimated, beginning in the second half of the 16th century. {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=34-35}} This trafficking occurred through the so-called '' licenses '', a kind of contract with the state in which the crown authorized the slave trade to the colonies in exchange for  a tax contribution. {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=36}}\n\nThe slave trade was morally justified under the idea that the slave received the \"invaluable\" evangelizing work of his master, and that the Christian principle of equality referred to equality in the hereafter and the superiority of the white man in the  present. {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=34-35}} This did not prevent slaves from being transported in subhuman conditions;  the journey from Africa to America lasted about two months and was carried out on disease-ridden ships, with poor or no ventilation, and overcrowded. {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=66}}\n\n== African slavery ==\n[[File: Barconegrero.jpg|thumb|African slaves were overcrowded during their transportation across the Atlantic.]]\nThe Iberian slave trade in Africa began with the Portuguese, who transported prisoners to the [[Madeira Islands]] and the [[Azores]].

Thus, the various researchers who approach the question of the origins of [[Afro-Colombians|Afro-Colombian]] slaves often have no choice but to group their origin into larger regions, often divided into three.  Luz Adriana Maya identifies these as: Sudano-Sahelian, the tropical forest and the equatorial rain forest; {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=98}} John Thornton identifies the three regions as: Upper Guinea, Lower Guinea and the  Angola region.  These regions do not comprise a single town and include great diversity among them.\n\nThe western [[Sahel]] region is home to ethnic groups such as the [[fulani]], [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|mande]] and [[songhai people|songhai]].  The region was home to the largest empires in sub-Saharan Africa, the [[Empire of Ghana]], [[Empire of Mali]] and [[Songhai Empire]];  The latter two would become a direct part of the slave trade and collapse during it.  The two later empires would be Muslim, which would influence not only their dominant ethnic groups but other peoples who would arrive in chains at the ports of [[Cartagena de Indias]] such as the [[balanta people|balanta]], [[  bijag\u00f3s]], [[diola]], [[nalu]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and [[sosso]]. {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=100-101}}\n\nIn the [[Gulf of Guinea]] region, peoples can be divided into two macro-groups, the [[Kwe people|Kwe peoples]] and the speakers of [[Volta-Niger languages]].  This region was dominated by smaller states like the [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti Kingdom]] as well as the city states of [[Ife]] and [[Kingdom of Benin| Benin]].  It is the origin of peoples such as the [[yoruba people|yoruba]], [[igbo people|igbo]] and [[asante people|asante]]. {{Sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=103}} This region represents the origin of several Afro-Caribbean religions still practiced in Colombia  such as [[Santeria]], which has its origin in the [[Yoruba religion]].\n\nIn the southernmost region between the [[Congo river]] delta and present-day Angola, the great majority of the peoples were of [[bantu peoples|bantu]] origin, mainly from speakers of the [[kikongo]] and [[  kimbundu]]. {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=104-105}} The region included states such as the small [[Lunda Empire]] and the great [[Kingdom of Kongo]], whose king [[Afonso I of Kongo|Afonso I]] unsuccessfully attempted to stop the slave trade from his domain by sending correspondence to [[John III of Portugal]] speaking of the \"corruption and depravity\" of European slavers who depopulated their country.  He also sent emissaries to deal with the pope, but these were intersected by the Portuguese upon landing in [[Lisbon]]. {{Sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=33-34}}\n\n=== On the Caribbean coast ===\n[[File:Boazio-Sir_Francis_Drake_in_Cartagena.jpg|thumb| [[Cartagena de Indias]] was the main port of entry for slaves during the colony.]]\n[[Cartagena de Indias]] was the main port of entry of slaves into the country during the colonial period and during its highest boom it turned out to be the most lucrative business in the city.  By 1620 the city had 6000 inhabitants, of whom 1400 were slaves of African origin, by 1686 the number of slaves had increased to 2000. {{sfn|Meisel Roca|1980|p=242}} In the census carried out between 1778  and 1780 it was determined that the slave population represented 10% of the population in [[Santa Marta Province]] and 8% of [[Cartagena Province]]. {{sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=54}}\n\nThe use of slave labor turned out to be essential for the economy of Cartagena Province, both in urban and rural areas.  With the death of the vast majority of the native population, the work of the Africans became highly relevant.  Although during the seventeenth century slave labor was used in both agriculture and livestock, eventually it became concentrated around only the latter since agriculture is seasonal and therefore less profitable for the slave owner who wanted to minimize the hours in which the slave  did not work. {{sfn|Meisel Roca|1980|p=243}}\n\nInside the cities, slavery gained a function not only of production but of status, all the houses of prosperous Spaniards in Cartagena and [[Momp\u00f3s]] were endowed with black servitude, which served as a sign of opulence. {{Sfn|Meisel  Roca|1980|p=243}} These slaves were traded during the 17th century for a value between 200 and 400 silver pesos each. {{Sfn|Meisel Roca|1980|p=248}}\n\nThe system of production with slave labor required a constant influx of new slaves, since the population of African origin had negative growth rates in the new world.  This was due to various factors such as the number of men exceeding that of women by a factor of 5 to 1 because they were considered more productive, as well as the high death rate among workers.  This required the constant influx of new \"bozales\" slaves (born in Africa). {{Sfn|Meisel Roca|1980|p=251}}\n\nSlavery in the Cartagena province began to decline in the eighteenth century.  During the republican era the institution entered into a true decline, mainly in rural areas where the current system of production ceased to be replaced by cheap mestizo labor.  In urban areas slavery managed to maintain its relevance because it was more linked to the exhibition of status than to modes of production, so it continued to be a relevant system until its abolition in the 19th century. {{Sfn|Meisel  Roca|1980|p=243}}\n\n=== On the Pacific coast ===\nThe first attempts at mining using slaves of African origin in the [[Pacific Region (Colombia)| Pacific coast of New Granada]] occurred during the 17th century.  However, these attempts were very limited and mostly unsuccessful due to the great difficulties that the Spanish had in subjugating the native populations.  Large mining operations, and with them the massive trafficking of African slaves to the west coast, would not begin until the last two decades of the 17th century. {{Sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=17}}\n\nThe vast majority of the African slaves that would eventually reach the Pacific entered through the port of [[Cartagena de Indias]];  in the Pacific they were marketed for a value of about 300 silver pesos if they were muzzles (born in Africa), and between 400 and 500 if they were creoles (born in America). {{sfn|de Friedemann|1974|p=96}} From analysis of documents of the time, it seems that more than half of the slaves who arrived in [[Choc\u00f3]] were of [[Kwa languages|Kwa]] origin, mainly from the [[Akan people|Akan]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]], there were also important minorities of [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mand\u00e9]], [[Gur languages|Gur speakers]] and [[Kru people|Kru]]. {{sfn|Granda Guti\u00e9rrez|1988|p=73-74}}\n\nThe Pacific coast was the colonial area with the highest percentage of slave population in New Granada territory.  In the 1778-1780 census it was found that in Choc\u00f3 slaves constituted 39% of the population;  in [[Iscuand\u00e9]] 38%;  in [[Tumaco]] 63%;  and in {{ill|Territory of Raposo|lt=Raposo|es|Territorio de Raposo}}, an extraordinary 70%.{{sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=55}}\n\nThese slaves destined for mining production were a vital component in the Pacific Region.  Between 1680 and 1700 [[Popay\u00e1n]] was the source of 41% of the gold production in New Granada. {{Sfn|de Friedemann|1974|p=98}}\n\n== Rebellions ==\n[[File:Benkos_Bioho.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px| Statue of [[Benkos Bioh\u00f3]], maroon rebel leader.]]\nThe first to oppose the imposition of forced labor by Europeans were indigenous peoples.  During the 16th century there were rebellions of the [[Paez people|paeces]], [[muzos]], and [[Yarigui people|Yariguis]]. {{Sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=132}} Los [[chinato]  ] s the town of San Crist\u00f3bal rebelled, while the {{ill|Tupe people|lt=Tupes|es|Tupe}} did the same in [[Santa Marta]].  However, the [[pijaos]] were the most successful in this regard, managing to stop work in the mines of [[Cartago, Valle del Cauca| Cartago]] and [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]], successfully interrupting communication with [[  Popay\u00e1n]] and Peru, and killing the Governor of Popay\u00e1n Vasco de Quiroga.  The war waged during the first decade of the 17th century would end with a victory for the Europeans, who would be rewarded for their service in the form of encomiendas. {{Sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=139}}\n\nAfrican slaves frequently rebelled against their masters, either through the practice [[Maroon Black| Maroon]] and their flight, or through armed rebellion.  In Santa Marta in 1530, just five years after the city was built, a slave rebellion destroyed the town.  The city would be rebuilt only to suffer a new rebellion in the 1950s. {{Sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=38}}\n\nAlthough it was certainly possible for an individual slave to flee their masters and go unnoticed among the free black population of a large city, it was a precarious situation in which the fugitive was at constant risk of discovery;  therefore it is natural that many acts of flight were organized and directed towards communities of [[Black Maroon| Maroon Slaves]] in which they could find security with those of their own class. {{sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=57}}\n\nNot all rebellion activities ended in flight, in several cases the threat of revolt was used as a method within [[collective bargaining]].  In 1768 in the province of Santa Marta a group of slaves wounded a foreman whom they accused of ill-treatment, when their master sent a couple of white men to subdue them, the blacks killed one of the whites.  Far from being intimidated, the rebels gave their master an ultimatum, if he did not agree to their demands they would burn down the entire estate and escape to live with the \"brave Indians.\"  Without further remedy, the master accepted their demands, swearing to forgive them for the revolt, stopping the mistreatment and agreeing that if the slaves were ever sold this should be done collectively so as not to divide the families.  The owner also agreed to provide the workers with a good quantity of tobacco and brandy as compensation for the abuses. {{Sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=63}} Similar incidents occurred in [[Neiva]] in 1773 and [[  C\u00facuta]] in 1780, in which the slaves had reached a sort of agreement with the [[Company of Jesus| Jesuit priests]] in which their treatment was more similar to that of free peasants in a [[sharecropping]],  in which they were remunerated for their crops and granted holidays.  When a new master refused to uphold what the slaves considered their [[customary rights]], they did not hesitate to go into open rebellion and demand that the colonial government authorities recognize their rights. {{Sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=73-75}}\n\nOn the other hand, it is important to recognize that the resistance strategies of the black women enslaved during the colonial period were aimed at confronting the discourse of colonial power by resorting to judicial demands. <ref name=\"EUI\"> {{cite book|url=https://www.icesi.edu.co/editorial/demando-mi-liberty|title=Demando mi libertad|publisher=[[Universidad Icesi]]|year=2018|isbn=978-958-8936-36-9|editor-last1=Vergara Figueroa|editor-first1=Aurora|edition=1st|series=El sur es cielo roto |volume=16 |location=Cali, Colombia|language=espa\u00f1ol|trans-title=I demand my freedom|doi=10.18046/EUI/Escr.16.2018|oclc=1121270926|ol=OL26778189M|editor-last2=Cosme Puntiel|editor-first2=Carmen Luz}} </ref>\n\nHowever, the most famous slave rebellion in New Granada was undoubtedly that of the slaves of [[San Basilio de Palenque]], led by [[Benkos Bioh\u00f3]], the rebellion was so successful that on August 23,  1691 the king of Spain was forced to issue a certificate ordering the general freedom of the palenques and their right to land. {{Sfn|Navarrete|2008}}\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, the colonial authorities tried again to start a great campaign against the Maroon palenques, but despite succeeding in destroying some villages, the entire company turned out to be a failure, since the blacks managed to preserve their freedom and simply moved south.  {{sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=57}}\n\nCimarronaje would continue until the 19th century with the abolition of slavery, after which the former slaves would exercise new forms of resistance seeking to retaliate from their former masters. Blacks roamed the fields, tearing down fences, raiding property, and punishing conservatives with their whips;This period was named by the President [[Jos\u00e9 Hilario L\u00f3pez]] as \u00abthe democratic frolics\u00bb. {{sfn|Valencia Llano|1998}}\n\n== Abolition ==\n[[File:Josehilariolopez1.png|thumb| President [[Jos\u00e9 Hilario L\u00f3pez]], who spearheaded the abolition of slavery.]]\nThe process of [[manumission]] of slaves occurred to some extent throughout the history of the colony, but the question of abolishing slavery as an institution did not begin to take relevance until the [[Napoleonic Spain| Napoleonic invasion of Spain]]  ;  context in which in Iberian courts since 1809 the need to abolish slavery was raised in order to prevent \"slaves from seeking and even achieving it by violent and coercive means\".  [[Antonio Villavicencio]] was a proponent of [[freedom of wombs]], however his views were not heeded by the European crown. {{Sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}}\n\nDuring the [[Colombian Declaration of Independence|war of independence of Colombia]] it was [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] who introduced in 1816 the idea of \u200b\u200bgranting freedom to slaves who participated in the independence cause. {{Sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}} This was not  it means that the process was not without controversy, the landowners who depended on slaves both for work and to demonstrate status staunchly opposed the libertarian process.\n\nIn order to compromise the demands of the slavers who demanded that their \"property\" be respected, {{ill|Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix de Restrepo|es}} managed before the [[Congress of C\u00facuta]] to decree the freedom of bellies, which he declared as free  to the children of slaves born as of July 21, 1821. The law established for the masters the obligation to \u00abeducate, clothe and feed their children [...] but they in compensation must compensate the masters of  their mothers were prevented from spending on their upbringing, with their works and services, which they would lend to them up to the age of 18 years of age. \u201d{{sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}} The slave trade was definitively prohibited in 1825.\n\nAlthough the freedom of young slaves should have started on July 21, 1839, the process was largely delayed by the [[War of the Supremes]], which was fought from 1839 to 1842. After the war and under pressure  of the masters, a new law of May 29, 1842, extended the dependence on slaves for another 7 years through what was called apprenticeship.  In other words, the 18-year-old slaves would be presented to the mayors who should have them serve their former master or someone else who could \"educate and instruct\" him in a trade or profession.  In this way slavery was extended, while those who refused to participate were recruited into the [[Colombian National Army| national army]]. {{Sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}}\n\nThe inefficiency of the manumission, as well as the corruption of officials and landowners who continued with the slave trade ignoring the law caused great discontent among the so-called Democratic Societies (liberal associations of artisans).  This great political upheaval, coming from both the artisans and the slaves themselves, led the President [[Jos\u00e9 Hilario L\u00f3pez]] to propose absolute freedom.  Finally, the [[Colombian Congress]] dictated the law of May 21, 1851, by means of which the slaves would be free as of January 1, 1852 and the masters would be compensated with bonds.{{Sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}}\n\nEven so, in many places the masters refused to let the slaves go in a peaceful way, this led to the {{ill|Colombian Civil War of 1851|lt=Civil War of 1851|es|Guerra civil colombiana de 1851}}, which began when an insurrection began in [[Cauca Department| Cauca]] and [[Pasto, Colombia| Pasto]] headed by the [[Colombian Conservative Party| Conservative leaders]] Manuel Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and [[Julio Arboleda]] with the support of the government [[Ecuador|<nowiki> Ecuadorian]</nowiki>]] conservative trend.  In [[Antioquia State|Antioquia]] the rebellion broke out at the hands of conservatives led by {{ill|Eusebio Borrero|es}}.  The war would end in four months with the liberal victory and the final liberation of the slaves.{{Sfn|V\u00e9lez Ocampo|2005}}\n\nFrom all this it can be concluded that the abolition of slavery that occurred during the republic was a gradual process.  This can be verified when seeing how the percentage of the enslaved population was in constant decline throughout the republican period until the definitive abolition of the institution:{{sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}}\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |-\n !Years\n!Total population\n!Slaves\n!Proportion\n |-\n |1778\n| align=\"right\" |798 956\n| align=\"right\" |62 547\n|7.82%\n |-\n |1825\n| align=\"right\" |1 129 174\n| align=\"right\" |45 133\n|4.00%\n |-\n |1835\n| align=\"right\" |1 570 854\n| align=\"right\" |37 547\n|2.39%\n |-\n |1843\n| align=\"right\" |1 812 782\n| align=\"right\" |25 591\n|1.41%\n|-\n |1851\n| align=\"right\" |2 105 622\n| align=\"right\" |15 972\n|0.76%\n|}\n </center>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last1=Navarrete|first1=Mar\u00eda Cristina|title=Genesis and development of slavery in Colombia in the 16th and 17th centuries|date=2005|publisher=Universidad del Valle|isbn=9789586703383|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PH_cf27ucZAC&dq=esclavitud+en+colombia|access-date=20 March 2019|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Navarrete|first1=Mar\u00eda Cristina|title=San Basilio de Palenque: memory and tradition - Emergence and vicissitudes of maroon deeds in the Colombian Caribbean|date=2008|publisher=Universidad del Valle|isbn=978-9587654189|url=https://books.google.es/books?Id=SLNJDwAAQBAJ&dq=san+basilio+de+palenque+%221691%22&lr=&hl=es&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=March 20, 2019|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Ruiz Rivera|first1=Juli\u00e1n Bautista|last2=Navarro Garc\u00eda|first2=Luis|date=1975|title=Commendation and myth in New Granada in the 17th century|publisher=CSIC Press|isbn=8400041763|page=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5R0dPbOImsUC&dq=Mita+en+Colombia|accessdate=March 19, 2019|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite publication|last1=Meisel Roca|first1=Adolfo|title=Slavery, Miscegenation and Haciendas in the Province of Cartagena: 1533-1851|work=Revista Desarrollo y Sociedad|date=July 4, 1980|page=229\u2013277|doi=10.13043/dys.4.2|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite publication|last1=de Friedemann|first1=Nina S.|title=The black culture of the Ecuadorian and Colombian coast: a model of ethnic adaptation|work=Colombian Journal of Anthropology|date=1974|volume=18|page=75\u2013115|url=http://biblioteca.icanh.gov.co/DOCS/MARC/texto/REV-0915V17a-4.PDF|accessdate=March 22, 2019|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite publication|last1=Granda Guti\u00e9rrez|first1=Germ\u00e1n|title=The slaves of Choc\u00f3.

This process consisted of [[human trafficking|trafficking in people]] of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|African]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] origin, first by the [[Spanish colonization of America|European colonizers]] from Spain and later by the commercial elites of the [[Republic of New Granada]], the country that contained what is today Colombia.\n\n== Indigenous slavery ==\n[[File:Jean_baptiste_debret_-_ca\u00e7ador_escravos.jpg|right|thumb|300x300px| Indigenous peoples were subjected to forced labor and other abuses by the Spanish conquerors.]]\nThe enslavement of indigenous peoples in what is now Colombia began with the colonization of the country by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in the early 16th century, and with the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in 1830. With the advance of the [[Conquistador|Conquistadors]] the defeated indigenous peoples were subjected to slavery as prisoners of war, as was the Spanish custom.{{Sfn|Miguel Angel|2012}} [[Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez  de Quesada]], for example, distributed some eighteen thousand conquered prisoners among its captains and soldiers.{{sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=128}} This process would continue without any state intervention or legal justification until  the expedition of the llamas [[Laws of Burgos]] by the Spanish crown, which eliminated the slavery of the indigenous peoples in 1512 \"[[de jure]]\". The legal status of the conquered American population would be improved again  by the calls [[New Laws]] of 1542, which would establish new protections for these people.\n\nThese protections, however, this should not be construed as an abolition ''[[de facto]] '' of slavery by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]]s. Among the European colonizers of the time an aphorism arose, \"the law is obeyed, but it is not followed\", in reference to the contempt of the laws issued in Europe.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|2019}} The slavery of the native peoples would continue on the margin  of the law, with the conquered being frequently subjected to the same treatment by the Spanish.\n\nBeyond the informal practice of slavery, forced labor would continue even within the framework of the law, with institutions known as the [[Mit'a|mita]] and the [[encomienda]].  The new laws as well as the Burgos laws still contemplated forced labor and, although this was not formally the very institution of slavery, materially it was not far from the slave trade.  The mita established labor quotas that the native population had to fulfill as a [[tribute]] according to the assignment made by the corregidor, while the encomienda was a form of [[clientelism]] in which the indigenous people were forced to pay  an encomendero the services supposedly provided by the same.  The main service that the encomendero had to render as contemplated by colonial legislation was evangelization, but even in this there was negligence;  For example, around the 16th century, there was only one encomendero de tapia church in all [[Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1]]. {{sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=132}} Meanwhile, in Tunja, the encomenderos not only neglected  their duty to educate but actively sabotaged it, strongly opposing indigenous people learning to read and write. {{sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=132}}\n\nThe application of [[New Laws]] of 1542 was suspended and with it his intention to leave the private encomenderos without power.

Through the [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]], in 1479 the [[Kingdom of Castile]] recognized the Portuguese primacy in the African slave trade, which would make them the main providers of enslaved labor for centuries to come. {{sfn | Navarrete | 2005 | p = 33}} This reached a new dimension with the colonization of the [[New World]], since the subjugated native population was insufficient for the exploitation of natural resources and their number was reduced day by day.  day, either because of the spread of disease or death from abuse by Europeans.

Thus, the various researchers who approach the question of the origins of [[Afro-Colombians|Afro-Colombian]] slaves often have no choice but to group their origin into larger regions, often divided into three.  Luz Adriana Maya identifies these as: Sudano-Sahelian, the tropical forest and the equatorial rain forest; {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=98}} John Thornton identifies the three regions as: Upper Guinea, Lower Guinea and the  Angola region.  These regions do not comprise a single town and include great diversity among them.\n\nThe western [[Sahel]] region is home to ethnic groups such as the [[fulani]], [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|mande]] and [[songhai people|songhai]].  The region was home to the largest empires in sub-Saharan Africa, the [[Empire of Ghana]], [[Empire of Mali]] and [[Songhai Empire]];  The latter two would become a direct part of the slave trade and collapse during it.  The two later empires would be Muslim, which would influence not only their dominant ethnic groups but other peoples who would arrive in chains at the ports of [[Cartagena de Indias]] such as the [[balanta people|balanta]], [[  bijag\u00f3s]], [[diola]], [[nalu]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and [[sosso]]. {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=100-101}}\n\nIn the [[Gulf of Guinea]] region, peoples can be divided into two macro-groups, the [[Kwe people|Kwe peoples]] and the speakers of [[Volta-Niger languages]].  This region was dominated by smaller states like the [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti Kingdom]] as well as the city states of [[Ife]] and [[Kingdom of Benin| Benin]].  It is the origin of peoples such as the [[yoruba people|yoruba]], [[igbo people|igbo]] and [[asante people|asante]]. {{Sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=103}} This region represents the origin of several Afro-Caribbean religions still practiced in Colombia  such as [[Santeria]], which has its origin in the [[Yoruba religion]].\n\nIn the southernmost region between the [[Congo river]] delta and present-day Angola, the great majority of the peoples were of [[bantu peoples|bantu]] origin, mainly from speakers of the [[kikongo]] and [[  kimbundu]]. {{sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=104-105}} The region included states such as the small [[Lunda Empire]] and the great [[Kingdom of Kongo]], whose king [[Afonso I of Kongo|Afonso I]] unsuccessfully attempted to stop the slave trade from his domain by sending correspondence to [[John III of Portugal]] speaking of the \"corruption and depravity\" of European slavers who depopulated their country.  He also sent emissaries to deal with the pope, but these were intersected by the Portuguese upon landing in [[Lisbon]]. {{Sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=33-34}}\n\n=== On the Caribbean coast ===\n[[File:Boazio-Sir_Francis_Drake_in_Cartagena.jpg|thumb| [[Cartagena de Indias]] was the main port of entry for slaves during the colony.]]\n[[Cartagena de Indias]] was the main port of entry of slaves into the country during the colonial period and during its highest boom it turned out to be the most lucrative business in the city.  By 1620 the city had 6000 inhabitants, of whom 1400 were slaves of African origin, by 1686 the number of slaves had increased to 2000. {{sfn|Meisel Roca|1980|p=242}} In the census carried out between 1778  and 1780 it was determined that the slave population represented 10% of the population in [[Santa Marta Province]] and 8% of [[Cartagena Province]]. {{sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=54}}\n\nThe use of slave labor turned out to be essential for the economy of Cartagena Province, both in urban and rural areas.  With the death of the vast majority of the native population, the work of the Africans became highly relevant.  Although during the seventeenth century slave labor was used in both agriculture and livestock, eventually it became concentrated around only the latter since agriculture is seasonal and therefore less profitable for the slave owner who wanted to minimize the hours in which the slave  did not work. {{sfn|Meisel Roca|1980|p=243}}\n\nInside the cities, slavery gained a function not only of production but of status, all the houses of prosperous Spaniards in Cartagena and [[Momp\u00f3s]] were endowed with black servitude, which served as a sign of opulence. {{Sfn|Meisel  Roca|1980|p=243}} These slaves were traded during the 17th century for a value between 200 and 400 silver pesos each. {{Sfn|Meisel Roca|1980|p=248}}\n\nThe system of production with slave labor required a constant influx of new slaves, since the population of African origin had negative growth rates in the new world.  This was due to various factors such as the number of men exceeding that of women by a factor of 5 to 1 because they were considered more productive, as well as the high death rate among workers.  This required the constant influx of new \"bozales\" slaves (born in Africa). {{Sfn|Meisel Roca|1980|p=251}}\n\nSlavery in the Cartagena province began to decline in the eighteenth century.  During the republican era the institution entered into a true decline, mainly in rural areas where the current system of production ceased to be replaced by cheap mestizo labor.  In urban areas slavery managed to maintain its relevance because it was more linked to the exhibition of status than to modes of production, so it continued to be a relevant system until its abolition in the 19th century. {{Sfn|Meisel  Roca|1980|p=243}}\n\n=== On the Pacific coast ===\nThe first attempts at mining using slaves of African origin in the [[Pacific Region (Colombia)| Pacific coast of New Granada]] occurred during the 17th century.  However, these attempts were very limited and mostly unsuccessful due to the great difficulties that the Spanish had in subjugating the native populations.  Large mining operations, and with them the massive trafficking of African slaves to the west coast, would not begin until the last two decades of the 17th century. {{Sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=17}}\n\nThe vast majority of the African slaves that would eventually reach the Pacific entered through the port of [[Cartagena de Indias]];  in the Pacific they were marketed for a value of about 300 silver pesos if they were muzzles (born in Africa), and between 400 and 500 if they were creoles (born in America). {{sfn|de Friedemann|1974|p=96}} From analysis of documents of the time, it seems that more than half of the slaves who arrived in [[Choc\u00f3]] were of [[Kwa languages|Kwa]] origin, mainly from the [[Akan people|Akan]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]], there were also important minorities of [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mand\u00e9]], [[Gur languages|Gur speakers]] and [[Kru people|Kru]]. {{sfn|Granda Guti\u00e9rrez|1988|p=73-74}}\n\nThe Pacific coast was the colonial area with the highest percentage of slave population in New Granada territory.  In the 1778-1780 census it was found that in Choc\u00f3 slaves constituted 39% of the population;  in [[Iscuand\u00e9]] 38%;  in [[Tumaco]] 63%;  and in {{ill|Territory of Raposo|lt=Raposo|es|Territorio de Raposo}}, an extraordinary 70%.{{sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=55}}\n\nThese slaves destined for mining production were a vital component in the Pacific Region.  Between 1680 and 1700 [[Popay\u00e1n]] was the source of 41% of the gold production in New Granada. {{Sfn|de Friedemann|1974|p=98}}\n\n== Rebellions ==\n[[File:Benkos_Bioho.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px| Statue of [[Benkos Bioh\u00f3]], maroon rebel leader.]]\nThe first to oppose the imposition of forced labor by Europeans were indigenous peoples.  During the 16th century there were rebellions of the [[Paez people|paeces]], [[muzos]], and [[Yarigui people|Yariguis]]. {{Sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=132}} Los [[chinato]  ] s the town of San Crist\u00f3bal rebelled, while the {{ill|Tupe people|lt=Tupes|es|Tupe}} did the same in [[Santa Marta]].  However, the [[pijaos]] were the most successful in this regard, managing to stop work in the mines of [[Cartago, Valle del Cauca| Cartago]] and [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]], successfully interrupting communication with [[  Popay\u00e1n]] and Peru, and killing the Governor of Popay\u00e1n Vasco de Quiroga.  The war waged during the first decade of the 17th century would end with a victory for the Europeans, who would be rewarded for their service in the form of encomiendas. {{Sfn|Ruiz Rivera|Navarro Garc\u00eda|1975|p=139}}\n\nAfrican slaves frequently rebelled against their masters, either through the practice [[Maroon Black| Maroon]] and their flight, or through armed rebellion.  In Santa Marta in 1530, just five years after the city was built, a slave rebellion destroyed the town.  The city would be rebuilt only to suffer a new rebellion in the 1950s. {{Sfn|Navarrete|2005|p=38}}\n\nAlthough it was certainly possible for an individual slave to flee their masters and go unnoticed among the free black population of a large city, it was a precarious situation in which the fugitive was at constant risk of discovery;  therefore it is natural that many acts of flight were organized and directed towards communities of [[Black Maroon| Maroon Slaves]] in which they could find security with those of their own class. {{sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=57}}\n\nNot all rebellion activities ended in flight, in several cases the threat of revolt was used as a method within [[collective bargaining]].  In 1768 in the province of Santa Marta a group of slaves wounded a foreman whom they accused of ill-treatment, when their master sent a couple of white men to subdue them, the blacks killed one of the whites.  Far from being intimidated, the rebels gave their master an ultimatum, if he did not agree to their demands they would burn down the entire estate and escape to live with the \"brave Indians.\"  Without further remedy, the master accepted their demands, swearing to forgive them for the revolt, stopping the mistreatment and agreeing that if the slaves were ever sold this should be done collectively so as not to divide the families.  The owner also agreed to provide the workers with a good quantity of tobacco and brandy as compensation for the abuses. {{Sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=63}} Similar incidents occurred in [[Neiva]] in 1773 and [[  C\u00facuta]] in 1780, in which the slaves had reached a sort of agreement with the [[Company of Jesus| Jesuit priests]] in which their treatment was more similar to that of free peasants in a [[sharecropping]],  in which they were remunerated for their crops and granted holidays.  When a new master refused to uphold what the slaves considered their [[customary rights]], they did not hesitate to go into open rebellion and demand that the colonial government authorities recognize their rights. {{Sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=73-75}}\n\nOn the other hand, it is important to recognize that the resistance strategies of the black women enslaved during the colonial period were aimed at confronting the discourse of colonial power by resorting to judicial demands. <ref name=\"EUI\"> {{cite book|url=https://www.icesi.edu.co/editorial/demando-mi-liberty|title=Demando mi libertad|publisher=[[Universidad Icesi]]|year=2018|isbn=978-958-8936-36-9|editor-last1=Vergara Figueroa|editor-first1=Aurora|edition=1st|series=El sur es cielo roto |volume=16 |location=Cali, Colombia|language=espa\u00f1ol|trans-title=I demand my freedom|doi=10.18046/EUI/Escr.16.2018|oclc=1121270926|ol=OL26778189M|editor-last2=Cosme Puntiel|editor-first2=Carmen Luz}} </ref>\n\nHowever, the most famous slave rebellion in New Granada was undoubtedly that of the slaves of [[San Basilio de Palenque]], led by [[Benkos Bioh\u00f3]], the rebellion was so successful that on August 23,  1691 the king of Spain was forced to issue a certificate ordering the general freedom of the palenques and their right to land. {{Sfn|Navarrete|2008}}\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, the colonial authorities tried again to start a great campaign against the Maroon palenques, but despite succeeding in destroying some villages, the entire company turned out to be a failure, since the blacks managed to preserve their freedom and simply moved south.  {{sfn|McFarlane|1991|p=57}}\n\nCimarronaje would continue until the 19th century with the abolition of slavery, after which the former slaves would exercise new forms of resistance seeking to retaliate from their former masters. Blacks roamed the fields, tearing down fences, raiding property, and punishing conservatives with their whips;This period was named by the President [[Jos\u00e9 Hilario L\u00f3pez]] as \u00abthe democratic frolics\u00bb. {{sfn|Valencia Llano|1998}}\n\n== Abolition ==\n[[File:Josehilariolopez1.png|thumb| President [[Jos\u00e9 Hilario L\u00f3pez]], who spearheaded the abolition of slavery.]]\nThe process of [[manumission]] of slaves occurred to some extent throughout the history of the colony, but the question of abolishing slavery as an institution did not begin to take relevance until the [[Napoleonic Spain| Napoleonic invasion of Spain]]  ;  context in which in Iberian courts since 1809 the need to abolish slavery was raised in order to prevent \"slaves from seeking and even achieving it by violent and coercive means\".  [[Antonio Villavicencio]] was a proponent of [[freedom of wombs]], however his views were not heeded by the European crown. {{Sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}}\n\nDuring the [[Colombian Declaration of Independence|war of independence of Colombia]] it was [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] who introduced in 1816 the idea of \u200b\u200bgranting freedom to slaves who participated in the independence cause. {{Sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}} This was not  it means that the process was not without controversy, the landowners who depended on slaves both for work and to demonstrate status staunchly opposed the libertarian process.\n\nIn order to compromise the demands of the slavers who demanded that their \"property\" be respected, {{ill|Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix de Restrepo|es}} managed before the [[Congress of C\u00facuta]] to decree the freedom of bellies, which he declared as free  to the children of slaves born as of July 21, 1821. The law established for the masters the obligation to \u00abeducate, clothe and feed their children [...] but they in compensation must compensate the masters of  their mothers were prevented from spending on their upbringing, with their works and services, which they would lend to them up to the age of 18 years of age. \u201d{{sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}} The slave trade was definitively prohibited in 1825.\n\nAlthough the freedom of young slaves should have started on July 21, 1839, the process was largely delayed by the [[War of the Supremes]], which was fought from 1839 to 1842. After the war and under pressure  of the masters, a new law of May 29, 1842, extended the dependence on slaves for another 7 years through what was called apprenticeship.  In other words, the 18-year-old slaves would be presented to the mayors who should have them serve their former master or someone else who could \"educate and instruct\" him in a trade or profession.  In this way slavery was extended, while those who refused to participate were recruited into the [[Colombian National Army| national army]]. {{Sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}}\n\nThe inefficiency of the manumission, as well as the corruption of officials and landowners who continued with the slave trade ignoring the law caused great discontent among the so-called Democratic Societies (liberal associations of artisans).  This great political upheaval, coming from both the artisans and the slaves themselves, led the President [[Jos\u00e9 Hilario L\u00f3pez]] to propose absolute freedom.  Finally, the [[Colombian Congress]] dictated the law of May 21, 1851, by means of which the slaves would be free as of January 1, 1852 and the masters would be compensated with bonds.{{Sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}}\n\nEven so, in many places the masters refused to let the slaves go in a peaceful way, this led to the {{ill|Colombian Civil War of 1851|lt=Civil War of 1851|es|Guerra civil colombiana de 1851}}, which began when an insurrection began in [[Cauca Department| Cauca]] and [[Pasto, Colombia| Pasto]] headed by the [[Colombian Conservative Party| Conservative leaders]] Manuel Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and [[Julio Arboleda]] with the support of the government [[Ecuador|<nowiki> Ecuadorian]</nowiki>]] conservative trend.  In [[Antioquia State|Antioquia]] the rebellion broke out at the hands of conservatives led by {{ill|Eusebio Borrero|es}}.  The war would end in four months with the liberal victory and the final liberation of the slaves.{{Sfn|V\u00e9lez Ocampo|2005}}\n\nFrom all this it can be concluded that the abolition of slavery that occurred during the republic was a gradual process.  This can be verified when seeing how the percentage of the enslaved population was in constant decline throughout the republican period until the definitive abolition of the institution:{{sfn|Tovar Pinz\u00f3n|1994}}\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |-\n !Years\n!Total population\n!Slaves\n!Proportion\n |-\n |1778\n| align=\"right\" |798 956\n| align=\"right\" |62 547\n|7.82%\n |-\n |1825\n| align=\"right\" |1 129 174\n| align=\"right\" |45 133\n|4.00%\n |-\n |1835\n| align=\"right\" |1 570 854\n| align=\"right\" |37 547\n|2.39%\n |-\n |1843\n| align=\"right\" |1 812 782\n| align=\"right\" |25 591\n|1.41%\n|-\n |1851\n| align=\"right\" |2 105 622\n| align=\"right\" |15 972\n|0.76%\n|}\n </center>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last1=Navarrete|first1=Mar\u00eda Cristina|title=Genesis and development of slavery in Colombia in the 16th and 17th centuries|date=2005|publisher=Universidad del Valle|isbn=9789586703383|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PH_cf27ucZAC&dq=esclavitud+en+colombia|access-date=20 March 2019|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Navarrete|first1=Mar\u00eda Cristina|title=San Basilio de Palenque: memory and tradition - Emergence and vicissitudes of maroon deeds in the Colombian Caribbean|date=2008|publisher=Universidad del Valle|isbn=978-9587654189|url=https://books.google.es/books?Id=SLNJDwAAQBAJ&dq=san+basilio+de+palenque+%221691%22&lr=&hl=es&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=March 20, 2019|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Ruiz Rivera|first1=Juli\u00e1n Bautista|last2=Navarro Garc\u00eda|first2=Luis|date=1975|title=Commendation and myth in New Granada in the 17th century|publisher=CSIC Press|isbn=8400041763|page=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5R0dPbOImsUC&dq=Mita+en+Colombia|accessdate=March 19, 2019|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite publication|last1=Meisel Roca|first1=Adolfo|title=Slavery, Miscegenation and Haciendas in the Province of Cartagena: 1533-1851|work=Revista Desarrollo y Sociedad|date=July 4, 1980|page=229\u2013277|doi=10.13043/dys.4.2|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite publication|last1=by Friedemann|first1=Nina S.|title=The black culture of the Ecuadorian and Colombian coast: a model of ethnic adaptation|work=Colombian Journal of Anthropology|date=1974|volume=18|page=75\u2013115|url=http://biblioteca.icanh.gov.co/DOCS/MARC/texto/REV-0915V17a-4.PDF|accessdate=March 22, 2019|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite publication|last1=Granda Guti\u00e9rrez|first1=Germ\u00e1n|title=The slaves of Choc\u00f3.

{"title_page": "Vincenty's formulae", "text_new": "{{for|the mathematical background to this problem|Geodesics on an ellipsoid}}\n'''Vincenty's formulae''' are two related [[iterative method]]s used in [[geodesy]] to calculate the distance between two points on the surface of a spheroid, developed by [[Thaddeus Vincenty]] (1975a). They are based on the assumption that the [[figure of the Earth]] is an [[oblate spheroid]], and hence are more accurate than methods that assume a [[spherical]] Earth, such as [[great-circle distance]].\n\nThe first (direct) method computes the location of a point that is a given distance and [[azimuth]] (direction) from another point. The second (inverse) method computes the [[geographical distance]] and [[azimuth]] between two given points. They have been widely used in geodesy because they are accurate to within 0.5&nbsp;mm (0.020{{nbsp}}in) on the [[Earth ellipsoid]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nVincenty's goal was to express existing algorithms for [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]] in a form that minimized the program length (Vincenty 1975a). His unpublished report (1975b) mentions the use of a [[Wang Laboratories#Calculators|Wang]] 720 desk calculator, which had only a few kilobytes of memory. To obtain good accuracy for long lines, the solution uses the classical solution of Legendre (1806), Bessel (1825), and Helmert (1880) based on the auxiliary sphere. Vincenty relied on formulation of this method given by Rainsford, 1955. Legendre showed that an ellipsoidal geodesic can be exactly mapped to a great circle on the auxiliary sphere by mapping the geographic latitude to reduced latitude and setting the azimuth of the great circle equal to that of the geodesic. The longitude on the ellipsoid and the distance along the geodesic are then given in terms of the longitude on the sphere and the arc length along the great circle by simple integrals. Bessel and Helmert gave rapidly converging series for these integrals, which allow the geodesic to be computed with arbitrary accuracy.\n\nIn order to minimize the program size, Vincenty took these series, re-expanded them using the first term of each series as the small parameter,{{clarify|date=May 2019}} and truncated them to <math>O\\left(f^3\\right)</math>. This resulted in compact expressions for the longitude and distance integrals. The expressions were put in [[Horner scheme|Horner]] (or ''nested'') form, since this allows polynomials to be evaluated using only a single temporary register. Finally, simple iterative techniques were used to solve the implicit equations in the direct and inverse methods; even though these are slow (and in the case of the inverse method it sometimes does not converge), they result in the least increase in code size.\n\n== Notation ==\nDefine the following notation:\n{|\n|-\n| ''a'' || length of semi-[[major axis]] of the ellipsoid (radius at equator); || (6378137.0 metres in [[WGS-84]])\n|-\n| ''&fnof;'' || [[flattening]] of the ellipsoid; || (1/298.257223563 in [[WGS-84]])\n|-\n| ''b'' = (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''&fnof;'')&nbsp;''a''|| length of semi-[[minor axis]] of the ellipsoid (radius at the poles); || (6356752.314245 meters in [[WGS-84]])\n|-\n| ''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub> || [[latitude]] of the points;\n|-\n| ''U''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;arctan( (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u0192'')&nbsp;tan&nbsp;''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub> ), <br/> ''U''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;arctan( (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u0192'') tan ''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub> ) || [[Latitude#Reduced (or parametric) latitude|reduced latitude]] (latitude on the auxiliary sphere)\n|-\n| ''L''{{sub|1}}, ''L''{{sub|2}} || [[longitude]] of the points;\n|-\n| ''L'' = ''L''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''L''<sub>1</sub> || difference in [[longitude]] of two points;\n|-\n| ''\u03bb'' || Difference in longitude of the points on the auxiliary sphere;\n|-\n| ''\u03b1''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03b1''<sub>2</sub> || forward [[azimuth]]s at the points;\n|-\n| ''\u03b1'' || forward [[azimuth]] of the geodesic at the equator, if it were extended that far;\n|-\n| ''s'' || ellipsoidal distance between the two points;\n|-\n| ''\u03c3'' || angular separation between points\n|-\n| ''\u03c3''{{sub|1}} || angular separation between the point and the equator\n|-\n| ''\u03c3''{{sub|m}} || angular separation between the midpoint of the line and the equator\n|}\n\n== Inverse problem==\nGiven the coordinates of the two points (''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>1</sub>) and (''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>2</sub>), the inverse problem finds the azimuths ''\u03b1''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03b1''<sub>2</sub> and the ellipsoidal distance ''s''.\n\nCalculate ''U''<sub>1</sub>, ''U''<sub>2</sub> and ''L'', and set initial value of ''\u03bb'' = ''L''.

An example of slow convergence is (''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>1</sub>) = (0\u00b0,&nbsp;0\u00b0) and (''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>2</sub>) = (0.5\u00b0,&nbsp;179.5\u00b0) for the WGS84 ellipsoid. This requires about 130 iterations to give a result accurate to 1&nbsp;mm. Depending on how the inverse method is implemented, the algorithm might return the correct result (19936288.579&nbsp;m), an incorrect result, or an error indicator. An example of an incorrect result is provided by the [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Inv_Fwd/Inv_Fwd.html NGS online utility], which returns a distance that is about 5&nbsp;km too long. Vincenty suggested a method of accelerating the convergence in such cases (Rapp, 1973).\n\nAn example of a failure of the inverse method to converge is (''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>1</sub>) = (0\u00b0,&nbsp;0\u00b0) and (''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>2</sub>) = (0.5\u00b0,&nbsp;179.7\u00b0) for the WGS84 ellipsoid. In an unpublished report, Vincenty (1975b) gave an alternative iterative scheme to handle such cases. This converges to the correct result 19944127.421&nbsp;m after about 60 iterations; however, in other cases many thousands of iterations are required.\n\n[[Newton's method]] has been used to give rapid convergence for all pairs of input points (Karney, 2013).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Geographical distance]]\n*[[Great-circle distance]]\n*[[Meridian arc]]\n*[[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]]\n*[[Thaddeus Vincenty]]\n*[[Geodesy]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal\n |first=Friedrich W. |last=Bessel |authorlink=Friedrich Bessel\n |title=The calculation of longitude and latitude from geodesic measurements (1825)\n |journal=Astron.

They are based on the assumption that the [[figure of the Earth]] is an [[oblate spheroid]], and hence are more accurate than methods that assume a [[spherical]] Earth, such as [[great-circle distance]].\n\nThe first (direct) method computes the location of a point that is a given distance and [[azimuth]] (direction) from another point. The second (inverse) method computes the [[geographical distance]] and [[azimuth]] between two given points. They have been widely used in geodesy because they are accurate to within 0.5&nbsp;mm (0.020{{nbsp}}in) on the [[Earth ellipsoid]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nVincenty's goal was to express existing algorithms for [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]] in a form that minimized the program length (Vincenty 1975a). His unpublished report (1975b) mentions the use of a [[Wang Laboratories#Calculators|Wang]] 720 desk calculator, which had only a few kilobytes of memory. To obtain good accuracy for long lines, the solution uses the classical solution of Legendre (1806), Bessel (1825), and Helmert (1880) based on the auxiliary sphere. Vincenty relied on formulation of this method given by Rainsford, 1955. Legendre showed that an ellipsoidal geodesic can be exactly mapped to a great circle on the auxiliary sphere by mapping the geographic latitude to reduced latitude and setting the azimuth of the great circle equal to that of the geodesic. The longitude on the ellipsoid and the distance along the geodesic are then given in terms of the longitude on the sphere and the arc length along the great circle by simple integrals. Bessel and Helmert gave rapidly converging series for these integrals, which allow the geodesic to be computed with arbitrary accuracy.\n\nIn order to minimize the program size, Vincenty took these series, re-expanded them using the first term of each series as the small parameter,{{clarify|date=May 2019}} and truncated them to <math>O\\left(f^3\\right)</math>. This resulted in compact expressions for the longitude and distance integrals. The expressions were put in [[Horner scheme|Horner]] (or ''nested'') form, since this allows polynomials to be evaluated using only a single temporary register. Finally, simple iterative techniques were used to solve the implicit equations in the direct and inverse methods; even though these are slow (and in the case of the inverse method it sometimes does not converge), they result in the least increase in code size.\n\n== Notation ==\nDefine the following notation:\n{|\n|-\n| ''a'' || length of semi-[[major axis]] of the ellipsoid (radius at equator); || (6378137.0 metres in [[WGS-84]])\n|-\n| ''&fnof;'' || [[flattening]] of the ellipsoid; || (1/298.257223563 in [[WGS-84]])\n|-\n| ''b'' = (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''&fnof;'')&nbsp;''a''|| length of semi-[[minor axis]] of the ellipsoid (radius at the poles); || (6356752.314245 meters in [[WGS-84]])\n|-\n| ''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub> || [[latitude]] of the points;\n|-\n| ''U''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;arctan( (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u0192'')&nbsp;tan&nbsp;''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub> ), <br/> ''U''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;arctan( (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u0192'') tan ''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub> ) || [[Latitude#Reduced (or parametric) latitude|reduced latitude]] (latitude on the auxiliary sphere)\n|-\n| ''L''{{sub|1}}, ''L''{{sub|2}} || [[longitude]] of the points;\n|-\n| ''L'' = ''L''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''L''<sub>1</sub> || difference in [[longitude]] of two points;\n|-\n| ''\u03bb'' || Difference in longitude of the points on the auxiliary sphere;\n|-\n| ''\u03b1''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03b1''<sub>2</sub> || forward [[azimuth]]s at the points;\n|-\n| ''\u03b1'' || forward [[azimuth]] of the geodesic at the equator, if it were extended that far;\n|-\n| ''s'' || ellipsoidal distance between the two points;\n|-\n| ''\u03c3'' || angular separation between points\n|-\n| ''\u03c3''{{sub|1}} || angular separation between the point and the equator\n|-\n| ''\u03c3''{{sub|m}} || angular separation between the midpoint of the line and the equator\n|}\n\n== Inverse problem==\nGiven the coordinates of the two points (''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>1</sub>) and (''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>2</sub>), the inverse problem finds the azimuths ''\u03b1''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03b1''<sub>2</sub> and the ellipsoidal distance ''s''.\n\nCalculate ''U''<sub>1</sub>, ''U''<sub>2</sub> and ''L'', and set initial value of ''\u03bb'' = ''L''.

An example of slow convergence is (''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>1</sub>) = (0\u00b0,&nbsp;0\u00b0) and (''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>2</sub>) = (0.5\u00b0,&nbsp;179.5\u00b0) for the WGS84 ellipsoid. This requires about 130 iterations to give a result accurate to 1&nbsp;mm. Depending on how the inverse method is implemented, the algorithm might return the correct result (19936288.579&nbsp;m), an incorrect result, or an error indicator. An example of an incorrect result is provided by the [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Inv_Fwd/Inv_Fwd.html NGS online utility], which returns a distance that is about 5&nbsp;km too long. Vincenty suggested a method of accelerating the convergence in such cases (Rapp, 1973).\n\nAn example of a failure of the inverse method to converge is (''\u03a6''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>1</sub>) = (0\u00b0,&nbsp;0\u00b0) and (''\u03a6''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>2</sub>) = (0.5\u00b0,&nbsp;179.7\u00b0) for the WGS84 ellipsoid. In an unpublished report, Vincenty (1975b) gave an alternative iterative scheme to handle such cases. This converges to the correct result 19944127.421&nbsp;m after about 60 iterations; however, in other cases many thousands of iterations are required.\n\n[[Newton's method]] has been used to give rapid convergence for all pairs of input points (Karney, 2013).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Geographical distance]]\n*[[Great-circle distance]]\n*[[Meridian arc]]\n*[[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]]\n*[[Thaddeus Vincenty]]\n*[[Geodesy]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal\n |first=Friedrich W. |last=Bessel |authorlink=Friedrich Bessel\n |title=The calculation of longitude and latitude from geodesic measurements (1825)\n |journal=Astron.
