As a result, Ugandan President [[Idi Amin]] was deposed, his forces were scattered, and a UNLF government was installed.\n\nAmin had seized power in Uganda in 1971 and established a brutal dictatorship. Seven years later he attempted to invade Tanzania to the south. Tanzania repulsed the assault and launched a counter-attack into Ugandan territory. After [[Battle of Entebbe|routing]] the Ugandans and their [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]n allies in [[Entebbe]], the Tanzanians revised their existing offensive designs for Kampala. The plans called for the 208th Brigade to advance from the south, spearheaded by Lieutenant Colonel Ben Msuya's 800-strong 19th Battalion, which was to secure the centre of the city. The 207th Brigade and a UNLF battalion were to attack from the west, while the 201st Brigade was to establish roadblocks to the north to prevent Ugandan units from withdrawing. An eastern corridor was left open to allow the Libyans to evacuate to [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]] and fly out of the country. Amin prepared for the defence of Kampala but fled through the gap.\n\nThe Tanzanians began their assault on the city on the morning of 10 April. The 19th Battalion moved cautiously down the Entebbe\u2013Kampala road. Other battalions of the 208th advanced on [[Port Bell]]. The 201st Brigade established its roadblocks north of Kampala and intercepted both forces attempting to reinforce Kampala from [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]] and those attempting to effect a breakout. The 207th Brigade advanced from the west in tandem with the UNLF battalion, which secured [[Nateete]] and passed through [[Rubaga]]. One of the 207th's battalions seized [[Kasubi hill]] and the [[Kasubi Tombs|royal tomb]] of the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabakas]]. The 19th Battalion encountered only sporadic resistance and was greeted by crowds of rejoicing civilians. Upon reaching Kampala's city centre, the unit, lacking maps, had trouble navigating the streets. The Tanzanians secured the radio station and set up a command post on [[Kololo]] hill. The UNLF battalion occupied Republic House\u2014the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]]'s headquarters at the edge of the city\u2014unopposed, but was unable to take the [[State Research Bureau (organisation)|State Research Bureau]] at [[Nakasero]]. Men of the 207th and 208th Brigades seized the southern and western portions of the city. The few Libyan units in the area put up little resistance, most having retreated to Jinja.\n\nBy dawn on April 11, Tanzanian troops had cut off all routes out of Kampala, including the road to Jinja, and began eliminating remaining pockets of resistance. Some UNLF forces conducted revenge killings against suspected collaborators with the Amin regime, while others attacked [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]] and [[Nubians]], both ethnic groups that had benefited from the dictatorship. Later in the morning Tanzanian [[artillery]] bombarded parts of the city. The remaining Ugandan soldiers in the city desperately attempted to escape by changing into civilian clothes and requisitioning civilian vehicles. Casualty statistics are not exact, though Tanzanian losses are estimated to have been light, and dozens of Ugandan soldiers and civilians are believed to have died. The battle marked the first time in the recent history of the continent that an African state seized the capital of another African country and deposed its government. In the immediate aftermath civilians engaged in rampant looting, despite the attempts of Tanzanian and UNLF troops to maintain order. A new Ugandan government was established by the UNLF. Though pro-Amin forces were left scattered and disjointed by the seizure of the capital, combat operations in the country continued until 3 June, when Tanzanian forces reached the [[Sudan]]ese border and eliminated the last resistance.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1971, [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the President of [[Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring [[Tanzania]].<ref name= honey2/> Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his socialist orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news |last=Honey |first=Martha |title=Ugandan Capital Captured |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=12 April 1979 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on |access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters. He tacitly supported a failed attempt by Obote to overthrow Amin in 1972, and after a brief border conflict he and Amin signed a peace accord. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}}\n\nUganda's economy languished under Amin's corrupt rule and instability manifested in the armed forces. Following a failed mutiny in late October 1978, Ugandan troops crossed over the Tanzanian border in pursuit of rebellious soldiers.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} On 1 November Amin announced that he was annexing the [[Kagera Region|Kagera Salient]] in northern Tanzania.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=157}} Tanzania halted the sudden invasion, mobilised anti-Amin opposition groups, and launched a counter-offensive.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=160\u2013161}} Nyerere told foreign diplomats that he did not intend to depose Amin, but only \"teach him a lesson\". The claim was not believed; Nyerere despised Amin, and he made statements to some of his colleagues about overthrowing him. The Tanzanian government also felt that its northern border would not be secure unless the threat presented by Amin was eliminated.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=163\u2013164}} After initial advances into Ugandan territory, Major General [[David Msuguri]] was appointed commander of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF)'s 20th Division and ordered to push further into the country.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=79}}\n\nThe TPDF [[Battle of Masaka|seized]] [[Masaka]] on 24 February 1979. Nyerere originally planned to halt his forces there and allow Ugandan exiles to attack [[Kampala]], the Ugandan capital, and overthrow Amin.{{efn|According to historian Kenneth Ingham, Nyerere requested Obote, who was in exile in Tanzania, to fly to Masaka to accompany the Ugandan partisans as they entered the city, but Obote refused, fearing that such a dramatic return to the country would incite hostility against him.{{sfn|Ingham|1994|p=150}}}} He feared that scenes of Tanzanian troops occupying the city would reflect poorly on the country's image abroad.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=162\u2013163}} The fall of Masaka surprised and deeply troubled Ugandan commanders, who felt that the defeat made Kampala vulnerable to attack. They mobilised additional forces and began planning for a defence of the city.{{sfn|Rwehururu|2002|p=124}} Some troops were sent to [[Lukaya, Uganda|Lukaya]], where they [[Battle of Lukaya|vainly attempted]] to halt the Tanzanian advance.{{sfn|Rwehururu|2002|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nUgandan opposition groups met in [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]] in late March. They elected [[Yusuf Lule]] chairman of the [[Uganda National Liberation Front]] (UNLF) and established a cabinet.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=117}} Shortly thereafter President [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[Libya]], an ally of Amin, attempted to stem the advance by sending an ultimatum to Nyerere, demanding that he withdraw his forces in 24 hours or face the opposition of Libyan troops (which were already operating in Uganda). Nyerere rejected the threat in a radio broadcast, announcing that Libya's entry into the war did not change the Tanzanian government's view of Amin.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=120}} Ugandan rebel forces did not have the strength to defeat Libyan units, so Nyerere decided to use the TPDF to take Kampala.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=162\u2013163}} Tanzanian leaders were also inclined to capture the city after Ugandan planes bombed [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] and following Amin's announcement that the inhabitants of Masaka and [[Mbarara]] would face retaliation for welcoming the Tanzanian invasion.<ref name= lubega>{{cite web |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/39-years-after-war-brought-down-Amin/688342-4381066-mqe3pw/index.html |title=39 years after war that brought down Amin |last=Lubega |first=Henry |date=11 April 2018 |website=[[Daily Monitor]] |access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref> The successful formation of the UNLF government eased Tanzanian concerns about the aftermath of a seizure of the capital.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=121}} On 25 March Amin imposed a curfew<ref>{{cite news |title=Amin Shuts Entebbe Airport as Rebels Approach Capital |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=[[The Cornell Daily Sun]] |page=2 |volume=95 |issue=113 |date=26 March 1979 |url=https://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&d=CDS19790326.2.8}}</ref> and a blackout{{sfn|Decker|2014|p=158}} in Kampala, which was home to 400,000 residents.<ref name= IHT1/> Four days later the [[United Nations]] announced that it would evacuate the approximately 140 dependents of its Kampala staff to [[Kenya]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Honey |first=Martha |title=U.N.

However, from the high ground in [[Mpigi]] they could see the [[Entebbe]] peninsula, where there was heavy Libyan air traffic and a large contingent of Ugandan and Libyan soldiers. If the TPDF seized Kampala before securing the town of Entebbe, it would be susceptible to a flanking attack.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=121}} Taking Entebbe would cut off Uganda's Libyan reinforcements and permit an assault on the capital from the south.{{sfn|Pollack|2004|pp=372\u2013373}} Msuguri made the decision to attack the peninsula first, and ordered the 208th Brigade to secure it. A preliminary bombardment frightened Amin in his official residence, the Entebbe State House, and he fled via helicopter to Kampala. On 7 April the brigade [[Battle of Entebbe|advanced into the town]]. Many Libyan soldiers attempted to evacuate to Kampala but were intercepted and killed.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=121\u2013122}} Following the seizure of Entebbe, hundreds of Ugandan soldiers garrisoning Kampala fled,{{sfn|Mzirai|1980|p=97}} many of them relocating with their moveable possessions to the country's north.{{sfn|Decker|2014|p=148}} While these troops attempted to flee the capital, one unit relocated from [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]] to Kampala to help defend Amin's government.

Brigadier Mwita Marwa, commander of the 208th Brigade, conducted the briefing. Nyerere requested that his commanders leave the eastern road from the city leading to [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]] clear so that Libyan troops and foreign diplomats could evacuate. He thought that by letting the Libyans escape, Libya could avoid humiliation and quietly withdraw from the war. Nyerere also feared that further conflict with Libyan troops would incite Afro\u2013Arab tensions and invite the armed belligerence of other Arab states. He sent a message to Gaddafi explaining his decision, saying that the Libyans could be airlifted out of Uganda unopposed from the airstrip in Jinja.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=124\u2013125}} He further requested that his forces avoid damaging key buildings in Kampala, including [[Mulago Hospital]], [[Makerere University]], and the [[Parliament of Uganda]].<ref name= downfall /> The Tanzanian plan of attack called for an advance by the 207th Brigade and a UNLF battalion from the west along the road from Masaka with a simultaneous assault from Entebbe in the south by the 208th Brigade. The latter's 19th Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Ben Msuya was earmarked for the seizure of the city centre, while other units were to cover their flanks in the bush. The 201st Brigade was to maintain a \"blocking action\" north of Kampala to prevent Ugandan forces from escaping.

As a result, Ugandan President [[Idi Amin]] was deposed, his forces were scattered, and a UNLF government was installed.\n\nAmin had seized power in Uganda in 1971 and established a brutal dictatorship. Seven years later he attempted to invade Tanzania to the south. Tanzania repulsed the assault and launched a counter-attack into Ugandan territory. After [[Battle of Entebbe|routing]] the Ugandans and their [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]n allies in [[Entebbe]], the Tanzanians revised their existing offensive designs for Kampala. The plans called for the 208th Brigade to advance from the south, spearheaded by Lieutenant Colonel Ben Msuya's 800-strong 19th Battalion, which was to secure the centre of the city. The 207th Brigade and a UNLF battalion were to attack from the west, while the 201st Brigade was to establish roadblocks to the north to prevent Ugandan units from withdrawing. An eastern corridor was left open to allow the Libyans to evacuate to [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]] and fly out of the country. Amin prepared for the defence of Kampala but fled through the gap.\n\nThe Tanzanians began their assault on the city on the morning of 10 April. The 19th Battalion moved cautiously down the Entebbe\u2013Kampala road. Other battalions of the 208th advanced on [[Port Bell]]. The 201st Brigade established its roadblocks north of Kampala and intercepted both forces attempting to reinforce Kampala from [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]] and those attempting to effect a breakout. The 207th Brigade advanced from the west in tandem with the UNLF battalion, which secured [[Nateete]] and passed through [[Rubaga]]. One of the 207th's battalions seized [[Kasubi hill]] and the [[Kasubi Tombs|royal tomb]] of the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabakas]]. The 19th Battalion encountered only sporadic resistance and was greeted by crowds of rejoicing civilians. Upon reaching Kampala's city centre, the unit, lacking maps, had trouble navigating the streets. The Tanzanians secured the radio station and set up a command post on [[Kololo]] hill. The UNLF battalion occupied Republic House\u2014the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]]'s headquarters at the edge of the city\u2014unopposed, but was unable to take the [[State Research Bureau (organisation)|State Research Bureau]] at [[Nakasero]]. Men of the 207th and 208th Brigades seized the southern and western portions of the city. The few Libyan units in the area put up little resistance, most having retreated to Jinja.\n\nBy dawn on April 11, Tanzanian troops had cut off all routes out of Kampala, including the road to Jinja, and began eliminating remaining pockets of resistance. Some UNLF forces conducted revenge killings against suspected collaborators with the Amin regime, while others attacked [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]] and [[Nubians]], both ethnic groups that had benefited from the dictatorship. Later in the morning Tanzanian [[artillery]] bombarded parts of the city. The remaining Ugandan soldiers in the city desperately attempted to escape by changing into civilian clothes and requisitioning civilian vehicles. Casualty statistics are not exact, though Tanzanian losses are estimated to have been light, and dozens of Ugandan soldiers and civilians are believed to have died. The battle marked the first time in the recent history of the continent that an African state seized the capital of another African country and deposed its government. In the immediate aftermath civilians engaged in rampant looting, despite the attempts of Tanzanian and UNLF troops to maintain order. A new Ugandan government was established by the UNLF. Though pro-Amin forces were left scattered and disjointed by the seizure of the capital, combat operations in the country continued until 3 June, when Tanzanian forces reached the [[Sudan]]ese border and eliminated the last resistance.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1971, [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the President of [[Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring [[Tanzania]].<ref name= honey2/> Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his socialist orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news |last=Honey |first=Martha |title=Ugandan Capital Captured |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=12 April 1979 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on |access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters. He tacitly supported a failed attempt by Obote to overthrow Amin in 1972, and after a brief border conflict he and Amin signed a peace accord. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}}\n\nUganda's economy languished under Amin's corrupt rule and instability manifested in the armed forces. Following a failed mutiny in late October 1978, Ugandan troops crossed over the Tanzanian border in pursuit of rebellious soldiers.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} On 1 November Amin announced that he was annexing the [[Kagera Region|Kagera Salient]] in northern Tanzania.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=157}} Tanzania halted the sudden invasion, mobilised anti-Amin opposition groups, and launched a counter-offensive.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=160\u2013161}} Nyerere told foreign diplomats that he did not intend to depose Amin, but only \"teach him a lesson\". The claim was not believed; Nyerere despised Amin, and he made statements to some of his colleagues about overthrowing him. The Tanzanian government also felt that its northern border would not be secure unless the threat presented by Amin was eliminated.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=163\u2013164}} After initial advances into Ugandan territory, Major General [[David Msuguri]] was appointed commander of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF)'s 20th Division and ordered to push further into the country.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=79}}\n\nThe TPDF [[Battle of Masaka|seized]] [[Masaka]] on 24 February 1979. Nyerere originally planned to halt his forces there and allow Ugandan exiles to attack [[Kampala]], the Ugandan capital, and overthrow Amin.{{efn|According to historian Kenneth Ingham, Nyerere requested Obote, who was in exile in Tanzania, to fly to Masaka to accompany the Ugandan partisans as they entered the city, but Obote refused, fearing that such a dramatic return to the country would incite hostility against him.{{sfn|Ingham|1994|p=150}}}} He feared that scenes of Tanzanian troops occupying the city would reflect poorly on the country's image abroad.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=162\u2013163}} The fall of Masaka surprised and deeply troubled Ugandan commanders, who felt that the defeat made Kampala vulnerable to attack. They mobilised additional forces and began planning for a defence of the city.{{sfn|Rwehururu|2002|p=124}} Some troops were sent to [[Lukaya, Uganda|Lukaya]], where they [[Battle of Lukaya|vainly attempted]] to halt the Tanzanian advance.{{sfn|Rwehururu|2002|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nUgandan opposition groups met in [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]] in late March. They elected [[Yusuf Lule]] chairman of the [[Uganda National Liberation Front]] (UNLF) and established a cabinet.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=117}} Shortly thereafter President [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[Libya]], an ally of Amin, attempted to stem the advance by sending an ultimatum to Nyerere, demanding that he withdraw his forces in 24 hours or face the opposition of Libyan troops (which were already operating in Uganda). Nyerere rejected the threat in a radio broadcast, announcing that Libya's entry into the war did not change the Tanzanian government's view of Amin.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=120}} Ugandan rebel forces did not have the strength to defeat Libyan units, so Nyerere decided to use the TPDF to take Kampala.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=162\u2013163}} Tanzanian leaders were also inclined to capture the city after Ugandan planes bombed [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] and following Amin's announcement that the inhabitants of Masaka and [[Mbarara]] would face retaliation for welcoming the Tanzanian invasion.<ref name= lubega>{{cite web |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/39-years-after-war-brought-down-Amin/688342-4381066-mqe3pw/index.html |title=39 years after war that brought down Amin |last=Lubega |first=Henry |date=11 April 2018 |website=[[Daily Monitor]] |access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref> The successful formation of the UNLF government eased Tanzanian concerns about the aftermath of a seizure of the capital.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=121}} On 25 March Amin imposed a curfew<ref>{{cite news |title=Amin Shuts Entebbe Airport as Rebels Approach Capital |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=[[The Cornell Daily Sun]] |page=2 |volume=95 |issue=113 |date=26 March 1979 |url=https://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&d=CDS19790326.2.8}}</ref> and a blackout{{sfn|Decker|2014|p=158}} in Kampala, which was home to 400,000 residents.<ref name= IHT1/> Four days later the [[United Nations]] announced that it would evacuate the approximately 140 dependents of its Kampala staff to [[Kenya]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Honey |first=Martha |title=U.N.

However, from the high ground in [[Mpigi]] they could see the [[Entebbe]] peninsula, where there was heavy Libyan air traffic and a large contingent of Ugandan and Libyan soldiers. If the TPDF seized Kampala before securing the town of Entebbe, it would be susceptible to a flanking attack.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=121}} Taking Entebbe would cut off Uganda's Libyan reinforcements and permit an assault on the capital from the south.{{sfn|Pollack|2004|pp=372\u2013373}} Msuguri made the decision to attack the peninsula first, and ordered the 208th Brigade to secure it.

Brigadier Mwita Marwa, commander of the 208th Brigade, conducted the briefing. Nyerere requested that his commanders leave the eastern road from the city leading to [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]] clear so that Libyan troops and foreign diplomats could evacuate. He thought that by letting the Libyans escape, Libya could avoid humiliation and quietly withdraw from the war. Nyerere also feared that further conflict with Libyan troops would incite Afro\u2013Arab tensions and invite the armed belligerence of other Arab states. He sent a message to Gaddafi explaining his decision, saying that the Libyans could be airlifted out of Uganda unopposed from the airstrip in Jinja.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=124\u2013125}} He further requested that his forces avoid damaging key buildings in Kampala, including [[Mulago Hospital]], [[Makerere University]], and the [[Parliament of Uganda]].<ref name= downfall /> The Tanzanian plan of attack called for an advance by the 207th Brigade and a UNLF battalion from the west along the road from Masaka with a simultaneous assault from Entebbe in the south by the 208th Brigade. The latter's 19th Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Ben Msuya was earmarked for the seizure of the city centre, while other units were to cover their flanks in the bush. The 201st Brigade was to maintain a \"blocking action\" north of Kampala to prevent Ugandan forces from escaping.

In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the [[Pueblo Revolt]], until 1692 when [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was reconquered and once again became the capital.\n\nThe [[Texas Revolution]] (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side.<ref name=\"elpaso7475\">''El Paso, A Borderlands History'', by W.H. Timmons, pp. 74, 75</ref> The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\n\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral]] which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with [[San Elizario, Texas|San Elizario]] as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of [[Cross-border town naming]] until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888.

Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast [[Plan de San Diego]] which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens.<ref name=TSHAPSD>{{cite web | url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ngp04 | publisher=Texas State Historical Association | title=Plan of San Diego | accessdate=October 4, 2015| date=June 15, 2010 }}</ref> The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives.

Copper smelting, [[Petroleum|oil]] refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the [[bracero program]] which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority.

The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was {{convert|15|\u00b0F|0}}, the lowest daily maximum on record.

El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the [[Sunset Heights]] district. It is close to the [[El Paso International Airport]], the international border, and [[Fort Bliss]]. It is part of the [[El Paso Independent School District]].\n\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the [[white American]] residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic-American]] residents lived in an area called [[Chihuahuita]] (\"little [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita.

Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like [[east El Paso]] and [[northwest El Paso]], but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at [[Ft. Bliss]] in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at [[Andress High School]], [[Parkland High School (Texas)|Parkland High School]], [[Irvin High School]], and [[Captain John L.

It is the third largest area of the city, behind [[east El Paso]] and [[central El Paso]]. Hawkins Road and [[Interstate 10]] border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day [[Texas]] was under the rule of [[Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain).\n\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: [[Ysleta Mission]]-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), [[Socorro Mission]]-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and [[San Elizario Chapel]] (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\n\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. [[Don Juan de O\u00f1ate]], a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared [[La Toma]] (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\n[[Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo]] (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\n\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n===Texas and New Mexico suburbs===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico.

In any given climbing season, which generally lasts from October through March, it is common for climbers from across Europe, Asia, and Australia to visit the park. Since implementation of the Public Use Plan, following a brief closure of the entire park due to the park service's inability to manage the growing crowds of international climbers, volunteer or commercial guides are required to access more than 2/3 of the park's area. Only North Mountain is accessible without guides, and then only for about 70 people at any given time. The park offers camping and showers for a small fee a day or, as is most popular for climbers, the nearby Hueco Rock Ranch offers camping where climbers can relax and socialize.\n\nThe [[Chamizal National Memorial]] is a 54.90-acre (22.22 ha) memorial park that serves primarily as a cultural center and contains art galleries, a theater, and an amphitheatre.

In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the [[Pueblo Revolt]], until 1692 when [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was reconquered and once again became the capital.\n\nThe [[Texas Revolution]] (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side.<ref name=\"elpaso7475\">''El Paso, A Borderlands History'', by W.H. Timmons, pp. 74, 75</ref> The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\n\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral]] which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with [[San Elizario, Texas|San Elizario]] as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of [[Cross-border town naming]] until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring [[Anson Mills]] to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{Handbook of Texas | id=hde01 | name=El Paso, Texas}}</ref>[[File:El Paso c1880.jpg|thumb|El Paso circa 1880|alt=|left]]During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union [[California Column]] in 1862.

Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast [[Plan de San Diego]] which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens.<ref name=TSHAPSD>{{cite web | url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ngp04 | publisher=Texas State Historical Association | title=Plan of San Diego | accessdate=October 4, 2015| date=June 15, 2010 }}</ref> The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives.

Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites.

The [[El Paso and Northeastern Railway]] was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory.

In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the [[Depression era]] overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nDuring and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)]], helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, [[Petroleum|oil]] refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the [[bracero program]] which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Farah strike|The Farah Strike]], 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas.

El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the [[Sunset Heights]] district. It is close to the [[El Paso International Airport]], the international border, and [[Fort Bliss]]. It is part of the [[El Paso Independent School District]].\n\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the [[white American]] residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic-American]] residents lived in an area called [[Chihuahuita]] (\"little [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita.

Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like [[east El Paso]] and [[northwest El Paso]], but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at [[Ft. Bliss]] in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at [[Andress High School]], [[Parkland High School (Texas)|Parkland High School]], [[Irvin High School]], and [[Captain John L.

It is the third largest area of the city, behind [[east El Paso]] and [[central El Paso]]. Hawkins Road and [[Interstate 10]] border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day [[Texas]] was under the rule of [[Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain).\n\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: [[Ysleta Mission]]-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), [[Socorro Mission]]-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and [[San Elizario Chapel]] (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\n\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. [[Don Juan de O\u00f1ate]], a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared [[La Toma]] (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\n[[Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo]] (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\n\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n===Texas and New Mexico suburbs===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are [[Socorro, Texas|Socorro]], [[Horizon City, Texas|Horizon City]], [[Fort Bliss]] and [[San Elizario, Texas|San Elizario]]. Other Texas suburbs are [[Anthony, Texas|Anthony]], [[Canutillo, Texas|Canutillo]], [[Sparks, Texas|Sparks]], [[Fabens, Texas|Fabens]], and [[Vinton, Texas|Vinton]].\n\nAlthough [[Anthony, New Mexico|Anthony]], [[Santa Teresa, New Mexico|Santa Teresa]], [[Sunland Park, New Mexico|Sunland Park]], and [[Chaparral, New Mexico|Chaparral]] lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/List4.txt.html |title=Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Components |publisher=U.S Census Bureau |date=November 2004 |accessdate=June 27, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Cityscape===\n{{wide image|El_paso_city.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|A panoramic view of El Paso, looking northeast through south, near Scenic Drive.

{"title_page": "Flight level", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{More citations needed\n| date = December 2016\n}}\n\nIn [[aviation]] and aviation [[meteorology]], '''flight level''' ('''FL''') is an aircraft's altitude at standard [[air pressure]], expressed in hundreds of [[foot (unit)|feet]]. The air pressure is computed assuming an [[International Standard Atmosphere]] pressure of 1013.25&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] (29.92&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) at [[sea level]], and therefore is not necessarily the same as the aircraft's actual altitude, either above sea level or [[height above ground level|above ground level]].\n\n==Background==\nFlight levels are used to ensure safe vertical separation between aircraft, despite natural local variations in atmospheric [[air pressure]]. Historically, altitude has been measured using a pressure [[altimeter]], which is essentially a calibrated [[barometer]]. An altimeter measures ambient air pressure, which decreases with increasing altitude following the [[barometric formula]]. It then calculates and displays the corresponding altitude. If different aircrafts' altimeters were not calibrated consistently, then two aircraft could be flying at the same altitude even though their altimeters appeared to show that they were at different altitudes.<ref>See also [http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Level_Bust Level Bust] for related causes and consequences</ref> Flight levels solve this problem by defining altitudes based on a standard air pressure at sea-level. All aircraft operating on flight levels calibrate to this setting regardless of the actual sea level pressure.\n\nTo display true altitude above sea level, a pilot would need to calibrate the altimeter according to the local air pressure at sea level, to take into account natural variation of pressure over time and in different regions.\n\n== Definition ==\nFlight levels<ref>{{cite book|url = https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/pcg_basic_chgs%201_2_9-13-18.pdf|title=Aeronautical Information Manual|author=Federal Aviation Administration | author-link=Federal Aviation Administration| chapter = Pilot/Controller Glossary | page = PCG F\u22123| date= 29 March 2018| access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref> are described by a number, which is the nominal altitude, or [[pressure altitude]], in hundreds of feet, while being a multiple of 500&nbsp;ft, therefore always ending in 0 or 5. Therefore, a pressure altitude of {{cvt|32000|ft|m}} is referred to as \"flight level 320\".\n\nFlight levels are usually designated in writing as ''FLxxx'', where ''xxx'' is a two- or three-digit number indicating the pressure altitude in units of {{convert|100|ft|m}}. In radio communications, FL290 would be pronounced as \"flight level two nine(r) zero.\"\n\n==Transition altitude==\nWhile use of a standardised pressure setting facilitates separation of aircraft from each other, it does not provide the aircraft's actual height above ground. At low altitudes, the altimeter is commonly set to show the altitude above sea-level, which can be directly compared to the known [[elevation]] of the terrain. The pressure setting to achieve this varies with weather conditions. It is called [[QNH]] (\"barometric pressure adjusted to sea level\") or \"[[altimeter setting]]\" and the current local value is available from various sources, including [[air traffic control]] and the local [[METAR]]-issuing station.\n\nThe '''transition altitude''' (TA) is the altitude above sea level at which aircraft change from the use of local barometer derived altitudes to the use of flight levels. When operating at or below the TA, aircraft altimeters are usually set to show the altitude above sea level.<ref name=\"CAP410\">{{cite web | title=CAP 410 Manual of Flight Information Services | publisher=UK Civil Aviation Authority | id=CAP410 | url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP410PtA.pdf | accessdate=25 February 2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Above the TA, the aircraft altimeter pressure setting is normally adjusted to the standard pressure setting of 1013.25 [[pascal (unit)|hectopascals]] (which is equivalent to millibars) or 29.92 [[inches of mercury]] and aircraft altitude will be expressed as a flight level.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the transition altitude is {{convert|18000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In Europe, the transition altitude varies and can be as low as {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. There are discussions to standardize the transition altitude within the [[Eurocontrol]] area.<ref>{{cite web | title=A Common European Transition Altitude; An ATC perspective | publisher=Eurocontrol | url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/content/documents/nm/airspace/airspace-atmprocedures-cta-atc-perspective.pdf | accessdate=3 April 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926112255/http://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/content/documents/nm/airspace/airspace-atmprocedures-cta-atc-perspective.pdf | archivedate=26 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 25 November 2004 the [[Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand]] raised New Zealand's transition altitude from {{convert|11000 to 13,000|ft|m}} and changed the transition level from FL130 to FL150.<ref>{{cite web | title=Part 91, Amendment 12 | publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand]] | url=http://www.caa.govt.nz/rules/Amendments/Part_091_040705_Amendment_11.pdf | accessdate=4 February 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306222005/https://www.caa.govt.nz/rules/Amendments/Part_091_040705_Amendment_11.pdf | archive-date=6 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe '''transition level''' is the lowest flight level above the transition altitude. The table below shows the transition level according to transition altitude and QNH. When descending below the transition level, the pilot starts to refer to altitude of the aircraft by setting the altimeter to the [[QNH]] for the region or airfield.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\"\n|+ Table for determining transition level{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n|-\n!rowspan=2| [[QNH]]<br>(in hectopascals) !! colspan=5 | Transition altitude (in feet)\n|-\n! 3,000 !! 4,000 !! 5,000 !! 6,000 !! 18,000\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1032\u20131050 || FL25 || FL35 || FL45 || FL55 || FL175\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1014\u20131031 || FL30 || FL40 || FL50 || FL60 || FL180\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 996\u20131013 || FL35 || FL45 || FL55 || FL65 || FL185\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 978\u2013995 || FL40 || FL50 || FL60 || FL70 || FL190\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 960\u2013977 || FL45 || FL55 || FL65 || FL75 || FL195\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 943\u2013959 || FL50 || FL60 || FL70 || FL80 || FL200\n|-\n|}\n\nThe '''transition layer''' is the airspace between the [[transition altitude]] and the [[transition level]].\n\nAccording to these definitions the transition layer is {{convert|0\u2013500|ft|m}} thick. Aircraft are not normally assigned to fly at the \"'transition level'\" as this would provide inadequate separation from traffic flying on QNH at the transition altitude. Instead, the lowest usable \"'flight level'\" is the transition level plus 500&nbsp;ft.\n\nHowever, in some countries, such as [[Norway]] for example,{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} the transition level is determined by adding a buffer of minimum {{cvt|1000|ft|m}} (depending on QNH) to the transition altitude. Therefore, aircraft may be flying at both transition level and transition altitude, and still be vertically separated by at least {{cvt|1000|ft|m}}. In those areas the transition layer will be {{cvt|1000|-|1500|ft|m}} thick, depending on QNH.\n\nIn summary, the connection between \"transition altitude\" (TA), \"transition layer\" (TLYR), and \"transition level\" (TL) is\n\nTL = TA + TLYR\n\n==Semicircular/hemispheric rule==\nThe ''semicircular rule'' (also known as the ''hemispheric rule'') applies, in slightly different version, to IFR flights in the UK inside controlled airspace and generally in the rest of the world.\nThe standard rule defines an East/West track split:\n\n* Eastbound \u2013 Magnetic track 000 to 179\u00b0 \u2013 odd thousands (FL 250, 270, etc.)\n* Westbound \u2013 Magnetic track 180 to 359\u00b0 \u2013 even thousands (FL 260, 280, etc.)\n\nAt FL 290 and above, if [[Reduced Vertical Separation Minima]] are not in use, 4,000&nbsp;ft intervals are used to separate same-direction aircraft (instead of 2,000&nbsp;ft intervals below FL 290), and only odd flight levels are assigned, independent of the direction of flight:\n* Eastbound \u2013 Magnetic track 000 to 179\u00b0 \u2013 odd flight levels (FL 290, 330, 370, etc.)\n* Westbound \u2013 Magnetic track 180 to 359\u00b0 \u2013 odd flight levels (FL 310, 350, 390, etc.)\n\nCountries where the major airways are oriented north/south (e.g., New Zealand; Italy; Portugal; France) have semicircular rules that define a North/South rather than an East/West track split.\n\nIn Italy, France, Portugal and recently also in Spain (AIP ENR 1.7-3), for example, southbound traffic uses odd flight levels; in New Zealand, southbound traffic uses even flight levels.\nIn Europe commonly used [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) separation levels are as per the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Vertical separation of [[visual flight rules|VFR]] and [[instrument flight rules|IFR]] flights{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" | Magnetic route figure of merit (FOM)\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 0\u00b0 to 179\u00b0 !! colspan=\"4\" | 180\u00b0 to 359\u00b0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | VFR !! colspan=\"2\" | IFR !! colspan=\"2\" | VFR !! colspan=\"2\" | IFR\n|-\n!

This allows aircraft to safely fly more optimum routes, gain fuel savings and increase airspace capacity by adding new flight levels. Only aircraft that have been certified to meet RVSM standards, with several exclusions, are allowed to fly in RVSM airspace. It was introduced into the UK in March 2001. On 20 January 2002, it entered European airspace.

The air pressure is computed assuming an [[International Standard Atmosphere]] pressure of 1013.25&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] (29.92&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) at [[sea level]], and therefore is not necessarily the same as the aircraft's actual altitude, either above sea level or [[height above ground level|above ground level]].\n\n==Background==\nFlight levels are used to ensure safe vertical separation between aircraft, despite natural local variations in atmospheric [[air pressure]]. Historically, altitude has been measured using a pressure [[altimeter]], which is essentially a calibrated [[barometer]]. An altimeter measures ambient air pressure, which decreases with increasing altitude following the [[barometric formula]]. It then calculates and displays the corresponding altitude. If different aircraft's altimeters were not calibrated consistently, then two aircraft could be flying at the same altitude even though their altimeters appeared to show that they were at different altitudes.<ref>See also [http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Level_Bust Level Bust] for related causes and consequences</ref> Flight levels solve this problem by defining altitudes based on a standard air pressure at sea-level. All aircraft operating on flight levels calibrate to this setting regardless of the actual sea level pressure.\n\nTo display true altitude above sea level, a pilot would need to calibrate the altimeter according to the local air pressure at sea level, to take into account natural variation of pressure over time and in different regions.\n\n== Definition ==\nFlight levels<ref>{{cite book|url = https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/pcg_basic_chgs%201_2_9-13-18.pdf|title=Aeronautical Information Manual|author=Federal Aviation Administration | author-link=Federal Aviation Administration| chapter = Pilot/Controller Glossary | page = PCG F\u22123| date= 29 March 2018| access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref> are described by a number, which is the nominal altitude, or [[pressure altitude]], in hundreds of feet, while being a multiple of 500&nbsp;ft, therefore always ending in 0 or 5. Therefore, a pressure altitude of {{cvt|32000|ft|m}} is referred to as \"flight level 320\".\n\nFlight levels are usually designated in writing as ''FLxxx'', where ''xxx'' is a two- or three-digit number indicating the pressure altitude in units of {{convert|100|ft|m}}. In radio communications, FL290 would be pronounced as \"flight level two nine(r) zero.\"\n\n==Transition altitude==\nWhile use of a standardised pressure setting facilitates separation of aircraft from each other, it does not provide the aircraft's actual height above ground. At low altitudes, the altimeter is commonly set to show the altitude above sea-level, which can be directly compared to the known [[elevation]] of the terrain. The pressure setting to achieve this varies with weather conditions. It is called [[QNH]] (\"barometric pressure adjusted to sea level\") or \"[[altimeter setting]]\" and the current local value is available from various sources, including [[air traffic control]] and the local [[METAR]]-issuing station.\n\nThe '''transition altitude''' (TA) is the altitude above sea level at which aircraft change from the use of local barometer derived altitudes to the use of flight levels. When operating at or below the TA, aircraft altimeters are usually set to show the altitude above sea level.<ref name=\"CAP410\">{{cite web | title=CAP 410 Manual of Flight Information Services | publisher=UK Civil Aviation Authority | id=CAP410 | url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP410PtA.pdf | accessdate=25 February 2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Above the TA, the aircraft altimeter pressure setting is normally adjusted to the standard pressure setting of 1013.25 [[pascal (unit)|hectopascals]] (which is equivalent to millibars) or 29.92 [[inches of mercury]] and aircraft altitude will be expressed as a flight level.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the transition altitude is {{convert|18000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In Europe, the transition altitude varies and can be as low as {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. There are discussions to standardize the transition altitude within the [[Eurocontrol]] area.<ref>{{cite web | title=A Common European Transition Altitude; An ATC perspective | publisher=Eurocontrol | url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/content/documents/nm/airspace/airspace-atmprocedures-cta-atc-perspective.pdf | accessdate=3 April 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926112255/http://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/content/documents/nm/airspace/airspace-atmprocedures-cta-atc-perspective.pdf | archivedate=26 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 25 November 2004 the [[Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand]] raised New Zealand's transition altitude from {{convert|11000 to 13,000|ft|m}} and changed the transition level from FL130 to FL150.<ref>{{cite web | title=Part 91, Amendment 12 | publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand]] | url=http://www.caa.govt.nz/rules/Amendments/Part_091_040705_Amendment_11.pdf | accessdate=4 February 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306222005/https://www.caa.govt.nz/rules/Amendments/Part_091_040705_Amendment_11.pdf | archive-date=6 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe '''transition level''' is the lowest flight level above the transition altitude. The table below shows the transition level according to transition altitude and QNH. When descending below the transition level, the pilot starts to refer to altitude of the aircraft by setting the altimeter to the [[QNH]] for the region or airfield.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\"\n|+ Table for determining transition level{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n|-\n!rowspan=2| [[QNH]]<br>(in hectopascals) !! colspan=5 | Transition altitude (in feet)\n|-\n! 3,000 !! 4,000 !! 5,000 !! 6,000 !! 18,000\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1032\u20131050 || FL25 || FL35 || FL45 || FL55 || FL175\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1014\u20131031 || FL30 || FL40 || FL50 || FL60 || FL180\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 996\u20131013 || FL35 || FL45 || FL55 || FL65 || FL185\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 978\u2013995 || FL40 || FL50 || FL60 || FL70 || FL190\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 960\u2013977 || FL45 || FL55 || FL65 || FL75 || FL195\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 943\u2013959 || FL50 || FL60 || FL70 || FL80 || FL200\n|-\n|}\n\nThe '''transition layer''' is the airspace between the [[transition altitude]] and the [[transition level]].\n\nAccording to these definitions the transition layer is {{convert|0\u2013500|ft|m}} thick. Aircraft are not normally assigned to fly at the \"'transition level'\" as this would provide inadequate separation from traffic flying on QNH at the transition altitude. Instead, the lowest usable \"'flight level'\" is the transition level plus 500&nbsp;ft.\n\nHowever, in some countries, such as [[Norway]] for example,{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} the transition level is determined by adding a buffer of minimum {{cvt|1000|ft|m}} (depending on QNH) to the transition altitude. Therefore, aircraft may be flying at both transition level and transition altitude, and still be vertically separated by at least {{cvt|1000|ft|m}}. In those areas the transition layer will be {{cvt|1000|-|1500|ft|m}} thick, depending on QNH.\n\nIn summary, the connection between \"transition altitude\" (TA), \"transition layer\" (TLYR), and \"transition level\" (TL) is\n\nTL = TA + TLYR\n\n==Semicircular/hemispheric rule==\nThe ''semicircular rule'' (also known as the ''hemispheric rule'') applies, in slightly different version, to IFR flights in the UK inside controlled airspace and generally in the rest of the world.\nThe standard rule defines an East/West track split:\n\n* Eastbound \u2013 Magnetic track 000 to 179\u00b0 \u2013 odd thousands (FL 250, 270, etc.)\n* Westbound \u2013 Magnetic track 180 to 359\u00b0 \u2013 even thousands (FL 260, 280, etc.)\n\nAt FL 290 and above, if [[Reduced Vertical Separation Minima]] are not in use, 4,000&nbsp;ft intervals are used to separate same-direction aircraft (instead of 2,000&nbsp;ft intervals below FL 290), and only odd flight levels are assigned, independent of the direction of flight:\n* Eastbound \u2013 Magnetic track 000 to 179\u00b0 \u2013 odd flight levels (FL 290, 330, 370, etc.)\n* Westbound \u2013 Magnetic track 180 to 359\u00b0 \u2013 odd flight levels (FL 310, 350, 390, etc.)\n\nCountries where the major airways are oriented north/south (e.g., New Zealand; Italy; Portugal; France) have semicircular rules that define a North/South rather than an East/West track split.\n\nIn Italy, France, Portugal and recently also in Spain (AIP ENR 1.7-3), for example, southbound traffic uses odd flight levels; in New Zealand, southbound traffic uses even flight levels.\nIn Europe commonly used [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) separation levels are as per the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Vertical separation of [[visual flight rules|VFR]] and [[instrument flight rules|IFR]] flights{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" | Magnetic route figure of merit (FOM)\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 0\u00b0 to 179\u00b0 !! colspan=\"4\" | 180\u00b0 to 359\u00b0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | VFR !! colspan=\"2\" | IFR !! colspan=\"2\" | VFR !! colspan=\"2\" | IFR\n|-\n!

Making false claims, even if in language not intended to be advertising, in advergames can result in penalties and fines by the national or regional [[consumer protection]] agencies. In a notable case, the [[Gatorade]] company, a subsidiary of [[PepsiCo]], had published a free mobile game ''Bolt!'' which featured [[Usain Bolt]] and challenged the player to \"keep your performance high by avoiding water\". The state of California asserted this claim was false, as Gatorade had been shown to be more harmful to the human body than water, and with the game targeted to youth, send the wrong message. The state sued Gatorade, and the case was ultimately settled with Gatorade paying a {{USD|300,000}} fine to the state, part of which the state used to promote health-conscious water-drinking habits for children.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/09/21/gatorade-pay-california-water-usain-bolt-advergame/ | title = Gatorade To Pay California $300K Over Anti-Water Usain Bolt 'Advergame' | date = September 21, 2017 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[KPIX]] }}</ref>\n\n===National regulations and oversight===\nIn the United States, attempts have been made by the [[United States Congress]] to give the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) authority to oversee online advertising aimed at children, including advergames, but had been challenged by lobbies representing the food industry and effectively shut down such attempts.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/business/media/24food.html | title = Ad Rules Stall, Keeping Cereal a Cartoon Staple | first = Willie | last = Neuman | date = July 23, 2010 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> Nevertheless, the propagation of online games and advertising aimed at children led to passage of the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA) in 2000, which set strict standards for what type of private information websites could collect from minors, with the FTC overseeing any such fines.<ref name=\"kff 2006\"/>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, advergames regulation was brought into coverage by the [[CAP Code]] or the Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing in 2016. The CAP code, updated frequently, provides specific guidance on what advergames (among other types of advertising) can and cannot do, with specific attention to how such games may influence children. CAP code violations are monitored and penalized by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/25/food-firms-may-face-litigation-over-neuromarketing-to-hijack-brains | title = Food firms could face litigation over neuromarketing to hijack brains | first = Sarah | last =Bosely | date = May 25, 2018 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref>\n\n==Other concerns==\nMessaging in advergames may backfire and impact the reputation of the brand the game promotes. A notable example from [[Intel]], which had published in 2004 ''The Intel IT Manager Game'', a browser-based game that attempted to give insight into the job opportunities of an [[information technology]] manager, including simulating the hires of new employees. However, the game only allowed male employees to be higher by design, and Intel received criticism for discounting female hires. The game was taken offline and later replaced with a new version that had equal gender representation. While the situation could be compared to a similar problem around the game ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'' which also forced players to male avatars, the real-world setting of Intel's game was seen as a more serious flaw, and at the time, gender representation in the information technology industry was a serious concern.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/103388/SGS_Feature_When_Advergaming_Backfires.php | title = SGS Feature: 'When Advergaming Backfires' | first = Jason | last = Dobson | date = January 18, 2007 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Video game genre}}\n\n[[Category:Advergames| ]]\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n", "text_old": "An '''advergame''' is a form of [[advertising in video games]], in which the video game is developed by or in close collaboration with a corporate entity for purposes of advertising a brand-name product.

In a notable case, the [[Gatorade]] company, a subsidary of [[PepsiCo]], had published a free mobile game ''Bolt!'' which featured [[Usain Bolt]] and challenged the player to \"keep your performance high by avoiding water\". The state of California asserted this claim was false, as Gatorade had been shown to be more harmful to the human body than water, and with the game targeted to youth, send the wrong message. The state sued Gatorade, and the case was ultimately settled with Gatorade paying a {{USD|300,000}} fine to the state, part of which the state used to promote health-conscious water-drinking habits for children.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/09/21/gatorade-pay-california-water-usain-bolt-advergame/ | title = Gatorade To Pay California $300K Over Anti-Water Usain Bolt 'Advergame' | date = September 21, 2017 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[KPIX]] }}</ref>\n\n===National regulations and oversight===\nIn the United States, attempts have been made by the [[United States Congress]] to give the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) authority to oversee online advertising aimed at children, including advergames, but had been challenged by lobbies representing the food industry and effectively shut down such attempts.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/business/media/24food.html | title = Ad Rules Stall, Keeping Cereal a Cartoon Staple | first = Willie | last = Neuman | date = July 23, 2010 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> Nevertheless, the propagation of online games and advertising aimed at children led to passage of the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA) in 2000, which set strict standards for what type of private information websites could collect from minors, with the FTC overseeing any such fines.<ref name=\"kff 2006\"/>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, advergames regulation was brought into coverage by the [[CAP Code]] or the Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing in 2016. The CAP code, updated frequently, provides specific guidance on what advergames (among other types of advertising) can and cannot do, with specific attention to how such games may influence children. CAP code violations are monitored and penalized by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/25/food-firms-may-face-litigation-over-neuromarketing-to-hijack-brains | title = Food firms could face litigation over neuromarketing to hijack brains | first = Sarah | last =Bosely | date = May 25, 2018 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref>\n\n==Other concerns==\nMessaging in advergames may backfire and impact the reputation of the brand the game promotes. A notable example from [[Intel]], which had published in 2004 ''The Intel IT Manager Game'', a browser-based game that attempted to give insight into the job opportunities of an [[information technology]] manager, including simulating the hires of new employees. However, the game only allowed male employees to be higher by design, and Intel received criticism for discounting female hires. The game was taken offline and later replaced with a new version that had equal gender representation. While the situation could be compared to a similar problem around the game ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'' which also forced players to male avatars, the real-world setting of Intel's game was seen as a more serious flaw, and at the time, gender represention in the information technology industry was a serious concern.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/103388/SGS_Feature_When_Advergaming_Backfires.php | title = SGS Feature: 'When Advergaming Backfires' | first = Jason | last = Dobson | date = January 18, 2007 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Video game genre}}\n\n[[Category:Advergames| ]]\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: represention \u2192 representation, subsidary \u2192 subsidiary", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advergame"}

Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity.

During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand were unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the earlier strong, but now falling apart walls, were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under the uncle of his father, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards''', ed. Chase F. Robinson, (Brill, 2003), 46.</ref>\n\nRight when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen the news of the re-capture of Bukhara arrived to Abu Ali Chaghani, he once again marched towards Bukhara, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensured between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387/997 with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription,<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested for and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was in the start given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), while it was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could in the Samanid state rise to high offices, which would sometimes result the Turkic slaves usurp power, almost making the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

Daniel pg. 74\"/> Islamic architecture and Islamo-Persian culture was spread deep into the heart of Central Asia by the Samanids. Following the first complete translation of the [[Qur'an]] into Persian, during the 9th century, populations under the Samanid empire began accepting Islam in significant numbers.<ref>Michael Dillon, ''Xinjiang: China's Muslim far Northwest'', (RoutledgeCurzon, 2004), 11.</ref>\n\nThrough zealous missionary work as many as 30,000 tents of [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] came to profess Islam and later under the Ghaznavids more than 55,000 under  the [[Hanafi]] school of thought. The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the [[Ghaznavids]], who would later rule the region.\n\nAgriculture and trading were the economic basis of Samanid State. The Samanids were heavily involved in trading&nbsp;\u2013 even with Europe, as thousands of Samanid coins that have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavian countries testify.<ref>History of Bukhara, By Narshakhi trans. Richard N. Frye, pg. 143</ref>\n\nAnother lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written.  The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners.\n\n===Scholarship===\n\n====Avicenna and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni====\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:The Sasanian King Khusraw and Courtiers in a Garden, Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdawsi, late 15th-early 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] and his courtiers in a garden'', page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh]], late 15th-early 16th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, there was a large amount of growth in literature, mostly in poetry. It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxania and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most favorable language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Only less than 2,000 of his poetry lines have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse forms of medieval Persian poetry; mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions were taken in special interest, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age, was Ferdowsi\u2014he was born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it was by the Samanids.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Population===\nUnder the Samanid Empire, the [[Zarafshan]] valley, [[Qashqadaryo Region|Kashka Darya]] and [[Usrushana]] were populated by [[Sogdia]]ns; [[Tukharistan]] by the Bactrians; [[Khwarezm]] by the Khwarazmians; the [[Fergana Valley|Ferghana valley]] by the Ferghanans; southern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by Khorasanians; and the [[Pamir mountains]] and its surroundings by the [[Saka]] and other early Iranian peoples.

Scholars, poets, artists and other men of education from many Muslim countries assembled in the Samanid capital of Bukhara, where a rich soil was created for the prosper of creative thought, thus making it one of the most distinguished cultural centres of the Eastern world.

If the bowl is looked at closely there are cracks and marks that have occurred over time. What would once have been a white bowl is now stained yellow in some areas. The calligraphy looks well thought out and planned. Each letter is well spaced, and the whole saying fits perfectly around the bowl.

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]].

He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him Baghdad, where he was executed.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Furthermore, he also received the investiture over [[Tabaristan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}}\n\nBefore his major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand were unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the earlier strong, but now falling apart walls, were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under the uncle of his father, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards''', ed. Chase F. Robinson, (Brill, 2003), 46.</ref>\n\nRight when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen the news of the re-capture of Bukhara arrived to Abu Ali Chaghani, he once again marched towards Bukhara, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensured between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387/997 with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription,<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested for and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was in the start given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), while it was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could in the Samanid state rise to high offices, which would sometimes result the Turkic slaves usurp power, almost making the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the [[Ghaznavids]], who would later rule the region.\n\nAgriculture and trading were the economic basis of Samanid State. The Samanids were heavily involved in trading&nbsp;\u2013 even with Europe, as thousands of Samanid coins that have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavian countries testify.<ref>History of Bukhara, By Narshakhi trans. Richard N. Frye, pg. 143</ref>\n\nAnother lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written.  The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners.\n\n===Scholarship===\n\n====Avicenna and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni====\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:The Sasanian King Khusraw and Courtiers in a Garden, Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdawsi, late 15th-early 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] and his courtiers in a garden'', page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh]], late 15th-early 16th century.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxania and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most favorable language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Only less than 2,000 of his poetry lines have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse forms of medieval Persian poetry; mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions were taken in special interest, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age, was Ferdowsi\u2014he was born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud.
