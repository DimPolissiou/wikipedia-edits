Each player's clock stops as soon as they press a button to select an answer. If both are correct, a new question is asked. If one player misses, they are asked \"time-waster\" questions that involve word puzzles or mathematical calculations, with their clock running until they give a correct answer.\n\nIf both players miss the same three-choice question, a time-waster is asked as a toss-up and both clocks stop as soon as either of them buzzes-in. A correct response forces the opponent to answer a new time-waster, but a miss requires that player to do so instead.

A correct answer stops the player's clock and passes control to the opponent. When one player runs out of time, the opponent wins the match and banks any time remaining on their own clock.\n\nThe champion is then shown the next contestant in line and given some biographical information about that person.

A champion who loses a match must leave the show.\n\n===Bonus Round===\nThe champion selects one of three trips that they would like to try to win.
