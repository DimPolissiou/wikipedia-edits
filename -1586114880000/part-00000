One of the [[list of coastal weather stations of the United Kingdom|UK's coastal weather stations]] is situated there.\n\n==History==\nLerwick is a name with roots in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] and its local descendant, [[Norn language|Norn]], which was spoken in Shetland until the mid-19th century. The name \"Lerwick\" means ''bay of clay''. The corresponding Norwegian name is {{lang|no|Leirvik}}, {{wikt-lang|no|leir}} meaning [[clay]] and {{wikt-lang|no|vik}} meaning \"bay\" or \"inlet\". Towns with similar names exist in southwestern Norway ({{lang|no|[[Leirvik]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|no|[[Lervik]]|italic=no}}) and on the Faroe Islands ({{lang|fo|[[Leirv\u00edk]]|italic=no}}).\n\nEvidence of human settlement in the Lerwick area dates back 3,000 years, centred on the [[Broch of Clickimin]], which was constructed in the first century BC. The first settlement to be known as Lerwick was founded in the 17th century as a [[herring]] and [[white fish (fisheries term)|white fish]] seaport to trade with the Dutch fishing fleet. This settlement was on the mainland (west) side of Bressay Sound, a natural harbour with south and north entrances between the Shetland mainland and the island of [[Bressay]]. Its collection of wooden huts was burned to the ground twice: once in the 17th century by the residents of [[Scalloway]] on the western side of Mainland, then the capital of Shetland, who disapproved of the immoral and drunken activities of the assembled fishermen and sailors; and again in 1702 by the French fleet.\n\n[[Fort Charlotte, Shetland|Fort Charlotte]] was built in the mid 17th century on Lerwick's waterfront, and permanent stone-built buildings began to be erected around the fort and along the shoreline. The principal concentration of buildings was in the \"lanes\" area: a steep hillside stretching from the shoreline to Hillhead at the top. Lerwick became capital of the Shetland Islands in 1708, taking over the function from Scalloway. The [[civil parishes in Scotland|civil parish]] of Lerwick had been in 1701 created from a small part of the parish of [[Tingwall, Shetland|Tingwall]], to which Scalloway still belongs. When Lerwick became more prosperous through sea trade and the fishing industry during the 19th century, the town expanded in 1891 to the west of Hillhead, thereby including the former civil parishes of [[Gulberwick]] and [[Quarff]], as well as the islands parish of [[Burra, Shetland|Burra]]. [[Lerwick Town Hall]] was built during this period of expansion.\n\nLerwick war memorial dates from 1923 and was designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref> The next period of significant expansion was during the [[North Sea oil]] boom of the 1970s when large housing developments were built to the north of Staney Hill (located in Lerwick) and to the south (Nederdale and Sandveien).\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Lerwick, Shetland, August 2010.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Lerwick in August 2010]]\nLerwick has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') closely bordering on the [[subpolar oceanic climate]] (''Cfc'') with cool to cold temperatures all year long. The lack of trees reflects the latter type. This is particularly pronounced by virtue of Lerwick being on the coast of an island, so even extreme temperature records are subdued; the record high stands at just {{convert|23.4|C|F}} (July 1991) and the record low just {{convert|-8.9|C|F}} (January 1952 and January 1959). Lerwick is also a very cloudy town, averaging only 1,110 sunshine hours annually. February is the coldest month, with high temperatures averaging around {{convert|5.5|C|F}}. In August, the warmest month, average high temperatures are near {{convert|14.5|C|F}}. This produces an extremely narrow difference for an area north of the [[60th parallel north|60 parallel]]. In terms of average monthly precipitation, October to January are the year's wettest months, with over 5.5 inches of precipitation each month; May and June are the driest months, with average monthly precipitation less than 2.3 inches each.  Snowfall can occur, primarily from December to March, but snow accumulation is rarely heavy and usually short-lived.  The exposed North Atlantic location and proximity to autumn and winter storm tracks means high winds are a regular occurrence, alongside high levels of cloudiness and precipitation.  The weather station is at an elevation of {{convert|82|m|ft}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gfxnj5fx4|title=Lerwick climate information|publisher=Lerwick climate information|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> so temperatures are likely to be slightly milder in the town centre at sea level.\n\nOwing to its northerly location, winter months are extremely dark in Lerwick. On the day of the winter solstice it gets only 5 hours and 49 minutes of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunrise-and-sunset.com/en/sun/united-kingdom/lerwick/2015/december|title=Lerwick sunrise and sunset - December|publisher=Sunrise and Sunset|accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> In sharp contrast daylight lasts 18 hours and 55 minutes on the day of the summer solstice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunrise-and-sunset.com/en/sun/united-kingdom/lerwick/2015/june|title=Sunrise and sunset for Lerwick - June|publisher=Sunrise and Sunset|accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> As a result, nights never get completely dark for a period of time in summer, with dark blue elements remaining in the sky. The maritime influence tempers the climate effects of these swings in daylight, but in many areas of the world this latitude has hostile winters. Farther north in the world, only the [[Faroe Islands]] have such high January averages as Lerwick and fellow Shetland station at [[Baltasound]] \u2013 with the warm Atlantic currents preventing ice formation. Only when temperatures in continental areas are record cold does Lerwick experience some cold as was the case in December 2010 during the severe cold wave affecting the [[Winter of 2010\u201311 in Great Britain and Ireland|British Isles]] and [[Winter of 2010\u201311 in Europe|Europe]] that covered much of England in snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/stationdata/lerwickdata.txt|title=Met Office Station Data for Lerwick|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> Even so, average highs remained above {{convert|3|C|F}} and frosts were light.

This serial is the first appearance of [[Wendy Padbury]] as [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Zoe Heriot]]. Only two of the six episodes are held in the BBC archives; four [[Doctor Who missing episodes|still remain missing]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{plot|date=July 2011}}\n}}\nThe explosion of the mercury fluid link forces the [[Second Doctor]] and [[Jamie McCrimmon|Jamie]] to evacuate the [[TARDIS]] to avoid mercury fumes, and until the mercury can be replaced, the [[spacecraft]] is marooned. They find themselves on a space vessel, deserted apart from a Servo-Robot. The robot detects the intruders and redirects the rocket from aimless wandering. The shock of a course change causes the Doctor to hit his head, concussing him. The robot also releases a group of egg-shaped white pods into space which direct themselves toward a nearby spaceship shaped like a giant wheel, attaching themselves to its exterior. When the robot becomes aggressive, Jamie destroys it, but the Doctor is very weak and collapses.\n\nThe Wheel is an Earth space station observing phenomena in deep space and is staffed with a small international crew. The crew are concerned by the sudden drops in pressure, which, unbeknown to them, coincide with the pods attaching themselves to the exterior of the Wheel. Controller Jarvis Bennett is also worried that the Silver Carrier, a missing supply vessel eighty million miles off course, has suddenly turned up nearby and is not responding to radio contact. He decides to destroy it with the Wheel\u2019s x-ray laser.\n\nJarvis is prevented from doing so when they hear a deafening burst of noise from the vessel. Jamie alerts them to his presence aboard the Carrier and he and the unconscious Doctor are rescued and taken aboard the Wheel. While the resident medic, Dr. Gemma Corwyn, sees to the Doctor, Jamie is given a guided tour by the astrophysicist librarian, [[Zoe Heriot]].\n\nGemma knows that Jamie is lying, so Bennett remains suspicious of the new arrivals, fearing they could be saboteurs opposed to the space program. He decides to use the x-ray laser on the Carrier now that the two refugees have been rescued, not realizing that the TARDIS is still on board, but Jamie sabotages the laser.\n\nMeanwhile, onboard the rocket, two pods similar to the ones which attached themselves to the Wheel draw energy from around it. A three-fingered silver hand punches out of the top of one of them.\n\nJamie's sabotage of the laser infuriates Bennett, especially as there is a potential meteor shower heading for the Wheel and they now have no way to repel it. Jarvis confines Jamie and the Doctor to the sickbay. When the Doctor recovers, he does not approve of Jamie's action. Zoe has calculated that the ship did not drift to their sector but was deliberately piloted there. The Wheel\u2019s crew, however, are more concerned with the impending meteor shower.\n[[File:60s Cyberman (6502028951).jpg|thumb|left|Updated Cyberman helmet, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition]]\nThe two large pods contain [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], who discuss their plans with the Cyberplanner (an immobile unit in control of the Cybermen) over a video communicator. The small pods they sent to the Wheel contained [[Cyberman#Cybermat|Cybermats]] which were sent to begin consuming the bernalium rods in the Wheel\u2019s stores. The bernalium is essential to power the x-ray laser. The Cybermen have engineered the star in [[Messier 13]] to go nova, forcing the Wheel crew to look to their bernalium stores only to find them missing. The Cybermen expect the crewmen will come to the Silver Carrier for an alternate source of bernalium, which can then be transported into the Wheel \u2013 with a surprise inside.\n\nEngineer Bill Duggan has noticed the depleted stocks and the presence of the Cybermats. His delay in reacting allows another crewman, Kemel Rudkin, to fall victim to the Cybermats. Jarvis Bennett overreacts with panic to this state of affairs, stripping Duggan of his position and imposing tighter controls. The Doctor uses the x-ray machine to scan a floor plate which Rudkin had sprayed with quick-setting plastic, revealing a Cybermat. Jarvis sends two crewmen, Laleham and Vallance, to the Silver Carrier to look for bernalium. Once there, the Cybermen reveal themselves and take control of their minds. They then order the crewmen to take them to the Wheel.\n\nLaleham and Vallance are used to prepare the bernalium crates destined for the Wheel with two Cybermen hidden inside. This ruse works, and the crates are ready to board the Wheel. The Doctor and Jamie try to warn Dr. Corwyn and Bennett, but the controller does not accept the danger. Indeed, Dr. Corwyn, who has formed an alliance with the Doctor, fears for Bennett\u2019s mental state.\n\nDuggan and Leo Ryan are glad to have access to a new power supply for the laser, which they are repairing. An engineer is killed by the emerging Cybermen when he is sent to fetch the new bernalium supply. Laleham and Vallance arrive at the laser with the bernalium for Duggan, who falls victim to the same mind control process used earlier. Duggan is sent to destroy communications with the Earth. He smashes the control panel and gets electrocuted to death afterwards.\n\nThe Doctor deduces that the fortuitous supply of bernalium has a deeper significance. Reasoning that Duggan was mind controlled, he instructs Dr. Corwyn to use a basic transistor system attached to each of the crews' necks to repel this technique. In the loading bay, the Doctor and Jamie discover the crate's false bottom, which confirms the presence of the Cybermen aboard the Wheel. Behind them, a Cyberman is coming down the steps.\n\nThe Cyberman leaves with some bernalium, not detecting the Doctor and Jamie. However, they are then ambushed by Cybermats. The crew use a sonic wave to disable the Cybermats. Gemma and Zoe show Jarvis a dead Cybermat, but he refuses to believe that they are under attack. Gemma relieves Jarvis of his command as he's unfit to be the station controller.\n\nThe death of Duggan is no obstacle to the Cybermen as another engineer, Flannigan, is found to replace him. Laleham is killed trying to subdue Flannigan when Vallance misses with a gun. A Cyberman takes control of Flannigan's mind. The Cybermen have invested time in repairing the x-ray laser. When the meteorites are due to hit, they can be deflected and obliterated. The Cybermen want the Wheel intact so they can use its radio beam for their fleet to home in on. They want to invade the Earth, desperate for the planet's mineral wealth.\n\nThe human crew repair the x-ray laser and use it to defend against the incoming meteorites. The Doctor decides that he needs the time vector generator, which he earlier removed from the TARDIS. Jamie and Zoe are chosen for a space-walk to the rocket. Gemma shows them to the airlock but hides in the oxygen room. She overhears Vallance and a Cyberman plotting to poison the air supply and warns the Doctor before she is killed by a Cyberman. Meanwhile, Jamie and Zoe are caught up in the meteor shower.\n\nLeo switches to sectional air supply, meaning that the Cybermen cannot poison their air. Shocked back to consciousness by Gemma's death, the insane Jarvis Bennett is killed when he seeks revenge. Leo assumes control as the Doctor warns there is a vast Cyberman spacecraft heading for the Wheel.\n\nThe Cyberplanner suspects that someone aboard knows of their methods. Vallance identifies everyone on board, and the Cyberplanner recognises the Doctor. The Cyberplanner decides that he must be killed. Jamie and Zoe tune into this conversation aboard the rocket and go back with the time vector generator to warn the Doctor.\n\nThe humans need to contact Earth, but Duggan's suicide mission made this impossible. They need spare parts. Flannigan pretends to be normal and says he will meet up with the Doctor in corridor 6 and give them to him. This is a plan by the Cybermen to ambush the Doctor. The Doctor suspects this and goes through the air tunnels to the power room to fetch them. When the Cybermen don't find him in corridor 6, they order Flannigan to go to the control room and destroy the forcefield.\n\nJamie and Zoe get back, and Flannigan takes them to the control room. He is overwhelmed by Leo and Enrico Casali, the communications officer, and his conditioning is broken. The Doctor is cornered in the powerhouse by the two Cybermen and they reveal their plans to him. When they try to destroy him, he electrocutes one. A large group of Cybermen start spacewalking towards the Wheel. Jamie and Flannigan go to the loading bay and free Vallance from cyber-control. Flannigan uses quick-setting plastic in a fire extinguisher to kill the last Cyberman and then turns on the deflector shield, which deflects the Cybermen into space. The Doctor uses the time vector generator to boost the power of the x-ray laser and destroys the advancing Cybership.\n\nWith the invasion repelled, the Doctor and Jamie return to the Silver Carrier with the mercury they need to repair the TARDIS. They are accompanied by Zoe, who stows away as they depart. She is determined to stay and so, to warn her of the dangers ahead, the Doctor uses a mental device to project images from his mind to the viewscreen, which tell her of his and Jamie's encounter with the [[Dalek]]s in their search for the Dalek Factor.\n\n==Production==\nThe story's working title was ''The Space Wheel''.

This serial is the first appearance of [[Wendy Padbury]] as [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Zoe Heriot]]. Only two of the six episodes are held in the BBC archives; four [[Doctor Who missing episodes|still remain missing]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{plot|date=July 2011}}\n}}\nThe explosion of the mercury fluid link forces the [[Second Doctor]] and [[Jamie McCrimmon|Jamie]] to evacuate the [[TARDIS]] to avoid mercury fumes, and until the mercury can be replaced, the [[spacecraft]] is marooned. They find themselves on a space vessel, deserted apart from a Servo-Robot. The robot detects the intruders and redirects the rocket from aimless wandering. The shock of a course change causes the Doctor to hit his head, concussing him. The robot also releases a group of egg-shaped white pods into space which direct themselves toward a nearby spaceship shaped like a giant wheel, attaching themselves to its exterior. When the robot becomes aggressive, Jamie destroys it, but the Doctor is very weak and collapses.\n\nThe Wheel is an Earth space station observing phenomena in deep space and is staffed with a small international crew. The crew are concerned by the sudden drops in pressure, which, unbeknown to them, coincide with the pods attaching themselves to the exterior of the Wheel. Controller Jarvis Bennett is also worried that the Silver Carrier, a missing supply vessel eighty million miles off course, has suddenly turned up nearby and is not responding to radio contact. He decides to destroy it with the Wheel\u2019s x-ray laser.\n\nJarvis is prevented from doing so when they hear a deafening burst of noise from the vessel. Jamie alerts them to his presence aboard the Carrier and he and the unconscious Doctor are rescued and taken aboard the Wheel. While the resident medic, Dr. Gemma Corwyn, sees to the Doctor, Jamie is given a guided tour by the astrophysicist librarian, [[Zoe Heriot]].\n\nGemma knows that Jamie is lying, so Bennett remains suspicious of the new arrivals, fearing they could be saboteurs opposed to the space program. He decides to use the x-ray laser on the Carrier now that the two refugees have been rescued, not realizing that the TARDIS is still on board, but Jamie sabotages the laser.\n\nMeanwhile, onboard the rocket, two pods similar to the ones which attached themselves to the Wheel draw energy from around it. A three-fingered silver hand punches out of the top of one of them.\n\nJamie's sabotage of the laser infuriates Bennett, especially as there is a potential meteor shower heading for the Wheel and they now have no way to repel it. Jarvis confines Jamie and the Doctor to the sickbay. When the Doctor recovers, he does not approve of Jamie's action. Zoe has calculated that the ship did not drift to their sector but was deliberately piloted there. The Wheel\u2019s crew, however, are more concerned with the impending meteor shower.\n[[File:60s Cyberman (6502028951).jpg|thumb|left|Updated Cyberman helmet, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition]]\nThe two large pods contain [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], who discuss their plans with the Cyberplanner (an immobile unit in control of the Cybermen) over a video communicator. The small pods they sent to the Wheel contained [[Cyberman#Cybermat|Cybermats]] which were sent to begin consuming the bernalium rods in the Wheel\u2019s stores. The bernalium is essential to power the x-ray laser. The Cybermen have engineered the star in [[Messier 13]] to go nova, forcing the Wheel crew to look to their bernalium stores only to find them missing. The Cybermen expect the crewmen will come to the Silver Carrier for an alternate source of bernalium, which can then be transported into the Wheel \u2013 with a surprise inside.\n\nEngineer Bill Duggan has noticed the depleted stocks and the presence of the Cybermats. His delay in reacting allows another crewman, Kemel Rudkin, to fall victim to the Cybermats. Jarvis Bennett overreacts with panic to this state of affairs, stripping Duggan of his position and imposing tighter controls. The Doctor uses the x-ray machine to scan a floor plate which Rudkin had sprayed with quick-setting plastic, revealing a Cybermat. Jarvis sends two crewmen, Laleham and Vallance, to the Silver Carrier to look for bernalium. Once there, the Cybermen reveal themselves and take control of their minds. They then order the crewmen to take them to the Wheel.\n\nLaleham and Vallance are used to prepare the bernalium crates destined for the Wheel with two Cybermen hidden inside. This ruse works, and the crates are ready to board the Wheel. The Doctor and Jamie try to warn Dr. Corwyn and Bennett, but the controller does not accept the danger. Indeed, Dr. Corwyn, who has formed an alliance with the Doctor, fears for Bennett\u2019s mental state.\n\nDuggan and Leo Ryan are glad to have access to a new power supply for the laser, which they are repairing. An engineer is killed by the emerging Cybermen when he is sent to fetch the new bernalium supply. Laleham and Vallance arrive at the laser with the bernalium for Duggan, who falls victim to the same mind control process used earlier. Duggan is sent to destroy communications with the Earth. He smashes the control panel and gets electrocuted to death afterwards.\n\nThe Doctor deduces that the fortuitous supply of bernalium has a deeper significance. Reasoning that Duggan was mind controlled, he instructs Dr. Corwyn to use a basic transistor system attached to each of the crews' necks to repel this technique. In the loading bay, the Doctor and Jamie discover the crate's false bottom, which confirms the presence of the Cybermen aboard the Wheel. Behind them, a Cyberman is coming down the steps.\n\nThe Cyberman leaves with some bernalium, not detecting the Doctor and Jamie. However, they are then ambushed by Cybermats. The crew use a sonic wave to disable the Cybermats. Gemma and Zoe show Jarvis a dead Cybermat, but he refuses to believe that they are under attack. Gemma relieves Jarvis of his command as he's unfit to be the station controller.\n\nThe death of Duggan is no obstacle to the Cybermen as another engineer, Flannigan, is found to replace him. Laleham is killed trying to subdue Flannigan when Vallance misses with a gun. A Cyberman takes control of Flannigan's mind. The Cybermen have invested time in repairing the x-ray laser. When the meteorites are due to hit, they can be deflected and obliterated. The Cybermen want the Wheel intact so they can use its radio beam for their fleet to home in on. They want to invade the Earth, desperate for the planet's mineral wealth.\n\nThe human crew repair the x-ray laser and use it to defend against the incoming meteorites. The Doctor decides that he needs the time vector generator, which he earlier removed from the TARDIS. Jamie and Zoe are chosen for a space-walk to the rocket. Gemma shows them to the airlock but hides in the oxygen room. She overhears Vallance and a Cyberman plotting to poison the air supply and warns the Doctor before she is killed by a Cyberman. Meanwhile, Jamie and Zoe are caught up in the meteor shower.\n\nLeo switches to sectional air supply, meaning that the Cybermen cannot poison their air. Shocked back to consciousness by Gemma's death, the insane Jarvis Bennett is killed when he seeks revenge. Leo assumes control as the Doctor warns there is a vast Cyberman spacecraft heading for the Wheel.\n\nThe Cyberplanner suspects that someone aboard knows of their methods. Vallance identifies everyone on board, and the Cyberplanner recognises the Doctor. The Cyberplanner decides that he must be killed. Jamie and Zoe tune into this conversation aboard the rocket and go back with the time vector generator to warn the Doctor.\n\nThe humans need to contact Earth, but Duggan's suicide mission made this impossible. They need spare parts. Flannigan pretends to be normal and says he will meet up with the Doctor in corridor 6 and give them to him. This is a plan by the Cybermen to ambush the Doctor. The Doctor suspects this and goes through the air tunnels to the power room to fetch them. When the Cybermen don't find him in corridor 6, they order Flannigan to go to the control room and destroy the forcefield.\n\nJamie and Zoe get back, and Flannigan takes them to the control room. He is overwhelmed by Leo and Enrico Casali, the communications officer, and his conditioning is broken. The Doctor is cornered in the powerhouse by the two Cybermen and they reveal their plans to him. When they try to destroy him, he electrocutes one. A large group of Cybermen start spacewalking towards the Wheel. Jamie and Flannigan go to the loading bay and free Vallance from cyber-control. Flannigan uses quick-setting plastic in a fire extinguisher to kill the last Cyberman and then turns on the deflector shield, which deflects the Cybermen into space. The Doctor uses the time vector generator to boost the power of the x-ray laser and destroys the advancing Cybership.\n\nWith the invasion repelled, the Doctor and Jamie return to the Silver Carrier with the mercury they need to repair the TARDIS. They are accompanied by Zoe, who stows away as they depart. She is determined to stay and so, to warn her of the dangers ahead, the Doctor uses a mental device to project images from his mind to the viewscreen, which tell her of his and Jamie's encounter with the [[Dalek]]s in their search for the Dalek Factor.\n\n==Production==\nThe story's working title was ''The Space Wheel''.

On some maps, for example, the town of Leposavic (Serbian) is listed not as Leposaviq, the Albanian equivalent, but as ' Albanik', which translates as 'Albanian'. Located in the far north of Kosovo and close to Serbian borders on three sides, Leposavic/Leposaviq/Albanik has historically been an area of Serbian settlement. The politics surrounding 'Albanik' is only one example of the multitude of ways that conflict between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo continues after the war has passed.}}</ref> Albanik is preferred over Leposaviq in Kosovar governmental documents translated into English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kuvendikosoves.org/common/docs/Strategjia_Minerare_e_R._Kosoves_2012_-_225__Ang.pdf|title=MINING STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO 2012\u20132025 |author=MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT|website=mzhe-ks.net|page=21|}}</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Leposavi\u0107, the municipality includes the following villages:\n{{div col|colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Bare, Leposavi\u0107|Bare]]\n* Belo Brdo\n* Belu\u0107e\n* Berberi\u0161te\n* Bistrica\n* Borova\n* Bor\u010dane\n* Brzance\n* Vitanovi\u0107e\n* Vra\u010devo\n* Vu\u010da\n* Gnje\u017edane\n* Gornji Krnjin\n* Grani\u010dane\n* Grkaje\n* Guvni\u0161te\n* Gulije\n* Desetak\n* Dobrava\n* Donje Isevo\n* Donji Krnjin\n* [[Dren, Leposavi\u0107|Dren]]\n* Duboka\n* Zabr\u0111e\n* Zavrata\n* Zemanica\n* Zrnosek\n* Ibarsko Postenje\n* [[Jarinje]]\n* Jelakce\n* Jo\u0161anica\n* Kajkovo\n* [[Kamenica, Leposavi\u0107|Kamenica]]\n* Kijev\u010di\u0107e\n* Kopori\u0107e\n* Kostin Potok\n* Ko\u0161utica\n* [[Ko\u0161utovo, Leposavi\u0107|Ko\u0161utovo]]\n* Kru\u0161evo\n* Kru\u0161\u010dica\n* Kutnje\n* Lazine\n* [[Le\u0161ak]]\n* Lozno\n* Majdevo\n* Mekini\u0107e\n* Miokovi\u0107e\n* Mioli\u0107e\n* Mo\u0161nica\n* Ostra\u0107e\n* Plakaonica\n* Planinica\n* Popovce\n* Potkomlje\n* Pridvorica\n* Rvatska\n* Rodelj\n* Rucmance\n* Seoce\n* Slatina\n* So\u010danica\n* Tvr\u0111an\n* Trebi\u0107e\n* Trikose\n* \u0106irkovi\u0107e\n* Ulije\n* [[Ceranja]]\n* Crveni\n* Crnatovo\n* [[\u0160aljska Bistrica]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title=Municipal historical population\n| percentages = pagr\n|1948|14949 |1953|17015 |1961|19006 |1971|18044 |1981|16906 |1991|16395 |2011|13773\n|source = [http://pop-stat.mashke.org/kosovo-division.htm Division of Kosovo]\n}}\n\nAccording to the 2011 estimations by the [[Government of Kosovo]], Leposavi\u0107 has 4,193 households and 13,773 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ask.rks-gov.net/media/2129/estimation-of-kosovo-population-2011.pdf|title=ESTIMATION of Kosovo population 2011|website=ask.rks-gov.net|publisher=[[Government of Kosovo]]|accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref> In 2015 report by [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], the population of Leposavi\u0107 municipality stands at 18,600 inhabitants.<ref name=\"est2105osce\">{{cite web|title=Leposavi\u0107|url=http://www.osce.org/kosovo/13120?download=true|website=osce.org|publisher=OSCE|accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref> Municipality of Leposavi\u0107 includes town and 72 villages.\n\n===Ethnic groups===\nThe majority of Leposavi\u0107 municipality is composed of [[Kosovo Serbs]] with around 18,000 inhabitants (96.4%), while 350 [[Bosniaks in Kosovo|Bosniaks]] and 270 [[Kosovo Albanians]] live in the municipality.<ref name=\"est2105osce\"/> Kosovo Albanians live in the three southern villages of Ko\u0161utovo, \u0160aljska Bistrica, and Ceranje.\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality of Leposavi\u0107, including [[Internally displaced person|IDP]]s:<ref name=\"est2105osce\"/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "William Lazonick", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=August 2018}}\n{{BLP primary sources|date=April 2015}}\n}}{{Cleanup rewrite}}\n\n'''William Lazonick''' (born June 8, 1945) is an [[economist]] who studies innovation and competition in the [[global economy]]. \n\nLazonick's research seeks to understand how, on the basis of innovative enterprise, a national economy can achieve stable and equitable economic growth. Lazonick is the originator of \"the theory of innovative enterprise\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}, which, he argues, provides both an essential intellectual foundation for understanding economic performance and a fundamental critique of the neoclassical theory of the market economy. Much of his current work focuses on how the financialization of the U.S. industrial corporation, manifested in massive distributions of corporate cash to [[shareholders]] and the explosion of stock-based executive pay, results in employment instability and [[income inequity]], while undermining the innovative capability of the U.S. economy.\n\nLazonick also conducts cross-national comparative research on the social conditions that enable or proscribe innovative enterprise, focusing in particular on the economies of Britain, Japan, and China as well as the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLazonick was in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] on June 8, 1945. Lazonick was an undergraduate in Commerce and Finance at the [[University of Toronto]], receiving a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1968.  He then attended the [[London School of Economics]], where he was awarded a Master of Science (Economics) degree, with a Mark of Distinction, in 1969. Lazonick spent one year as a graduate student at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]] before entering the PhD program in economics at [[Harvard University]] in 1970. For his doctoral thesis, he studied the applicability of [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of capitalist development to the [[British Industrial Revolution]], the experience that formed the empirical basis for Marx's arguments.<ref>William Lazonick, Marxian Theory and the Development of the Labor Force in England, PhD dissertation, Harvard University, 1975.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Educational Appointments ===\n<ref>Published biographical information on the first three decades of William Lazonick's academic career can be found in Fred Carstensen, \"William Lazonick,\" in Warren J.

In 1980 he was promoted to associate professor of economics. In 1982-83 he was a visiting professor of economics at the [[University of Toronto]]. In 1984-85 Lazonick held the Harvard-Newcomen Fellowship in Business History at [[Harvard Business School]] (HBS) and became an initial member of the HBS \"Business History Group\", working with Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. He remained as a research fellow at HBS in 1985-86 with funding from the German Marshall Fund of the United States and the [[National Science Foundation]].\n\nIn 1985 Lazonick was appointed to a tenured professorship of economics at [[Barnard College]] of [[Columbia University]]. He was also a member of the Graduate Faculty of [[Columbia University]], teaching a PhD course in economic history in the Columbia Economics Department and running a research seminar on national institutions and economic performance with [[Richard R. Nelson]] at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs. In 1989-90, Lazonick was a visiting member in social sciences at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton University]], where [[Albert Hirschman]] was the resident economist.  In 1990-91 Lazonick was president of the Business History Conference, the leading association of business historians in the United States. Also in 1991 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Uppsala University]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/|title=Honorary doctorates|website=Uppsala University, Sweden|first=David|last=Naylor|accessdate=}}</ref> for his work on the theory and history of economic development. In 1992 he was a visiting professor of economics at [[Harvard University]].\n\nIn 1993, after the publication of three books in the three previous years,<ref>William Lazonick, ''Competitive Advantage on the Shop Floor'', Harvard University Press, 1990; William Lazonick, ''Business Organization and the Myth of the Market Economy'', Cambridge University Press, 1991; William Lazonick, ''Organization and Technology in Capitalist Development'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 1992 (in the series, ''Economists of the Twentieth Century'').</ref>  Lazonick made the unusual academic move of leaving a tenured position at an elite private university for a tenured position at a regional public institution, [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].  The lure was the opportunity provided, under the administration of Chancellor William T. Hogan, to build an interdisciplinary graduate program in regional economic and social development at an engineering school that had deep historical roots in local industry and was now in the midst of a leading high-tech district, \"Route 128\".  Over the next 17 years at UMass Lowell, Lazonick participated in the construction of a world-class Master's program in regional development, run by UMass Lowell's Department of Regional Economic and Social Development (RESD), which he co-founded.\n\nFrom 1996-2007 Lazonick was also on the faculty of [[INSEAD]], the international business school in France, where he held an appointment as distinguished research professor.  Additionally, he was a professor of economics at the [[University of Tokyo]] (1996-1997) and a visiting professor at the [[BI Norwegian Business School]] (2002-2005).  In recent years, he has also held visiting positions at the [[University of Bordeaux]] and the [[University of Toulouse]].\n\nAlthough RESD no longer exists,<ref>For the demise of RESD, see www.restoreresd.org. In February 2014 the UMass Lowell administration froze admissions to the RESD program.</ref>  Lazonick remains a professor at UMass Lowell, where he co-directs the Center for Industrial Competitiveness. Lazonick is also visiting professor at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he teaches a PhD course, The Theory of Innovative Enterprise, and at the [[Telecom Business School]], Paris, where he engages in collaborative work on innovation and competition in the global communication technology industries.\n\n=== The Academic-Industry Research Network ===\nIn 2010, Lazonick started a [[501(c)(3) organization]] called the Academic-Industry Research Network, also known as AIRnet, which publishes research from Lazonick and other academics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theairnet.org/v3/about/our-purpose/|title=Our Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=The Academic-Industry Research Network|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-economist-who-put-stock-buybacks-in-washingtons-crosshairs|title=The Economist Who Put Stock Buybacks in Washington\u2019s Crosshairs|last=Kolhatkar|first=Sheelah|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The organization seeks to foster research regarding economic development<ref name=\":0\" />, and ways it can become more sustainable and inclusive.<ref name=\":1\" /> Lazonick appointed himself president of the organization, which evolved from a European Commission project on corporate governance, innovation, and economic performance that Lazonick ran at INSEAD in collaboration with Mary O'Sullivan (now a professor at the [[University of Geneva]]), and subsequent work on innovation and competition in the global communication technology industry with Marie Carpenter (T\u00e9l\u00e9com Ecole de Management, Paris), Henrik Glimstedt ([[Stockholm School of Economics]]), and Edward March (formerly Lucent Technologies, now at [[Dartmouth College]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n==Research==\n\nLazonick's research has focused on the role of the innovative business enterprise in generating [[productivity]] and sharing these gains with employees as the foundation for stable and equitable economic growth. Ranging empirically from the British industrial revolution of the first half of the 19th century to the financialization of the U.S. economy in the early 21st century, Lazonick's work has also included comparative perspectives on innovative enterprise and economic development in Japan and China.<ref>William Lazonick's bio and CV can be found at http://www.theairnet.org/V2/people/lazonick.php.</ref>  Through the study of advanced and emerging economies at various stages of their development, his research has sought to construct a rigorous and relevant theory of economic growth that is grounded in the [[microeconomics]] of the innovative enterprise{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}.\n\n=== Economic Innovation ===\nLazonick has been a leading critic of the neoclassical theory of the market economy that dominates the thinking and teaching of academic economists{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}. Whereas neoclassical economists see well-developed markets as causes of economic prosperity{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}, Lazonick's research shows that organizations that engage in collective and [[cumulative learning]] drive the process of economic development, with well-developed markets in land, labor, finance, and products as outcomes. Indeed, he argues that when these markets gain a preponderant influence in directing the allocation of resources in the economy, they undermine the organizations \u2013 family households, government agencies, and business enterprises \u2013 upon which we depend for the investments in productive capabilities that underpin stable and equitable economic growth.  This perspective on the relation between organizations and markets in determining economic performance provides an analytical framework for formulating policies that support innovative enterprise and regulate hyperactive markets{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}.\n\nLazonick's work on the theory of innovative enterprise builds on the intellectual legacies of [[Karl Marx]], [[Alfred Marshall]], [[Joseph A. Schumpeter]], [[Edith T. Penrose]], and Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.  In 2012, with David J. Teece, Lazonick edited the volume ''Management Innovation: Essays in the Spirit of Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. (Oxford University Press)''.  Lazonick is co-organizer of the Edith Penrose Centenary Conference to be held at SOAS, University of London, on November 14\u201315, 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/finance-and-management/research/|title=Financial and Management Studies Research at SOAS University of London|website=www.soas.ac.uk|accessdate=}}</ref>  Currently Lazonick is completing a book, ''The Theory of Innovative Enterprise'', to be published by Oxford University Press, in which he lays out his theoretical framework and explains how, making use of it, business decision-makers can build innovative companies and government policy-makers can support prosperous economies.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, with funding from the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, Lazonick did an in-depth study of the transformation from innovation to financialization in the information-and-communication technology industries in the context of the rise to dominance in the United States of the \"New Economy business model\" emanating from Silicon Valley.  His book ''Sustainable Prosperity in the New Economy? Business Organization and High-Tech Employment in the United States'' (Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, 2009) won the 2010 Schumpeter Prize, awarded by the International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society. In this book, Lazonick shows how in the last decades of the 20th century New Economy companies used the speculative stock market to attract finance in the form of venture capital, which could realize returns through a quick IPO on NASDAQ. These New Economy companies also used the speculative stock market to attract labor partially compensated with stock options to engage in innovative product development{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}. When they became profitable, these companies became obsessed with boosting their stock prices through massive stock repurchases{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}. Meanwhile, led by IBM and Hewlett-Packard, Old Economy companies made the transition to the New Economy business model, but in the process severely compromised, and in some cases destroyed, their innovative capabilities{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}.\n\nIn a 2016 working paper for the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]], Lazonick argued that stock-based pay harms investment in a firms productive and innovative capabilities by prioritizing financial investment go to [[Stock buyback|stock buybacks]] instead.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazonick|first=William|date=December 3, 2016|title=The Value-Extracting CEO: How Executive Stock-Based Pay Undermines Investment in Productive Capabilities|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/WP_54-Lazonick-Value-Extracting-CEO-Mod-2017.pdf|journal=Institute for New Economic Thinking Working Papers|volume=54|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Financialization ===\nMuch of Lazonick's research has been devoted to [[Stock buyback|stock buybacks]] and the alleged [[financialization]] of economies. This began during his time at Harvard in the 1980's, where he took note of his colleague [[Michael C. Jensen]], who became a major proponent of mass stock buybacks. Since then, Lazonick has publicly advocated against such buybacks through various research papers and articles, becoming a major voice regarding the matter.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nLazonick began this line of research in the late 1980s, becoming an early critic of the belief that companies should be run to maximize shareholder value.<ref>William Lazonick, \"Financial Commitment and Economic Performance: Ownership and Control in the American Industrial Corporation,\" ''Business and Economic History'', second series, 17, 1988, pp. 115-128; William Lazonick, \"Controlling the Market for Corporate Control: The Historical Significance of Managerial Capitalism,\" ''Industrial and Corporate Change'', 1, 3, 1992, pp. 445-488; William Lazonick, \"Creating and Extracting Value: Corporate Investment Behavior and American Economic Performance,\" in Michael Bernstein and David Adler, eds., ''Understanding American Economic Decline'', Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp. 79-113.</ref> In collaboration with Mary O'Sullivan, he continued this work in the 1990s at STEP Group, a research organization directed by Keith Smith in Oslo, Norway, and in the last half of the 1990s and early 2000s at INSEAD, where he directed the European Commission project Corporate Governance, Innovation, and Economic Performance.<ref>See William Lazonick and Mary O'Sullivan, \"Maximizing Shareholder Value: A New Ideology for Corporate Governance,\" ''Economy and Society'', 29, 1, 2000, pp. 13-35; William Lazonick and Mary O'Sullivan, ''Corporate Governance, Innovation, and Economic Performance in the EU: Final Report'', co-authored with Mary O'Sullivan, Targeted Socio-Economic Research (TSER) Report to the European Commission (DGXII) under the Fourth Framework Programme, European Commission (Contract no.: SOE1-CT98-1114; Project no: 053), May 2002 (published by EU Socio-Economic Research of the European Commission, December 2004), at ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/citizens/docs/soe1-ct98-1114_21037cgep.pdf.</ref>\n\nOne such article, \"Innovative Business Models and Varieties of Capitalism: Financialization of the U.S. Corporation,\" that compares the United States and Japan, Lazonick aruges that the persistence in the 1990s and 2000s of the Japanese institutions of stable shareholding, permanent employment, and main-bank lending, even in diminished form, imparted employment stability and income equity to the Japanese economy.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Lazonick|first=William|date=2010|title=Innovative Business Models and Varieties of Capitalism: Financialization of the U.S. Corporation|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0007680500001987|journal=Business History Review|volume=84|pages=675\u2013702|via=}}</ref>  Lazonick argues that while what he calls the \"New-Economy Model\" historically enabled rapid product development, the financialization of such model undermined the innovative capability of U.S. industrial enterprises, and contributed to employment instability and income inequity in the United States.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOver the past several years, with funding from the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]], Lazonick has elaborated his thesis that the financialized U.S. corporation is substantially responsible for employment instability and income inequity in the U.S. economy{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.  He argues that since the 1980s, three structural changes in employment\u2014one related to plant closings, the second to the end of the norm of a career with one company, and the last to offshoring of employment to low-wage nations\u2014have eroded the availability of middle-class jobs in the U.S. economy{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Initially these changes in employment were corporate reactions to changes in externally imposed industrial conditions{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}.  Subsequently, however, many major U.S. corporations have implemented these employment practices purely for financial gain{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}.  The increased profits have been distributed to shareholders as huge stock repurchases on top of generous dividend payments{{According to whom|date=April 2020}}. Lazonick argues that U.S.-style stock-based compensation gives top corporate executives a vested interest in this financialized mode of corporate resource allocation{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.  A full articulation of the thesis that pins poor economic performance on the financialized business enterprise can be found in three of Lazonick's recent papers: \"Taking Stock: How Executive Pay Results in an Unstable and Inequitable Economy,\" Roosevelt Institute White Paper, June 5, 2014; \"Labor in the Twenty-First Century: The Top 0.1 Percent and the Disappearing Middle Class,\" in Christian Weller, ed., ''Financial Market Developments and Labor Relations, Labor and Employment Relations'' Association, forthcoming; and \"Profits Without Prosperity: Stock Buybacks Manipulate the Market and Leave Most Americans Worse Off,\" ''Harvard Business Review'', September 2014 (published August 12, 2014).\n\nIn recent years, this research has made Lazonick a sought-after adviser to various United States politicians.<ref name=\":1\" /> Lazonick advised both [[Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign|Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential Campaign]], and [[Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign|Bernie Sander's 2016 Presidential Campaign]], as well as [[Marco Rubio]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lazonick, William}}\n[[Category:Canadian economists]]\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=August 2018}}\n{{BLP primary sources|date=April 2015}}\n}}\n\n'''William Lazonick''' (born June 8, 1945) is an [[economist]] who studies innovation and competition in the [[global economy]]. \n\nLazonick's research seeks to understand how, on the basis of innovative enterprise, a national economy can achieve stable and equitable economic growth. Lazonick is the originator of \"the theory of innovative enterprise\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}, which, he argues, provides both an essential intellectual foundation for understanding economic performance and a fundamental critique of the neoclassical theory of the market economy. Much of his current work focuses on how the financialization of the U.S. industrial corporation, manifested in massive distributions of corporate cash to [[shareholders]] and the explosion of stock-based executive pay, results in employment instability and [[income inequity]], while undermining the innovative capability of the U.S. economy.\n\nLazonick also conducts cross-national comparative research on the social conditions that enable or proscribe innovative enterprise, focusing in particular on the economies of Britain, Japan, and China as well as the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLazonick was in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] on June 8, 1945. Lazonick was an undergraduate in Commerce and Finance at the [[University of Toronto]], receiving a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1968.  He then attended the [[London School of Economics]], where he was awarded a Master of Science (Economics) degree, with a Mark of Distinction, in 1969. Lazonick spent one year as a graduate student at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]] before entering the PhD program in economics at [[Harvard University]] in 1970. For his doctoral thesis, he studied the applicability of [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of capitalist development to the [[British Industrial Revolution]], the experience that formed the empirical basis for Marx's arguments.<ref>William Lazonick, Marxian Theory and the Development of the Labor Force in England, PhD dissertation, Harvard University, 1975.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Educational Appointments ===\n<ref>Published biographical information on the first three decades of William Lazonick's academic career can be found in Fred Carstensen, \"William Lazonick,\" in Warren J.

In 1980 he was promoted to associate professor of economics. In 1982-83 he was a visiting professor of economics at the [[University of Toronto]]. In 1984-85 Lazonick held the Harvard-Newcomen Fellowship in Business History at [[Harvard Business School]] (HBS) and became an initial member of the HBS \"Business History Group\", working with Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. He remained as a research fellow at HBS in 1985-86 with funding from the German Marshall Fund of the United States and the [[National Science Foundation]].\n\nIn 1985 Lazonick was appointed to a tenured professorship of economics at [[Barnard College]] of [[Columbia University]]. He was also a member of the Graduate Faculty of [[Columbia University]], teaching a PhD course in economic history in the Columbia Economics Department and running a research seminar on national institutions and economic performance with [[Richard R. Nelson]] at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs. In 1989-90, Lazonick was a visiting member in social sciences at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton University]], where [[Albert Hirschman]] was the resident economist.  In 1990-91 Lazonick was president of the Business History Conference, the leading association of business historians in the United States. Also in 1991 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Uppsala University]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/|title=Honorary doctorates|website=Uppsala University, Sweden|first=David|last=Naylor|accessdate=}}</ref> for his work on the theory and history of economic development. In 1992 he was a visiting professor of economics at [[Harvard University]].\n\nIn 1993, after the publication of three books in the three previous years,<ref>William Lazonick, ''Competitive Advantage on the Shop Floor'', Harvard University Press, 1990; William Lazonick, ''Business Organization and the Myth of the Market Economy'', Cambridge University Press, 1991; William Lazonick, ''Organization and Technology in Capitalist Development'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 1992 (in the series, ''Economists of the Twentieth Century'').</ref>  Lazonick made the unusual academic move of leaving a tenured position at an elite private university for a tenured position at a regional public institution, [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].  The lure was the opportunity provided, under the administration of Chancellor William T. Hogan, to build an interdisciplinary graduate program in regional economic and social development at an engineering school that had deep historical roots in local industry and was now in the midst of a leading high-tech district, \"Route 128\".  Over the next 17 years at UMass Lowell, Lazonick participated in the construction of a world-class Master's program in regional development, run by UMass Lowell's Department of Regional Economic and Social Development (RESD), which he co-founded.\n\nFrom 1996-2007 Lazonick was also on the faculty of [[INSEAD]], the international business school in France, where he held an appointment as distinguished research professor.  Additionally, he was a professor of economics at the [[University of Tokyo]] (1996-1997) and a visiting professor at the [[BI Norwegian Business School]] (2002-2005).  In recent years, he has also held visiting positions at the [[University of Bordeaux]] and the [[University of Toulouse]].\n\nAlthough RESD no longer exists,<ref>For the demise of RESD, see www.restoreresd.org. In February 2014 the UMass Lowell administration froze admissions to the RESD program.</ref>  Lazonick remains a professor at UMass Lowell, where he co-directs the Center for Industrial Competitiveness. Lazonick is also visiting professor at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he teaches a PhD course, The Theory of Innovative Enterprise, and at the [[Telecom Business School]], Paris, where he engages in collaborative work on innovation and competition in the global communication technology industries.\n\n=== The Academic-Industry Research Network ===\nIn 2010, Lazonick started a [[501(c)(3) organization]] called the Academic-Industry Research Network, also known as AIRnet, which publishes research from Lazonick and other academics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theairnet.org/v3/about/our-purpose/|title=Our Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=The Academic-Industry Research Network|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-economist-who-put-stock-buybacks-in-washingtons-crosshairs|title=The Economist Who Put Stock Buybacks in Washington\u2019s Crosshairs|last=Kolhatkar|first=Sheelah|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The organization seeks to foster research regarding economic development<ref name=\":0\" />, and ways it can become more sustainable and inclusive.<ref name=\":1\" /> Lazonick appointed himself president of the organization, which evolved from a European Commission project on corporate governance, innovation, and economic performance that Lazonick ran at INSEAD in collaboration with Mary O'Sullivan (now a professor at the [[University of Geneva]]), and subsequent work on innovation and competition in the global communication technology industry with Marie Carpenter (T\u00e9l\u00e9com Ecole de Management, Paris), Henrik Glimstedt ([[Stockholm School of Economics]]), and Edward March (formerly Lucent Technologies, now at [[Dartmouth College]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n==Research==\n\nLazonick's research has focused on the role of the innovative business enterprise in generating [[productivity]] and sharing these gains with employees as the foundation for stable and equitable economic growth.
