A committee from New York purchased {{convert|17|acres|km2 sqmi}} in [[Knox County, Illinois|Knox County]] in 1835, and the first 25 settlers arrived in 1836. They built temporary cabins in Log City near current Lake Storey, just north of Galesburg, having decided that no log cabins were to be built inside the town limits.\n\nGalesburg was home to the first [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] society in Illinois, founded in 1837, and was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knox.edu/x12131.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601171751/http://www.knox.edu/x12131.xml|url-status=dead|title=Underground Freedom Railroad Station|archivedate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> The city was the site of the fifth [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln\u2013Douglas debate]], on a temporary speaker's platform attached to Knox College's \"Old Main\" building on October 7, 1858. Knox College continues to maintain and use Old Main to this day. An Underground Railroad Museum and Lincoln-Douglas Debate Museum were built in Knox College's Alumni Hall after it had finished renovations.\n\nGalesburg was the home of [[Mary Ann Bickerdyke|Mary Ann \"Mother\" Bickerdyke]], who provided hospital care for [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war, Galesburg was the birthplace of poet, author, and historian [[Carl Sandburg]], poet and artist [[Dorothea Tanning]], and former [[Major League Baseball]] star [[Jim Sundberg]]. Sandburg's boyhood home is now operated by the [[Illinois Historic Preservation Agency]] as the [[Carl Sandburg State Historic Site]]. The site contains the cottage he was born in, a modern museum, the rock under which he and his wife Lilian are buried, and a performance venue.\n\nThroughout much of its history, Galesburg has been inextricably tied to the [[railroad]] industry. Local businessmen were major backers of the first railroad to connect Illinois' (then) two biggest cities\u2014[[Chicago]] and [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]\u2014as well as a third leg initially terminating across the [[Mississippi River]] from [[Burlington, Iowa]], eventually connecting to it via bridge and thence onward to the Western frontier. The [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] (CB&Q) sited major rail sorting yards here, including the first to use [[hump yard|hump sorting]]. The CB&Q also built a major [[Galesburg station (Amtrak)#History|depot]] on South Seminary Street which was controversially torn down and replaced by a much smaller [[Galesburg station (Amtrak)|station]] in 1983. The yard is still used by the [[BNSF Railway]].\n\n[[File:BNSF Galesburg.jpg|left|thumb|275px|A BNSF train passes through central Galesburg near the site of the [[Galesburg Station (Santa Fe)|former Santa Fe depot]].]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, when the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] connected its service through to Chicago, it also laid track through Galesburg and built  [[Galesburg Station (Santa Fe)|its own railroad depot]]. This depot remained in operation until the construction of the [[Cameron Connector]] to the southwest of town<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thezephyr.com/archives/santafe.htm |title=Did Galesburg businessmen really need to pay to bring the Santa Fe Railway to Town? |date=June 20, 1996 |author=Rex Cherrington |newspaper=The Zephyr |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717043939/http://www.thezephyr.com/archives/santafe.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> enabled [[Amtrak]] to reroute the ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' onto the Mendota Subdivision and join the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' and ''[[Illinois Zephyr]]'' at the Burlington Northern depot. A series of mergers eventually united both lines under the ownership of [[BNSF Railway]], carrying an average of seven freight trains per hour between them. As of the closing of the [[Maytag]] plant in fall of 2004, BNSF is once again the largest private employer in Galesburg.\n\nIn addition, Galesburg was home to the pioneering [[Brass Era car|brass era]] automobile company [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Western]], which produced the Gale, named for the town.<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.51.</ref>\n\nGalesburg was home to [[minor league baseball]] from 1890\u20131914. The [[Galesburg Pavers]] was the last name of the minor league teams based in Galesburg.

A committee from New York purchased {{convert|17|acres|km2 sqmi}} in [[Knox County, Illinois|Knox County]] in 1835, and the first 25 settlers arrived in 1836. They built temporary cabins in Log City near current Lake Storey, just north of Galesburg, having decided that no log cabins were to be built inside the town limits.\n\nGalesburg was home to the first [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] society in Illinois, founded in 1837, and was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knox.edu/x12131.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601171751/http://www.knox.edu/x12131.xml|url-status=dead|title=Underground Freedom Railroad Station|archivedate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> The city was the site of the fifth [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln\u2013Douglas debate]], on a temporary speaker's platform attached to Knox College's \"Old Main\" building on October 7, 1858. Knox College continues to maintain and use Old Main to this day. An Underground Railroad Museum and Lincoln-Douglas Debate Museum were built in Knox College's Alumni Hall after it had finished renovations.\n\nGalesburg was the home of [[Mary Ann Bickerdyke|Mary Ann \"Mother\" Bickerdyke]], who provided hospital care for [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war, Galesburg was the birthplace of poet, author, and historian [[Carl Sandburg]], poet and artist [[Dorothea Tanning]], and former [[Major League Baseball]] star [[Jim Sundberg]]. Sandburg's boyhood home is now operated by the [[Illinois Historic Preservation Agency]] as the [[Carl Sandburg State Historic Site]]. The site contains the cottage he was born in, a modern museum, the rock under which he and his wife Lilian are buried, and a performance venue.\n\nThroughout much of its history, Galesburg has been inextricably tied to the [[railroad]] industry. Local businessmen were major backers of the first railroad to connect Illinois' (then) two biggest cities\u2014[[Chicago]] and [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]\u2014as well as a third leg initially terminating across the [[Mississippi River]] from [[Burlington, Iowa]], eventually connecting to it via bridge and thence onward to the Western frontier. The [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] (CB&Q) sited major rail sorting yards here, including the first to use [[hump yard|hump sorting]]. The CB&Q also built a major [[Galesburg station (Amtrak)#History|depot]] on South Seminary Street which was controversially torn down and replaced by a much smaller [[Galesburg station (Amtrak)|station]] in 1983. The yard is still used by the [[BNSF Railway]].\n\n[[File:BNSF Galesburg.jpg|left|thumb|275px|A BNSF train passes through central Galesburg near the site of the [[Galesburg Station (Santa Fe)|former Santa Fe depot]].]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, when the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] connected its service through to Chicago, it also laid track through Galesburg and built  [[Galesburg Station (Santa Fe)|its own railroad depot]]. This depot remained in operation until the construction of the [[Cameron Connector]] to the southwest of town<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thezephyr.com/archives/santafe.htm |title=Did Galesburg businessmen really need to pay to bring the Santa Fe Railway to Town? |date=June 20, 1996 |author=Rex Cherrington |newspaper=The Zephyr |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717043939/http://www.thezephyr.com/archives/santafe.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> enabled [[Amtrak]] to reroute the ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' onto the Mendota Subdivision and join the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' and ''[[Illinois Zephyr]]'' at the Burlington Northern depot. A series of mergers eventually united both lines under the ownership of [[BNSF Railway]], carrying an average of seven freight trains per hour between them. As of the closing of the [[Maytag]] plant in fall of 2004, BNSF is once again the largest private employer in Galesburg.\n\nIn addition, Galesburg was home to the pioneering [[Brass Era car|brass era]] automobile company [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Western]], which produced the Gale, named for the town.<ref>Clymer, Floyd.

{"title_page": "An Unbelievable Story of Rape", "text_new": "\"'''An Unbelievable Story of Rape'''\" is a 2015 article about a [[Washington and Colorado serial rape cases|series of rapes]] in the U.S. states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Colorado]] that occurred between 2008 and 2011, and the subsequent police investigations. It was a collaboration between two American, non-profit news organizations, [[The Marshall Project]] and [[ProPublica]]. The article was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T. Christian Miller]]. It won the 2016 [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] and the 2015 [[George Polk Award]] for Justice Reporting.\n\nThe article alternates between two true stories of events occurring between August 2008 and June 2012. The first narrative is about a woman in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], known pseudonymously as \"Marie\", who reports being raped to the police. After repeated interrogation by the police, who do not believe her, she says that her report was false. She is subsequently charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]] for false accusation. The second narrative details the police investigations into a serial rapist in Colorado, who is known to have raped four women and made a fifth attempt. The man is arrested in February 2011, and subsequent evidence on his hard drive reveals that Marie, not previously known to the local investigative team, was raped by him.\n\nT. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication. The article was further informed by other interviews and thousands of pages of public records material.\n\nThe article was later adapted into the Netflix series ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]'', which has received critical acclaim. The article also provided the basis of Miller and Armstrong's full-length book ''A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America'' (2018).\n\n==Article content==\nIn [[Lynnwood, Washington]], an 18-year-old woman, referred to as \"Marie,\" reported being bound, gagged and raped at knifepoint to police. Following police confrontation about inconsistencies in her story, she said that she made the incident up. In March 2009, she was charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]], fined $500 and put on probation. Marie had been sexually and physically abused in early life and was in foster care for most of her childhood. She joined Project Ladder at age 18, a program designed for people transitioning from foster care to living alone.\n\nIn [[Golden, Colorado]] during January 2011, Detective Stacy Galbraith interviewed a woman who was raped at gunpoint for four hours. When Galbraith talked to her husband, he observed familiarity with an incident reported to his police department in Westminster. Galbraith began collaboration with Westminster Detective Edna Hendershot, who had investigated two cases in which women aged 59 and 65 were raped in similar ways. They also discovered a burglary where a masked man had attempted to tie up a 46-year-old woman, who jumped out of her window and was badly injured. The four known cases took place in different suburbs of [[Denver]]. The man had gone to extreme lengths to avoid leaving DNA evidence, but [[touch DNA]] from the same paternal family line was found at three scenes.\n\nMarie had made her report in August 2008 to Sergeant Jeffrey Mason and Jerry Rittgarn. Police guidelines advised that rape victims should not be interrogated, as they may be uncertain of details or report conflicting information. Investigating Marie's report, police found evidence of an assailant and abrasions to Marie's vagina and wrist. However, two of Marie's former foster parents began to disbelieve her due to her seemingly calm demeanour, one reporting doubts to the police. Following this, and Marie's conflicting account of when she phoned a friend, Mason and Rittgarn made Marie repeat her story, Rittgarn saying that he disbelieved her. He asked if the rapist was real and she said \"no.\" Without reading the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]], they asked her to write that she had made a false report. She wrote instead that she had dreamed the incident, now unsure of what happened. After hours of further questioning, Marie wrote that she had been lying.\n\nProject Ladder staff made Marie return to police when she said she made the report under [[duress]]. She asked to take a [[polygraph test]]\u2014though such tests do not provide reliable evidence\u2014but declined when Rittgarn threatened jail and loss of housing if she failed it. Mason filed a false reporting charge; such charges in similar circumstances were rare. Marie became the subject of media reports and an attack website. She quit her [[Costco]] job and considered suicide. In October 2008, one of Marie's foster parents saw a report of a woman in [[Kirkland, Washington]] raped in the same way as Marie. Kirkland police abandoned this lead after Lynnwood police told them at least twice that Marie's account was a lie.\n\nIn February 2011, a report was unearthed of a suspicious vehicle registered to army veteran Marc Patrick O'Leary, whose description matched the attacker. FBI agents collected DNA evidence from his brother which showed one of them was the rapist. A search warrant led to the arrest of O'Leary. He possessed a mask, gun, women's underwear and other identifying evidence. Photographs of Marie were found on O'Leary's hard drive. O'Leary had watched women for hundreds of hours, breaking into their houses multiple times before each rape. In December 2011, O'Leary was sentenced to 327.5 years in prison for four incidents in Colorado. In June 2012, he was sentenced to an additional 38.5 years for two incidents in Washington.\n\nAn external report condemned the handling of Marie's case. It described the officers' behaviour as \"bullying\" and highlighted threats of jail and housing assistance removal as \"coercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\" An internal review also concluded that Mason and Rittgarn's behaviour was \"designed to elicit a confession of false reporting.\" In 2015, the commander of Lynnwood's Criminal Investigations Division said that practices had since changed. Neither Mason nor Rittgarn were disciplined. After Marie approached Mason, he offered an apology. Marie sued the city, winning $150,000. By the time of the article, Marie was married with two children.<ref name=\"Unbelievable Marshall\"/><ref name=\"Unbelievable ProPublica\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===History===\n\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\" was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T.

It was a collaboration between two American, non-profit news organizations, [[The Marshall Project]] and [[ProPublica]]. The article was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T. Christian Miller]]. It won the 2016 [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] and the 2015 [[George Polk Award]] for Justice Reporting.\n\nThe article alternates between two true stories of events occurring between August 2008 and June 2012. The first narrative is about a woman in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], known pseudonymously as \"Marie\", who reports being raped to the police. After repeated interrogation by the police, who do not believe her, she says that her report was false. She is subsequently charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]] for false accusation. The second narrative details the police investigations into a serial rapist in Colorado, who is known to have raped four women and made a fifth attempt. The man is arrested in February 2011, and subsequent evidence on his hard drive reveals that Marie, not previously known to the local investigative team, was raped by him.\n\nT. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication. The article was further informed by other interviews and thousands of pages of public records material.\n\nThe article was later adapted into the Netflix series ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]'', which has received critical acclaim. The article also provided the basis of Miller and Armstrong's full-length book ''A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America'' (2018).\n\n==Article content==\nIn [[Lynnwood, Washington]], an 18-year-old woman, referred to as \"Marie,\" reported being bound, gagged and raped at knifepoint to police. Following police confrontation about inconsistencies in her story, she said that she made the incident up. In March 2009, she was charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]], fined $500 and put on probation. Marie had been sexually and physically abused in early life and was in foster care for most of her childhood. She joined Project Ladder at age 18, a program designed for people transitioning from foster care to living alone.\n\nIn [[Golden, Colorado]] during January 2011, Detective Stacy Galbraith interviewed a woman who was raped at gunpoint for four hours. When Galbraith talked to her husband, he observed familiarity with an incident reported to his police department in Westminster. Galbraith began collaboration with Westminster Detective Edna Hendershot, who had investigated two cases in which women aged 59 and 65 were raped in similar ways. They also discovered a burglary where a masked man had attempted to tie up a 46-year-old woman, who jumped out of her window and was badly injured. The four known cases took place in different suburbs of [[Denver]]. The man had gone to extreme lengths to avoid leaving DNA evidence, but [[touch DNA]] from the same paternal family line was found at three scenes.\n\nMarie had made her report in August 2008 to Sergeant Jeffrey Mason and Jerry Rittgarn. Police guidelines advised that rape victims should not be interrogated, as they may be uncertain of details or report conflicting information. Investigating Marie's report, police found evidence of an assailant and abrasions to Marie's vagina and wrist. However, two of Marie's former foster parents began to disbelieve her due to her seemingly calm demeanour, one reporting doubts to the police. Following this, and Marie's conflicting account of when she phoned a friend, Mason and Rittgarn made Marie repeat her story, Rittgarn saying that he disbelieved her. He asked if the rapist was real and she said \"no.\" Without reading the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]], they asked her to write that she had made a false report. She wrote instead that she had dreamed the incident, now unsure of what happened. After hours of further questioning, Marie wrote that she had been lying.\n\nProject Ladder staff made Marie return to police when she said she made the report under [[duress]]. She asked to take a [[polygraph test]]\u2014though such tests do not provide reliable evidence\u2014but declined when Rittgarn threatened jail and loss of housing if she failed it. Mason filed a false reporting charge; such charges in similar circumstances were rare. Marie became the subject of media reports and an attack website. She quit her [[Costco]] job and considered suicide. In October 2008, one of Marie's foster parents saw a report of a woman in [[Kirkland, Washington]] raped in the same way as Marie. Kirkland police abandoned this lead after Lynnwood police told them at least twice that Marie's account was a lie.\n\nIn February 2011, a report was unearthed of a suspicious vehicle registered to army veteran Marc Patrick O'Leary, whose description matched the attacker. FBI agents collected DNA evidence from his brother which showed one of them was the rapist. A search warrant led to the arrest of O'Leary. He possessed a mask, gun, women's underwear and other identifying evidence. Photographs of Marie were found on O'Leary's hard drive. O'Leary had watched women for hundreds of hours, breaking into their houses multiple times before each rape. In December 2011, O'Leary was sentenced to 327.5 years in prison for four incidents in Colorado. In June 2012, he was sentenced to an additional 38.5 years for two incidents in Washington.\n\nAn external report condemned the handling of Marie's case. It described the officers' behaviour as \"bullying\" and highlighted threats of jail and housing assistance removal as \"coercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\" An internal review also concluded that Mason and Rittgarn's behaviour was \"designed to elicit a confession of false reporting.\" In 2015, the commander of Lynnwood's Criminal Investigations Division said that practices had since changed. Neither Mason nor Rittgarn were disciplined. After Marie approached Mason, he offered an apology. Marie sued the city, winning $150,000. By the time of the article, Marie was married with two children.<ref name=\"Unbelievable Marshall\"/><ref name=\"Unbelievable ProPublica\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===History===\n\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\" was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T.

They were the production destroyer of the US Navy when it entered [[World War II]].\n\nThe ''Gleaves'' class were initially specified as part of a 24-ship {{sclass-|Benson|destroyer|4}} authorized in [[fiscal year]]s 1938\u201340; however, [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding]] requested that the six ships designed by them use less complex machinery. Initially, ''Gleaves'' and {{USS|Niblack|DD-424|2}}, although designed by Gibbs & Cox and built by [[Bath Iron Works]], were to follow the ''Benson'' design. This temporarily made {{USS|Livermore|DD-429|2}} the lead ship with more complex machinery, so the class was initially called the ''Livermore'' class, and this name persisted through [[World War II]]. However, it soon proved possible for ''Gleaves'' and ''Niblack'' to be built to the ''Livermore'' design.<ref name=Friedman1/> Since ''Gleaves'' was completed before ''Livermore'' and had a lower hull number, the class is more correctly the ''Gleaves'' class. Eighteen of these were commissioned in 1940\u201341.<ref name=Register1>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 188-191</ref> The remaining 48 \u201crepeat ''Gleaves''es\u201d were authorized in 1940\u201342. These plus the 16 \"repeat ''Benson''s\" were also known at the time as the ''Bristol'' class, after {{USS|Bristol|DD-453|6}}. During World War II the ''Benson''s were usually combined with the ''Livermore''s (more correctly the ''Gleaves'' class) as the ''Benson''-''Livermore'' class; this persisted in references until at least the 1960s.<ref name=\"Silverstone, pp. 126-135\">Silverstone, pp. 126-135</ref> The classes are now called the ''Benson-Gleaves'' class.<ref name=BensonGleaves>[http://destroyerhistory.org/benson-gleavesclass/ ''Benson-Gleaves'' classes at DestroyerHistory.org]</ref> In some references both classes are combined and called the ''Benson'' class.<ref name=Friedman1/> The ''Benson''- and ''Gleaves''-class destroyers were the backbone of the pre-war [[Neutrality Patrol]]s and brought the action to the enemy by participating in every major naval campaign of the war.\n\n==Related classes==\nThe ''Benson''s were originally envisioned as a single class of 24 ships, the first eight of which were ordered in [[fiscal year]] 1938 (FY38). Six of these were designed by Bethlehem Shipbuilding, to be built at a Bethlehem yard and several naval shipyards, and two were designed by [[Gibbs & Cox]], to be built at [[Bath Iron Works]]. All were to have {{convert|600|psi|abbr=on}} steam (references vary) [[superheated steam|superheated]] to {{convert|750|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, with cruising turbines and double-reduction [[gear]]ing to maximize fuel efficiency.<ref name=Friedman1/> After contract award, Bethlehem requested that their design be modified to use less-complex single-reduction gears and no cruising turbines. Bethlehem claimed they could achieve comparable fuel efficiency with the simpler machinery. This request was granted, but FY39 and FY40 ships, beginning with ''Livermore'', would use the more complex machinery.<ref name=\"Register1\"/> So the class was known through World War II as the ''Benson''-''Livermore'' class, and this name persisted in many references until at least the 1960s.<ref name=\"Silverstone, pp. 126-135\"/> In the spring of 1938 the Navy's [[Bureau of Steam Engineering]] requested that the FY39 and FY40 ships be modified for {{convert|850|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} superheat.<ref name=Friedman1/> It proved possible for Bath to build their two FY38 ships, ''Gleaves'' and ''Niblack'', to the new design. ''Gleaves'' was completed prior to ''Livermore'' and had a lower hull number, thus the class name is more correctly the ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class.<ref name=Register1/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080118153104/http://www.destroyers.org/DD-Histories/DD-Classes/Intro-DD423.htm Archived notes on ''Gleaves'' class at Destroyers.org]</ref>\n\nAn external difference between the ''Benson'' and ''Gleaves'' classes was the shape of the stacks; the ''Benson''s' were flat-sided and the ''Gleaves'' were round.

To fill the gap until the [[Fletcher-class destroyer|''Fletcher''-class destroyers]] would be ready for service, an additional 72 \"repeat\" ''Benson''- and ''Gleaves''-class ships were ordered in FY41 and FY42. 24 repeat ''Benson''s were built by several Bethlehem yards, while an additional 48 repeat ''Gleaves'' were built by various other builders.<ref name=Register1/> These were initially called the ''Bristol'' class after ''Bristol'', a repeat ''Gleaves'' and the first of these to be completed, although the machinery of the repeat ''Benson''s was different from the repeat ''Gleaves''es. The repeat ships were ordered with reduced torpedo and gun armament and increased [[anti-submarine]] and light [[anti-aircraft]] armament.<ref name=Conway1>Gardiner and Chesneau, pp. 128\u2013129</ref>\n\nIn some references the ''Benson'' and ''Gleaves'' classes are combined as the ''Benson'' class.<ref name=Friedman1/>\n\n==Design==\nThe ''Gleaves'' class was designed as an improved version of the {{sclass-|Sims|destroyer|4}} with two stacks and a new \"echeloned\" machinery arrangement that featured alternating boiler and engine rooms, designed to give the ships a better chance at surviving torpedo damage. Loss of one compartment, or even two adjacent compartments, would no longer disable the entire propulsion system. This design was credited with the survival of {{USS|Kearny|DD-432|6}} after she was torpedoed by the {{ship|German submarine|U-568||2|up=yes}} near [[Iceland]] in October 1941, before the US entered the war. The ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class also introduced quintuple [[torpedo tube]] mounts. Their scantlings, or framing dimensions, were increased to carry the weight of the new machinery. This increased the ships' displacement by about seventy tons, to 1630 tons [[standard displacement]].<ref name=Friedman1/><ref name=Conway1/> Twenty ships (DD-493-497, 618-28, and 645-648) had square-faced bridges in an attempt to speed production.<ref name=Register1/>\n\n===Engineering===\nThe ''Gleaves'' class were all completed with {{convert|600|psi|abbr=on}} steam (references vary) [[superheated steam|superheated]] to {{convert|850|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, double-reduction gearing, and cruising turbines.<ref name=Register1/> The main [[steam turbine]]s were designed and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]].<ref name=Friedman1/><ref name=Conway1/><ref>[http://destroyerhistory.org/assets/pdf/generalinformationbooks/423Gleaves_GIBook.pdf USS ''Gleaves'' (DD-423) and USS ''Niblack'' (DD-424) General Information Book with as-built data] at [http://destroyerhistory.org/ Destroyer History Foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219202357/http://destroyerhistory.org/ |date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Armament===\nThe class was completed with four or five {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[dual purpose gun]]s (anti-surface and [[anti-aircraft]] (AA)), controlled by a [[Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System]] as in the previous ''Sims'' class. The introduction of two centerline quintuple torpedo tube mounts in the ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class was a significant improvement and was continued in subsequent [[World War II]] classes. This allowed a broadside of ten tubes with savings in space and weight compared to previous classes, which had twelve or sixteen tubes and an eight-tube broadside.<ref name=Friedman1/> However, most of the ''Gleaves'' class spent most of the war with only five torpedo tubes equipped in favor of greater light [[anti-aircraft]] armament. This varied considerably in different ships as the war went on; for example, the specified pair of twin {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns were not widely available until mid-1942 and a quadruple [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} machine cannon]] mount and a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun were temporarily substituted.<ref name=Conway1/> In 1945 sixteen ships (DD-423-424, 429-432, 435, 437-440, 443, 497, 623-624, and DD-628) were modified for maximum light AA armament as an anti-''[[kamikaze]]'' measure, with four 5-inch guns, no torpedo tubes, twelve 40&nbsp;mm guns in two quad and two twin mounts and four 20&nbsp;mm guns in two twin mountings.<ref>Friedman, p. 107</ref><ref name=Register1/> Photographs indicate that, as with most pre-1942 destroyers, the initial [[anti-submarine]] armament of two [[depth charge]] tracks was augmented with four or six [[K-gun]] depth charge throwers in 1941-42 on most ships.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/05idx.htm NavSource Destroyer Photo Index Page]</ref> In 1943 twelve ships (DD-493, 609, 620, 622-623, 635, 637-639, and DD-646-648) were temporarily equipped with three [[Mousetrap (weapon)|Mousetrap]] ASW rocket launchers, but this was unsuccessful and the only such installation on post-1930 US destroyers.

All other enlisted sailors had a bunk in large open living [[compartment (ship)|compartments]] astern of the engineering spaces. Beneath each tier of bunks were individual lockers with a wooden grate floor. As seawater entered the compartment during rough weather, the wooden grate was intended to lift the locker contents above the deck and allow the seawater to drain out as it sloshed over the deck when the ship rolled. No laundry was included in the original design, but a single washing machine was later installed in a compartment the size of a closet. Clothing could be washed and spun damp to be hung to dry wherever space allowed.<ref name=jkp/>\n\n===DMS conversions===\nTwenty-four ''Gleaves''-class ships were converted to [[destroyer minesweeper]]s (DMS-19 through DMS-42) in 1944 and 1945.<ref name=Conway1/><ref name=\"Friedman, pp. 108-109\">Friedman, pp. 108-109</ref> Twelve Atlantic Fleet ships (DD-454-458, 461-462, 464, 621, 625, 636, and 637) were converted in 1944, with the rest in the Pacific in 1945 (DD-489-490, 493-496, 618, 627, and 632-635). Magnetic and acoustic [[minesweeping]] gear was fitted, with armament reduced to three 5 in guns, no torpedo tubes, two K-guns, four 40&nbsp;mm guns in two twin mounts, and seven 20&nbsp;mm guns on the Atlantic ships. The Pacific ships and ''Hobson'' had increased light AA armament, with eight 40&nbsp;mm guns in two quad mounts and six 20&nbsp;mm guns in two twin and two single mounts. Twelve DMS conversions were the only ''Benson''-''Gleaves''-class ships retained in service postwar. However, they were judged ineffective in the [[Korean War]] due to requiring a large crew compared with purpose-built [[minesweeper]]s, and were decommissioned in 1954-56.<ref name=\"Friedman, pp. 108-109\"/>\n\n==Service==\nTwenty-one were in commission when the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]]. Eleven were lost to enemy action during World War II, including ''Gwin'', ''Meredith'', ''Monssen'', ''Bristol'', ''Emmons'', ''Aaron Ward'', ''Duncan'', ''Beatty'', ''Glennon'', ''Corry'', and ''Maddox''. Six of these were in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], two were off [[D-Day|Normandy]], and three were in the [[Mediterranean]]. ''Ingraham'' was lost in a collision with an [[tanker (ship)|oiler]] in 1942, and ''Turner'' was lost to an internal explosion in 1944.\n\nMost were decommissioned and placed in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|Reserve Fleet]] just following World War II. Twelve DMS conversions remained in commission into the 1950s, the last withdrawn from service in 1956.<ref name=\"Register1\"/> ''Hobson'' was sunk in a collision with the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|2}} in 1952. ''Baldwin'' grounded while under tow and was [[Scuttling|scuttled]] in 1961 while out of commission, thus is not counted as a loss.\n\nEleven ships of the class were transferred to foreign navies 1949-1959; two to Greece, four to Turkey, one to Italy, two to Taiwan, and two to Japan.<ref>Gardiner & Chumbley, pp. 160, 206, 222, 455, 469</ref> On 19 October 1954 {{USS|Ellyson|DD-454|2}} and {{USS|Macomb|DD-458|2}} were transferred to the [[Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force]] where they served as JDS ''Asakaze'' and JDS ''Hatakaze'', the latter was further transferred to Taiwan in 1970 as ''Hsien Yang'' to replace the ex-''Rodman'' of the same name.<ref>Gardiner & Chumbley, p. 222</ref>\n\nModernization was considered in the 1950s but not implemented except on the transferred ships.<ref>Friedman, pp. 107-108</ref> Those ships not transferred to other countries were mostly sold for scrap in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=Register1/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ships in

They were the production destroyer of the US Navy when it entered [[World War II]].\n\nThe ''Gleaves'' class were initially specified as part of a 24-ship {{sclass-|Benson|destroyer|4}} authorized in [[fiscal year]]s 1938\u201340; however, [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding]] requested that the six ships designed by them use less complex machinery. Initially, ''Gleaves'' and {{USS|Niblack|DD-424|2}}, although designed by Gibbs & Cox and built by [[Bath Iron Works]], were to follow the ''Benson'' design. This temporarily made {{USS|Livermore|DD-429|2}} the lead ship with more complex machinery, so the class was initially called the ''Livermore'' class, and this name persisted through [[World War II]]. However, it soon proved possible for ''Gleaves'' and ''Niblack'' to be built to the ''Livermore'' design.<ref name=Friedman1/> Since ''Gleaves'' was completed before ''Livermore'' and had a lower hull number, the class is more correctly the ''Gleaves'' class. Eighteen of these were commissioned in 1940\u201341.<ref name=Register1>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 188-191</ref> The remaining 48 \u201crepeat ''Gleaves''es\u201d were authorized in 1940\u201342. These plus the 16 \"repeat ''Benson''s\" were also known at the time as the ''Bristol'' class, after {{USS|Bristol|DD-453|6}}. During World War II the ''Benson''s were usually combined with the ''Livermore''s (more correctly the ''Gleaves'' class) as the ''Benson''-''Livermore'' class; this persisted in references until at least the 1960s.<ref name=\"Silverstone, pp. 126-135\">Silverstone, pp. 126-135</ref> The classes are now called the ''Benson-Gleaves'' class.<ref name=BensonGleaves>[http://destroyerhistory.org/benson-gleavesclass/ ''Benson-Gleaves'' classes at DestroyerHistory.org]</ref> In some references both classes are combined and called the ''Benson'' class.<ref name=Friedman1/> The ''Benson''- and ''Gleaves''-class destroyers were the backbone of the pre-war [[Neutrality Patrol]]s and brought the action to the enemy by participating in every major naval campaign of the war.\n\n==Related classes==\nThe ''Benson''s were originally envisioned as a single class of 24 ships, the first eight of which were ordered in [[fiscal year]] 1938 (FY38). Six of these were designed by Bethlehem Shipbuilding, to be built at a Bethlehem yard and several naval shipyards, and two were designed by [[Gibbs & Cox]], to be built at [[Bath Iron Works]]. All were to have {{convert|600|psi|abbr=on}} steam (references vary) [[superheated steam|superheated]] to {{convert|750|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, with cruising turbines and double-reduction [[gear]]ing to maximize fuel efficiency.<ref name=Friedman1/> After contract award, Bethlehem requested that their design be modified to use less-complex single-reduction gears and no cruising turbines. Bethlehem claimed they could achieve comparable fuel efficiency with the simpler machinery. This request was granted, but FY39 and FY40 ships, beginning with ''Livermore'', would use the more complex machinery.<ref name=\"Register1\"/> So the class was known through World War II as the ''Benson''-''Livermore'' class, and this name persisted in many references until at least the 1960s.<ref name=\"Silverstone, pp. 126-135\"/> In the spring of 1938 the Navy's [[Bureau of Steam Engineering]] requested that the FY39 and FY40 ships be modified for {{convert|850|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} superheat.<ref name=Friedman1/> It proved possible for Bath to build their two FY38 ships, ''Gleaves'' and ''Niblack'', to the new design. ''Gleaves'' was completed prior to ''Livermore'' and had a lower hull number, thus the class name is more correctly the ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class.<ref name=Register1/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080118153104/http://www.destroyers.org/DD-Histories/DD-Classes/Intro-DD423.htm Archived notes on ''Gleaves'' class at Destroyers.org]</ref>\n\nAn external difference between the ''Benson'' and ''Gleaves'' classes was the shape of the stacks; the ''Benson''s' were flat-sided and the ''Gleaves'' were round. The ''Gleaves''-class [[porthole]]s on the [[forecastle]] were omitted in the ''Benson''-class.<ref name=jkp>{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=Jackson K. |authorlink = |year=1986 |title=the Life of a Machinist's Mate |journal=Proceedings |volume=112 |issue=5 |pages=174-176 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Fall of France]] in 1940 a rapid expansion of the Navy was envisioned. To fill the gap until the [[Fletcher-class destroyer|''Fletcher''-class destroyers]] would be ready for service, an additional 72 \"repeat\" ''Benson''- and ''Gleaves''-class ships were ordered in FY41 and FY42. 24 repeat ''Benson''s were built by several Bethlehem yards, while an additional 48 repeat ''Gleaves'' were built by various other builders.<ref name=Register1/> These were initially called the ''Bristol'' class after ''Bristol'', a repeat ''Gleaves'' and the first of these to be completed, although the machinery of the repeat ''Benson''s was different from the repeat ''Gleaves''es. The repeat ships were ordered with reduced torpedo and gun armament and increased [[anti-submarine]] and light [[anti-aircraft]] armament.<ref name=Conway1>Gardiner and Chesneau, pp. 128-129</ref>\n\nIn some references the ''Benson'' and ''Gleaves'' classes are combined as the ''Benson'' class.<ref name=Friedman1/>\n\n==Design==\nThe ''Gleaves'' class was designed as an improved version of the {{sclass-|Sims|destroyer|4}} with two stacks and a new \"echeloned\" machinery arrangement that featured alternating boiler and engine rooms, designed to give the ships a better chance at surviving torpedo damage. Loss of one compartment, or even two adjacent compartments, would no longer disable the entire propulsion system. This design was credited with the survival of {{USS|Kearny|DD-432|6}} after she was torpedoed by the {{ship|German submarine|U-568||2|up=yes}} near [[Iceland]] in October 1941, before the US entered the war. The ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class also introduced quintuple [[torpedo tube]] mounts. Their scantlings, or framing dimensions, were increased to carry the weight of the new machinery. This increased the ships' displacement by about seventy tons, to 1630 tons [[standard displacement]].<ref name=Friedman1/><ref name=Conway1/> Twenty ships (DD-493-497, 618-28, and 645-648) had square-faced bridges in an attempt to speed production.<ref name=Register1/>\n\n===Engineering===\nThe ''Gleaves'' class were all completed with {{convert|600|psi|abbr=on}} steam (references vary) [[superheated steam|superheated]] to {{convert|850|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, double-reduction gearing, and cruising turbines.<ref name=Register1/> The main [[steam turbine]]s were designed and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]].<ref name=Friedman1/><ref name=Conway1/><ref>[http://destroyerhistory.org/assets/pdf/generalinformationbooks/423Gleaves_GIBook.pdf USS ''Gleaves'' (DD-423) and USS ''Niblack'' (DD-424) General Information Book with as-built data] at [http://destroyerhistory.org/ Destroyer History Foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219202357/http://destroyerhistory.org/ |date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Armament===\nThe class was completed with four or five {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[dual purpose gun]]s (anti-surface and [[anti-aircraft]] (AA)), controlled by a [[Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System]] as in the previous ''Sims'' class. The introduction of two centerline quintuple torpedo tube mounts in the ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class was a significant improvement and was continued in subsequent [[World War II]] classes. This allowed a broadside of ten tubes with savings in space and weight compared to previous classes, which had twelve or sixteen tubes and an eight-tube broadside.<ref name=Friedman1/> However, most of the ''Gleaves'' class spent most of the war with only five torpedo tubes equipped in favor of greater light [[anti-aircraft]] armament. This varied considerably in different ships as the war went on; for example, the specified pair of twin {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns were not widely available until mid-1942 and a quadruple [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} machine cannon]] mount and a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun were temporarily substituted.<ref name=Conway1/> In 1945 sixteen ships (DD-423-424, 429-432, 435, 437-440, 443, 497, 623-624, and DD-628) were modified for maximum light AA armament as an anti-''[[kamikaze]]'' measure, with four 5-inch guns, no torpedo tubes, twelve 40&nbsp;mm guns in two quad and two twin mounts and four 20&nbsp;mm guns in two twin mountings.<ref>Friedman, p. 107</ref><ref name=Register1/> Photographs indicate that, as with most pre-1942 destroyers, the initial [[anti-submarine]] armament of two [[depth charge]] tracks was augmented with four or six [[K-gun]] depth charge throwers in 1941-42 on most ships.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/05idx.htm NavSource Destroyer Photo Index Page]</ref> In 1943 twelve ships (DD-493, 609, 620, 622-623, 635, 637-639, and DD-646-648) were temporarily equipped with three [[Mousetrap (weapon)|Mousetrap]] ASW rocket launchers, but this was unsuccessful and the only such installation on post-1930 US destroyers. They were removed beginning in March 1944.<ref name=Conway1/><ref>Friedman, pp. 194-195</ref>\n\n===Habitability===\n[[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief petty officers]] had quarters in the forecastle. All other enlisted sailors had a bunk in large open living [[compartment (ship)|compartments]] astern of the engineering spaces. Beneath each tier of bunks were individual lockers with a wooden grate floor. As seawater entered the compartment during rough weather, the wooden grate was intended to lift the locker contents above the deck and allow the seawater to drain out as it sloshed over the deck when the ship rolled. No laundry was included in the original design, but a single washing machine was later installed in a compartment the size of a closet. Clothing could be washed and spun damp to be hung to dry wherever space allowed.<ref name=jkp/>\n\n===DMS conversions===\nTwenty-four ''Gleaves''-class ships were converted to [[destroyer minesweeper]]s (DMS-19 through DMS-42) in 1944 and 1945.<ref name=Conway1/><ref name=\"Friedman, pp. 108-109\">Friedman, pp. 108-109</ref> Twelve Atlantic Fleet ships (DD-454-458, 461-462, 464, 621, 625, 636, and 637) were converted in 1944, with the rest in the Pacific in 1945 (DD-489-490, 493-496, 618, 627, and 632-635). Magnetic and acoustic [[minesweeping]] gear was fitted, with armament reduced to three 5 in guns, no torpedo tubes, two K-guns, four 40&nbsp;mm guns in two twin mounts, and seven 20&nbsp;mm guns on the Atlantic ships. The Pacific ships and ''Hobson'' had increased light AA armament, with eight 40&nbsp;mm guns in two quad mounts and six 20&nbsp;mm guns in two twin and two single mounts. Twelve DMS conversions were the only ''Benson''-''Gleaves''-class ships retained in service postwar. However, they were judged ineffective in the [[Korean War]] due to requiring a large crew compared with purpose-built [[minesweeper]]s, and were decommissioned in 1954-56.<ref name=\"Friedman, pp. 108-109\"/>\n\n==Service==\nTwenty-one were in commission when the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]]. Eleven were lost to enemy action during World War II, including ''Gwin'', ''Meredith'', ''Monssen'', ''Bristol'', ''Emmons'', ''Aaron Ward'', ''Duncan'', ''Beatty'', ''Glennon'', ''Corry'', and ''Maddox''. Six of these were in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], two were off [[D-Day|Normandy]], and three were in the [[Mediterranean]]. ''Ingraham'' was lost in a collision with an [[tanker (ship)|oiler]] in 1942, and ''Turner'' was lost to an internal explosion in 1944.\n\nMost were decommissioned and placed in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|Reserve Fleet]] just following World War II. Twelve DMS conversions remained in commission into the 1950s, the last withdrawn from service in 1956.<ref name=\"Register1\"/> ''Hobson'' was sunk in a collision with the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|2}} in 1952. ''Baldwin'' grounded while under tow and was [[Scuttling|scuttled]] in 1961 while out of commission, thus is not counted as a loss.\n\nEleven ships of the class were transferred to foreign navies 1949-1959; two to Greece, four to Turkey, one to Italy, two to Taiwan, and two to Japan.<ref>Gardiner & Chumbley, pp. 160, 206, 222, 455, 469</ref> On 19 October 1954 {{USS|Ellyson|DD-454|2}} and {{USS|Macomb|DD-458|2}} were transferred to the [[Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force]] where they served as JDS ''Asakaze'' and JDS ''Hatakaze'', the latter was further transferred to Taiwan in 1970 as ''Hsien Yang'' to replace the ex-''Rodman'' of the same name.<ref>Gardiner & Chumbley, p. 222</ref>\n\nModernization was considered in the 1950s but not implemented except on the transferred ships.<ref>Friedman, pp. 107-108</ref> Those ships not transferred to other countries were mostly sold for scrap in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=Register1/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ships in
