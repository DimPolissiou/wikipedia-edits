It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport | publisher=manchester2002-uk.com | accessdate=29 August 2015 | last=Moss | first=John | date=28 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | archive-date=22 November 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref name=\"STOCKPORT CASTLE\">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 | mname=STOCKPORT CASTLE | accessdate=29 August 2015|date=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making Stockport the only senior club in the UK to wear the Umbro strip in the 2013\u201314 season.<ref name=\"Background\" /><ref name=\"New Kit Deal Agreed\">{{cite web |

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

Originally competing in blue and white striped jerseys and white shorts, they experimented with red and white stripes in the early 1900s, and from the mid-1930s to mid-1960s played in white jerseys and black shorts.<ref name=\"Our History\" /><ref name=\"Kit History\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Stockport_County/Stockport_County.htm#KitHistory | title=Kit History | publisher=historicalkits.co.uk | accessdate=8 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=8 September 2013}}</ref> No set pattern has been established for the club's use of blue and white as main colours, as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white shorts. They made a short experiment with an [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]]. This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s. Stockport marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit \u2013 a gold colour with black trim.<ref name=\"Coca Cola League Two 2007 - 2008 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2007-2008/league-two.html#stockport| title=Coca Cola League Two 2007 \u2013 2008 | work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref> The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away trips.

It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport | publisher=manchester2002-uk.com | accessdate=29 August 2015 | last=Moss | first=John | date=28 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | archive-date=22 November 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref name=\"STOCKPORT CASTLE\">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 | mname=STOCKPORT CASTLE | accessdate=29 August 2015|date=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making Stockport the only senior club in the UK to wear the Umbro strip in the 2013\u201314 season.<ref name=\"Background\" /><ref name=\"New Kit Deal Agreed\">{{cite web |

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

This avenue can be seen with the integration of the [[lorcon]] wireless (802.11) toolset into Metasploit 3.0 in November 2006. Metasploit 4.0 was released in August 2011.\n\n==Metasploit Framework==\nThe basic steps for exploiting a system using the Framework include:\n# Choosing and configuring an ''exploit'' (code that enters a target system by taking advantage of one of its [[Software bug|bugs]]; about 900 different exploits for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Unix]]/[[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]] systems are included);\n# Optionally checking whether the intended target system is susceptible to the chosen exploit;\n# Choosing and configuring a ''[[Payload (software)|payload]]'' (code that will be executed on the target system upon successful entry; for instance, a remote shell or a [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC server]]);\n# Choosing the encoding technique so that hexadecimal opcodes known as \"bad characters\" are removed from the payload, these characters will cause the exploit to fail.\n# Executing the exploit.\n\nThis modular approach \u2013 allowing the combination of any exploit with any payload \u2013 is the major advantage of the Framework. It facilitates the tasks of attackers, exploit writers and payload writers.\n\nMetasploit runs on Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X) and on Windows. The Metasploit Framework can be extended to use add-ons in multiple languages.\n\nTo choose an exploit and payload, some information about the target system is needed, such as operating system version and installed network services. This information can be gleaned with [[port scanning]] and [[OS fingerprinting]] tools such as [[Nmap]]. [[Vulnerability scanner]]s such as [[Nexpose]], [[Nessus (software)|Nessus]], and [[OpenVAS]] can detect target system vulnerabilities. Metasploit can import vulnerability scanner data and compare the identified vulnerabilities to existing exploit modules for accurate exploitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metasploit.com/download|title=Penetration Testing Tool, Metasploit, Free Download - Rapid7|work=Rapid7|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Metasploit interfaces==\nThere are several interfaces for Metasploit available. The most popular are maintained by Rapid7 and Strategic Cyber LLC.<ref name=\"Metasploit editions\">{{cite web|title=Metasploit editions|url=https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/editions-and-features.jsp|work=rapid7.com|publisher=rapid7|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Metasploit Framework Edition===\nThe free version. It contains a command line interface, third-party import, manual exploitation and manual brute forcing. This free version of the Metasploit project also includes [[Zenmap]], a well known ports-scanner and a compiler for Ruby, the language in which this version of Metasploit was written.\n<ref name=\"Metasploit editions\" />\n\n===Metasploit Community Edition===\nIn October 2011, Rapid7 released Metasploit Community Edition, a free, web-based user interface for Metasploit. Metasploit Community is based on the commercial functionality of the paid-for editions with a reduced set of features, including network discovery, module browsing and manual exploitation. Metasploit Community is included in the main installer.\n\n===Metasploit Express===\nIn April 2010, Rapid7 released Metasploit Express, an open-core commercial edition for security teams who need to verify vulnerabilities. It offers a graphical user interface, integrates nmap for discovery, and adds smart bruteforcing as well as automated evidence collection.\n\n===Metasploit Pro===\nIn October 2010, Rapid7 added Metasploit Pro, an open-core commercial Metasploit edition for penetration testers. Metasploit Pro adds onto Metasploit Express with features such as Quick Start Wizards/MetaModules, building and managing [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] campaigns, web application testing, an advanced Pro Console, dynamic payloads for anti-virus evasion, integration with Nexpose for ad-hoc vulnerability scans, and VPN pivoting.\n\n===Armitage===\n[[Armitage (computing)|Armitage]] is a graphical cyber attack management tool for the Metasploit Project that visualizes targets and recommends exploits. It is a [[free and open source]] [[network security]] tool notable for its contributions to [[red team]] collaboration allowing for shared sessions, data, and communication through a single Metasploit instance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Armitage A GUI for Metasploit|url=https://code.google.com/p/armitage/|publisher=Strategic Cyber LLC|accessdate=2013-11-18}}</ref>\n\n===Cobalt Strike===\nCobalt Strike is a collection of threat emulation tools provided by Strategic Cyber LLC to work with the Metasploit Framework.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cobaltstrike.com/|title=Adversary Simulation and Red Team Operations Software - Cobalt Strike|website=cobaltstrike.com|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref> Cobalt Strike includes all features of [[Armitage (computing)|Armitage]] and adds post-exploitation tools, in addition to report generation features.<ref>{{cite news|title=Armitage vs Cobalt Hooked Strike|url=http://www.advancedpentest.com/help-armitage-vs-cobaltstrike|publisher=Strategic Cyber LLC|accessdate=2013-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== Exploits ==\nMetasploit currently has over 1894 exploits, organized under the following platforms: [[AIX]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BSD]], [[BSDi]], [[Cisco]], [[Firefox]], [[FreeBSD]], [[HPUX]], [[Irix]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Linux]], [[mainframe]], multi (applicable to multiple platforms), [[NetBSD]], [[NetWare]], [[nodejs]], [[OpenBSD]], [[OSX]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Unix]], and [[Windows]].\n\n==Payloads==\nMetasploit currently has over 547 payloads. Some of them are: \n* '''Command shell''' enables users to run collection scripts or run arbitrary commands against the host.\n* '''Meterpreter''' (the Metasploit Interpreter) enables users to control the screen of a device using VNC and to browse, upload and download files.\n* '''Dynamic payloads''' enable users to evade anti-virus defense by generating unique payloads.\n* ''' Static payloads''' enable static IP address/port forwarding for communication between the host and the client system.\n\n==Contributors==\nMetasploit Framework operates as an open-source project and accepts contributions from the community through GitHub.com pull requests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md|title=rapid7/metasploit-framework|website=GitHub|access-date=2017-01-14}}</ref> Submissions are reviewed by a team consisting of both Rapid7 employees and senior external contributors.

{"title_page": "Franz Anton von Sporck", "text_new": "[[Image:Sporck01.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Count Franz Anton von Sporck from the year 1735]]\n[[Image:Spork medal 1723 rv.jpg|thumb|Order of St. Hubert]]\n[[Image:Spork medal 1723 av.jpg|thumb|Medal of 1723]]\n\n'''Franz Anton von Sporck, Count''' (''Franz Anton Reichsgraf von Sporck'' in [[German language|German]], ''Franti\u0161ek Anton\u00edn hrab\u011b \u0160pork'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]) (born 9 March 1662 in [[Lys\u00e1 nad Labem]] or [[He\u0159man\u016fv M\u011bstec]]; died 30 March 1738 in [[Lys\u00e1 nad Labem]]) was a German-speaking [[literatus]] and patron of the arts who lived in the province of [[Bohemia]] in what is now the [[Czech Republic]].  He was one of the most notable cultural and intellectual figures in central [[Europe]] in the early 18th century.\n\n==Life==\nCount Sporck was born the eldest of four children of Count [[Johann von Sporck]] (1595-1679) and his second wife Maria Eleonora of Fineke.  His father had been born in rather humble circumstances in [[Westphalia]], but was rewarded handsomely for distinguished military leadership in the service of the [[Habsburg]] dynasty during the [[Thirty Years' War]].  It was a habit of the Habsburg emperors to reward favorites with lands confiscated from dispossessed [[Protestant]] Bohemian nobles who refused to convert to [[Catholicism]] after the defeat of the Estates of Bohemia at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620. Count Sporck's father was an archetypal example of this sort of favorite, first ennobled with the rank of baron in 1647, then imperial count in 1664.  He was given vast amounts of land in Bohemia that Count Sporck would later inherit.  Typical of the Germanized Catholic nobility in Bohemia of his day, Count Sporck considered himself ethnically German and exhibited scant interest in Czech culture. He attended school first in He\u0159man\u016fv M\u011bstec, then at the Jesuit Latin School in Kutn\u00e1 Hora. In 1675 he began to attend lectures in philosophy and law at [[Charles-Ferdinand University]] in the Prague [[Clementinum]].  He graduated in 1678 at the age of sixteen.  In 1680 he embarked on a [[Grand Tour]] of Europe that brought him to [[Rome]], [[Turin]], southern [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Paris]], [[England]], [[The Hague]], and [[Brussels]].  He traveled for a second time to Paris in 1682 after returning to Bohemia in 1681.  He acquired a lifelong appreciation of French literature from his travels in France.  As he was still a minor at the time of his father's death, he was able to assume control of his inheritance only in 1684. This included the estates of Lys\u00e1, [[Konojedy]], [[Choustn\u00edkovo Hradi\u0161t\u011b]], and [[Male\u0161ov]]. It was on the estate of Choustn\u00edkovo Hradi\u0161t\u011b in northern Bohemia that he later built his own residence of [[Kuks]]. He also inherited the family palace in Prague and a considerable sum of money.\n\nIn 1686 he married the Franziska Apollonia, n\u00e9e von Sw\u00e9erts zu Reist (1667\u20131726), a member of a [[Silesians|Silesian]] family originally from Brussels. The marriage was a happy one.  Together the couple had two daughters, Elenora Franziska (1687\u20131717) and Anna Katherina (1689\u20131754), and a son, Johann Franz Anton Joseph Adam (born 1699), who did not survive infancy.  In 1718 Count Sporck adopted the husband of his daughter Anna Katherina, Franz Karl Rudolph von Sw\u00e9erts zu Reist, and it was he who inherited the Sporck estates, taking the name Sw\u00e9erts-Sporck.\n\nMuch of Count Sporck's early adulthood was spent improving and expanding his estates and participating in public affairs.  In the early 1690s he was awarded a number of prestigious imperial offices, including steward (''K\u00e4mmerer'') and ''Statthalter'' in 1690 and privy counselor (''Wirklicher Geheimer Rat'') in 1692.  His title of ''Statthalter'', which indicates merely that he held a seat on the ''Statthalterei'', a committee of nobles that served as the highest local civil authority in the province of Bohemia at the time, has led to confusion in the English-language literature.  Sometimes Count Sporck is referred to as the \"[[Viceroy]] of Bohemia,\" a title that did not exist.  In 1695 he founded a noted hunting society known as the Order of St. Hubert.\n\nIn 1694 the Prague physician J. F. Love confirmed the healing properties of the spring that originated on the left side of the river in the southern portion of the estate of Choustn\u00edkovo Hradi\u0161t\u011b. Here was built the Kuks spa, later famous for its curative powers and the charity hospital attached to it.  For the overall concept, design and execution of the building of the spa and castle of Kuks, Count Sporck commissioned the architect [[Giovanni Battista Alliprandi]] and the master mason [[Giovanni Pietro della Torre]]. The complex included the Church of the Holy Trinity, built for the benefit of war veterans and retired retainers as part of a foundation that he founded. The sculptor [[Matthias Braun|Matthias Bernard Braun]] beautified the grounds of Kuks with some of his finest works.  \n\nCount Sporck's intellectual interests led him to found a branch of [[Freemasonry]] in Bohemia, but they also had the effect of arousing the suspicion of the Habsburg ecclesiastical authorities for his flirtations with [[Jansenist]] philosophy and anti-Jesuitical polemicism.  In 1729, his entire collection of books was carted away for investigation on the orders of the emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] and he himself was temporarily arrested.  He was cleared of all wrongdoing in 1734 after a great deal of political maneuvering and substantial expenditure of money, but he never recovered emotionally.  The last four years of his life were spent in quiet retirement.\n\n=== Musical interests ===\n\nThere are three aspects of musical patronage that make Count Sporck notable to music lovers both inside and outside the Czech Republic:  his introduction of the French horn into Bohemia, his foundation of the first permanent opera theater in the Bohemian lands, and a certain connection with the composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] that still lacks clarification.\n\nTraditions of French horn playing were introduced in Bohemia after Count Sporck brought the instrument back with him from a visit to the court of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in the spring of 1681.  Its cultivation spread in Bohemia until the Bohemian horn players were generally acknowledged to be the best in Europe by the 18th century.\n\nCount Sporck had long sponsored theatrical performances at Kuks and his palace in Prague, but in 1724 permitted an Italian opera company to perform in his Prague palace free of charge. The impetus for this move was the coronation of Charles VI in Prague in 1723, an event accompanied by lavish operatic productions on the grounds of [[Prague Castle]].  There was a recognition that Prague should have a permanent theater capable of presenting the \"aristocratic\" entertainment of opera, and Count Sporck saw fit to encourage the efforts of the Italian impresario Antonio Maria Peruzzi in founding the Prague theater, then [[Antonio Denzio]], who soon supplanted Peruzzi, in continuing productions.  There were also operatic productions for a few years at Kuks during the summer months.  The Denzio company succeeded in attracting some of the most prominent singers in Italy to Prague, and used [[Antonio Vivaldi]] as a source of repertory and singers.  Vivaldi himself visited Prague in the early 1730s as a result of his connections with the Sporck theater.  Many creative operatic works were first performed in the Sporck theater, including the first opera to use the original settings and character names from the tradition of [[Don Juan]] dramatizations:  the opera ''[[La pravit\u00e0 castigata]]'' (1730) with words by Antonio Denzio and music mainly by [[Antonio Caldara]].  Count Sporck did not provide financial support for the opera company beyond permitting the impresario to use the theater in his Prague palace free of charge, however, nor did he attend performances after the confiscation of his library in 1729.  The Prague nobility gradually lost the interest in the Denzio productions, his company suffered serious financial reversals, and finally it collapsed in bankruptcy in 1735 with appeals to Count Sporck for assistance contemptuously dismissed.\n\nCount Sporck is known to have maintained connections with the poet [[Picander]] in [[Leipzig]], an individual well known to J. S. Bach, who set many of his texts to music.  It is possible that this connection led Bach to try to cultivate Count Sporck, who was passionately interested in German poetry and even employed the poet [[Gottfried Benjamin Hancke]] permanently as a member of his household. The autograph score of the \"Sanctus\" of the Bach's [[Mass in B minor]] contains an annotation that a copy was sent to Count Sporck in Bohemia. There is no record in the voluminous surviving correspondence of Count Sporck that this gesture was ever acknowledged or rewarded with a payment to Bach.  It is also not certain that the two ever met.\n\n==References==\n{{no footnotes|date=February 2017}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Pazaurek, Gustav Edmund.

In 1980, it was spoken by twenty elders in [[Queensland]] between the towns of [[Tambo, Queensland|Tambo]] and [[Augathella]], or the Warrego and Langlo rivers. The language is being revitalised and is being taught in local schools in the region.\n\n==Dialects==\nThe Bidjara language included numerous dialects, of which Bidjara proper was the last to go extinct. One of these was Gunya (Kunja), spoken over 31,200&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (12,188 sq mi), from the [[Warrego River]] near [[Cunnamulla]] north to Augathella and Burenda Station; west to between Cooladdi and Cheepie; east to Morven and Angellala Creek; at Charle-ville. [[Fred McKellar]] was the last known speaker. [[Yagalingu]] is poorly attested but may have been a dialect of Bidjara.<ref>{{AIATSIS|E43|Yagalingu}}</ref>\n\nNatalie Kwok prepared a report on Gunggari for the Native Title Court in Australia.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  In it she says:\n:Language served as an important identity marker between the Gunggari and Bidjara peoples. Although academically speaking, differences between the two languages have been found to be minor, from an emic point of view such distinctions were meaningful and consequential. Lynette Nixon recounts that when her father used to converse with the Gadd brothers it was understood that, although communication was possible, they each spoke in their own tongue.

Born in England, he began his career as a youth player with [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] before moving to Australia without making a first-team appearance. In Australia, he played for [[Balgownie Rangers FC|South Coast United]], [[St George Saints|St George]] and [[Balgownie Rangers FC|Safeway United]] and was called up to the [[Australia national soccer team]] after two years in the country.\n\nNicknamed \"Noddy\" for his heading ability, he made his international debut in 1969 and was instrumental in helping the side qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], the first time the nation had ever reached the finals tournament, where he featured in all three group matches. His performances attracted attention from around Europe and he eventually signed for English [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] after turning down several offers from clubs in Germany.
