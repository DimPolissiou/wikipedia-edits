He was a younger son of [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], and the younger brother of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], the '[[Kingmaker]]'.\n\nFrom an early age he was involved in fighting for [[House of Neville|his House]], particularly in the [[Percy\u2013Neville feud|feud]] that sprang up in the 1450s with the Neville family's major regional rivals, the [[House of Percy|Percy family]]. John Neville was personally responsible for much of the violence until, with his brothers, they defeated and imprisoned their enemies. This was taking place against the backdrop of a crisis in central government. The king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], already known to be a weak ruler, suffered a mental collapse which led to a [[protectorate]] headed by John's uncle, [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]]. Within two years an armed conflict had broken out, with York openly in rebellion against the king, and his Neville cousins supporting him. John fought with his father and Warwick against the king at the [[first Battle of St Albans]], at which they had the victory.\n\nFollowing a few years of uneasy peace, the Yorkists' rebellion erupted once again, and John Neville fought alongside his father and elder brother [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Thomas]] at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] in September 1459. Although the Earl of Salisbury fought off the Lancastrians, both his sons were captured, and John, with Thomas, spent the next year imprisoned. Following his release in 1460, he took part in the Yorkist government. His father and brother died in [[Battle of Wakefield|battle]] just after Christmas 1460, and in February the next year, John \u2013 now promoted to [[Peerage of England|the peerage]] as [[Baron Montagu|Lord Montagu]] \u2013 and Warwick fought the Lancastrians again at [[Second Battle of St Albans|St Albans]]. John was once again captured and not released until his cousin Edward, York's son, won a decisive victory at [[Battle of Towton|Towton]] in March 1461, and became [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]].\n\nJohn Neville soon emerged, with Warwick, as representatives of the king's power in the north, which was still politically turbulent, as there were still a large number of Lancastrians on the loose attempting to raise rebellion against the new regime. As his brother Warwick became more involved in national politics and central government, it devolved to John to finally defeat the last remnants of Lancastrians in 1464. Following these victories, Montagu, in what has been described as a high point for his House, was created [[Earl of Northumberland]]. At around the same time, however, his brother Warwick became increasingly dissatisfied with his relationship with the king, and began instigating rebellions against Edward IV in the north, finally capturing him in July 1469. At first, Montagu helped suppress this discontent, and also encouraged Warwick to release Edward. Eventually, however, his brother went into French exile with the king's brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence]], in March 1470.\n\nDuring Warwick's exile, King Edward stripped Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, making him [[Marquess of Montagu|Marquis of Montagu]] instead. John Neville appears to have seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained about the lack of landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a '[[Magpie|pie's nest]]'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]], [[Buckinghamshire]]; the king, with his other brother [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], fled into exile in Burgundy.\n\nWhile in exile, Warwick had allied with the old king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] and his Queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], Henry was restored to the throne, and Warwick now effectively ruled the kingdom, This return to Lancastrianism did not, however, last long; within the year, Edward and Gloucester had returned. Landing only a few miles from Montagu in Yorkshire \u2013 who did nothing to stop them \u2013 the Yorkists marched south, raising an army. Montagu followed them, and, meeting up with his brother at [[Coventry]], they confronted Edward over a battlefield at [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]]. John Neville was cut down in the fighting, Warwick died soon after, and within a month Edward had reclaimed his throne and Henry VI and his line was extinguished.\n\n==Youth and early career==\nMontagu was the third son of [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], and [[Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury]], and a younger brother of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], \"the Kingmaker.\"{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}}\n\nJohn Neville's upbringing and career was entwined with that of the north of England and specifically, the marcher areas, the eastern and western borders between Scotland and England, controlled from Berwick and Carlisle respectively.{{sfn|Tuck|1985|p=44}} His Early activity there consisted of diplomatic meetings with the Scots, at which he acted as a witness, between 1449 and 1451.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=403}} He was also one of three men who were instructed, in a letter of 3 February 1449, to not attend the forthcoming parliament and remain in the north guarding the border.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=65}} He was knighted by King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] at [[Greenwich]] on 5 January 1453, alongside [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond|Edmund]] and [[Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford|Jasper Tudor]], his brother Thomas Neville, [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (died 1469)|William Herbert]], Roger Lewknor, and [[William Catesby]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=699}}\n[[File:Middleham Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1737858.jpg|left|thumb|Middleham Castle today; this was his father's [[caput]].]]\n\n=== Feud with the Percys ===\n{{Main|Percy-Neville feud}}\nSir John Neville was from the branch of the Neville family based at [[Middleham Castle]] in Yorkshire, rather than that of [[Westmorland]]. It has been claimed that he, as a 'landless younger son' was partially to blame for his family's long-running feud with the Lancastrian [[House of Percy|Percy family]] of [[Northumberland]].{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=268}} The first outburst of violence that took place was a result of the 1 May 1453 royal licence for John Neville's brother, [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Thomas Neville]] to marry Maud Stanhope being issued. News of this must have reached the north within the fortnight, for by the twelfth, one of the Earl of Northumberland's younger sons, [[Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont|Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont]], began recruiting men.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=256}} In August 1453, John Neville raided the Percy castle of [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]], possibly with the intention of seizing Egremont.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Failing to find him, Neville resorted to threatening the Percy [[tenantry]] who were in residence.{{sfn|Storey|1966|p=129}} He and Egremont were subsequently summoned to appear before the [[Royal Council]], a summons which was ignored by both.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=xlii}} Feuding continued through summer 1453, and even though they had been instructed to keep the peace, by the 27 July, the council was issuing letters to Northumberland and Salisbury regarding their sons. This was followed by more letters to the sons.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=xlvii}} In [[Knaresborough]], the locals generally aligned themselves with John Neville due to the unpopularity of [[William Plumpton|Sir William Plumpton]] (the king's man), from whom they began stealing with impunity, which resulted in severe injuries when the Neville brothers demonstrated a 'show of force' in January 1454.{{sfn|Wilcock|2004|p=60}}\n\nJohn Neville was with his brother's wedding party when Egremont [[ambush]]ed them on the return from [[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]]. This took place on [[Heworth Moor]] on 24 August 1453.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=597}} The next month, John took a raiding party and ransacked Egremont's [[Catton, North Yorkshire|Catton]] [[manor]],{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=256}} 'breaking windows and shattering tiles.'{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=603}} With his brothers, Thomas and Richard, as well as the Earl of Salisbury, they faced the Earl of Northumberland and his sons at Topcliffe on 20 October 1453, although a peace was then negotiated.{{sfn|Storey|1966|p=132}} The feud continued for much of the next year, and only came to a halt with a battle at Salisbury's manor of [[Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire|Stamford Bridge]], near York on 31 October 1454.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=274}} Thomas and John confronted, and decisively beat, Egremont and [[Richard Percy]], whom the Nevilles captured.{{sfn|Storey|1966|p=149}}\n\n== Marriage ==\n\nJohn Neville married Isabel{{refn|Isabel Ingoldsthorpe is occasionally also referred to as Elizabeth in [[Exchequer]] records.{{sfn|Selden Society|1933|pp=138\u201340}}|group=note}} Ingoldsthorpe (c.1441 \u2013 20 May 1476), of [[Burrough Green]] and [[Sawston]], [[Cambridgeshire]], on 25 April 1457; Archbishop [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Thomas Bourchier]] officiated the marriage at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Isabel was not only the heiress of her father, Sir Edmund Ingaldsthorpe (who had died on 2 September 1456), but also the heiress of her maternal uncle, [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester|John Tiptoft]] and his [[Earldom of Worcester]].{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=130}} It may have been that Earl of Worcester had engineered the match.{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=34}} A [[Paston Letters|letter to John Paston]] on 1 May 1457 described how 'the Erle [of Warwick's] yonger bro[[Thorn (letter)|\u00fe]]ere maryed to Ser Edmund Ynglthorp's doughter upon Seynt Markes Day; the Erle of Worcestre broght aboute the maryage.'{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=172}} She was a greater heiress than might have been expected for a youngest son like John. John was granted seven southern manors by his father and mother, the Earl and [[Alice Montagu, 5th Countess of Salisbury|Countess of Salisbury]], for his part.{{sfn|Hicks|1986|p=323}}{{refn|Although ''cf.'' Hick's ''Warwick the Kingmaker'' (131), in which he states that it was eight manors.|group=note}}\n\nJohn Neville's marriage caused a dispute with [[Margaret of Anjou|Queen Margaret]]: even though Isabel was over fourteen years-old (and therefore of [[legal age]]), the Queen claimed that Isabel was still her [[Ward (law)|ward]]. As a result, Queen Margaret insisted that John pay her a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] for his marriage to Isabel: he was [[Contract|bound]] to pay her \u00a31,000 in ten instalments.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|pp=130\u201331}}\n\n== Wars of the Roses ==\n{{Main|Wars of the Roses}}\nThe king had become incapacitated in August 1453,{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=113}} which had led to the [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Duke of York]] being appointed [[Lord Protector|protector]] and controlling the government.{{sfn|Watts|2004}} By Christmas of 1454, however, King Henry had recovered from his illness, which removed the basis for York's authority.{{sfn|Hicks|2010|p=107}} Having reconvened the court at Westminster by mid-April 1455, Henry and a select council of nobles decided to hold a great council at Leicester. York and the Nevilles anticipated that Somerset would bring charges against them at this assembly. John Neville included,{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} they gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching [[Leicester]], intercepting them at [[St Albans]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|pp=134\u201335}}\n[[File:Castle Gate. Chester 02753.jpg|thumb|The gate of [[Chester Castle]]; John and his brother were imprisoned here for a year.]]\nAlthough only a small affray, it resulted in the deaths of some important people; viz. the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the Earl of Northumberland, and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]].{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset might have been targeted by York, the latter too might have been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers.{{sfn|Armstrong|1960|p=46}} It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke.{{sfn|Lander|1976|p=210 n. 34}} Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing out how Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently shared in the profits of York's redistribution of Skipwith's ex-offices.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}}\n\nIn December 1456, the new [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] tried to attack John Neville in London's [[Cheapside]];{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}} Somerset had already attempted something similar to John's brother Warwick the previous month. John's encounter, reported contemporary [[chroniclers]], would have become a 'skirmish' if the [[Geoffrey Boleyn|mayor]] had not intervened.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=800}} As it had been John who had 'spearheaded' the Neville retaliation to the Percies during their feud, Salisbury entered into a bond for Thomas and John's behaviour on 23 March 1458.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=628}} John, however continued to receive commissions from the government. He was part of a delegation of twenty-two Ambassadors nominated to discuss breaches of the Truce with Burgundy on 14 May that year,{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=150}} and two months later he was investigating the murder of a royal [[Serjeant-at-arms|serjeant]]. In 1459, he was appointed [[steward (office)|steward]] of the [[Honour of Pontefract]].{{sfn|Somerville|1953|p=514}}\n\nReconciliation between the crown and the sons of the dead lords of St Albans on the one half and of York and his Neville allies did not last, however.{{sfn|Pollard|2004}} In mid-September 1459, the Earl of Salisbury, intending to meet York at the latter's castle at [[Ludlow Castle|Ludlow]],{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=145}} marched south from [[Middleham Castle]] with his household, retainers, and a force of around five-thousand men.{{sfn|Hicks|2010|p=143}} John and Thomas were with him.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Salisbury's force was engaged by a much larger royal army under the command of [[James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley|Lord Audley]] on 23 September at [[Battle of Blore Heath|Blore Heath]], near [[Mucklestone]], [[Staffordshire]].{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=103}}{{sfn|Simons|1966|p=38}} Even though he had numerical superiority{{sfn|Harriss|2006|p=639}} the result was defeat for Audley, who was killed.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=145}} However at some point John Neville \u2013 along with his brother [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Thomas]]{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} and their father's [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] [[James Harrington (Yorkist knight)|James Harrington]]{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=272}} were captured. This might have occurred in their pursuit of fleeing Lancastrians{{sfn|Simons|1966|p=53}} the next day{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=272}} or alternatively they may have been injured in battle and had been sent home.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=163}} Either way, captured at [[Acton Bridge]] near [[Tarporley]], Cheshire, the four were imprisoned in [[Chester Castle]].{{sfn|Clayton|1980|p=118}}\n\nJohn Neville was not released until July 1460. As a result, he was not present at the Yorkists' [[rout]] at the [[Battle of Ludford Bridge]], which resulted in his father and brother's exile in [[Calais]]. He had still been [[attainted]] at the [[Parliament of Devils]] in October 1459{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=320 & n. 33}}{{sfn|Ross|1981|p=320}} and only restored in August the next year.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=306}} He was not released until June that year, and remained in London with during York's return from exile, and his claiming of the throne.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=211}} On 1 November 1460,{{sfn|Kendall|1957|p=73}} York appointed John the king's [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] for a crown-wearing ceremony at [[St Paul's Cathedral]].{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=44}} He stayed in London as word arrived that Lancastrians were gathering an army in the north;{{sfn|Watts|2004}} York, Salisbury, and John's brother Thomas marched north to confront them. On 30 December 1460 they went down to a crushing defeat outside York's castle at [[Sandal Castle|Sandal]], at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] where York and Thomas were killed, and Salisbury captured and killed the next day.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}}\n\nJohn Neville appears to have been Lieutenant of the castle of Calais, whilst Warwick served as its [[Captain of Calais|Captain]].{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=112 n. 1}} During the Protector's absence that winter, and after York's and Salisbury's death, alongside his brothers Warwick and George (the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]]) Neville was part of the head of government.{{sfn|Kendall|1957|p=74}}\n\n== Elevation to the peerage and war in the north ==\nAccording to [[Benet's Chronicle|Benet's ''Chronicle'']], John Neville was elevated to the peerage as Lord Montagu in the January 1461 parliament.{{sfn|Benet|1972|p=69}} It was also at this parliament that he presented a petition, regarding his wife, in which he reiterated that in [[common law]] women receive [[Livery#Sue one's livery|livery]] of their lands at fourteen years of age, and he requested parliament to reaffirm this.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1936|p=269}} In February he was elected to the [[Order of the Garter]]. He was installed on 21 March 1462, when he took his father's [[choir stall]] in [[Windsor Castle]]'s [[St. George's Chapel]].{{sfn|St. John Hope|1901|p=68}}\n[[File:Map for Second Battle of St Alban's by Ramsay.jpg|thumb|Map for Second Battle of St Albans by Ramsay.]]\nBy February 1461 Queen Margaret's army was marching south.{{sfn|Cron|1999|p=598}} Warwick and John, with their 'frantically raised' army, collected the King and marched north to confront the Queen's army on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]].{{sfn|Pollard|2007|pp=46\u201347}} The two armies met on 17 February at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]]- this time, just outside the town. In the resulting encounter, Warwick was 'outflanked and now outmatched,'{{sfn|Sadler|2011|p=69}} whereas John seems to have kept his army together up until the point the King's person was regained by the Lancastrians.{{sfn|Kendall|1957|p=84}} Montagu commanded the left [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] of the Yorkist army, which itself was subdivided into a group of archers in the town itself, with the majority posted on [[Bernards Heath]],{{sfn|Haigh|1997|p=48}} stretching eastwards towards Warwick's [[vanguard]].{{sfn|Haigh|1996|p=132}} This 'bloody and bitter' encounter' saw Warwick and John's army defeated.{{sfn|Ross|1986|p=51}} The Earl escaped;{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=148}} Montagu was captured and sent to [[York Castle]].{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} It seems probable that he escaped execution after the battle because, as the [[Milanese duchy|Milanese]] [[Ambassador]] wrote, 'a brother of my [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|lord of Somerset]] is a prisoner [of Warwick's] at Calais.{{sfn|Hinds|1912|p=51}}{{sfn|Burley|Elliot|Watson|2013|p=79}}\n\n[[File:Quartered arms of Sir John Nevill, 1st Marquess of Montagu, KG.png|thumb|Quartered arms of Sir John Neville, Lord Montagu, KG]]\nAs a result of his capture and imprisonment in York, Montagu escaped participation in the biggest and probably bloodiest battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]] which took place on 29 March 1461 at [[Battle of Towton|Towton]] in Yorkshire.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=1}} This decisive Yorkist victory led to Montagu being released the next day, when the son of the Duke of York \u2013 and England's ''de facto'' new king \u2013 [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] entered York in triumph.{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=165}} Montagu and Warwick then missed the King's coronation in April, as they stayed in the north to attempt the recapture of northern castles still in Lancastrian hands;{{sfn|Scofield|1923|pp=186\u201367}} as [[John Gillingham]] has put it, 'the 'unfinished military business would have to be left to the Nevilles.'{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=136}} And on 10 May 1461 Montagu was commissioned to raise troops against both the Lancastrian remnants and the king of Scotland.{{sfn|Booth|1997|p=77}} One of Montagu's first actions was to successfully raise the siege of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], 'with prompt action.'{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=229}} Carlisle had had its suburbs burnt and been under siege from June{{sfn|Summerson|1996|p=90}} by a Scottish-Lancastrian force, but was easily{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=60}} relieved by him,{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=138}} apparently killing 6,000 Scots and Lord Clifford's brother in the process,{{sfn|Summerson|1996|p=89}} before Warwick had even arrived.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=238}}\n\nThe military campaign that followed was focussed on the recapture of strategically vital castles on the Northumbrian border. [[Alnwick Castle]] was commanded by a shell keep, to which extra towers had been added, as well as to the curtain wall, with a solid barbican and gatehouse. [[Bamburgh Castle]] was on a high spur ridge with three [[Ward (castle)|baileys]], a large [[keep]], and fortified gateways. [[Dunstanburgh Castle]] stood on a [[dolerite]] spur which had the sheer drop of a cliff on one side.{{sfn|Sadler|2006|p=349}} Montagu besieged Bamburgh, the most important of these northern bulwarks, due to its distance from London and proximity to Scotland.{{sfn|Jacob|1993|p=529}} By 26 December 1462, when the garrison surrendered,{{sfn|Goodman|1990|p=61}} they 'had been reduced to eating their horses.'{{sfn|N. C. H.

This was twice the salary his legally-trained and 'non-noble' successors would receive from the Bishop in later years,{{sfn|Storey|1972|p=141}} and has been described as a 'unique post.'{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=162}}\n\n== Hexham and Hedgeley Moor ==\n{{Main|Battle of Hedgeley Moor|Battle of Hexham}}\n[[File:The Battle site of Hedgley Moor - geograph.org.uk - 1439715.jpg|thumb|left|The battle site of Hedgley Moor, where Montagu defeated a Lancastrian army in 1464.]]\nIn spite of Montagu's and Warwick's northern successes in the years following Towton, a not-insubstantial Lancastrian army was still active in the area; it had been slowly been re-taking castles, like [[Bamburgh Castle|Bamburgh]], [[Hexham Castle|Hexham]], [[Langley Castle|Langley]], [[Norham Castle|Norham]], and [[Prudhoe Castle]]s, between February and March 1464. This threatened [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], a major Yorkist supply centre. Local Lancastrians were returning to their estates, such as the Cliffords, who regained their castle at Skipton Craven{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=151}} with no royal response, military or otherwise. They 'virtually controlled most of the country immediately south of the Scottish border', wrote [[Charles Ross (historian)|Charles Ross]],{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=59}} although very few local gentry directly supported them.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=142}} The situation was severe enough that in April 1464 he was too occupied with the northern situation to travel to London, and was exempted from attending the [[Order of the Garter]] Chapter meeting on the 29th of the month.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=245}} He has been described as the king's 'resident commander' in the north{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=161}} and a 'confident and aggressive commander.'{{sfn|Storey|1966|p=158}}\n\nIn early 1464, the Lancastrians having coalesced in the [[Lord Warden of the Marches#Warden of the Eastern March|East March]], the ongoing peace negotiations with the Scots were moved from Newcastle to York.{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=329}} Montagu was sent to escort their embassy through now-unfriendly territory.

In June 1465 he was commissioned to contract marriages \"between English and Scottish subjects\"{{sfn|Roskell|1956|p=476}} as well as to treat for a perpetual peace with Scotland,{{sfn|Hardy|1873|p=696}} as a result of which, Montagu returned the captured [[Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]] to Scotland, for which he was paid fifty [[mark (currency)|mark]]s.{{sfn|Somerville|1953|p=236. n.5}} It was during this time ([[Michael Hicks (historian)|Hicks]] has suggested around January 1465){{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=262}} that Montagu and Lord Scales were requested by the [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] to accompany a force of 3,000 Breton archers{{sfn|Jacob|1993|p=536}} supplied by him,  for the '[[League of the Public Weal]]' against [[Louis XI of France]]. However, due to commitments in the north with Warwick, Montagu ended up taking no part in this campaign.{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=350}}\n\nIn 1465 Montagu received the main grant of the Percy Earldom of Northumberland estates,{{sfn|N. C. H. C.|1893|p=105}} and on 25 March the following year he was granted the constableships and [[Honour (feudal barony)#Traditional mediaeval honours|honours]] of [[Knaresborough Castle|Knaresborough]] and [[Pontefract Castle]]s,{{sfn|Somerville|1953|p=517}} which Warwick and before him their father had previously held, and also the castles of Tickhill, Snaith, and Dunstanburgh. This was to repay his [[arrears]] in back wages from his Wardenship of the East March, from an indenture of 1 June 1463.{{sfn|Rose|2011|p=53}} On the same day he was made Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster (north of the [[River Trent|Trent]]),  and it was from the profits of the duchy that his wages were coming from, amounting to approximately \u00a31,000.{{sfn|Arnold|1984|p=136 n.56}}\n\n===Warden of the Marches===\nThe Wardens were the military guardians of the border from the late fourteenth-century,  and their salaries made them the highest-paid among Crown officers, but this was inclusive of the cost of raising troops and maintaining defence. This has also been described as controlling 'private armies raised at the Crown's expense.'{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|pp=29\u201330}} By the mid-fifteenth century, the Wardenship of the East March was the most important of the two northern marcher lordships.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=812}} Marcher Wardens were granted the right to recruit by their being 'explicitly' exempted from the 1468 Statute of Livery,  which restrained- or attempted to restrain- retaining.{{sfn|Hicks|2000|p=395}} Montagu, however, was allowed to continue retaining in times of peace as well as war.{{sfn|Hicks|1991|p=22}} At this point Humphrey Neville was still on the run, and Montagu required troops to be raised on various occasions; in 1467, for example, [[Beverley]] sent him troops to deal with Humphrey's resistance.{{sfn|R. C. H. M.|1900|p=142}}\n\n===Warwick's rebellion===\nIn 1467, as part of his brother's plan for a closer relationship with the French, John and Isabelle accompanied Warwick in escorting the French King's envoys to Canterbury.{{sfn|Kendall|1957|p=208}} However, by this time, it was being rumoured that Warwick was moving towards supporting the House of Lancaster, as a result of dissatisfaction over the king's marriage to [[Elizabeth Woodville]] and his pursuit of an anti-French foreign policy. In 1469, Warwick organised [[Robin of Redesdale]]'s rebellion against Edward IV in Yorkshire{{sfn|Hicks|1998|pp=264\u201365}} and in July that year the king's brother [[George, Duke of Clarence]] married Warwick's daughter [[Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence|Isabelle]] whilst anchored off [[Calais]]; this was in direct defiance of the king's own wishes.{{sfn|Hicks|1980|pp=42\u201345}} It seems that Montagu, however, reacted strongly against his brother's machinations,{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=265}} and, unlike him, was satisfied with his current position.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|pp=265\u201366}}\n\nOn 27 October 1469, Henry Percy had taken his oath of fealty to the King, and had been released from the Tower.{{sfn|Hardy|1873|p=699}} The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick.{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=488}} Montagu was forced to come down from the Scottish border to suppress it;{{sfn|Haigh|1997|p=190}} this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he 'allowed the leaders to escape&nbsp;... ensuring that the rebellion could rise again' at a more opportune moment.{{sfn|Haigh|1997|p=197}} Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time lead by a [[Robin of Holderness]], but calling for the return of Percy to the Northumberland Earldom.{{sfn|Goodman|1990|p=67}} The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army big enough to march south and defeat a royal force at the [[Battle of Edgecote Moor]] on 26 July 1469.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=145}} King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother's rebellion,{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=79}} and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his journey from the north back to London.{{sfn|Bagley|1948|p=193}}\n\nHowever, it was while Edward was in York that he ordered the rehabilitation of [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]] to his family Earldom on 25/27 March 1470.{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=95}} On the same day John was elevated to the [[Marquess]]ate of Montagu,{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=433}} and now outranked his brother- an Earl- in the [[English peerage]].{{sfn|Hicks|2010|p=195}} Historians have since questioned, however, whether his new title had the gravitas that his previous Earldom had had,{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=175}} and have even suggested that the king was 'walking a tightrope' as to whether Montagu would actually accept it or not.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=310}} To compensate him for the loss of the Percy estates Montagu was granted the lands of the dead [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]],{{sfn|Hicks|1980|p=59}} and Montagu's son, George was created [[Duke of Bedford]]. These were substantial estates,{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=176}} providing an income of at least \u00a3600 per annum.{{sfn|Hicks|1980|p=59}} Montagu was to be the new regional magnate- as he been in the north- to fill an existing power vacuum.{{sfn|Ross|1986|p=82}}\n\n== Rebellion and death ==\nMontagu, though, was not happy with the new arrangements, and King Edward has been held responsible for turning Montagu from a friend to an enemy.{{sfn|Hicks|2010|p=202}} [[Warkworth's Chronicle]] describes him as condemning these grants to him as 'a [mag]pyes] nest.'{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Montagu had been on the Scottish border since at least January 1470.{{sfn|Thornley|1920|p=33}} Following unrest in [[Lincolnshire]] and the subsequent [[1470 Lincolnshire Rebellion|Lincolnshire rebellion]], the king marched from London to crush the rising. This he did at the [[Battle of Empingham]]. Following the battle, Edward headed north where he was met by Montagu and Northumberland at [[Doncaster]].{{sfn|Hicks|1980|p=74}} Warwick and Clarence's involvement in the Lincolnshire uprising had by now been established, and they fled to Calais. Further trouble broke out in the summer of 1470 in the north, with friends and relatives of Warwick in open rebellion.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=182}} The new Earl of Northumberland was unable to put down these risings, so the king, once again marched north to deal with it personally. Modern historians generally consider that these rebellions were a deliberate trap, instigated by Warwick and Clarence from Calais.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=182}} On 24 June 1470 the Wardenship of the East March was stripped from Montagu and given to Percy.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Edward was still in the north with Percy when he received word that the Warwick and Clarence had landed in [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]].{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=152}}\n\nAt [[Doncaster]], the king awaited Montagu, who was in the north raising a substantial force in Edward's name.{{sfn|Goodman|1990|p=250 n.28}} Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, marching to the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the king has been called 'decisive'.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=185}} The king was trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he escaped to [[King's Lynn|Bishop's Lynn]], sailing for Burgundy on 2 October.{{sfn|Ross|1981|p=18}}\n\n===Readeption of Henry VI===\n{{Main|Readeption of King Henry VI}}\nOn 3 October, with Edward IV in exile, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] was released from the Tower and [[Readeption of Henry VI|returned to the throne]] by Warwick. Almost immediately, Montagu was granted the wardship of the executed [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]]'s heir and estates, as well as of the young [[Henry Clifford, 10th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]]. He was reappointed to the Wardenship of the East March, with its salary, on 22 October 1470.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}}\n\nHowever, Montagu did not profit from the new regime as he probably expected to. He did not regain the Earldom of Northumberland. Further, he lost some of the Courtney lands that had come with his Marquessate to the newly returned [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]].{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=297}} Montagu had no active role in government, and does not seem to have sat in Council,{{sfn|Jacob|1993|p=561}} although he was appointed Chamberlain to the King's Household.{{sfn|Scattergood|1971|p=199}} Although he was confirmed in command of the new King's forces in the north{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=543}} and in possession of the manor of Wressle on 21 March 1471,{{sfn|Hardy|1873|p=701}} he did not regain any other Percy estates. Indeed, it has been suggested that his loyalty might still have been suspect by the newly arrived Lancastrians: having been summoned to the November 1470 parliament, Polydor Virgil states that he had to apologise there for his prior support of Edward.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=58}}  Montagu even had to pay cash for the king's pardon,{{sfn|Neillands|1992|p=144}} which he only received after making a lengthy speech, declaring that he had only remained faithful to Edward out of fear.{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=555}}\n\nMontagu, having responsibility for the defence of the north, received various commissions of array, which reflected the government's knowledge that King Edward was equipping a Burgundian-backed fleet in order to re-invade.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=18}}{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=560}} Montagu was to raise men from all across the north.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=157}} On 14 March 1471, King Edward landed at [[Ravenspur]], on the coast of Yorkshire; he had intended to land in [[East Anglia]], but this had been established as being unsafe.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=161\u201363}} Montagu, it has been suggested, could have 'snuffed out' Edward's army almost immediately had he moved fast enough.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=161\u201363}} Montagu was in [[Pontefract Castle]] as Edward passed by (where even his castle [[bailiff]] deserted him for the returning king, taking the castle's funds with him).{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=43}} Montagu's army, composed of local militias, was probably in the region of several thousand men, between 6,000 and 7,000,{{sfn|Weiss|1972|p=506}}{{sfn|Goodman|1990|p=75}} and increased as he trailed Edward south.{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=123}} Montagu arrived at [[Coventry]], where the Earl of Warwick was camped, in early April 1471;{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=79}} this was probably the day after Clarence had defected back to his brother Edward, and taken his army with him.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=193}}\n\n===Battle of Barnet Heath===\n{{Main|Battle of Barnet}}\nBy 12 April 1471, Montagu, with his brother Warwick and the [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]], the [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]], and [[William Beaumont, 2nd Viscount Beaumont|Viscount Beaumont]] were approaching London with their army.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=167}}\n[[File:Battle of Barnet retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Barnet, as depicted on a 15th-century [[Ghent]] [[manuscript]]]]\nEdward, having arrived in London on 11 April and been reunited with his queen,{{sfn|Horrox|2004a}} met Montagu and Warwick a few miles north of London, outside the village of [[Friern Barnet|Barnet]]. It is possible that he commanded a smaller army, perhaps of only 9,000 men,{{sfn|J. A. Giles|1845|p=124}} and probably no more than 14,000.{{sfn|Pugh|1972|p=127}}\n\nThe battle was a 'confused affair' and fought in [[fog]].{{sfn|DeVries|France|Rogers|2015|p=197}} It has been suggested that it was Montagu who persuaded Warwick to fight on foot at Barnet,{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=571}} leaving the horses tethered at the rear,  in order to demonstrate their commitment to the cause by taking the same risks as the common soldier.{{sfn|Kendall|1957|p=319}} Montagu probably controlled the centre [[battle]] of Warwick's army,{{sfn|Kendall|1977|p=96}} facing Edward's own section,  on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]]  from Barnet to [[St. Albans]].{{sfn|Haigh|1997|p=120}} Warkworth's Chronicle states that Warwick had an army of 20,000 men and that the battle beginning at 0400, lasted until ten o'clock that morning. Contemporaries have favourably described Montagu's martial skill at Barnet. [[Philippe de Commines]] called him as 'a very courageous knight,'{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=200}} and the Burgundian observer [[Jean de Waurin]] wrote that, in the thick of the fighting, Montagu was 'cutting off arms and heads like a hero of [[Chivalric romance|romance]].'{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=120}}\n\nThe Earl of Oxford, commanding the right wing of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|William, Lord Hastings]], early in the battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up [[looting]] away from the battlefield.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, 'disaster struck.' In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's '[[Star (heraldry)|Streaming star]]' banner as the king's '[[Sun (heraldry)|Sunne in splendour]],' and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York.{{sfn|Kendall|1977|p=96}}{{sfn|J. A. Giles|1845|p=124}} Recently though, one historian has pointed out that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a [[Heraldic badge|cognizance]], and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.{{sfn|Ross|2011|p=67}}\n\nAt some point, possibly around this time, Montagu was killed; he was certainly dead before his brother.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=168}} The ''Arrivall'' chronicler states this occurred 'in plain battle,'{{sfn|J. A. Giles|1845|p=125}} and in the thick of the fighting, rather than in the rout that later followed.{{sfn|Jacob|1993|p=568}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe bodies of Warwick and Montagu were laid out 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour starting that they had in fact survived the battle;{{sfn|J. A. Giles|1845|p=67}} Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to be put in a cart&nbsp;... to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay for three or four days'{{sfn|J. A. Giles|1845|p=12}} before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at [[Bisham Abbey|Bisham Priory]].{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=73}}\n\n==Family==\nWith Isabelle Ingaldsthorpe, John Neville had a son and five daughters.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=452\u201354}} The eldest was [[George Neville, Duke of Bedford]] (c. 1461\u20131483). It appears that Montagu had wanted to marry George to Anne, heiress of the [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]]; however, she had married the [[Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset|Earl of Dorset]] by 1466.{{sfn|Hicks|2004}} George eventually died without issue, having been stripped of his dukedom in 1478.{{sfn|Hicks|1986|pp=321, 325\u2013326}} His first daughter was Anne, who married Sir William Stonor of Stonor in [[Pyrton]], [[Oxfordshire]] (and was thus a descendant of [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]]).{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=452\u201354}} Elizabeth married firstly Thomas Scrope, [[Baron Scrope of Masham|6th Baron Scrope of Masham]], who was a dedicated Yorkist for his whole career,{{sfn|Attreed|1983|p=1021}} and secondly Sir [[Henry Wentworth]] of Nettlestead,{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=452\u201354}} while Margaret Neville married firstly Sir John Mortimer (who was dead before 12 November 1504),{{sfn|Cokayne|1953|p=458}} only son of Sir Hugh Mortimer and Eleanor Cornwall,{{sfn|Anonymous|1878|p=62}}{{sfn|V.

He was a younger son of [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], and the younger brother of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], the '[[Kingmaker]]'.\n\nFrom an early age he was involved in fighting for [[House of Neville|his House]], particularly in the [[Percy\u2013Neville feud|feud]] that sprang up in the 1450s with the Neville family's major regional rivals, the [[House of Percy|Percy family]]. John Neville was personally responsible for much of the violence until, with his brothers, they defeated and imprisoned their enemies. This was taking place against the backdrop of a crisis in central government. The king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], already known to be a weak ruler, suffered a mental collapse which led to a [[protectorate]] headed by John's uncle, [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]]. Within two years an armed conflict had broken out, with York openly in rebellion against the king, and his Neville cousins supporting him. John fought with his father and Warwick against the king at the [[first Battle of St Albans]], at which they had the victory.\n\nFollowing a few years of uneasy peace, the Yorkists' rebellion erupted once again, and John Neville fought alongside his father and elder brother [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Thomas]] at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] in September 1459. Although the Earl of Salisbury fought off the Lancastrians, both his sons were captured, and John, with Thomas, spent the next year imprisoned. Following his release in 1460, he took part in the Yorkist government. His father and brother died in [[Battle of Wakefield|battle]] just after Christmas 1460, and in February the next year, John \u2013 now promoted to [[Peerage of England|the peerage]] as [[Baron Montagu|Lord Montagu]] \u2013 and Warwick fought the Lancastrians again at [[Second Battle of St Albans|St Albans]]. John was once again captured and not released until his cousin Edward, York's son, won a decisive victory at [[Battle of Towton|Towton]] in March 1461, and became [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]].\n\nJohn Neville soon emerged, with Warwick, as representatives of the king's power in the north, which was still politically turbulent, as there were still a large number of Lancastrians on the loose attempting to raise rebellion against the new regime. As his brother Warwick became more involved in national politics and central government, it devolved to John to finally defeat the last remnants of Lancastrians in 1464. Following these victories, Montagu, in what has been described as a high point for his House, was created [[Earl of Northumberland]]. At around the same time, however, his brother Warwick became increasingly dissatisfied with his relationship with the king, and began instigating rebellions against Edward IV in the north, finally capturing him in July 1469. At first, Montagu helped suppress this discontent, and also encouraged Warwick to release Edward. Eventually, however, his brother went into French exile with the king's brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence]], in March 1470.\n\nDuring Warwick's exile, King Edward stripped Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, making him [[Marquess of Montagu|Marquis of Montagu]] instead. John Neville appears to have seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained about the lack of landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a '[[Magpie|pie's nest]]'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]], [[Buckinghamshire]]; the king, with his other brother [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], fled into exile in Burgundy.\n\nWhile in exile, Warwick had allied with the old king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] and his Queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], Henry was restored to the throne, and Warwick now effectively ruled the kingdom, This return to Lancastrianism did not, however, last long; within the year, Edward and Gloucester had returned. Landing only a few miles from Montagu in Yorkshire \u2013 who did nothing to stop them \u2013 the Yorkists marched south, raising an army. Montagu followed them, and, meeting up with his brother at [[Coventry]], they confronted Edward over a battlefield at [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]]. John Neville was cut down in the fighting, Warwick died soon after, and within a month Edward had reclaimed his throne and Henry VI and his line was extinguished.\n\n==Youth and early career==\nMontagu was the third son of [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], and [[Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury]], and a younger brother of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], \"the Kingmaker.\"{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}}\n\nJohn Neville's upbringing and career was entwined with that of the north of England and specifically, the marcher areas, the eastern and western borders between Scotland and England, controlled from Berwick and Carlisle respectively.{{sfn|Tuck|1985|p=44}} His Early activity there consisted of diplomatic meetings with the Scots, at which he acted as a witness, between 1449 and 1451.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=403}} He was also one of three men who were instructed, in a letter of 3 February 1449, to not attend the forthcoming parliament and remain in the north guarding the border.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=65}} He was knighted by King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] at [[Greenwich]] on 5 January 1453, alongside [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond|Edmund]] and [[Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford|Jasper Tudor]], his brother Thomas Neville, [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (died 1469)|William Herbert]], Roger Lewknor, and [[William Catesby]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=699}}\n[[File:Middleham Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1737858.jpg|left|thumb|Middleham Castle today; this was his father's [[caput]].]]\n\n=== Feud with the Percys ===\n{{Main|Percy-Neville feud}}\nSir John Neville was from the branch of the Neville family based at [[Middleham Castle]] in Yorkshire, rather than that of [[Westmorland]]. It has been claimed that he, as a 'landless younger son' was partially to blame for his family's long-running feud with the Lancastrian [[House of Percy|Percy family]] of [[Northumberland]].{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=268}} The first outburst of violence that took place was a result of the 1 May 1453 royal licence for John Neville's brother, [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Thomas Neville]] to marry Maud Stanhope being issued. News of this must have reached the north within the fortnight, for by the twelfth, one of the Earl of Northumberland's younger sons, [[Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont|Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont]], began recruiting men.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=256}} In August 1453, John Neville raided the Percy castle of [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]], possibly with the intention of seizing Egremont.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Failing to find him, Neville resorted to threatening the Percy [[tenantry]] who were in residence.{{sfn|Storey|1966|p=129}} He and Egremont were subsequently summoned to appear before the [[Royal Council]], a summons which was ignored by both.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=xlii}} Feuding continued through summer 1453, and even though they had been instructed to keep the peace, by the 27 July, the council was issuing letters to Northumberland and Salisbury regarding their sons. This was followed by more letters to the sons.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=xlvii}} In [[Knaresborough]], the locals generally aligned themselves with John Neville due to the unpopularity of [[William Plumpton|Sir William Plumpton]] (the king's man), from whom they began stealing with impunity, which resulted in severe injuries when the Neville brothers demonstrated a 'show of force' in January 1454.{{sfn|Wilcock|2004|p=60}}\n\nJohn Neville was with his brother's wedding party when Egremont [[ambush]]ed them on the return from [[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]]. This took place on [[Heworth Moor]] on 24 August 1453.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=597}} The next month, John took a raiding party and ransacked Egremont's [[Catton, North Yorkshire|Catton]] [[manor]],{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=256}} 'breaking windows and shattering tiles.'{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=603}} With his brothers, Thomas and Richard, as well as the Earl of Salisbury, they faced the Earl of Northumberland and his sons at Topcliffe on 20 October 1453, although a peace was then negotiated.{{sfn|Storey|1966|p=132}} The feud continued for much of the next year, and only came to a halt with a battle at Salisbury's manor of [[Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire|Stamford Bridge]], near York on 31 October 1454.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=274}} Thomas and John confronted, and decisively beat, Egremont and [[Richard Percy]], whom the Nevilles captured.{{sfn|Storey|1966|p=149}}\n\n== Marriage ==\n\nJohn Neville married Isabel{{refn|Isabel Ingoldsthorpe is occasionally also referred to as Elizabeth in [[Exchequer]] records.{{sfn|Selden Society|1933|pp=138\u201340}}|group=note}} Ingoldsthorpe (c.1441 \u2013 20 May 1476), of [[Burrough Green]] and [[Sawston]], [[Cambridgeshire]], on 25 April 1457; Archbishop [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Thomas Bourchier]] officiated the marriage at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Isabel was not only the heiress of her father, Sir Edmund Ingaldsthorpe (who had died on 2 September 1456), but also the heiress of her maternal uncle, [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester|John Tiptoft]] and his [[Earldom of Worcester]].{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=130}} It may have been that Earl of Worcester had engineered the match.{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=34}} A [[Paston Letters|letter to John Paston]] on 1 May 1457 described how 'the Erle [of Warwick's] yonger bro[[Thorn (letter)|\u00fe]]ere maryed to Ser Edmund Ynglthorp's doughter upon Seynt Markes Day; the Erle of Worcestre broght aboute the maryage.'{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=172}} She was a greater heiress than might have been expected for a youngest son like John. John was granted seven southern manors by his father and mother, the Earl and [[Alice Montagu, 5th Countess of Salisbury|Countess of Salisbury]], for his part.{{sfn|Hicks|1986|p=323}}{{refn|Although ''cf.'' Hick's ''Warwick the Kingmaker'' (131), in which he states that it was eight manors.|group=note}}\n\nJohn Neville's marriage caused a dispute with [[Margaret of Anjou|Queen Margaret]]: even though Isabel was over fourteen years-old (and therefore of [[legal age]]), the Queen claimed that Isabel was still her [[Ward (law)|ward]]. As a result, Queen Margaret insisted that John pay her a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] for his marriage to Isabel: he was [[Contract|bound]] to pay her \u00a31,000 in ten instalments.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|pp=130\u201331}}\n\n== Wars of the Roses ==\n{{Main|Wars of the Roses}}\nThe king had become incapacitated in August 1453,{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=113}} which had led to the [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Duke of York]] being appointed [[Lord Protector|protector]] and controlling the government.{{sfn|Watts|2004}} By Christmas of 1454, however, King Henry had recovered from his illness, which removed the basis for York's authority.{{sfn|Hicks|2010|p=107}} Having reconvened the court at Westminster by mid-April 1455, Henry and a select council of nobles decided to hold a great council at Leicester. York and the Nevilles anticipated that Somerset would bring charges against them at this assembly. John Neville included,{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} they gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching [[Leicester]], intercepting them at [[St Albans]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|pp=134\u201335}}\n[[File:Castle Gate. Chester 02753.jpg|thumb|The gate of [[Chester Castle]]; John and his brother were imprisoned here for a year.]]\nAlthough only a small affray, it resulted in the deaths of some important people; viz. the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the Earl of Northumberland, and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]].{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset might have been targeted by York, the latter too might have been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers.{{sfn|Armstrong|1960|p=46}} It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke.{{sfn|Lander|1976|p=210 n. 34}} Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing out how Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently shared in the profits of York's redistribution of Skipwith's ex-offices.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}}\n\nIn December 1456, the new [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] tried to attack John Neville in London's [[Cheapside]];{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}} Somerset had already attempted something similar to John's brother Warwick the previous month. John's encounter, reported contemporary [[chroniclers]], would have become a 'skirmish' if the [[Geoffrey Boleyn|mayor]] had not intervened.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=800}} As it had been John who had 'spearheaded' the Neville retaliation to the Percies during their feud, Salisbury entered into a bond for Thomas and John's behaviour on 23 March 1458.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=628}} John, however continued to receive commissions from the government. He was part of a delegation of twenty-two Ambassadors nominated to discuss breaches of the Truce with Burgundy on 14 May that year,{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=150}} and two months later he was investigating the murder of a royal [[Serjeant-at-arms|serjeant]]. In 1459, he was appointed [[steward (office)|steward]] of the [[Honour of Pontefract]].{{sfn|Somerville|1953|p=514}}\n\nReconciliation between the crown and the sons of the dead lords of St Albans on the one half and of York and his Neville allies did not last, however.{{sfn|Pollard|2004}} In mid-September 1459, the Earl of Salisbury, intending to meet York at the latter's castle at [[Ludlow Castle|Ludlow]],{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=145}} marched south from [[Middleham Castle]] with his household, retainers, and a force of around five-thousand men.{{sfn|Hicks|2010|p=143}} John and Thomas were with him.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Salisbury's force was engaged by a much larger royal army under the command of [[James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley|Lord Audley]] on 23 September at [[Battle of Blore Heath|Blore Heath]], near [[Mucklestone]], [[Staffordshire]].{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=103}}{{sfn|Simons|1966|p=38}} Even though he had numerical superiority{{sfn|Harriss|2006|p=639}} the result was defeat for Audley, who was killed.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=145}} However at some point John Neville \u2013 along with his brother [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Thomas]]{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} and their father's [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] [[James Harrington (Yorkist knight)|James Harrington]]{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=272}} were captured. This might have occurred in their pursuit of fleeing Lancastrians{{sfn|Simons|1966|p=53}} the next day{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=272}} or alternatively they may have been injured in battle and had been sent home.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=163}} Either way, captured at [[Acton Bridge]] near [[Tarporley]], Cheshire, the four were imprisoned in [[Chester Castle]].{{sfn|Clayton|1980|p=118}}\n\nJohn Neville was not released until July 1460. As a result, he was not present at the Yorkists' [[rout]] at the [[Battle of Ludford Bridge]], which resulted in his father and brother's exile in [[Calais]]. He had still been [[attainted]] at the [[Parliament of Devils]] in October 1459{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=320 & n. 33}}{{sfn|Ross|1981|p=320}} and only restored in August the next year.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=306}} He was not released until June that year, and remained in London with during York's return from exile, and his claiming of the throne.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=211}} On 1 November 1460,{{sfn|Kendall|1957|p=73}} York appointed John the king's [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] for a crown-wearing ceremony at [[St Paul's Cathedral]].{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=44}} He stayed in London as word arrived that Lancastrians were gathering an army in the north;{{sfn|Watts|2004}} York, Salisbury, and John's brother Thomas marched north to confront them. On 30 December 1460 they went down to a crushing defeat outside York's castle at [[Sandal Castle|Sandal]], at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] where York and Thomas were killed, and Salisbury captured and killed the next day.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}}\n\nJohn Neville appears to have been Lieutenant of the castle of Calais, whilst Warwick served as its [[Captain of Calais|Captain]].{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=112 n. 1}} During the Protector's absence that winter, and after York's and Salisbury's death, alongside his brothers Warwick and George (the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]]) Neville was part of the head of government.{{sfn|Kendall|1957|p=74}}\n\n== Elevation to the peerage and war in the north ==\nAccording to [[Benet's Chronicle|Benet's ''Chronicle'']], John Neville was elevated to the peerage as Lord Montagu in the January 1461 parliament.{{sfn|Benet|1972|p=69}} It was also at this parliament that he presented a petition, regarding his wife, in which he reiterated that in [[common law]] women receive [[Livery#Sue one's livery|livery]] of their lands at fourteen years of age, and he requested parliament to reaffirm this.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1936|p=269}} In February he was elected to the [[Order of the Garter]]. He was installed on 21 March 1462, when he took his father's [[choir stall]] in [[Windsor Castle]]'s [[St. George's Chapel]].{{sfn|St. John Hope|1901|p=68}}\n[[File:Map for Second Battle of St Alban's by Ramsay.jpg|thumb|Map for Second Battle of St Albans by Ramsay.]]\nBy February 1461 Queen Margaret's army was marching south.{{sfn|Cron|1999|p=598}} Warwick and John, with their 'frantically raised' army, collected the King and marched north to confront the Queen's army on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]].{{sfn|Pollard|2007|pp=46\u201347}} The two armies met on 17 February at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]]- this time, just outside the town. In the resulting encounter, Warwick was 'outflanked and now outmatched,'{{sfn|Sadler|2011|p=69}} whereas John seems to have kept his army together up until the point the King's person was regained by the Lancastrians.{{sfn|Kendall|1957|p=84}} Montagu commanded the left [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] of the Yorkist army, which itself was subdivided into a group of archers in the town itself, with the majority posted on [[Bernards Heath]],{{sfn|Haigh|1997|p=48}} stretching eastwards towards Warwick's [[vanguard]].{{sfn|Haigh|1996|p=132}} This 'bloody and bitter' encounter' saw Warwick and John's army defeated.{{sfn|Ross|1986|p=51}} The Earl escaped;{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=148}} Montagu was captured and sent to [[York Castle]].{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} It seems probable that he escaped execution after the battle because, as the [[Milanese duchy|Milanese]] [[Ambassador]] wrote, 'a brother of my [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|lord of Somerset]] is a prisoner [of Warwick's] at Calais.{{sfn|Hinds|1912|p=51}}{{sfn|Burley|Elliot|Watson|2013|p=79}}\n\n[[File:Quartered arms of Sir John Nevill, 1st Marquess of Montagu, KG.png|thumb|Quartered arms of Sir John Neville, Lord Montagu, KG]]\nAs a result of his capture and imprisonment in York, Montagu escaped participation in the biggest and probably bloodiest battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]] which took place on 29 March 1461 at [[Battle of Towton|Towton]] in Yorkshire.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=1}} This decisive Yorkist victory led to Montagu being released the next day, when the son of the Duke of York \u2013 and England's ''de facto'' new king \u2013 [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] entered York in triumph.{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=165}} Montagu and Warwick then missed the King's coronation in April, as they stayed in the north to attempt the recapture of northern castles still in Lancastrian hands;{{sfn|Scofield|1923|pp=186\u201367}} as [[John Gillingham]] has put it, 'the 'unfinished military business would have to be left to the Nevilles.'{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=136}} And on 10 May 1461 Montagu was commissioned to raise troops against both the Lancastrian remnants and the king of Scotland.{{sfn|Booth|1997|p=77}} One of Montagu's first actions was to successfully raise the siege of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], 'with prompt action.'{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=229}} Carlisle had had its suburbs burnt and been under siege from June{{sfn|Summerson|1996|p=90}} by a Scottish-Lancastrian force, but was easily{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=60}} relieved by him,{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=138}} apparently killing 6,000 Scots and Lord Clifford's brother in the process,{{sfn|Summerson|1996|p=89}} before Warwick had even arrived.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=238}}\n\nThe military campaign that followed was focussed on the recapture of strategically vital castles on the Northumbrian border. [[Alnwick Castle]] was commanded by a shell keep, to which extra towers had been added, as well as to the curtain wall, with a solid barbican and gatehouse. [[Bamburgh Castle]] was on a high spur ridge with three [[Ward (castle)|baileys]], a large [[keep]], and fortified gateways.

However, due to commitments in the north with Warwick, Montagu ended up taking no part in this campaign.{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=350}}\n\nIn 1465 Montagu received the main grant of the Percy Earldom of Northumberland estates,{{sfn|N.

This was to repay his [[arrears]] in back wages from his Wardenship of the East March, from an indenture of 1 June 1463.{{sfn|Rose|2011|p=53}} On the same day he was made Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster (north of the [[River Trent|Trent]]),  and it was from the profits of the duchy that his wages were coming from, amounting to approximately \u00a31,000.{{sfn|Arnold|1984|p=136 n.56}}\n\n===Warden of the Marches===\nThe Wardens were the military guardians of the border from the late fourteenth-century,  and their salaries made them the highest-paid among Crown officers, but this was inclusive of the cost of raising troops and maintaining defence. This has also been described as controlling 'private armies raised at the Crown's expense.'{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|pp=29\u201330}} By the mid-fifteenth century, the Wardenship of the East March was the most important of the two northern marcher lordships.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=812}} Marcher Wardens were granted the right to recruit by their being 'explicitly' exempted from the 1468 Statute of Livery,  which restrained- or attempted to restrain- retaining.{{sfn|Hicks|2000|p=395}} Montagu, however, was allowed to continue retaining in times of peace as well as war.{{sfn|Hicks|1991|p=22}} At this point Humphrey Neville was still on the run, and Montagu required troops to be raised on various occasions; in 1467, for example, [[Beverley]] sent him troops to deal with Humphrey's resistance.{{sfn|R. C. H.

In 1469, Warwick organised [[Robin of Redesdale]]'s rebellion against Edward IV in Yorkshire{{sfn|Hicks|1998|pp=264\u201365}} and in July that year the king's brother [[George, Duke of Clarence]] married Warwick's daughter [[Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence|Isabelle]] whilst anchored off [[Calais]]; this was in direct defiance of the king's own wishes.{{sfn|Hicks|1980|pp=42\u201345}} It seems that Montagu, however, reacted strongly against his brother's machinations,{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=265}} and, unlike him, was satisfied with his current position.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|pp=265\u201366}}\n\nOn 27 October 1469, Henry Percy had taken his oath of fealty to the King, and had been released from the Tower.{{sfn|Hardy|1873|p=699}} The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick.{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=488}} Montagu was forced to come down from the Scottish border to suppress it;{{sfn|Haigh|1997|p=190}} this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he 'allowed the leaders to escape&nbsp;... ensuring that the rebellion could rise again' at a more opportune moment.{{sfn|Haigh|1997|p=197}} Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time lead by a [[Robin of Holderness]], but calling for the return of Percy to the Northumberland Earldom.{{sfn|Goodman|1990|p=67}} The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army big enough to march south and defeat a royal force at the [[Battle of Edgecote Moor]] on 26 July 1469.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=145}} King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother's rebellion,{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=79}} and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his journey from the north back to London.{{sfn|Bagley|1948|p=193}}\n\nHowever, it was while Edward was in York that he ordered the rehabilitation of [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]] to his family Earldom on 25/27 March 1470.{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=95}} On the same day John was elevated to the [[Marquess]]ate of Montagu,{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=433}} and now outranked his brother- an Earl- in the [[English peerage]].{{sfn|Hicks|2010|p=195}} Historians have since questioned, however, whether his new title had the gravitas that his previous Earldom had had,{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=175}} and have even suggested that the king was 'walking a tightrope' as to whether Montagu would actually accept it or not.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=310}} To compensate him for the loss of the Percy estates Montagu was granted the lands of the dead [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]],{{sfn|Hicks|1980|p=59}} and Montagu's son, George was created [[Duke of Bedford]]. These were substantial estates,{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=176}} providing an income of at least \u00a3600 per annum.{{sfn|Hicks|1980|p=59}} Montagu was to be the new regional magnate- as he been in the north- to fill an existing power vacuum.{{sfn|Ross|1986|p=82}}\n\n== Rebellion and death ==\nMontagu, though, was not happy with the new arrangements, and King Edward has been held responsible for turning Montagu from a friend to an enemy.{{sfn|Hicks|2010|p=202}} [[Warkworth's Chronicle]] describes him as condemning these grants to him as 'a [mag]pyes] nest.'{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Montagu had been on the Scottish border since at least January 1470.{{sfn|Thornley|1920|p=33}} Following unrest in [[Lincolnshire]] and the subsequent [[1470 Lincolnshire Rebellion|Lincolnshire rebellion]], the king marched from London to crush the rising. This he did at the [[Battle of Empingham]]. Following the battle, Edward headed north where he was met by Montagu and Northumberland at [[Doncaster]].{{sfn|Hicks|1980|p=74}} Warwick and Clarence's involvement in the Lincolnshire uprising had by now been established, and they fled to Calais. Further trouble broke out in the summer of 1470 in the north, with friends and relatives of Warwick in open rebellion.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=182}} The new Earl of Northumberland was unable to put down these risings, so the king, once again marched north to deal with it personally. Modern historians generally consider that these rebellions were a deliberate trap, instigated by Warwick and Clarence from Calais.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=182}} On 24 June 1470 the Wardenship of the East March was stripped from Montagu and given to Percy.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Edward was still in the north with Percy when he received word that the Warwick and Clarence had landed in [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]].{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=152}}\n\nAt [[Doncaster]], the king awaited Montagu, who was in the north raising a substantial force in Edward's name.{{sfn|Goodman|1990|p=250 n.28}} Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, marching to the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the king has been called 'decisive'.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=185}} The king was trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he escaped to [[King's Lynn|Bishop's Lynn]], sailing for Burgundy on 2 October.{{sfn|Ross|1981|p=18}}\n\n===Readeption of Henry VI===\n{{Main|Readeption of King Henry VI}}\nOn 3 October, with Edward IV in exile, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] was released from the Tower and [[Readeption of Henry VI|returned to the throne]] by Warwick. Almost immediately, Montagu was granted the wardship of the executed [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]]'s heir and estates, as well as of the young [[Henry Clifford, 10th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]]. He was reappointed to the Wardenship of the East March, with its salary, on 22 October 1470.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}}\n\nHowever, Montagu did not profit from the new regime as he probably expected to. He did not regain the Earldom of Northumberland. Further, he lost some of the Courtney lands that had come with his Marquessate to the newly returned [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]].{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=297}} Montagu had no active role in government, and does not seem to have sat in Council,{{sfn|Jacob|1993|p=561}} although he was appointed Chamberlain to the King's Household.{{sfn|Scattergood|1971|p=199}} Although he was confirmed in command of the new King's forces in the north{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=543}} and in possession of the manor of Wressle on 21 March 1471,{{sfn|Hardy|1873|p=701}} he did not regain any other Percy estates. Indeed, it has been suggested that his loyalty might still have been suspect by the newly arrived Lancastrians: having been summoned to the November 1470 parliament, Polydor Virgil states that he had to apologise there for his prior support of Edward.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=58}}  Montagu even had to pay cash for the king's pardon,{{sfn|Neillands|1992|p=144}} which he only received after making a lengthy speech, declaring that he had only remained faithful to Edward out of fear.{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=555}}\n\nMontagu, having responsibility for the defence of the north, received various commissions of array, which reflected the government's knowledge that King Edward was equipping a Burgundian-backed fleet in order to re-invade.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=18}}{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=560}} Montagu was to raise men from all across the north.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=157}} On 14 March 1471, King Edward landed at [[Ravenspur]], on the coast of Yorkshire; he had intended to land in [[East Anglia]], but this had been established as being unsafe.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=161\u201363}} Montagu, it has been suggested, could have 'snuffed out' Edward's army almost immediately had he moved fast enough.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=161\u201363}} Montagu was in [[Pontefract Castle]] as Edward passed by (where even his castle [[bailiff]] deserted him for the returning king, taking the castle's funds with him).{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=43}} Montagu's army, composed of local militias, was probably in the region of several thousand men, between 6,000 and 7,000,{{sfn|Weiss|1972|p=506}}{{sfn|Goodman|1990|p=75}} and increased as he trailed Edward south.{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=123}} Montagu arrived at [[Coventry]], where the Earl of Warwick was camped, in early April 1471;{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=79}} this was probably the day after Clarence had defected back to his brother Edward, and taken his army with him.{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=193}}\n\n===Battle of Barnet Heath===\n{{Main|Battle of Barnet}}\nBy 12 April 1471, Montagu, with his brother Warwick and the [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]], the [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]], and [[William Beaumont, 2nd Viscount Beaumont|Viscount Beaumont]] were approaching London with their army.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=167}}\n[[File:Battle of Barnet retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Barnet, as depicted on a 15th-century [[Ghent]] [[manuscript]]]]\nEdward, having arrived in London on 11 April and been reunited with his queen,{{sfn|Horrox|2004a}} met Montagu and Warwick a few miles north of London, outside the village of [[Friern Barnet|Barnet]]. It is possible that he commanded a smaller army, perhaps of only 9,000 men,{{sfn|J. A.

Contemporaries have favourably described Montagu's martial skill at Barnet. [[Philippe de Commines]] called him as 'a very courageous knight,'{{sfn|Gillingham|1990|p=200}} and the Burgundian observer [[Jean de Waurin]] wrote that, in the thick of the fighting, Montagu was 'cutting off arms and heads like a hero of [[Chivalric romance|romance]].'{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=120}}\n\nThe Earl of Oxford, commanding the right wing of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|William, Lord Hastings]], early in the battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up [[looting]] away from the battlefield.{{sfn|Horrox|2004b}} Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, 'disaster struck.' In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's '[[Star (heraldry)|Streaming star]]' banner as the king's '[[Sun (heraldry)|Sunne in splendour]],' and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York.{{sfn|Kendall|1977|p=96}}{{sfn|J. A. Giles|1845|p=124}} Recently though, one historian has pointed out that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a [[Heraldic badge|cognizance]], and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.{{sfn|Ross|2011|p=67}}\n\nAt some point, possibly around this time, Montagu was killed; he was certainly dead before his brother.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=168}} The ''Arrivall'' chronicler states this occurred 'in plain battle,'{{sfn|J.

A. Giles|1845|p=67}} Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to be put in a cart&nbsp;... to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay for three or four days'{{sfn|J.

CAPM assumes a particular form of utility functions (in which only first and second moments matter, that is risk is measured by variance, for example a quadratic utility) or alternatively asset returns whose probability distributions are completely described by the first two moments (for example, the normal distribution) and zero transaction costs (necessary for diversification to get rid of all idiosyncratic risk).

Treynor|Jack Treynor]] (1961, 1962),<ref>{{cite journal |last=French |first=Craig W. |year=2003 |title=The Treynor Capital Asset Pricing Model |journal=Journal of Investment Management |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=60\u201372 |ssrn=447580 }}</ref> [[William F. Sharpe]] (1964), [[John Lintner]] (1965a,b) and [[Jan Mossin]] (1966) independently, building on the earlier work of [[Harry Markowitz]] on [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] and [[modern portfolio theory]].  Sharpe, Markowitz and [[Merton Miller]] jointly received the 1990 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] for this contribution to the field of [[financial economics]].  [[Fischer Black]] (1972) developed another version of CAPM, called Black CAPM or zero-beta CAPM, that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset.  This version was more robust against empirical testing and was influential in the widespread adoption of the CAPM.\n\n==Formula==\n{|align=right\n|<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SecMktLine.png|thumb|center|249px|The security market line, seen here in a graph, describes a relation between the beta and the asset's expected rate of return.]] -->\n|}\nThe CAPM is a model for pricing an individual security or portfolio. For individual securities, we make use of the [[security market line]] (SML) and its relation to expected return and [[systematic risk]] (beta) to show how the market must price individual securities in relation to their security risk class. The SML enables us to calculate the [[Risk\u2013return spectrum|reward-to-risk ratio]] for any security in relation to that of the overall market. Therefore, when the expected rate of return for any security is deflated by its beta coefficient, the reward-to-risk ratio for any individual security in the market is equal to the market reward-to-risk ratio, thus:\n\n: <math>\\frac {E(R_i)- R_f}{\\beta_{i}}  = E(R_m) - R_f   </math>\n\nThe market reward-to-risk ratio is effectively the market [[risk premium]] and by rearranging the above equation and solving for <math>E(R_i)</math>, we obtain the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\n\n: <math>E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_{i}(E(R_m) - R_f)\\,</math>\n\nwhere:\n* <math>E(R_i)~~</math> is the expected return on the capital asset\n* <math>R_f~</math> is the risk-free rate of interest such as interest arising from government bonds\n* <math>\\beta_{i}~~</math> (the ''[[Beta (finance)|beta]]'') is the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of the expected excess asset returns to the expected excess market returns, or also <math>\\beta_{i} = \\frac {\\mathrm{Cov}(R_i,R_m)}{\\mathrm{Var}(R_m)} = \\rho_{i,m} \\frac {\\sigma_{i}}{\\sigma_{m}}</math>\n* <math>E(R_m)~</math> is the expected return of the market\n* <math>E(R_m)-R_f~</math> is sometimes known as the ''market premium'' (the difference between the expected market rate of return and the risk-free rate of return).\n* <math>E(R_i)-R_f~</math> is also known as the ''risk premium''\n* <math> \\rho_{i,m}</math> denotes the [[correlation coefficient]] between the investment <math>i</math> and the market <math>m</math>\n* <math> \\sigma_{i}</math> is the [[standard deviation]] for the investment <math>i</math>\n* <math> \\sigma_{m}</math> is the [[standard deviation]] for the market <math>m</math>.\nRestated, in terms of risk premium, we find that:\n\n: <math>E(R_i) - R_f = \\beta_{i}(E(R_m) - R_f)\\,</math>\n\nwhich states that the ''individual risk premium'' equals the ''market premium'' times ''\u03b2''.\n\nNote 1: the expected market rate of return is usually estimated by measuring the arithmetic average of the historical returns on a market portfolio (e.g. S&P 500).\n\nNote 2: the risk free rate of return used for determining the risk premium is usually the arithmetic average of historical risk free rates of return and not the current risk free rate of return.\n\nFor the full derivation see [[Modern portfolio theory]].\n\n==Modified [[Beta (finance)|Betas]]==\nThere has also been research into a mean-reverting beta often referred to as the adjusted beta, as well as the consumption beta. However, in empirical tests the traditional CAPM model has been found to do as well as or outperform the modified beta models.\n\n==Security market line==\nThe [[Security market line|SML]] essentially graphs the results from the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) formula. The ''x''-axis represents the risk (beta), and the ''y''-axis represents the expected return. The market risk premium is determined from the slope of the SML.\n\nThe relationship between \u03b2 and required return is plotted on the ''securities market line'' (SML), which shows expected return as a function of \u03b2. The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available for the market, while the slope is the market premium, E(''R''<sub>''m''</sub>)\u2212&nbsp;''R''<sub>''f''</sub>. The securities market line can be regarded as representing a single-factor model of the asset price, where Beta is exposure to changes in value of the Market. The equation of the SML is thus:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{SML}: E(R_i)= R_f+\\beta_i (E(R_M) - R_f).~ </math>\n\nIt is a useful tool in determining if an asset being considered for a portfolio offers a reasonable expected return for risk. Individual securities are plotted on the SML graph. If the security's expected return versus risk is plotted above the SML, it is  undervalued since the investor can expect a greater return for the inherent risk. And a security plotted below the SML is overvalued since the investor would be accepting less return for the amount of risk assumed.\n\n==Asset pricing==\nOnce the expected/required rate of return <math>E(R_i)</math> is calculated using CAPM, we can compare this required rate of return to the asset's estimated rate of return over a specific investment horizon to determine whether it would be an appropriate investment. To make this comparison, you need an independent estimate of the return outlook for the security based on either '''fundamental or technical analysis techniques''', including P/E, M/B etc.\n\nAssuming that the CAPM is correct, an asset is correctly priced when its estimated price is the same as the present value of future cash flows of the asset, discounted at the rate suggested by CAPM. If the estimated price is higher than the CAPM valuation, then the asset is undervalued (and overvalued when the estimated price is below the CAPM valuation).<ref name=\"luenberger\">{{cite book|title=Investment Science|last=Luenberger|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-510809-5}}</ref> When the asset does not lie on the SML, this could also suggest mis-pricing. Since the expected return of the asset at time <math>t</math> is <math>E(R_t)=\\frac{E(P_{t+1})-P_t}{P_t}</math>, a higher expected return than what CAPM suggests indicates that <math>P_t</math> is too low (the asset is currently undervalued), assuming that at time <math>t+1</math> the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bodie |first=Z. |last2=Kane |first2=A. |last3=Marcus |first3=A.

Thus, a more risky stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate; less sensitive stocks will have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate.  Given the accepted concave [[utility function]], the CAPM is consistent with intuition\u2014investors (should) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset.\n\nSince beta reflects asset-specific sensitivity to non-diversifiable, i.e. market [[risk]], the market as a whole, by definition, has a beta of one. Stock market indices are frequently used as local proxies for the market\u2014and in that case (by definition) have a beta of one. An investor in a large, diversified portfolio (such as a [[mutual fund]]), therefore, expects performance in line with the market.\n\n==Risk and diversification==\nThe risk of a [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] comprises [[systematic risk]], also known as undiversifiable risk, and [[Specific risk|unsystematic risk]] which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk. Systematic risk refers to the risk common to all securities\u2014i.e. [[market risk]]. Unsystematic risk is the risk associated with individual assets. Unsystematic risk can be [[Diversification (finance)|diversified]] away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio (specific risks \"average out\"). The same is not possible for systematic risk within one market. Depending on the market, a portfolio of approximately 30\u201340 securities in developed markets such as the UK or US will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only. In developing markets a larger number is required, due to the higher asset volatilities.\n\nA rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model.  Therefore, the required [[Return on investment|return]] on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context\u2014i.e. its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness\u2014as opposed to its \"stand alone risk\". In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher [[variance]] i.e. less predictability. In other words, the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor.\n\n==Efficient frontier==\n{{Main|Efficient frontier}}\n[[Image:markowitz frontier.jpg|thumb|269px|The (Markowitz) [[efficient frontier]]. CAL stands for the [[capital allocation line]].]]\nThe CAPM assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized\u2014an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return. Additionally, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, (assuming no trading costs) with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above (assuming that any asset is [[infinite divisibility|infinitely divisible]]).  All such optimal portfolios, i.e., one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier.\n\nBecause the unsystematic risk is [[Diversification (finance)|diversifiable]], the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as [[Beta (finance)|beta]].\n\n== Assumptions ==\n\nAll investors:<ref>{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Glen|title=Corporate financial management|year=2005|publisher=Financial Times/Prentice Hall|location=Harlow [u.a.]|page=354|edition=3.}}</ref>\n\n# Aim to maximize economic utilities (Asset quantities are given and fixed).\n# Are rational and risk-averse.\n# Are broadly diversified across a range of investments.\n# Are price takers, i.e., they cannot influence prices.\n# Can lend and borrow unlimited amounts under the risk free rate of interest.\n# Trade without transaction or taxation costs.\n# Deal with securities that are all highly divisible into small parcels (All assets are perfectly divisible and liquid).\n# Have homogeneous expectations.\n# Assume all information is available at the same time to all investors.\n\n== Problems ==\nIn their 2004 review, economists [[Eugene Fama]] and [[Kenneth French]] argue that \"the failure of the CAPM in empirical tests implies that most applications of the model are invalid\".<ref name=\"FamaFrench2004\" />\n\n* The traditional CAPM using historical data as the inputs to solve for a future return of asset i. However, the history may not be sufficient to use for predicting the future and modern CAPM approaches have used betas that rely on future risk estimates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=French|first1=Jordan|title=Back to the Future Betas: Empirical Asset Pricing of US and Southeast Asian Markets|journal=International Journal of Financial Studies|volume=4|issue=3|page=15|doi=10.3390/ijfs4030015|year=2016}}</ref>\n* Most practitioners and academics agree that risk is of a varying nature (non-constant). A critique of the traditional CAPM is that the risk measure used remains constant (non-varying beta). Recent research has empirically tested time-varying betas to improve the forecast accuracy of the CAPM.<ref>{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Jordan|title=Estimating Time-Varying Beta Coefficients: An Empirical Study of US & ASEAN Portfolios|volume=32|pages=19\u201334|doi=10.1108/S0196-382120160000032002|series=Research in Finance|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78635-156-2}}</ref>\n* The model assumes that the variance of returns is an adequate measurement of risk. This would be implied by the assumption that returns are normally distributed, or indeed are distributed in any two-parameter way, but for general return distributions other risk measures (like [[coherent risk measure]]s) will reflect the active and potential shareholders' preferences more adequately. Indeed, risk in financial investments is not variance in itself, rather it is the probability of losing: it is asymmetric in nature. [[Barclays Wealth]] have published some research on asset allocation with non-normal returns which shows that investors with very low risk tolerances should hold more cash than CAPM suggests.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.barclayswealth.com/Images/asset-allocation-february-2013.pdf | title=News and insight &#124; Wealth Management &#124; Barclays}}</ref>\n* The model assumes that all active and potential shareholders have access to the same information and agree about the risk and expected return of all assets (homogeneous expectations assumption).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n* The model assumes that the probability beliefs of active and potential shareholders match the true distribution of returns. A different possibility is that active and potential shareholders' expectations are biased, causing market prices to be informationally inefficient. This possibility is studied in the field of [[behavioral finance]], which uses psychological assumptions to provide alternatives to the CAPM such as the overconfidence-based asset pricing model of Kent Daniel, [[David Hirshleifer]], and [[Avanidhar Subrahmanyam]] (2001).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Overconfidence, Arbitrage, and Equilibrium Asset Pricing |first=Kent D. |last=Daniel |first2=David |last2=Hirshleifer |first3=Avanidhar |last3=Subrahmanyam |journal=Journal of Finance |volume=56 |issue=3 |year=2001 |pages=921\u2013965 |doi=10.1111/0022-1082.00350 }}</ref>\n* The model does not appear to adequately explain the variation in stock returns.

Sharpe, Markowitz and [[Merton Miller]] jointly received the 1990 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] for this contribution to the field of [[financial economics]].  [[Fischer Black]] (1972) developed another version of CAPM, called Black CAPM or zero-beta CAPM, that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset.  This version was more robust against empirical testing and was influential in the widespread adoption of the CAPM.\n\n==Formula==\n{|align=right\n|<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SecMktLine.png|thumb|center|249px|The security market line, seen here in a graph, describes a relation between the beta and the asset's expected rate of return.]] -->\n|}\nThe CAPM is a model for pricing an individual security or portfolio. For individual securities, we make use of the [[security market line]] (SML) and its relation to expected return and [[systematic risk]] (beta) to show how the market must price individual securities in relation to their security risk class. The SML enables us to calculate the [[Risk\u2013return spectrum|reward-to-risk ratio]] for any security in relation to that of the overall market. Therefore, when the expected rate of return for any security is deflated by its beta coefficient, the reward-to-risk ratio for any individual security in the market is equal to the market reward-to-risk ratio, thus:\n\n: <math>\\frac {E(R_i)- R_f}{\\beta_{i}}  = E(R_m) - R_f   </math>\n\nThe market reward-to-risk ratio is effectively the market [[risk premium]] and by rearranging the above equation and solving for <math>E(R_i)</math>, we obtain the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\n\n: <math>E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_{i}(E(R_m) - R_f)\\,</math>\n\nwhere:\n* <math>E(R_i)~~</math> is the expected return on the capital asset\n* <math>R_f~</math> is the risk-free rate of interest such as interest arising from government bonds\n* <math>\\beta_{i}~~</math> (the ''[[Beta (finance)|beta]]'') is the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of the expected excess asset returns to the expected excess market returns, or also <math>\\beta_{i} = \\frac {\\mathrm{Cov}(R_i,R_m)}{\\mathrm{Var}(R_m)} = \\rho_{i,m} \\frac {\\sigma_{i}}{\\sigma_{m}}</math>\n* <math>E(R_m)~</math> is the expected return of the market\n* <math>E(R_m)-R_f~</math> is sometimes known as the ''market premium'' (the difference between the expected market rate of return and the risk-free rate of return).\n* <math>E(R_i)-R_f~</math> is also known as the ''risk premium''\n* <math> \\rho_{i,m}</math> denotes the [[correlation coefficient]] between the investment <math>i</math> and the market <math>m</math>\n* <math> \\sigma_{i}</math> is the [[standard deviation]] for the investment <math>i</math>\n* <math> \\sigma_{m}</math> is the [[standard deviation]] for the market <math>m</math>.\nRestated, in terms of risk premium, we find that:\n\n: <math>E(R_i) - R_f = \\beta_{i}(E(R_m) - R_f)\\,</math>\n\nwhich states that the ''individual risk premium'' equals the ''market premium'' times ''\u03b2''.\n\nNote 1: the expected market rate of return is usually estimated by measuring the arithmetic average of the historical returns on a market portfolio (e.g. S&P 500).\n\nNote 2: the risk free rate of return used for determining the risk premium is usually the arithmetic average of historical risk free rates of return and not the current risk free rate of return.\n\nFor the full derivation see [[Modern portfolio theory]].\n\n==Modified [[Beta (finance)|Betas]]==\nThere has also been research into a mean-reverting beta often referred to as the adjusted beta, as well as the consumption beta. However, in empirical tests the traditional CAPM model has been found to do as well as or outperform the modified beta models.\n\n==Security market line==\nThe [[Security market line|SML]] essentially graphs the results from the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) formula. The ''x''-axis represents the risk (beta), and the ''y''-axis represents the expected return. The market risk premium is determined from the slope of the SML.\n\nThe relationship between \u03b2 and required return is plotted on the ''securities market line'' (SML), which shows expected return as a function of \u03b2. The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available for the market, while the slope is the market premium, E(''R''<sub>''m''</sub>)\u2212&nbsp;''R''<sub>''f''</sub>. The securities market line can be regarded as representing a single-factor model of the asset price, where Beta is exposure to changes in value of the Market. The equation of the SML is thus:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{SML}: E(R_i)= R_f+\\beta_i (E(R_M) - R_f).~ </math>\n\nIt is a useful tool in determining if an asset being considered for a portfolio offers a reasonable expected return for risk. Individual securities are plotted on the SML graph. If the security's expected return versus risk is plotted above the SML, it is  undervalued since the investor can expect a greater return for the inherent risk. And a security plotted below the SML is overvalued since the investor would be accepting less return for the amount of risk assumed.\n\n==Asset pricing==\nOnce the expected/required rate of return <math>E(R_i)</math> is calculated using CAPM, we can compare this required rate of return to the asset's estimated rate of return over a specific investment horizon to determine whether it would be an appropriate investment. To make this comparison, you need an independent estimate of the return outlook for the security based on either '''fundamental or technical analysis techniques''', including P/E, M/B etc.\n\nAssuming that the CAPM is correct, an asset is correctly priced when its estimated price is the same as the present value of future cash flows of the asset, discounted at the rate suggested by CAPM. If the estimated price is higher than the CAPM valuation, then the asset is undervalued (and overvalued when the estimated price is below the CAPM valuation).<ref name=\"luenberger\">{{cite book|title=Investment Science|last=Luenberger|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-510809-5}}</ref> When the asset does not lie on the SML, this could also suggest mis-pricing. Since the expected return of the asset at time <math>t</math> is <math>E(R_t)=\\frac{E(P_{t+1})-P_t}{P_t}</math>, a higher expected return than what CAPM suggests indicates that <math>P_t</math> is too low (the asset is currently undervalued), assuming that at time <math>t+1</math> the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bodie |first=Z. |last2=Kane |first2=A. |last3=Marcus |first3=A.

Thus, a more risky stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate; less sensitive stocks will have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate.  Given the accepted concave [[utility function]], the CAPM is consistent with intuition\u2014investors (should) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset.\n\nSince beta reflects asset-specific sensitivity to non-diversifiable, i.e. market [[risk]], the market as a whole, by definition, has a beta of one. Stock market indices are frequently used as local proxies for the market\u2014and in that case (by definition) have a beta of one. An investor in a large, diversified portfolio (such as a [[mutual fund]]), therefore, expects performance in line with the market.\n\n==Risk and diversification==\nThe risk of a [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] comprises [[systematic risk]], also known as undiversifiable risk, and [[Specific risk|unsystematic risk]] which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk. Systematic risk refers to the risk common to all securities\u2014i.e. [[market risk]]. Unsystematic risk is the risk associated with individual assets. Unsystematic risk can be [[Diversification (finance)|diversified]] away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio (specific risks \"average out\"). The same is not possible for systematic risk within one market. Depending on the market, a portfolio of approximately 30\u201340 securities in developed markets such as the UK or US will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only. In developing markets a larger number is required, due to the higher asset volatilities.\n\nA rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model.  Therefore, the required [[Return on investment|return]] on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context\u2014i.e. its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness\u2014as opposed to its \"stand alone risk\". In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher [[variance]] i.e. less predictability. In other words, the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor.\n\n==Efficient frontier==\n{{Main|Efficient frontier}}\n[[Image:markowitz frontier.jpg|thumb|269px|The (Markowitz) [[efficient frontier]]. CAL stands for the [[capital allocation line]].]]\nThe CAPM assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized\u2014an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return. Additionally, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, (assuming no trading costs) with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above (assuming that any asset is [[infinite divisibility|infinitely divisible]]).  All such optimal portfolios, i.e., one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier.\n\nBecause the unsystematic risk is [[Diversification (finance)|diversifiable]], the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as [[Beta (finance)|beta]].\n\n== Assumptions ==\n\nAll investors:<ref>{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Glen|title=Corporate financial management|year=2005|publisher=Financial Times/Prentice Hall|location=Harlow [u.a.]|page=354|edition=3.}}</ref>\n\n# Aim to maximize economic utilities (Asset quantities are given and fixed).\n# Are rational and risk-averse.\n# Are broadly diversified across a range of investments.\n# Are price takers, i.e., they cannot influence prices.\n# Can lend and borrow unlimited amounts under the risk free rate of interest.\n# Trade without transaction or taxation costs.\n# Deal with securities that are all highly divisible into small parcels (All assets are perfectly divisible and liquid).\n# Have homogeneous expectations.\n# Assume all information is available at the same time to all investors.\n\n== Problems ==\nIn their 2004 review, economists [[Eugene Fama]] and [[Kenneth French]] argue that \"the failure of the CAPM in empirical tests implies that most applications of the model are invalid\".<ref name=\"FamaFrench2004\" />\n\n* The traditional CAPM using historical data as the inputs to solve for a future return of asset i. However, the history may not be sufficient to use for predicting the future and modern CAPM approaches have used betas that rely on future risk estimates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=French|first1=Jordan|title=Back to the Future Betas: Empirical Asset Pricing of US and Southeast Asian Markets|journal=International Journal of Financial Studies|volume=4|issue=3|page=15|doi=10.3390/ijfs4030015|year=2016}}</ref>\n* Most practitioners and academics agree that risk is of a varying nature (non-constant). A critique of the traditional CAPM is that the risk measure used remains constant (non-varying beta). Recent research has empirically tested time-varying betas to improve the forecast accuracy of the CAPM.<ref>{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Jordan|title=Estimating Time-Varying Beta Coefficients: An Empirical Study of US & ASEAN Portfolios|volume=32|pages=19\u201334|doi=10.1108/S0196-382120160000032002|series=Research in Finance|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78635-156-2}}</ref>\n* The model assumes that the variance of returns is an adequate measurement of risk. This would be implied by the assumption that returns are normally distributed, or indeed are distributed in any two-parameter way, but for general return distributions other risk measures (like [[coherent risk measure]]s) will reflect the active and potential shareholders' preferences more adequately. Indeed, risk in financial investments is not variance in itself, rather it is the probability of losing: it is asymmetric in nature. [[Barclays Wealth]] have published some research on asset allocation with non-normal returns which shows that investors with very low risk tolerances should hold more cash than CAPM suggests.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.barclayswealth.com/Images/asset-allocation-february-2013.pdf | title=News and insight &#124; Wealth Management &#124; Barclays}}</ref>\n* The model assumes that all active and potential shareholders have access to the same information and agree about the risk and expected return of all assets (homogeneous expectations assumption).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n* The model assumes that the probability beliefs of active and potential shareholders match the true distribution of returns. A different possibility is that active and potential shareholders' expectations are biased, causing market prices to be informationally inefficient. This possibility is studied in the field of [[behavioral finance]], which uses psychological assumptions to provide alternatives to the CAPM such as the overconfidence-based asset pricing model of Kent Daniel, [[David Hirshleifer]], and [[Avanidhar Subrahmanyam]] (2001).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Overconfidence, Arbitrage, and Equilibrium Asset Pricing |first=Kent D. |last=Daniel |first2=David |last2=Hirshleifer |first3=Avanidhar |last3=Subrahmanyam |journal=Journal of Finance |volume=56 |issue=3 |year=2001 |pages=921\u2013965 |doi=10.1111/0022-1082.00350 }}</ref>\n* The model does not appear to adequately explain the variation in stock returns.  Empirical studies show that low beta stocks may offer higher returns than the model would predict. Some data to this effect was presented as early as a 1969 conference in [[Buffalo, New York]] in a paper by [[Fischer Black]], [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]], and [[Myron Scholes]].

Although the Lagrange point is just a point in empty space, its peculiar characteristic is that it can be orbited. Halo orbits can be thought of as resulting from an interaction between the gravitational pull of the two planetary bodies and the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]] and [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal accelerations]] on a spacecraft. Halo orbits exist in any three-body system, e.g., the [[Sun]]\u2013[[Earth]]\u2013Orbiting Satellite system or the Earth\u2013[[Moon]]\u2013Orbiting Satellite system. Continuous \"families\" of both Northern and Southern halo orbits exist at each Lagrange point. Because halo orbits tend to be unstable, [[Orbital station-keeping|stationkeeping]] is required to keep a satellite on the orbit.\n\nMost satellites in halo orbit serve scientific purposes, for example as [[space telescope]]s.\n\n== Definition and history ==\n{{multiple image | align =right| direction = vertical| width = \n| header = Animation of SOHO{{'s}} trajectory \n| image1 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Polar view.gif\n| caption1 = Polar view\n| image2 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Equatorial view.gif \n| caption2 = Equatorial view\n| footer ={{legend2| RoyalBlue| Earth}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Magenta| SOHO}}\n}}\n[[Robert W.

W.: \"The Control and Use of Libration-Point Satellites\", Ph.D. Dissertation, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, Stanford, California, 1968</ref> Farquhar advocated using spacecraft in a halo orbit on the [[far side of the Moon]] (Earth\u2013Moon {{L2|nolink=yes}}) as a communications relay station for an [[Apollo program|Apollo]] mission to the far side of the Moon. A spacecraft in such a halo orbit would be in continuous view of both the Earth and the far side of the Moon. In the end, no relay satellite was launched for Apollo, since all landings were on the near side of the Moon.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680015886_1968015886.pdf | title=Lunar Far-Side Communication Satellites | last1=Schmid | first1=P.

It traveled to the Sun\u2013Earth {{L1|nolink=yes}} point and remained there for several years. The next mission to use a halo orbit was [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO), a joint [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and [[NASA]] mission to study the Sun, which arrived at Sun\u2013Earth {{L1|nolink=yes}} in 1996.

Although the Lagrange point is just a point in empty space, its peculiar characteristic is that it can be orbited. Halo orbits can be thought of as resulting from an interaction between the gravitational pull of the two planetary bodies and the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]] and [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal accelerations]] on a spacecraft. Halo orbits exist in any three-body system, e.g., the [[Sun]]\u2013[[Earth]]\u2013Orbiting Satellite system or the Earth\u2013[[Moon]]\u2013Orbiting Satellite system. Continuous \"families\" of both Northern and Southern halo orbits exist at each Lagrange point. Because halo orbits tend to be unstable, [[Orbital station-keeping|stationkeeping]] is required to keep a satellite on the orbit.\n\nMost satellites in halo orbit serve scientific purposes, for example as [[space telescope]]s.\n\n== Definition and history ==\n{{multiple image | align =right| direction = vertical| width = \n| header = Animation of SOHO{{'s}} trajectory \n| image1 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Polar view.gif\n| caption1 = Polar view\n| image2 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Equatorial view.gif \n| caption2 = Equatorial view\n| footer ={{legend2| RoyalBlue| Earth}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Magenta| SOHO}}\n}}\n[[Robert W. Farquhar]] first used the name \"halo\" for these orbits in his 1968 Ph.D. thesis.<ref>Farquhar, R. W.: \"The Control and Use of Libration-Point Satellites\", Ph.D. Dissertation, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, Stanford, California, 1968</ref> Farquhar advocated using spacecraft in a halo orbit on the [[far side of the Moon]] (Earth\u2013Moon {{L2|nolink=yes}}) as a communications relay station for an [[Apollo program|Apollo]] mission to the far side of the Moon. A spacecraft in such a halo orbit would be in continuous view of both the Earth and the far side of the Moon. In the end, no relay satellite was launched for Apollo, since all landings were on the near side of the Moon.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680015886_1968015886.pdf | title=Lunar Far-Side Communication Satellites | last1=Schmid | first1=P.
