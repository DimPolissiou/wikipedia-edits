{"title_page": "Violence against Muslims in India", "text_new": "Can we spread love & peace over all this nonsense.\n\n==Manifestation==\nViolence against Muslims is frequently in the form of mob attacks on [[Muslim]]s by [[Hindu]]s.{{sfn|Brass|2003|p=65|quote=Deaths in Hindu-Muslim riots have three sources: \"Mob action\", \"police killings\" and \"isolated incidents\". \"Mob action\" may take the form of confrontations between gangs or crowds from different communities or segments of them, armed with sticks, knives, swords, and occasionally bombs and small weapons, and kerosene. It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ... 'Hindu-Muslim riots and anti-Muslim pogroms have been endemic in India since independence.'\"}} These attacks are referred to as [[Communal violence|communal riots]] in India and are seen to be part of a pattern of sporadic [[sectarian violence]] between the majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, and have also been connected to a rise in [[Islamophobia]] throughout the 20th century.{{sfn|Herman|2006|p=65}} Most incidents have occurred in the northern and western states of India, whereas communalist sentiment in the south is less pronounced.{{sfn|Cohen|2013|p=66}} Among the largest incidents were [[Great Calcutta killings]] in 1946, [[Noakhali riots#Repercussions in Bihar|Bihar]] and Garmukhteshwar in 1946 after [[Noakhali riot]] in East Bengal, the massacre of Muslims in [[Jammu Division|Jammu]] in 1947, large-scale killing of Muslims following the [[Operation Polo]] in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], anti-Muslim riots in Kolkata in the aftermath of [[1950 Barisal Riots]] and [[1964 East-Pakistan riots]], [[1969 Gujarat riots]], [[1984 Bhiwandi riot]], [[1985 Gujarat riots]], [[1989 Bhagalpur riots]], [[Bombay riots]],  [[Nellie massacre|Nellie]] in 1983{{sfn|Ganguly|2007|p=135}} and [[2002 Gujarat violence|Gujarat riot]] in 2002 and [[2013 Muzaffarnagar riots]].\n\nThese patterns of violence have been well-established since partition, with dozens of studies documenting instances of mass violence against minority groups.{{sfn|Pennington|2012|p=32}} Over 10,000 people have been killed in Hindu-Muslim communal violence since 1950.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} According to official figures, there were 6,933 instances of communal violence between 1954 and 1982 and, between 1968 and 1980, there were 530 Hindus and 1,598 Muslims killed in a total of 3,949 instances of mass violence.{{sfn|Brass|2003|p=60}}\n\nIn 1989, there were incidents of mass violence throughout the north of India.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}}  [[Praveen Swami]] believes these periodic acts of violence have \"scarred India's post independence history\" and have also hindered India's cause in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] with regard to the [[Kashmir conflict]].{{sfn|Swami|2006|p=217}}\n\nIn 2017, IndiaSpend reported that 84% of the victims of [[cow vigilante violence in India since 2014|cow vigilante violence in India]] from 2010 to 2017 were Muslims, and almost 97% of these attacks were reported after May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Ojaswi|last2=Abraham|first2=Delna|title=86% Dead In Cow-Related Violence Since 2010 Are Muslim; 97% Attacks After 2014|url=http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/86-dead-in-cow-related-violence-since-2010-are-muslim-97-attacks-after-2014-2014|website=IndiaSpend.com|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=28 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilkes \n|first1=Tommy|last2=Srivastava|first2=Roli|title=Protests held across India after attacks against Muslims|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/india-protests/protests-held-across-india-after-attacks-against-muslims-idINKBN19J2C3|website=Reuters|accessdate=11 March 2020|date=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Causes and effects==\n{{location map+|India|float=right|width=400|caption=Location of incidents.

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to [[globalization]] and [[investment]] from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.{{sfn|Price|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe actions of anti-Hindu and [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-India militant groups]] in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] and Pakistan have reinforced anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right. The [[Hindutva]] discourse portrays Muslims as traitors and state enemies, whose patriotism is suspected.{{sfn|Sikand|2006|p=88}} [[Sumit Ganguly]] argues that the rise in terrorism cannot only be attributed to [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors, but also to the violence perpetrated by Hindutva forces.{{sfn|Ganguly|2003|p=10}}\n\n==Major incidents==\n\n===1964 Kolkata===\nRiots between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s had left over a hundred people dead, 438 people were injured. Over 7000 people were arrested. 70,000 Muslims have fled their homes and 55,000 were provided protection by the [[Indian army]]. Muslims in Kolkata became more ghettoized than ever before in the aftermath of this riot. The riot was believed to be instigated by violence against Hindus in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh) and the flow of refugees from there. Violence was also seen in rural [[West Bengal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1964: Riots in Calcutta leave more than 100 dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4098000/4098363.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1983 Nellie massacre===\nIn the state of [[Assam]] in 1983 the [[Nellie massacre]] occurred. Nearly 1,800 Muslims of Bengali origin were slaughtered by [[Lalung]] tribespeople (also known as Tiwa) at a village called Nellie.{{sfn|Hazarika|1984}}{{sfn|Kokrajhar|Dhubri|2012}} It has been described as one of the most severe massacres since [[World War II]] with the majority of victims being women and children, as a result of the actions of the [[Assam Movement]].{{sfn|Ghosh|2004|p=312}}{{sfn|Hussain|2009|p=261}}\n\nOne reason cited for this incident is that it resulted from a build-up of resentment over immigration.{{sfn|Datta|2012|p=183}} The Assam movement insisted on striking the names of [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from the electoral register and their deportation from the state. There was widespread support for the movement, which tapered off between 1981 and 1982.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=481}}\n\nThe movement demanded that anyone who had entered the state illegally since 1951 be deported.  The central government, however, insisted on a cutoff date of 1971. Towards the end of 1982, the central government called elections and the movement called for people to [[boycott]] it, which led to the widespread violence.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=418}}\n\nThe official Tiwari Commission report on the Nellie massacre is still a closely guarded secret (only three copies exist).<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=feb1908/at02|title=83 polls were a mistake: KPS Gill|publisher=Assam Tribune|date= 18 February 2008|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> The 600-page report was submitted to the Assam Government in 1984 and the Congress Government (headed by [[Hiteswar Saikia]]) decided not to make it public, and subsequent Governments followed suit.<ref name=\"Tehelka\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|title=An Untold Shame|last=Rehman|first=Teresa|publisher=Tehelka Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111192753/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|archive-date=11 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Assam United Democratic Front]] and others are making legal efforts to make Tiwari Commission report public, so that reasonable justice is delivered to victims, at least after 25 years after the incident.<ref>{{cite news | last =Reporter | first =Staff | title =Flashback to Nellie Horror:AUDF to move court for probe report | newspaper =The Telegraph | date =19 February 2008 | url =http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080219/jsp/guwahati/story_8920369.jsp |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince, then there have been no instances of communal violence in [[Upper Assam Division|Upper Assam]].{{sfn|Saikia|2005|p=65}}\n\n===1969 to 1989===\nDuring the [[1969 Gujarat riots]], it is estimated that 630 people lost their lives.{{sfn|Khalidi|2009|p=180}} The [[1970 Bhiwandi Riots]] was an instance of anti-Muslim violence which occurred between 7 and 8 May in the Indian towns of Bhiwandi, Jalgaon and Mahad. There were large amounts of arson and vandalism of Muslim-owned properties. In 1980 in Moradabad, an estimated 2,500 people were killed.  The official estimate is 400 and other observers estimate between 1,500 and 2,000. Local police were directly implicated in planning the violence.{{sfn|Engineer|1991|p=209}} In 1989 in Bhagalpur, it is estimated nearly 1,000 people lost their lives in violent attacks,{{sfn|Khalidi|2009|p=180}} believed to be a result of tensions raised over the [[Ayodhya dispute]] and the processions carried out by VHP activists, which were to be a show of strength and to serve as a warning to the minority communities.{{sfn|Berglund|2011|p=105}}\n\n===1987 Hashimpura massacre===\n{{main|Hashimpura massacre}}\n[[Hashimpura massacre]] happened on 22 May 1987, during the [[1987 Meerut Riots|Hindu-Muslim riots]] in [[Meerut]] city in [[Uttar Pradesh]] state, India, when 19 personnel of the [[Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary|Provincial Armed Constabulary]] (PAC) allegedly rounded up 42 Muslim youth from the Hashimpura ''[[mohalla]]'' (locality) of the city, took them in truck to the outskirts, near [[Murad Nagar]], in [[Ghaziabad district, India|Ghaziabad district]], where they were shot and their bodies were [[Dump job#Police usage|dumped]] in water canals.

It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ...

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to [[globalization]] and [[investment]] from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.{{sfn|Price|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe actions of anti-Hindu and [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-India militant groups]] in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] and Pakistan have reinforced anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right. The [[Hindutva]] discourse portrays Muslims as traitors and state enemies, whose patriotism is suspected.{{sfn|Sikand|2006|p=88}} [[Sumit Ganguly]] argues that the rise in terrorism cannot only be attributed to [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors, but also to the violence perpetrated by Hindutva forces.{{sfn|Ganguly|2003|p=10}}\n\n==Major incidents==\n\n===1964 Kolkata===\nRiots between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s had left over a hundred people dead, 438 people were injured. Over 7000 people were arrested. 70,000 Muslims have fled their homes and 55,000 were provided protection by the [[Indian army]]. Muslims in Kolkata became more ghettoized than ever before in the aftermath of this riot. The riot was believed to be instigated by violence against Hindus in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh) and the flow of refugees from there. Violence was also seen in rural [[West Bengal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1964: Riots in Calcutta leave more than 100 dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4098000/4098363.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1983 Nellie massacre===\nIn the state of [[Assam]] in 1983 the [[Nellie massacre]] occurred. Nearly 1,800 Muslims of Bengali origin were slaughtered by [[Lalung]] tribespeople (also known as Tiwa) at a village called Nellie.{{sfn|Hazarika|1984}}{{sfn|Kokrajhar|Dhubri|2012}} It has been described as one of the most severe massacres since [[World War II]] with the majority of victims being women and children, as a result of the actions of the [[Assam Movement]].{{sfn|Ghosh|2004|p=312}}{{sfn|Hussain|2009|p=261}}\n\nOne reason cited for this incident is that it resulted from a build-up of resentment over immigration.{{sfn|Datta|2012|p=183}} The Assam movement insisted on striking the names of [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from the electoral register and their deportation from the state. There was widespread support for the movement, which tapered off between 1981 and 1982.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=481}}\n\nThe movement demanded that anyone who had entered the state illegally since 1951 be deported.  The central government, however, insisted on a cutoff date of 1971. Towards the end of 1982, the central government called elections and the movement called for people to [[boycott]] it, which led to the widespread violence.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=418}}\n\nThe official Tiwari Commission report on the Nellie massacre is still a closely guarded secret (only three copies exist).<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=feb1908/at02|title=83 polls were a mistake: KPS Gill|publisher=Assam Tribune|date= 18 February 2008|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> The 600-page report was submitted to the Assam Government in 1984 and the Congress Government (headed by [[Hiteswar Saikia]]) decided not to make it public, and subsequent Governments followed suit.<ref name=\"Tehelka\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|title=An Untold Shame|last=Rehman|first=Teresa|publisher=Tehelka Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111192753/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|archive-date=11 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Assam United Democratic Front]] and others are making legal efforts to make Tiwari Commission report public, so that reasonable justice is delivered to victims, at least after 25 years after the incident.<ref>{{cite news | last =Reporter | first =Staff | title =Flashback to Nellie Horror:AUDF to move court for probe report | newspaper =The Telegraph | date =19 February 2008 | url =http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080219/jsp/guwahati/story_8920369.jsp |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince, then there have been no instances of communal violence in [[Upper Assam Division|Upper Assam]].{{sfn|Saikia|2005|p=65}}\n\n===1969 to 1989===\nDuring the [[1969 Gujarat riots]], it is estimated that 630 people lost their lives.{{sfn|Khalidi|2009|p=180}} The [[1970 Bhiwandi Riots]] was an instance of anti-Muslim violence which occurred between 7 and 8 May in the Indian towns of Bhiwandi, Jalgaon and Mahad.

In 1803 a government stock farm was established in what was to become the Riverstone/Marsden Park area, on the basis of the abundant water supply and good grazing land there. In 1810 Lieut-Col [[Maurice Charles O'Connell]] was granted 2,500 acres (10&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land in the district, which he named \"Riverston Farm\", after his birthplace in Ireland. (The \"e\" at the end first appeared on railway timetables in the 1860s, an apparent  misprint that has become the accepted spelling, although the name is still pronounced as though the \"e\" is not present).\n\nOriginally, beef cattle farmed in the area were driven overland to the [[Hawkesbury River]] for transport by sailing ship to the convict settlement at [[Sydney Cove]]. The construction of the Sydney to Richmond Railway line in the 1864 both eliminated the need for this and opened up the region to non-rural development. \nAn important meatworks was established there in 1878, undergoing various stages of rebuilding and expansion until it closed permanently in 1992.\n\nIn 1970, a major fire at the Riverstone Meatworks killed six men, who were attempting to lead the animals to safety.\n\nIn 1988, as part of a Federal Government programme to commemorate the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia, a heritage museum was established in the old Masonic hall.\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nRiverstone has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Riverstone Parade: [[Riverstone railway station]]<ref name=nswshr-1237>{{cite NSW SHR|5012209|Riverstone Railway Station Group and Residence|hr=01237|fn=H08/00175/1, 10/06094|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n* West Parade: [[House]] \n\n* Railway Terrace: [[Riverstone Railway Station]]\n\n==Developments==\n[[Image:Riverstone terrace.jpg|thumb|Riverstone Terrace]]\n\nIn the 1880s O'Connell's widow subdivided and sold off most of the original grant, and a pattern of intersecting streets was laid out, mostly named after famous streets in [[London]] (e.g. Piccadilly Street, Gladstone Parade etc.).

From dawn to about 9pm, commuter trains to Sydney leave at approximately 30 minute intervals, in most cases coinciding with the arrival of a train from Sydney. They stay for two minutes because the next station, Vineyard, is single platform. After that they shift to an hourly schedule. Depending on the hour, train services running through Riverstone offer a varying number of \"limited stops\" to the Sydney CBD and the majority then continue over the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] to the North Shore line and Hornsby or Berowra. Apart from the city stations, transfer to most other lines is easily made at Strathfield, Redfern or Parramatta, and other stops that offer fewer choices. The peak-hour journey from Riverstone to Central takes a little over an hour, and another 20 minutes to the popular destination of [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]]. Buses at Riverstone are run by Busways with route 757 that goes to Mount Druitt and 747 to Marsden Park and Rouse Hill.\n\nDevelopments at the Garfield Rd traffic lights adjacent to the Railway Station have caused massive traffic disruptions.<ref>http://rouse-hill-times.whereilive.com.au/news/story/outrage-at-riverstone-lights/</ref>\n\nRiverstone is one of the few suburbs left in the Sydney region with a level crossing with old-fashioned boom gates. This view looking west onto the undeveloped flood-prone paddocks is popular with Sydney film and TV commercial makers as a stand-in for a small country railway station. The final parting scene in the film [[Beneath Clouds]] was shot there.\n\nThe [[Westlink M7|M7 Motorway]] can be accessed by the Richmond Road ramp to provide faster access from Riverstone to the City. Riverstone and surrounding suburbs have a continuous motorway link to [[Sydney Airport]] via the [[Lane Cove Tunnel]].\n\nTallawong [[Sydney Metro|Metro]] Station is located just 10 minutes by car from Riverstone's CBD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Riverstone+NSW/Tallawong,+Rouse+Hill+NSW+2155/@-33.6858155,150.8660128,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b129e3951bc8b71:0x5017d681632c880!2m2!1d150.8594!2d-33.6819!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b129efe3561808d:0xfbf948ad4581d955!2m2!1d150.9060436!2d-33.6916153!3e0|title=Riverstone to Tallawong|website=Riverstone to Tallawong|language=en|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref>\n\n== National Broadband Network (NBN) ==\nRiverstone was named<ref name=\"Geographical rollout\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbn.gov.au/content/geographical-rollout |publisher= Australian Government |title=Geographical rollout of NBN|accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> as one of the second release sites in the rollout of the optical fibre [[National Broadband Network]].

From dawn to about 9pm, commuter trains to Sydney leave at approximately 30 minute intervals, in most cases coinciding with the arrival of a train from Sydney. They stay for two minutes because the next station, Vineyard, is single platform. After that they shift to an hourly schedule. Depending on the hour, train services running through Riverstone offer a varying number of \"limited stops\" to the Sydney CBD and the majority then continue over the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] to the North Shore line and Hornsby or Berowra. Apart from the city stations, transfer to most other lines is easily made at Strathfield, Redfern or Parramatta, and other stops that offer fewer choices. The peak-hour journey from Riverstone to Central takes a little over an hour, and another 20 minutes to the popular destination of [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]]. Buses at Riverstone are run by Busways with route 757 that goes to Mount Druitt and 747 to Marsden Park and Rouse Hill.\n\nDevelopments at the Garfield Rd traffic lights adjacent to the Railway Station have caused massive traffic disruptions.<ref>http://rouse-hill-times.whereilive.com.au/news/story/outrage-at-riverstone-lights/</ref>\n\nRiverstone is one of the few suburbs left in the Sydney region with a level crossing with old-fashioned boom gates. This view looking west onto the undeveloped flood-prone paddocks is popular with Sydney film and TV commercial makers as a stand-in for a small country railway station. The final parting scene in the film [[Beneath Clouds]] was shot there.\n\nThe [[Westlink M7|M7 Motorway]] can be accessed by the Richmond Road ramp to provide faster access from Riverstone to the City. Riverstone and surrounding suburbs have a continuous motorway link to [[Sydney Airport]] via the [[Lane Cove Tunnel]].\n\nTallawong [[Sydney Metro|Metro]] Station is located just 10 minutes by car from Riverstone's CBD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Riverstone+NSW/Tallawong,+Rouse+Hill+NSW+2155/@-33.6858155,150.8660128,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b129e3951bc8b71:0x5017d681632c880!2m2!1d150.8594!2d-33.6819!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b129efe3561808d:0xfbf948ad4581d955!2m2!1d150.9060436!2d-33.6916153!3e0|title=Riverstone to Tallawong|website=Riverstone to Tallawong|language=en|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref>\n\n== National Broadband Network (NBN) ==\nRiverstone was named<ref name=\"Geographical rollout\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbn.gov.au/content/geographical-rollout |publisher= Australian Government |title=Geographical rollout of NBN|accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> as one of the second release sites in the rollout of the optical fibre [[National Broadband Network]].

A naval squadron commanded by the British officer [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]], on behalf of Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]], regent for the rightful Queen [[Maria II]], defeated the navy of the usurper Dom [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]].\n\n==Background==\nWhile serving in the [[Azores]], Napier had come to know members of the exiled Portuguese liberals, who had offered him command of the small fleet serving Dom Pedro, which largely consisted of a few old men-o'-war and some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833 Napier accepted their proposals, in succession to another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as Admiral of Pedro's navy. Using the name 'Carlos de Ponza' in a transparent attempt to disguise his identity as a British officer to escape penalties under the [[Foreign Enlistment Act 1819|Foreign Enlistment Act]], in June 1833 Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off Oporto. ('Carlos de Ponza' = Charles of Ponza; one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic War]] had been the capture of the island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813). Dom Pedro, currently being besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as Vice Admiral, Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored the situation in the fleet, which had been close to mutiny because of lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'' 46, commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he sailed from Oporto with his small fleet, transporting the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the constitutional army to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country and march on [[Lisbon]]. After successfully disembarking this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel off Cape St Vincent on 3 July 1833, and after two days of maneuvering in calm and very light winds he brought them to action.\n\n==The battle==\nNapier\u2019s command was essentially a mere squadron of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. (He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as tugs, but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last engagement of consequence between two fleets of sailing warships.) On 5 July the wind eventually got up and at 4.00 p.m. he attacked the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] force of 3 [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], 3 corvettes and 2 brigs, mounting altogether 372 guns. Knowing he could not long sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier closed against enemy fire and boarded, so that the battle was decided in hand-to-hand fighting. In the event the Liberal forces captured all three ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose crews agreed to fight from now on for [[Maria II]]; another ship came over the next day; the remnant of the Miguelite force fled to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed (including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains) and about 60 wounded (including Charles Elers Napier), as against somewhere between 200 and 300 of the enemy, including the Miguelite commander, Admiral [[Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros]]. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the peerage of Portugal. Immediately afterwards his fleet was ravaged by [[cholera]] (which was raging on mainland Portugal), with appalling loss of life, but he was able to bring it safe into Lisbon, which the Miguelistas had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] of the British navy who was in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[France|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the Battle, largely won by British officers and crews fighting for Maria II, was viewed in [[England]] as bringing honour to the British navy. The sea victory, making possible the capture of Lisbon from the Miguelites, was the single most important event contributing to Miguel's eventual defeat and overthrow in 1834.\n\n== Ships involved ==\n===Loyalist fleet (Charles Napier)===\n''Rainha de Portugal'' 46 (flag, commodore Wilkinson, captain MacDonough)<br>\n[[Asia (1797 ship)|''Dona Maria'']] 42 (Peake)<br>\n''Dom Pedro'' 50 (Thomas Goble)<br>\n''Vila Flor'' 18 (Ruxton)<br>\n''Portuense'' 20 (Blackstone)<br>\n''Faro'' 6<br>\na few steam tugs and transports\n\n===Miguelite fleet (Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros)===\n''Nau Rainha'' 74 (Barradas) - Captured by ''Rainha de Portugal''<br>\n''Dom Jo\u00e3o'' 74 - Captured<br>\n''Martinho de Freitas'' 50 - Captured<br>\n''Duquesa da Bragan\u00e7a'' 56 - Captured by ''Dona Maria''<br>\n''Isabel Maria'' 22 (corvette) - Captured<br>\n''Princesa Real'' 24 (corvette)<br>\n''Tejo'' 20 (corvette)<br>\n''Sybille'' 20 (corvette)<br>\n''Audaz'' 18 (brig)<br>\n''Activa'' (xebec)<br>\nseveral other brigs\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (disambiguation)]], for several other naval battles of Cape St Vincent, the best known in [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|1797]]\n\n==Sources==\nMain source for this entry is Napier's own narrative of the battle in his ''An Account of the War in Portugal between Dom Pedro and Dom Miguel'' (London, 1836)\n\n{{coord missing|Portugal}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1833|Cape St. Vincent (1833)]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of the Liberal Wars|Cape St. Vincent]]\n[[Category:1833 in Portugal]]\n[[Category:July 1833 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{One source|article|date=July 2009}}\n{{For|other battles in the same place|Battle of Cape St. Vincent (disambiguation){{!}}Battle of Cape St. Vincent}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Battle of Cape St. Vincent\n|partof= the [[Liberal Wars]]\n|campaign=\n|image= BatalhaCaboS.Vicente.jpg\n|image_size = 300\n|caption=The ''Battle of Cape St. Vincent'' by [[Antoine L\u00e9on Morel-Fatio|L\u00e9on Morel-Fatio]]\n|date=July 5, 1833\n|place=off [[Cape St. Vincent]], [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|result=Decisive Loyalist victory\n|combatant1={{flagdeco|Portugal|1830}} [[Liberalism|Loyalists]]\n|combatant2={{flagdeco|Portugal|1707}} [[Miguelist|Miguelites]]\n|commander1={{flagdeco|Portugal|1830}} [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]] \n|commander2={{flagdeco|Portugal|1707}} Manuel Marreiros\n|strength1=3 frigates<br>1 corvette<br>1 brig<br>1 schooner\n|strength2=3 ships of the line<br>1 frigate<br>1 xebec<br>3 corvettes<br>2 brigs\n|casualties1=100 killed or wounded\n|casualties2=300 killed or wounded<br>4 ships of the line captured <br> 1 corvette captured\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Liberal Wars}}\n\nThe fourth '''Battle of Cape St Vincent''' was fought on 5 July 1833 and was a decisive encounter in Portugal's [[Liberal Wars]].

The sea victory, making possible the capture of Lisbon from the Miguelites, was the single most important event contributing to Miguel's eventual defeat and overthrow in 1834.\n\n== Ships involved ==\n===Loyalist fleet (Charles Napier)===\n''Rainha de Portugal'' 46 (flag, commodore Wilkinson, captain MacDonough)<br>\n[[Asia (1797 ship)|''Dona Maria'']] 42 (Peake)<br>\n''Dom Pedro'' 50 (Thomas Goble)<br>\n''Vila Flor'' 18 (Ruxton)<br>\n''Portuense'' 20 (Blackstone)<br>\n''Faro'' 6<br>\na few steam tugs and transports\n\n===Miguelite fleet (Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros)===\n''Nau Rainha'' 74 (Barradas) - Captured by ''Rainha de Portugal''<br>\n''Dom Jo\u00e3o'' 74 - Captured<br>\n''Martinho de Freitas'' 50 - Captured<br>\n''Duquesa da Bragan\u00e7a'' 56 - Captured by ''Dona Maria''<br>\n''Isabel Maria'' 22 (corvette) - Captured<br>\n''Princesa Real'' 24 (corvette)<br>\n''Tejo'' 20 (corvette)<br>\n''Sybille'' 20 (corvette)<br>\n''Audaz'' 18 (brig)<br>\n''Activa'' (xebec)<br>\nseveral other brigs\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (disambiguation)]], for several other naval battles of Cape St Vincent, the best known in [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|1797]]\n\n==Sources==\nMain source for this entry is Napier's own narrative of the battle in his ''An Account of the War in Portugal between Dom Pedro and Dom Miguel'' (London, 1836)\n\n{{coord missing|Portugal}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1833|Cape St. Vincent (1833)]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of the Liberal Wars|Cape St. Vincent]]\n[[Category:1833 in Portugal]]\n[[Category:July 1833 events]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "Infobox changes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_St._Vincent_(1833)"}

Nabeel takes advantage of this and starts living in the apartment as landlord and rents out a room to Mehmood. Khoobsoorat, who ran away from her wedding just fifteen minutes before it took place, arrives at the same apartment looking for her friend Saima, who is married to Ahmed. Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz started to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well. Nabeel is shocked by this and feels very uncomfortable about his mother being close to Mehmood. At this moment, Siddiqui arrives to cancel his daughter's wedding. Nabeel tells him that the nikah is already read, and he gets really angry, later he is convinced to eat biryani which later calms down his mood.\n\n====Episode 26-82 (After marriage)====\n(Nabeel's mother becomes a regular cast member after episode 25.)\n\nSoon after the couples get married, Nabeel gets a call from Ahmad, who tells him he has found someone who will move into the apartment, and that they have two days to move out. Luckily, Khubsoorat's father arranges for a new place for them to live and pays in advance, so that they do not struggle. \n\nSiddiqui also finds a good job offer for Nabeel.

Every episode ends with the family being ripped off, or either of the men getting a beating from his wife for flirting with other women. The storyline starts off with Nabeel and Mehmood living in an apartment as bachelors and progresses to both of them marrying and having children.\n\nThe show is known to break the [[fourth wall]] all the time.\n\n====Episode 1-25 (Pre-marriage)====\nNabeel's childhood friend Ahmad moves abroad and tells Nabeel to look after his apartment. Nabeel takes advantage of this and starts living in the apartment as landlord and rents out a room to Mehmood. Khoobsoorat, who ran away from her wedding just fifteen minutes before it took place, arrives at the same apartment looking for her friend Saima, who is married to Ahmed. Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz started to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well. Nabeel is shocked by this and feels very uncomfortable about his mother being close to Mehmood. At this moment, Siddiqui arrives to cancel his daughter's wedding. Nabeel tells him that the nikah is already read, and he gets really angry, later he is convinced to eat biryani which later calms down his mood.\n\n====Episode 26-82 (After marriage)====\n(Nabeel's mother becomes a regular cast member after episode 25.)\n\nSoon after the couples get married, Nabeel gets a call from Ahmad, who tells him he has found someone who will move into the apartment, and that they have two days to move out. Luckily, Khubsoorat's father arranges for a new place for them to live and pays in advance, so that they do not struggle. \n\nSiddiqui also finds a good job offer for Nabeel. Nabeel is forced to attend the job interview by his wife Khoobsurat. Nabeel later gets declined due to his demanding of a salary of 3-4 lakhs, saying he is made for much bigger things and will not work for anyone who does not see his true potential.\n\n====Episode 83-87 (Bubulay in Dubai)====\nThe Bulbulay family goes to Dubai but without telling each other.

Fatmag\u00fcl plans to marry her childhood love Mustafa (Firat \u00c7elik), who is a fisherman. They are only waiting for Mustafa to earn much money to finish their house construction before marriage. Then there is the Yasaran family, the rich upper-class business men and their political social elites. Yasaran Family is in Izmir for the engagement ceremony of the son of the elder brother Resat Yasaran (Musa Uzunlar) to the daughter of a politician. Selim (Engin \u00d6zt\u00fcrk) is his son and Erdogan (Kaan Tasaner) his nephew. These cousins have a third friend Vural (Bugra G\u00fclsoy) who also belongs to the upper-class. All these three have spent their childhood in Izmir but as the businesses of their fathers grew, they moved to Istanbul. They have a childhood friend in Izmir, whom they meet on yearly basis when they come there for summer vacations. This fourth friend of theirs is the hero - Kerim Ilgaz (Engin Aky\u00fcrek).\n\nKerim Ilgaz is a well-mannered boy, a blacksmith apprentice by profession, who lives with his aunt Meryem Aksoy (Sumru Yavrucuk), known affectionately as \"Ebe Nine\", who is a homeopath. Kerim was orphaned during childhood so Meryem brought him up as her own son. He works as a carpenter in the workshop of his father's friend. Kerim though unlike his rich friends, is over-powered by their presence. He considers himself important with them and hence, enjoys their company.\n\nFatmag\u00fcl is desperate to be married-off to Mustafa, not only because she loves him but also to get rid away from her nagging sister-in-law. Her desire for Mustafa and an independent married life is growing with time as Muqadas's hatred is growing towards her. Except for Mustafa, she has no one to share her feelings with. While in Izmir, Erdogan, Selim, Vural and Kerim see Fatmagul and the three rich tease her as young boys do. Kerim doesn't like this. Then at Selim's engagement, Keirm comes face-to-face with her as she is working their with her sister-in-law. \n\nThe big event of the season is the engagement of Selim, to the politician Turaner Alag\u00f6z's (Aziz Sarvan) daughter Meltem (Seda G\u00fcven). Kerim after attending Selim's engagement, joins his friends for an after-party. All four go for drinking and drug binge near the sea. Mustafa is leaving for a night fish-catch. Fatmag\u00fcl is coming to see him off. She passes from the area where the drunk boys are singing. Kerim sees her and on recognizing her shouts to his friends 'Guys! Its the same girl'!! Then when she tries to run, Kerim gets hold of her while the other three come near her.\n\nThe tragedy occurs. Fatmag\u00fcl is gang-raped. The four boys are shown to be involved in the crime as she faints when Kerim comes on her. The next morning, a traumatized Fatmag\u00fcl is discovered by Ebe Nine while she is picking herbs. The four boys have already left the crime scene. Kerim drops off Selim and Erdogan at their place and himself goes with Vural to his house. Kerim is left deeply disturbed by the event and is even more distressed to know that the girl has been rescued by his mother. The rich boys are confident in the power of their rich fathers and are sure to be saved. As Muqadas approaches the Yasarans threatening of giving their name to the police (as she had found Selim's engagement ring at the rape-scene), with the course of events, the Yasarans save their sons and forcefully marry Kerim to Fatmag\u00fcl. Kerim accepts the blame of solely raping Fatmag\u00fcl for protecting his friends and also because he believes himself to be guilty. Muqadas is their accomplice in all this. Mustafa is hurt primarily because of his fiance' being raped. He burns their house in front of Fatmag\u00fcl but afterwards believes Yasaran\u2019s false stories of Fatmag\u00fcl being involved in Kerim. Fatmag\u00fcl and Kerim's families sell their properties and move to \u0130stanbul to start a new life.\n\nThe story develops in Istanbul. Fatmag\u00fcl hates Kerim. She insults him, abuses him, spits at him, tries to kill him, etc. Kerim is not sure whether he really raped her, as he was drunk and drugged. But Fatmag\u00fcl believes that he did it as his was the last face she saw before fainting. Then Vural who is having little traumas of guilt, tells Kerim what he knows that; Kerim did not rape Fatmagul. In fact, when she laid there, fainted under open sky, he just sat beside her. Kerim tells this to Fatmag\u00fcl. She believes it but it is of no importance for her as she hates him and considers him as much as culprit as the other three. \n\nThings become complicated due to the exploitations of the Ya\u015farans and their unscrupulous lawyer, M\u00fcnir Telci (Murat Daltaban), who wants to protect them, as well as Mustafa, who seeks revenge as he believes that Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl had an affair from the beginning. As a result, both the Ya\u015farans and Mustafa start harassing Kerim, Fatmag\u00fcl and their relatives. Kerim initially wild and exhausted with Fatmag\u00fcl's behavior, is ready to leave her and divorce her as she desires. But when he is leaving, Kerim realizes that he loves Fatmag\u00fcl, and this was love at first sight. Before leaving he writes a letter to her, telling her to move on in her life and that one day he will come and ask for forgiveness from her.\n\nFatmag\u00fcl reads this letter. Later-on the viewers are shown that this was the moment when Fatmag\u00fcl fell in love with Kerim as his words softened her heart for him and she believed in what he wrote to her. Anyways, Kerim returns and then the year long, tough but with a happy-end path of Kerim and Fatmagul starts. \n\nHowever, even after she has already developed a soft corner for him, Fatmag\u00fcl is in a state of self-denial about her feelings for Kerim and when one day she sees Vural hugging him, she believes him still to be in contact with her rapists, which actually is not the reality. In order to prove his innocence and love for her, Kerim files her rape case and asks the police to arrest him, Vural and the Ya\u015farans, after which Fatmag\u00fcl finally accepts his of being honest with her. Mustafa after knowing the truth asks Fatmag\u00fcl to forgive him, but she rejects him. Things take a turn when the Ya\u015farans start threatening Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl, trying to quickly finish the case, while also using the greedy and weak Mustafa against them. During the first trial, the Ya\u015farans falsify their testimonies. They also resort to using several bribed witnesses. Vural then is accidentally killed by Mustafa. \n\nIn the second season, Fatmag\u00fcl also confesses her love for Kerim. After the Yasarans forcefully protect Mustafa against Fatmag\u00fcl, he abducts her, stating he loves her more than Kerim and that he regrets leaving her. Kerim eventually rescues his wife and they escape. Mustafa is arrested and imprisoned for his crimes. At the wedding of Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl, Mustafa intentionally tries to escape from police custody and is therefore, shot to death. Meanwhile, Selim and Erdo\u011fan surreptitiously move to [[Malta]] where they briefly hide from the authorities. However, they are forced to return to Istanbul after Erdo\u011fan engages in a fight at a nightclub and is arrested. \n\nEventually, Fatmag\u00fcl confronts them in court and they are charged for their part in her rape, essentially bringing down the Ya\u015faran empire. The series ends with Fatmag\u00fcl and Kerim expecting their first child. In the final scene, they walk down the street in Izmir holding hands, expressing that their love cannot be shaken despite the difficult challenges they faced and that when a woman is strong like Fatmag\u00fcl and has the support of a strong husband like Kerim, even a crime like 'rape' cannot escape justice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cleanup|section|date=November 2016|reason=Per [[WP:SLASH]] we do not use slashes when we write articles, because they introduce ambiguities. In the list below there are numerous character names divided by slashes. It is unclear if this means that the actor played multiple roles, or if the names are nicknames, or if the names represent married names, etc. If the actors portrayed multiple roles it might be wiser to present the content ordered by Character instead of Cast, with one character on each bulleted line. Character descriptions should briefly explain who the character is and what role they had in the story, and should also present real-world information, like details about casting and leaving the series if relevant.

Fatmag\u00fcl plans to marry her childhood love Mustafa (Firat \u00c7elik), who is a fisherman. They are only waiting for Mustafa to earn much money to finish their house construction before marriage. Then there is the Yasaran family, the rich upper-class business men and their political social elites. Yasaran Family is in Izmir for the engagement ceremony of the son of the elder brother Resat Yasaran (Musa Uzunlar) to the daughter of a politician. Selim (Engin \u00d6zt\u00fcrk) is his son and Erdogan (Kaan Tasaner) his nephew. These cousins have a third friend Vural (Bugra G\u00fclsoy) who also belongs to the upper-class. All these three have spent their childhood in Izmir but as the businesses of their fathers grew, they moved to Istanbul. They have a childhood friend in Izmir, whom they meet on yearly basis when they come there for summer vacations. This fourth friend of theirs is the hero - Kerim Ilgaz (Engin Aky\u00fcrek).\n\nKerim Ilgaz is a well-mannered boy, a blacksmith apprentice by profession, who lives with his aunt Meryem Aksoy (Sumru Yavrucuk), known affectionately as \"Ebe Nine\", who is a homeopath. Kerim was orphaned during childhood so Meryem brought him up as her own son. He works as a carpenter in the workshop of his father's friend. Kerim though unlike his rich friends, is over-powered by their presence. He considers himself important with them and hence, enjoys their company.\n\nFatmag\u00fcl is desperate to be married-off to Mustafa, not only because she loves him but also to get rid away from her nagging sister-in-law. Her desire for Mustafa and an independent married life is growing with time as Muqadas's hatred is growing towards her. Except for Mustafa, she has no one to share her feelings with. While in Izmir, Erdogan, Selim, Vural and Kerim see Fatmagul and the three rich tease her as young boys do. Kerim doesn't like this. Then at Selim's engagement, Keirm comes face-to-face with her as she is working their with her sister-in-law. \n\nThe big event of the season is the engagement of Selim, to the politician Turaner Alag\u00f6z's (Aziz Sarvan) daughter Meltem (Seda G\u00fcven). Kerim after attending Selim's engagement, joins his friends for an after-party. All four go for drinking and drug binge near the sea. Mustafa is leaving for a night fish-catch. Fatmag\u00fcl is coming to see him off. She passes from the area where the drunk boys are singing. Kerim sees her and on recognizing her shouts to his friends 'Guys! Its the same girl'!! Then when she tries to run, Kerim gets hold of her while the other three come near her.\n\nThe tragedy occurs. Fatmag\u00fcl is gang-raped. The four boys are shown to be involved in the crime as she faints when Kerim comes on her. The next morning, a traumatized Fatmag\u00fcl is discovered by Ebe Nine while she is picking herbs. The four boys have already left the crime scene. Kerim drops off Selim and Erdogan at their place and himself goes with Vural to his house. Kerim is left deeply disturbed by the event and is even more distressed to know that the girl has been rescued by his mother. The rich boys are confident in the power of their rich fathers and are sure to be saved. As Muqadas approaches the Yasarans threatening of giving their name to the police (as she had found Selim's engagement ring at the rape-scene), with the course of events, the Yasarans save their sons and forcefully marry Kerim to Fatmag\u00fcl. Kerim accepts the blame of solely raping Fatmag\u00fcl for protecting his friends and also because he believes himself to be guilty. Muqadas is their accomplice in all this. Mustafa is hurt primarily because of his fiance' being raped. He burns their house in front of Fatmag\u00fcl but afterwards believes Yasaran\u2019s false stories of Fatmag\u00fcl being involved in Kerim. Fatmag\u00fcl and Kerim's families sell their properties and move to \u0130stanbul to start a new life.\n\nThe story develops in Istanbul. Fatmag\u00fcl hates Kerim. She insults him, abuses him, spits at him, tries to kill him, etc. Kerim is not sure whether he really raped her, as he was drunk and drugged. But Fatmag\u00fcl believes that he did it as his was the last face she saw before fainting. Then Vural who is having little traumas of guilt, tells Kerim what he knows that; Kerim did not rape Fatmagul. In fact, when she laid there, fainted under open sky, he just sat beside her. Kerim tells this to Fatmag\u00fcl. She believes it but it is of no importance for her as she hates him and considers him as much as culprit as the other three. \n\nThings become complicated due to the exploitations of the Ya\u015farans and their unscrupulous lawyer, M\u00fcnir Telci (Murat Daltaban), who wants to protect them, as well as Mustafa, who seeks revenge as he believes that Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl had an affair from the beginning. As a result, both the Ya\u015farans and Mustafa start harassing Kerim, Fatmag\u00fcl and their relatives. Kerim initially wild and exhausted with Fatmag\u00fcl's behavior, is ready to leave her and divorce her as she desires. But when he is leaving, Kerim realizes that he loves Fatmag\u00fcl, and this was love at first sight. Before leaving he writes a letter to her, telling her to move on in her life and that one day he will come and ask for forgiveness from her.\n\nFatmag\u00fcl reads this letter. Later-on the viewers are shown that this was the moment when Fatmag\u00fcl fell in love with Kerim as his words softened her heart for him and she believed in what he wrote to her. Anyways, Kerim returns and then the year long, tough but with a happy-end path of Kerim and Fatmagul starts. \n\nHowever, even after she has already developed a soft corner for him, Fatmag\u00fcl is in a state of self-denial about her feelings for Kerim and when one day she sees Vural hugging him, she believes him still to be in contact with her rapists, which actually is not the reality. In order to prove his innocence and love for her, Kerim files her rape case and asks the police to arrest him, Vural and the Ya\u015farans, after which Fatmag\u00fcl finally accepts his of being honest with her. Mustafa after knowing the truth asks Fatmag\u00fcl to forgive him, but she rejects him. Things take a turn when the Ya\u015farans start threatening Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl, trying to quickly finish the case, while also using the greedy and weak Mustafa against them. During the first trial, the Ya\u015farans falsify their testimonies. They also resort to using several bribed witnesses. Vural then is accidentally killed by Mustafa. \n\nIn the second season, Fatmag\u00fcl also confesses her love for Kerim. After the Yasarans forcefully protect Mustafa against Fatmag\u00fcl, he abducts her, stating he loves her more than Kerim and that he regrets leaving her. Kerim eventually rescues his wife and they escape. Mustafa is arrested and imprisoned for his crimes. At the wedding of Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl, Mustafa intentionally tries to escape from police custody and is therefore, shot to death. Meanwhile, Selim and Erdo\u011fan surreptitiously move to [[Malta]] where they briefly hide from the authorities. However, they are forced to return to Istanbul after Erdo\u011fan engages in a fight at a nightclub and is arrested. \n\nEventually, Fatmag\u00fcl confronts them in court and they are charged for their part in her rape, essentially bringing down the Ya\u015faran empire. The series ends with Fatmag\u00fcl and Kerim expecting their first child. In the final scene, they walk down the street in Izmir holding hands, expressing that their love cannot be shaken despite the difficult challenges they faced and that when a woman is strong like Fatmag\u00fcl and has the support of a strong husband like Kerim, even a crime like 'rape' cannot escape justice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cleanup|section|date=November 2016|reason=Per [[WP:SLASH]] we do not use slashes when we write articles, because they introduce ambiguities.
