It is attached to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\nThe unit's heritage stems from World War II, with the creation of the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]] in October 1941. 9 Para SF, raised in 1966 as '''9th Parachute Commando Battalion''', is the oldest among the eight Para SF units of the Indian Army.\n\n==History==\n\nThe parachute units of the Indian Army are among the oldest airborne units in the world. The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|title=Welcome to The Parachute Regiment|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190919/http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when [[Maratha Light Infantry|21 Maratha Light Infantry]] was selected to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka.<ref name=popl>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=K.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft. One team rescued the president, another took over the airfield, and a third rescued Maldivian security personnel besieged in the [[National Security Service (Maldives)|National Security Service]] HQ. Later 7 Para and part of 17 Para Field Regiment were also deployed to the Maldives. When mercenaries tried to escape by sea along with hostages, they were intercepted by the [[Indian navy]]. Thus, 6 Para, and the 17 Para Field Regiment conducted the first-ever international intervention by the [[Indian army]] without any loss of life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/operation-cactus-how-indian-troops-went-to-maldives-and-helped-quell-a-coup/articleshow/62816787.cms|title=Operation Cactus: How Indian troops went to Maldives and helped quell a coup|last=|first=|last2=|date=7 February 2018|website=[[The Times of India]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-17|last3=|first3=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/news/india/operation-cactus-maldives-crisis-should-india-intervene-again|title=Operation Cactus: The Day India Saved the Maldives|date=2018-02-06|website=The Quint|language=en|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>\n\n===1999 Kargil War===\n{{Main|Kargil War}}\nIn 1999 nine out of ten Parachute battalions were deployed for Operation Vijay in Kargil, which bears testimony to the operational profile of the Regiment. While the Parachute Brigade cleared the Mushkoh Valley intrusions, 5 PARA was actively involved in the forgotten sector of Batalik, and was awarded the Chief of Army Staff (COASS) Unit Citation.\n\n===Operation Khukri 2000, Sierra Leone===\n[[Operation Khukri]] was a rescue mission conducted by the 2 PARA (SF) in Sierra Leone in June 2000. About 90 operators commanded by Major (now Lt. Col.) Harinder Sood were airlifted from New Delhi to spearhead the mission to rescue 223 men of the 5/8 Gurkha Rifles who were surrounded and held captive by [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) rebels for over 75 days just 90 Para (SF) forced 2000-5000 members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) divided into 5 battalions to surrender. This ultimately led to the liberation of Freetown.\n\n===Operation Summer Storm 2009===\nOn 11 April 2009, the 57 Mountain Division of the Indian Army based in Manipur, Para Commandos along with the para-military Assam Rifles and State Police, launched a counter insurgency operation, code-named \"Operation Summer Storm\" in the Loktak Lake region and adjoining [[Loktak Lake]] in Bishnupur District, located south of State capital of Imphal. The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/TWIR/4_3_2009_Manipur|title=Manipur: Operation \u2018Summer Storm\u2019 called off {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/myanmar-operation-sends-a-larger-political-message-india-will-pay-back-if-provoked/articleshow/47657355.cms|title=Myanmar operation sends a larger political message: India will pay back, if provoked|date=2015-06-14|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-summer-storm-392192|title=Operation Summer Storm|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://spiderimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2020/01/31/750x506/nagrota-terror-attack_1580463635.jpeg Para SF operators arrive to take position] before a gunfight took place at a toll plaza in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir in January 2020.

Sometimes these units work with the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] (COIN force) in complicated operations. Since the mid-1990s, the role of Paratroopers and Para (SF) as a counter terrorism force has increased substantially. They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) and special units of the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir.

The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army.

The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Indian Air Force [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment.\n\nPara (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines.

For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

Although this is also a training phase, this is still part of the selection process. Here the soldiers undertake various different kinds of training with various organisations overseen by the Parachute Regiment Training Centre and the Special Forces Training School. Training includes weapons handling training land navigation and field craft training, infiltration, assault and ambush tactics; [[close quarter battle]] (CQB) training; urban warfare; counter-terrorism; unarmed combat training and various other courses across training centers of the [[Indian Defense Forces|Indian defense forces]].\n\n==== Training centers and courses ====\n* Commando Training Camp, [[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n* 4-week High-Altitude Commando Course, Parvat Ghatak School in Tawang, [[Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* Desert Warfare School, Rajasthan\n* [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS), Sonamarg, Kashmir\n* Basic Combat Divers course, Indian Navy's Dive School, [[Kochi]]\n* Counter insurgency, at the [[Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (India)|Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram\n* [[Indian Special Forces Training School (SFTS)|Indian Special Forces Training School]], Nahan, Himachal Pradesh; \n* Combat free-fall training (HAHO and HALO) at the Parachute Training School, Agra\n\n==== 90-day probation ====\nSome of the training during the 90 day selection includes:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Day 1 to 35: The first 35 days comprises 'Physical and Skills Training'.

This is to test probationers panic reactions under stress. The hands are also tied later on and using ropes the probationers are pulled under water. It is well known that hypoxia and blackout due to lack of oxygen is common during this test. The first 16 hours are completed without a drop of water or food. This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs. This is all done at the last stage of the stress test under lack to sleep and extreme fatigue mainly to test mental endurance of the probationers under such conditions and how they react.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable [[parachute]]s called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} is also perfected.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nFor combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water.\n\nThe daily routine begins with a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.

This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations. [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] also conducted joint HAHO training with the Para (SF) in 1992, underwater training in 1995, and anti-terrorism training in 1997. It is thought that the [[French Foreign Legion]] also has approached CIJWS regarding the courses taught by them.

The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|title=Welcome to The Parachute Regiment|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190919/http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when [[Maratha Light Infantry|21 Maratha Light Infantry]] was selected to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft. One team rescued the president, another took over the airfield, and a third rescued Maldivian security personnel besieged in the [[National Security Service (Maldives)|National Security Service]] HQ. Later 7 Para and part of 17 Para Field Regiment were also deployed to the Maldives. When mercenaries tried to escape by sea along with hostages, they were intercepted by the [[Indian navy]]. Thus, 6 Para, and the 17 Para Field Regiment conducted the first-ever international intervention by the [[Indian army]] without any loss of life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/operation-cactus-how-indian-troops-went-to-maldives-and-helped-quell-a-coup/articleshow/62816787.cms|title=Operation Cactus: How Indian troops went to Maldives and helped quell a coup|last=|first=|last2=|date=7 February 2018|website=[[The Times of India]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-17|last3=|first3=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/news/india/operation-cactus-maldives-crisis-should-india-intervene-again|title=Operation Cactus: The Day India Saved the Maldives|date=2018-02-06|website=The Quint|language=en|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>\n\n===1999 Kargil War===\n{{Main|Kargil War}}\nIn 1999 nine out of ten Parachute battalions were deployed for Operation Vijay in Kargil, which bears testimony to the operational profile of the Regiment. While the Parachute Brigade cleared the Mushkoh Valley intrusions, 5 PARA was actively involved in the forgotten sector of Batalik, and was awarded the Chief of Army Staff (COASS) Unit Citation.\n\n===Operation Khukri 2000, Sierra Leone===\n[[Operation Khukri]] was a rescue mission conducted by the 2 PARA (SF) in Sierra Leone in June 2000. About 90 operators commanded by Major (now Lt. Col.) Harinder Sood were airlifted from New Delhi to spearhead the mission to rescue 223 men of the 5/8 Gurkha Rifles who were surrounded and held captive by [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) rebels for over 75 days just 90 Para (SF) forced 2000-5000 members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) divided into 5 battalions to surrender. This ultimately led to the liberation of Freetown.\n\n===Operation Summer Storm 2009===\nOn 11 April 2009, the 57 Mountain Division of the Indian Army based in Manipur, Para Commandos along with the para-military Assam Rifles and State Police, launched a counter insurgency operation, code-named \"Operation Summer Storm\" in the Loktak Lake region and adjoining [[Loktak Lake]] in Bishnupur District, located south of State capital of Imphal. The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/TWIR/4_3_2009_Manipur|title=Manipur: Operation \u2018Summer Storm\u2019 called off {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/myanmar-operation-sends-a-larger-political-message-india-will-pay-back-if-provoked/articleshow/47657355.cms|title=Myanmar operation sends a larger political message: India will pay back, if provoked|date=2015-06-14|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-summer-storm-392192|title=Operation Summer Storm|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://spiderimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2020/01/31/750x506/nagrota-terror-attack_1580463635.jpeg Para SF operators arrive to take position] before a gunfight took place at a toll plaza in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir in January 2020.

Sometimes these units work with the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] (COIN force) in complicated operations. Since the mid-1990s, the role of Paratroopers and Para (SF) as a counter terrorism force has increased substantially. They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) and special units of the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir. They may also include [[MARCOS (India)|MARCOS]] personnel, many of whom are seconded to the [[Indian Army|Army]] for CT operations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/vc5nVprN5J6tJhF5U6UinL/Living-and-dying-in-the-Special-Forces.html|title=Living and dying in the Special Forces|last=Sengupta|first=Rudraneil|date=2015-11-27|website=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref><ref name=\"ManuPubby2018\">{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-turns-to-para-special-forces-for-covert-missions/articleshow/54616701.cms?from=mdr|title=India turns to Para Special Forces for covert missions|last=Pubby|first=Manu|date=2018-07-12|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://forceindia.net/the-maroon-beret/|title=With added emphasis on Special Forces, the army is set to change the face of war|last=|first=|date=2019-03-18|website=FORCE|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>\n\n===Counter-terrorist operation in Samba===\nOn 26 September 2013, terrorists dressed in Army fatigues stormed a police station and then an Army camp in the Jammu region killing 10 people, including an Army officer, in twin ''[[fidayeen]]'' attacks. The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army. The bodies of the three terrorists aged between 16 and 19 were in the custody of the Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|title=Court of inquiry ordered into terror attack on army camp in Samba - Times of India|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929133303/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|archivedate=29 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAuthorities moved commandos of 1 Para (SF) in helicopters to the shootout site. The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Indian Air Force [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment.

For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

Although this is also a training phase, this is still part of the selection process. Here the soldiers undertake various different kinds of training with various organisations overseen by the Parachute Regiment Training Centre and the Special Forces Training School. Training includes weapons handling training land navigation and field craft training, infiltration, assault and ambush tactics; [[close quarter battle]] (CQB) training; urban warfare; counter-terrorism; unarmed combat training and various other courses across training centers of the [[Indian Defense Forces|Indian defense forces]].\n\n==== Training centers and courses ====\n* Commando Training Camp, [[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n* 4-week High-Altitude Commando Course, Parvat Ghatak School in Tawang, [[Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* Desert Warfare School, Rajasthan\n* [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS), Sonamarg, Kashmir\n* Basic Combat Divers course, Indian Navy's Dive School, [[Kochi]]\n* Counter insurgency, at the [[Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (India)|Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram\n* [[Indian Special Forces Training School (SFTS)|Indian Special Forces Training School]], Nahan, Himachal Pradesh; \n* Combat free-fall training (HAHO and HALO) at the Parachute Training School, Agra\n\n==== 90-day probation ====\nSome of the training during the 90 day selection includes:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Day 1 to 35: The first 35 days comprises 'Physical and Skills Training'.

This is to test probationers panic reactions under stress. The hands are also tied later on and using ropes the probationers are pulled under water. It is well known that hypoxia and blackout due to lack of oxygen is common during this test. The first 16 hours are completed without a drop of water or food. This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned.

Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.

This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations. [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] also conducted joint HAHO training with the Para (SF) in 1992, underwater training in 1995, and anti-terrorism training in 1997.

Through time, numerous ethno-linguistic groups developed, until some of they became monarchies, plutocracies, hunter-gatherers, city-states, and so on. Trade also became part of the tourism as [[Arabs]], [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], and other ethnic groups in mainland [[Southeast Asia]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Ryukyu]] traded goods with the natives. When the islands became part of the territory of [[Spain]], an influx of [[Spanish people]] migrated into the country, though still few compared to the Spanish migrations in South America as the Philippines was farther from Spain.\n\nThe tourism industry first truly flourished during the late 19th to early 20th century due to the influx of immigrants from [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. It was listed as one of the best countries to visit in [[Asia]] aside from [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]], earning the nickname \"[[Pearl of the Orient Seas]]\". The tourism declined during and after the [[World War II]], leaving the country with a completely devastated economy, and a landscape filled with destroyed heritage towns. The second wave of tourist influx flourished in the 1950s but declined drastically during the dictatorship era. After the People Power Revolution, the tourism industry continued to decline due to the domino effect caused by the dictatorship. The industry only managed to cope in 1991 and 1992, where 1.2 million tourists visited the Philippines. It afterwards waned again after a decade due to corrupt practices in government.\n\nThe tourism industry flourished again for the third time at the early part of the 2010s under the \"''It's More Fun in the Philippines''\" slogan, which was widely regarded as an international success, gaining international media attention. The country saw an influx of tourists from all over the world, with the help of social media and the creative tagline, the tourism went at its peak with having 5,360,682 foreign million tourists recorded in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM|date= 10 September 2015|url=http://www.tourism.gov.ph/pages/industryperformance.aspx}}</ref> The industry continued to grow in 2017, but the growth rate from Western tourists drastically decreased due to an ongoing drug war and the declaration of martial law in [[Mindanao]]. Nonetheless, the growth continued due to an influx of Asian and Russian tourists.<ref>{{cite web|author=By Afp |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4337764/Philippines-complains-drug-war-reports-hurting-tourism.html |title=Philippines complains drug war reports hurting tourism &#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2017-03-22 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==Country visitor statistics==\n\n<div style=\"overflow:scroll;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:70%; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

Various universities in the country, such as [[University of the Philippines]], [[Ateneo de Manila University]], [[De La Salle University]], [[University of Santo Tomas]], [[Silliman University]], [[University of San Carlos]], and [[University of Mindanao]], have also been influential in research tourism, especially for graduate students and students seeking better review centers.

The country has been known as the traditional capital of the world's festivities and the capital of fun due to the thousands of festivals which happen in the country, most of which are annual spectacles. Among the most famous of these events are the [[Sinulog Festival]] of [[Cebu]], the [[Kadayawan Festival]] of [[Davao City|Davao]], the [[Ati-Atihan Festival]] of [[Aklan]], the [[Dinagyang Festival]] of [[Iloilo]], the [[Panagbenga Festival]] of [[Baguio]], the [[Moriones Festival]] of [[Marinduque]], the [[Pahiyas Festival]] of [[Quezon province]], the [[Obando Fertility Rites]] Festival of [[Bulacan]], the [[Pintados Festival]] of [[Leyte]], the [[Sandugo Festival]] of [[Bohol]], the [[Ibalong Festival]] of [[Bicol Region|Bicol]], the [[MassKara Festival]] of [[Bacolod]], and the [[Giant Lantern Festival]] of [[Pampanga]]. Each of the festivals, or locally known as ''fiesta'', have different traditions at play. The festivals may be [[Philippine mythology|Anitist]], Hindu, Buddhist, Catholic, Muslim, or a mixture of religions in origin. Some festivals, however, are not interlaced with any form of religion.\n\n[[File:Hibok Hibok volcano and Camiguin volcano.jpg|thumb|[[Camiguin]] island.]]\n\n===Wellness tourism===\n{{Main|Hilot}}\n[[Wellness tourism]] has recently doubled its contribution to Philippine tourism due to the rise of [[hilot]] (ancient Filipino art of healing) practices in spas, bath houses, and hotels. Surges in patriotism for whole-body firewood pot bathing and indigenous herbal usage have also helped the industry to prosper in the village-level. Staycation, or staying in hotels for relaxation purposes, has also become a trend, along with the increase of [[yoga]], as rooted to the Indian roots of many indigenous Filipino cultures. Hilot havens include [[Camiguin]], [[Siquijor]], and [[Antique (province)|Antique]], while staycation destinations include the hotels of [[Manila]], [[Bataan]], [[Batanes]], [[Tagaytay]], [[Baguio]], and [[Bukidnon]].\n\n==Heritage towns and cities==\n[[File:Calle Real, Iloilo City 2.jpg|thumb|[[Iloilo City]].]]\n[[File:WIKI-2012-negdelacruz-VIGAN-bricks 04.jpg|thumb|[[Vigan]], [[World Heritage Site]].]]\n[[File:BaguioCathedraljf0230 42.JPG|thumb|[[Baguio]], [[UNESCO]] Creative City.]]\n[[File:Angeles City Pampanga 16.jpg|thumb|[[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles City]].]]\n{{main|Culture of the Philippines}}\nThe Philippines is home to numerous heritage towns and cities, many of which have been intentionally destroyed by the Japanese through fire tactics in World War II and the Americans through bombings during the same war.  After the war, the government of the Empire of Japan withheld from giving funds to the Philippines for the restoration of the heritage towns they destroyed, effectively destroying any chances of restoration since the pre-war Philippines' economy was devastated and had limited monetary supply. On the other hand, the United States gave minimal funding for only two of the hundreds of cities they destroyed, namely, Manila and Baguio. Today, only the centres (poblacion or downtown areas) of Filipino heritage towns and cities remain in most of the expansive heritage cities and towns in the country. Yet, some heritage cities in their former glory prior to the war still exist, such as the [[UNESCO]] city of [[Vigan]] which was the only heritage town saved from American bombing and Japanese fire and kamikaze tactics. The country currently lacks a city/town-singular architectural style law. Due to this, unaesthetic cement or shanty structures have taken over heritage buildings annually, destroying many former heritage townscapes. Some heritage buildings have been demolished or sold to corporations, and have been replaced by commercial structures such as shopping centers, condominium units, or newly-furnished modern-style buildings, completely destroying the old aesthetics of many former heritage towns and cities. This is one of the reasons why [[UNESCO]] has repeatedly withheld from inscribing further Filipino heritage towns in the [[World Heritage List]] since 1999. Only the heritage city of Vigan has a town law that guarantees its singular architecture (the Vigan colonial style) shall always be used in constructions and reconstructions. While Silay, Iloilo City, and San Fernando de Pampanga have ordinances giving certain tax exemptions to owners of heritage houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/214011/silay-in-negros-passes-landmark-heritage-ordinance/ |title=Silay in Negros passes landmark heritage ordinance &#124; Inquirer Lifestyle |publisher=Lifestyle.inquirer.net |date=2015-11-23 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref> In 2010, the Philippine Cultural Heritage Act passed into law, effectively giving protection to all cultural heritage properties of the Philippines. However, despite its passage, many ancestral home owners continue to approve the demolition of ancestral structures. In certain cases, government entities themselves were the purveyors of such demolitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncca.gov.ph/republic-act-no-10066/ |title=Republic Act No. 10066 Heritage Law |publisher=Ncca.gov.ph |date=2015-02-17 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref> Because of the minimal reach of the current governmental culture agency and the lack of awareness on the importance of Filipino sites, a bill establishing a Department of Culture was formally filed in 2016. The bill is expected to pass into law by late 2018 or early 2019 as it was declared a priority legislation by both houses of Congress.

While most parts of the Philippines archipelago are relatively safe to visit, certain areas where terrorist cells have been at large are best avoided. The far-southern region is widely known as a no-go zone for foreign visitors. Areas surrounding [[Marawi]] and other parts of the island are considered unsafe. This is because rebel groups like the [[Maute Group]] and [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) are active in these areas and have been held responsible for a number of violent incidents. However, since not all parts of Mindanao have terrorist cells and rebel areas, Mindanao is still a relatively safe place to visit and as long as one is aware of their surroundings and one has knowledge of the places to visit and have knowledge that these places should be avoided, then one can enjoy travel as much as other tourist destinations.<ref name=\"Nomads\">{{cite web | title = Terrorism in the Philippines: Places you should avoid | work = World Nomads | url = https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/southeast-asia/philippines/areas-to-avoid-in-the-philippines}}</ref>\n\nCertain militant Islamist groups such as [[Abu Sayyaf]] and [[Jema'ah Islamiyah]] are particularly dangerous, since they are responsible for the majority of recent attacks, which have included bombings, piracies, kidnappings and killings of foreign nationals if their government failed to pay the demanded ransom.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news | title = How Abu Sayyaf makes a business of beheadings as Islamist terror gang releases 'final message' hostage video | work = The Telegraph | author = Philip Sherwell | date = 23 May 2016 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/20/how-abu-sayyaf-the-islamist-terror-gang-made-a-business-out-of-b/}}</ref> The [[New People's Army]] of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] has from time to time been listed as a rebel or terrorist group by the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/05/17/duterte-declares-cpp-npa-as-terror-group |title=Duterte declares CPP-NPA as terror group &#124; ABS-CBN News |publisher=News.abs-cbn.com |date=2017-12-05 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref>\n\nOther threats are mostly focused on heritage destruction. There include cultural heritage destruction such as the [[demolition]]s of many [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] structures annually with little opposition from the government, government infrastructure projects (such as road projects) that destroy or damage heritage structures and [[archaeological site]]s, [[looting]] of heritage sites (usually by foreigners or locals paid by foreigners), illegal [[treasure hunting]] activities by foreigners and locals, limited funding for heritage restoration, a shift in mall culture, expansive establishment of structures (such as high-rise condominiums and casinos) in heritage zones, irresponsible and destructive heritage restoration activities from government and private entities, and [[urbanization]] of younger generations away from indigenous [[tradition]]s, causing various [[ritual]]s and practices to fade away due to the absence of a future bearer. Natural heritage destruction is also a huge problem due to [[mining]], severe [[population growth]], [[urbanization]], introduction of [[invasive species]], [[deforestation]], irresponsibly establishing structures in forests (such as the proposed [[Sibuyan Island]] road project), irresponsibly enlarging structures and roads that lead to the chopping and destruction of centuries-old trees at road sides, [[illegal fishing]], [[illegal hunting]] (usually by Chinese and Vietnamese foreigners), illegal [[wildlife trade]], [[water pollution]], [[air pollution]], establishment of coal power plants (such as the proposed coal plant in Sariaya, a heritage town in Quezon), [[climate change]], irresponsible tourists, and a lack of initiative in proper [[waste disposal]] among poor brackets in society.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marquez |first=Buen |url=http://thepalladium.ph/legal/soaring-eyesore-torre-de-manilas-construction-threatens-rizal-parks-skyline/ |title=A soaring eyesore: Torre de Manila's construction threatens Rizal Park's skyline - The Palladium Online |publisher=Thepalladium.ph |date= |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/143442/oslob-loses-heritage-house |title=Oslob loses heritage house - Cebu Daily News &#124; Cebu Daily News |publisher=Cebudailynews.inquirer.net |date=2017-08-14 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filipiknow.net/philippine-icons-and-traditions-that-are-disappearing/|title=9 Philippine Icons and Traditions That May Disappear Soon|date=4 November 2016|website=Filipiknow.net|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=by Indy N &middot; |url=http://www.topten.ph/2016/07/14/10-filipino-traditions-we-hardly-perform-anymore/ |title=10 Filipino Traditions We Hardly Perform Anymore - Pinoy Top Tens |publisher=Topten.ph |date= |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Philippines}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Visa policy of the Philippines]]\n*[[Philippine Registry of Cultural Property]]\n*[[List of festivals in the Philippines]]\n*[[Arts of the Philippines]]\n*[[Landmarks of the Philippines]]\n*[[Culture of the Philippines]]\n*[[Cuisine of the Philippines]]\n*[[List of beaches in the Philippines]]\n*[[Pilipinas Kay Ganda]]\n*[[Dambana|Built and Natural Dambanas]]\n*[[Suyat|Suyat Scripts of the Philippines]]\n*[[Architecture of the Philippines]]\n*[[List of protected areas of the Philippines]]\n*[[List of Ramsar sites in the Philippines]]\n*[[Biosphere reserves of the Philippines]]\n*[[Spanish Colonial Fortifications of the Philippines]]\n*[[Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Philippines]]\n*[[Lists of Cultural Properties of the Philippines]]\n*[[Archaeology of the Philippines]]\n*[[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]]\n*[[List of national parks of the Philippines]]\n*[[World Heritage Sites in the Philippines]]\n*[[List of mosques in the Philippines]]\n*[[Ship burial in Asia]]\n*[[National Artist of the Philippines]]\n*[[National Living Treasures Award (Philippines)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\nAndrei Salokhin and Nastia Khanenia.

Through time, numerous ethno-linguistic groups developed, until some of they became monarchies, plutocracies, hunter-gatherers, city-states, and so on. Trade also became part of the tourism as [[Arabs]], [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], and other ethnic groups in mainland [[Southeast Asia]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Ryukyu]] traded goods with the natives. When the islands became part of the territory of [[Spain]], an influx of [[Spanish people]] migrated into the country, though still few compared to the Spanish migrations in South America as the Philippines was farther from Spain.\n\nThe tourism industry first truly flourished during the late 19th to early 20th century due to the influx of immigrants from [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. It was listed as one of the best countries to visit in [[Asia]] aside from [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]], earning the nickname \"[[Pearl of the Orient Seas]]\". The tourism declined during and after the [[World War II]], leaving the country with a completely devastated economy, and a landscape filled with destroyed heritage towns. The second wave of tourist influx flourished in the 1950s but declined drastically during the dictatorship era. After the People Power Revolution, the tourism industry continued to decline due to the domino effect caused by the dictatorship. The industry only managed to cope in 1991 and 1992, where 1.2 million tourists visited the Philippines. It afterwards waned again after a decade due to corrupt practices in government.\n\nThe tourism industry flourished again for the third time at the early part of the 2010s under the \"''It's More Fun in the Philippines''\" slogan, which was widely regarded as an international success, gaining international media attention. The country saw an influx of tourists from all over the world, with the help of social media and the creative tagline, the tourism went at its peak with having 5,360,682 foreign million tourists recorded in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM|date= 10 September 2015|url=http://www.tourism.gov.ph/pages/industryperformance.aspx}}</ref> The industry continued to grow in 2017, but the growth rate from Western tourists drastically decreased due to an ongoing drug war and the declaration of martial law in [[Mindanao]].

Among the most popular pilgrimage sites in the Philippines are [[Paoay Church]], [[Manila Cathedral]], [[Maragondon Church]], [[Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral]], [[Baclayon Church]], [[Panay Church]], [[Loboc Church]], [[Daraga Church]], [[Boljoon Church]], [[Guiuan Church]], [[Saints Peter and Paul Parish Church (Calasiao)|Calasiao Church]], [[Manaoag Church]], [[Tumauini Church]], [[Naga Cathedral]], [[San Sebastian Cathedral (Bacolod)|San Sebastian Church of Bacolod]], [[Betis Church]], [[Quiapo Church]], [[Taal Basilica]], [[Miagao Church]], [[San Salvador del Mundo Church|Caraga Church]], [[Saint James the Apostle Parish Church (Paete)|Paete Church]], [[Lucban Church]], [[San Sebastian Church (Manila)|San Sebastian Church of Manila]], [[Jimenez Church]], [[Barasoain Church]], [[Seng Guan Temple]], [[Sheik Karimol Makhdum Mosque]], [[Taluksangay Mosque]], [[Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Masjid]], [[Masjid Dimaukom]], [[Mount Banahaw]], [[Kabayan Mummies|Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves]], [[Limestone tombs of Kamhantik]], [[Bud Bongao]], [[Mount Apo]], [[Mount Bulusan]], [[Mount Pulag]], [[Callao Cave]], [[Mount Kalatungan]], [[Mount Matutum]], [[Mount Makiling]], [[Kanlaon]], [[Mount Arayat]], [[Mayon Volcano]], [[Mount Pinatubo]], and [[Mount Kitanglad]].\n\n[[File:Ati-Atihan Festival Participant.jpg|thumb|Participants at the [[Ati-Atihan festival]].]]\n\n===Fiesta tourism===\n{{Main|List of festivals in the Philippines}}\nVarious [[festivals]] in the country are flocked annually by both locals and foreigners. The country has been known as the traditional capital of the world's festivities and the capital of fun due to the thousands of festivals which happen in the country, most of which are annual spectacles. Among the most famous of these events are the [[Sinulog Festival]] of [[Cebu]], the [[Kadayawan Festival]] of [[Davao City|Davao]], the [[Ati-Atihan Festival]] of [[Aklan]], the [[Dinagyang Festival]] of [[Iloilo]], the [[Panagbenga Festival]] of [[Baguio]], the [[Moriones Festival]] of [[Marinduque]], the [[Pahiyas Festival]] of [[Quezon province]], the [[Obando Fertility Rites]] Festival of [[Bulacan]], the [[Pintados Festival]] of [[Leyte]], the [[Sandugo Festival]] of [[Bohol]], the [[Ibalong Festival]] of [[Bicol Region|Bicol]], the [[MassKara Festival]] of [[Bacolod]], and the [[Giant Lantern Festival]] of [[Pampanga]]. Each of the festivals, or locally known as ''fiesta'', have different traditions at play. The festivals may be [[Philippine mythology|Anitist]], Hindu, Buddhist, Catholic, Muslim, or a mixture of religions in origin. Some festivals, however, are not interlaced with any form of religion.\n\n[[File:Hibok Hibok volcano and Camiguin volcano.jpg|thumb|[[Camiguin]] island.]]\n\n===Wellness tourism===\n{{Main|Hilot}}\n[[Wellness tourism]] has recently doubled its contribution to Philippine tourism due to the rise of [[hilot]] (ancient Filipino art of healing) practices in spas, bath houses, and hotels. Surges in patriotism for whole-body firewood pot bathing and indigenous herbal usage have also helped the industry to prosper in the village-level. Staycation, or staying in hotels for relaxation purposes, has also become a trend, along with the increase of [[yoga]], as rooted to the Indian roots of many indigenous Filipino cultures. Hilot havens include [[Camiguin]], [[Siquijor]], and [[Antique (province)|Antique]], while staycation destinations include the hotels of [[Manila]], [[Bataan]], [[Batanes]], [[Tagaytay]], [[Baguio]], and [[Bukidnon]].\n\n==Heritage towns and cities==\n[[File:Calle Real, Iloilo City 2.jpg|thumb|[[Iloilo City]].]]\n[[File:WIKI-2012-negdelacruz-VIGAN-bricks 04.jpg|thumb|[[Vigan]], [[World Heritage Site]].]]\n[[File:BaguioCathedraljf0230 42.JPG|thumb|[[Baguio]], [[UNESCO]] Creative City.]]\n[[File:Angeles City Pampanga 16.jpg|thumb|[[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles City]].]]\n{{main|Culture of the Philippines}}\nThe Philippines is home to numerous heritage towns and cities, many of which have been intentionally destroyed by the Japanese through fire tactics in World War II and the Americans through bombings during the same war.  After the war, the government of the Empire of Japan withheld from giving funds to the Philippines for the restoration of the heritage towns they destroyed, effectively destroying any chances of restoration since the pre-war Philippines' economy was devastated and had limited monetary supply. On the other hand, the United States gave minimal funding for only two of the hundreds of cities they destroyed, namely, Manila and Baguio. Today, only the centres (poblacion or downtown areas) of Filipino heritage towns and cities remain in most of the expansive heritage cities and towns in the country. Yet, some heritage cities in their former glory prior to the war still exist, such as the [[UNESCO]] city of [[Vigan]] which was the only heritage town saved from American bombing and Japanese fire and kamikaze tactics. The country currently lacks a city/town-singular architectural style law. Due to this, unaesthetic cement or shanty structures have taken over heritage buildings annually, destroying many former heritage townscapes. Some heritage buildings have been demolished or sold to corporations, and have been replaced by commercial structures such as shopping centers, condominium units, or newly-furnished modern-style buildings, completely destroying the old aesthetics of many former heritage towns and cities. This is one of the reasons why [[UNESCO]] has repeatedly withheld from inscribing further Filipino heritage towns in the [[World Heritage List]] since 1999. Only the heritage city of Vigan has a town law that guarantees its singular architecture (the Vigan colonial style) shall always be used in constructions and reconstructions. While Silay, Iloilo City, and San Fernando de Pampanga have ordinances giving certain tax exemptions to owners of heritage houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/214011/silay-in-negros-passes-landmark-heritage-ordinance/ |title=Silay in Negros passes landmark heritage ordinance &#124; Inquirer Lifestyle |publisher=Lifestyle.inquirer.net |date=2015-11-23 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref> In 2010, the Philippine Cultural Heritage Act passed into law, effectively giving protection to all cultural heritage properties of the Philippines. However, despite its passage, many ancestral home owners continue to approve the demolition of ancestral structures.

While most parts of the Philippines archipelago are relatively safe to visit, certain areas where terrorist cells have been at large are best avoided. The far-southern region is widely known as a no-go zone for foreign visitors. Areas surrounding [[Marawi]] and other parts of the island are considered unsafe. This is because rebel groups like the [[Maute Group]] and [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) are active in these areas and have been held responsible for a number of violent incidents. However, since not all parts of Mindanao have terrorist cells and rebel areas, Mindanao is still a relatively safe place to visit and as long as one is aware of their surroundings and one has knowledge of the places to visit and have knowledge that these places should be avoided, then one can enjoy travel as much as other tourist destinations.<ref name=\"Nomads\">{{cite web | title = Terrorism in the Philippines: Places you should avoid | work = World Nomads | url = https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/southeast-asia/philippines/areas-to-avoid-in-the-philippines}}</ref>\n\nCertain militant Islamist groups such as [[Abu Sayyaf]] and [[Jema'ah Islamiyah]] are particularly dangerous, since they are responsible for the majority of recent attacks, which have included bombings, piracies, kidnappings and killings of foreign nationals if their government failed to pay the demanded ransom.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news | title = How Abu Sayyaf makes a business of beheadings as Islamist terror gang releases 'final message' hostage video | work = The Telegraph | author = Philip Sherwell | date = 23 May 2016 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/20/how-abu-sayyaf-the-islamist-terror-gang-made-a-business-out-of-b/}}</ref> The [[New People's Army]] of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] has from time to time been listed as a rebel or terrorist group by the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/05/17/duterte-declares-cpp-npa-as-terror-group |title=Duterte declares CPP-NPA as terror group &#124; ABS-CBN News |publisher=News.abs-cbn.com |date=2017-12-05 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref>\n\nOther threats are mostly focused on heritage destruction.

Natural heritage destruction is also a huge problem due to [[mining]], severe [[population growth]], [[urbanization]], introduction of [[invasive species]], [[deforestation]], irresponsibly establishing structures in forests (such as the proposed [[Sibuyan Island]] road project), irresponsibly enlarging structures and roads that lead to the chopping and destruction of centuries-old trees at road sides, [[illegal fishing]], [[illegal hunting]] (usually by Chinese and Vietnamese foreigners), illegal [[wildlife trade]], [[water pollution]], [[air pollution]], establishment of coal power plants (such as the proposed coal plant in Sariaya, a heritage town in Quezon), [[climate change]], irresponsible tourists, and a lack of initiative in proper [[waste disposal]] among poor brackets in society.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marquez |first=Buen |url=http://thepalladium.ph/legal/soaring-eyesore-torre-de-manilas-construction-threatens-rizal-parks-skyline/ |title=A soaring eyesore: Torre de Manila's construction threatens Rizal Park's skyline - The Palladium Online |publisher=Thepalladium.ph |date= |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/143442/oslob-loses-heritage-house |title=Oslob loses heritage house - Cebu Daily News &#124; Cebu Daily News |publisher=Cebudailynews.inquirer.net |date=2017-08-14 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filipiknow.net/philippine-icons-and-traditions-that-are-disappearing/|title=9 Philippine Icons and Traditions That May Disappear Soon|date=4 November 2016|website=Filipiknow.net|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=by Indy N &middot; |url=http://www.topten.ph/2016/07/14/10-filipino-traditions-we-hardly-perform-anymore/ |title=10 Filipino Traditions We Hardly Perform Anymore - Pinoy Top Tens |publisher=Topten.ph |date= |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Philippines}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Visa policy of the Philippines]]\n*[[Philippine Registry of Cultural Property]]\n*[[List of festivals in the Philippines]]\n*[[Arts of the Philippines]]\n*[[Landmarks of the Philippines]]\n*[[Culture of the Philippines]]\n*[[Cuisine of the Philippines]]\n*[[List of beaches in the Philippines]]\n*[[Pilipinas Kay Ganda]]\n*[[Dambana|Built and Natural Dambanas]]\n*[[Suyat|Suyat Scripts of the Philippines]]\n*[[Architecture of the Philippines]]\n*[[List of protected areas of the Philippines]]\n*[[List of Ramsar sites in the Philippines]]\n*[[Biosphere reserves of the Philippines]]\n*[[Spanish Colonial Fortifications of the Philippines]]\n*[[Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Philippines]]\n*[[Lists of Cultural Properties of the Philippines]]\n*[[Archaeology of the Philippines]]\n*[[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]]\n*[[List of national parks of the Philippines]]\n*[[World Heritage Sites in the Philippines]]\n*[[List of mosques in the Philippines]]\n*[[Ship burial in Asia]]\n*[[National Artist of the Philippines]]\n*[[National Living Treasures Award (Philippines)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\nAndrei Salokhin and Nastia Khanenia.

At early discovery / development stage, the clinical TI of a drug candidate is not known. However, understanding the preliminary TI of a drug candidate is of utmost importance as early as possible since TI is an important indicator of the probability of the successful development of a drug. Recognizing drug candidates with potentially suboptimal TI at earliest possible stage helps to initiate mitigation or potentially re-deploy resources.\n\nIn a drug development setting, TI is the quantitative relationship between efficacy (pharmacology) and safety (toxicology), without considering the nature of pharmacological or toxicological endpoints themselves. However, to convert a calculated TI to something that is more than just a number, the nature and limitations of pharmacological and/or toxicological endpoints must be considered. Depending on the intended clinical indication, the associated unmet medical need and/or the competitive situation, more or less weight can be given to either the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate with the aim to create a well balanced indication-specific safety vs efficacy profile.\n\nIn general, it is the exposure of a given tissue to drug (i.e. drug concentration over time), rather than dose, that drives the pharmacological and toxicological effects. For example, at the same dose there may be marked inter-individual variability in exposure due to polymorphisms in metabolism, DDIs or differences in body weight or environmental factors. These considerations emphasize the importance of using exposure rather than dose for calculating TI. To account for delays between exposure and toxicity, the TI for toxicities that occur after multiple dose administrations should be calculated using the exposure to drug at steady state rather than after administration of a single dose.\n\nA review published by Muller and Milton in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery critically discusses the various aspects of TI determination and interpretation in a translational drug development setting for both small molecules and biotherapeutics.<ref name=\"muller-Milton2012\"/>\n\n==Range of therapeutic indices==\nThe therapeutic index varies widely among substances, even within a related group. \n\nFor instance, the [[opioid]] [[analgesics|painkiller]] [[remifentanil]] is very forgiving, offering a therapeutic index of 33,000:1, while [[Diazepam]], a [[benzodiazepine]] [[sedative-hypnotic]] and skeletal [[muscle relaxant]], has a less forgiving therapeutic index of 100:1.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanley TH | title = Anesthesia for the 21st century | journal = Proceedings | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 7\u201310 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 16389318 | pmc = 1312206 | doi = 10.1080/08998280.2000.11927635 }}</ref> Morphine is even less so with a therapeutic index of 70.\n\nLess safe are [[cocaine]], a [[stimulant]] and [[local anaesthetic]], and [[ethanol]] (colloquially, the \"alcohol\" in [[alcoholic beverage]]s), a widely available [[sedative]] consumed worldwide \u2013 the therapeutic indices for these substances are 15:1 and 10:1, respectively.<ref name=\"Drug comparison\" /> \n\nEven less-safe are drugs such as [[digoxin]], a [[cardiac glycoside]]; its therapeutic index is approximately 2:1.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker DE | title = Drug therapy in dental practice: general principles.

The source of high energy arises from x-rays, gamma rays, charged particles and heavy particles. The therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy for cancer treatment is related to the maximum radiation dose by which death of cancer cells is locally controlled and the minimum radiation dose by which cells in normal tissues have low acute and late morbidity.<ref name=\"Thoms 217\u2013222\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Thoms J, Bristow RG | title = DNA repair targeting and radiotherapy: a focus on the therapeutic ratio | journal = Seminars in Radiation Oncology | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 217\u201322 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20832013 | doi = 10.1016/j.semradonc.2010.06.003 }}</ref> Both of parameters have sigmoidal dose-response curves. Thus, a favorable outcome in dose-response curve is the response of tumor tissue is greater than that of normal tissue to the same dose, meaning that the treatment is effective to tumors and does not cause serious morbidity to normal tissue. Reversely, overlapping response of two tissues is highly likely to cause serious morbidity to normal tissue and ineffective treatment to tumors. The mechanism of radiation therapy is categorized into direct and indirect radiation. Both of direct and indirect radiations induce DNAs to have a mutation or chromosomal rearrangement during its repair process. Direct radiation creates a free DNA radical from radiation energy deposition that damages DNA. Indirect radiation occurs from radiolysis of water, creating a free hydroxyl radical, hydronium and electron. Then, hydroxyl radical transfers its radical to DNA.  Or together with hydronium and electron, a free hydroxyl radical can damage base region of DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yokoya | first1 = A. | last2 = Shikazono | first2 = N. | last3 = Fujii | first3 = K. | last4 = Urushibara | first4 = A. | last5 = Akamatsu | first5 = K. | last6 = Watanabe | first6 = R. | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2008-10-01 | title = DNA damage induced by the direct effect of radiation | journal = Radiation Physics and Chemistry | series = The International Symposium on Charged Particle and Photon Interaction with Matter \u2013 ASR 2007 | volume = 77 | issue = 10\u201312 | pages = 1280\u201385 | doi =10.1016/j.radphyschem.2008.05.021 }}</ref>\n \nCancer cells have imbalance of signals in [[cell cycle]]. G1 and G2/M arrest are found to be major checkpoints by irradiation in human cells. G1 arrest delays repair mechanism before synthesis of DNA in S phase and mitosis in M phase, suggesting key checkpoint to lead survival of cells. G2/M arrest occurs when cells need to repair after S phase before the mitotic entry. It was also known that S phase is the most resistant to radiation and M phase was the most sensitive to radiation. [[p53]], a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in G1 and G2/M arrest, enabled the understanding of the cell cycle by radiation. For example, irradiation to myeloid leukemia cell leads to an increase in p53 and a decrease in the level of DNA synthesis. Patients with Ataxia telangiectasia delays have hypersensitivity to radiation due to the delay of accumulation of p53.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/ataxia-fact-sheet#q1|title=Ataxia Telangiectasia|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> In this case, cells are able to replicate without repair of their DNA, prone to incidence of cancer. Most cells are in G1 and S phase and irradiation at G2 phase showed increased radiosensitivity and thus G1 arrest has been on focus for therapeutic treatment.\nIrradiation to a tissue creates response to both irradiated and non-irridiated cells. It was found that even cells up to 50\u201375 cell diameter distant from irradiated cells have phenotype of enhanced genetic instability such as micronucleation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Soriani | first1 = Renata Rabelo | last2 = Satomi | first2 = Lucilia Cristina | last3 = Pinto | first3 = Terezinha de Jesus A. | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2005-07-01 | title = Effects of ionizing radiation in ginkgo and guarana | journal = Radiation Physics and Chemistry | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 239\u201342 | doi = 10.1016/j.radphyschem.2005.01.003 }}</ref> This suggests the effect of cell-to-cell communication such as paracrine and juxtacrine signaling. Normal cells do not lose DNA repair mechanism whereas cancer cells often lose during radiotherapy. However, the nature of high energy radiation can override the ability of damaged normal cell to repair, leading to cause another risk for carcinogenesis. This suggests a significant risk associated with radiation therapy. Thus, it is desirable to improve the therapeutic ratio during radiotherapy. Employing IG-IMRT, protons and heavy ions are likely to minimize dose to normal tissues by altered fractionation. Molecular targeting to DNA repair pathway can lead to radiosensitization or radioprotection. Examples are direct and indirect inhibitors on DNA double-strand breaks. Direct inhibitors target proteins (PARP family) and kinases (ATM, DNA-PKCs) that are involved in DNA repair.  Indirect inhibitors target proteins tumor cell signaling proteins such as EGFR and insulin growth factor.<ref name=\"Thoms 217\u2013222\"/>\n\nThe effective therapeutic index can be affected by [[Targeted drug delivery|targeting]], in which the therapeutic agent is concentrated in its area of effect.  For example, in [[Radiation treatment|radiation therapy]] for cancerous tumors, shaping the radiation beam precisely to the profile of a tumor in the \"beam's eye view\" can increase the delivered dose without increasing toxic effects, though such shaping might not change the therapeutic index. Similarly, chemotherapy or radiotherapy with infused or injected agents can be made more efficacious by attaching the agent to an oncophilic substance, as is done in [[peptide receptor radionuclide therapy]] for [[neuroendocrine tumors]] and in chemoembolization or radioactive microspheres therapy for liver tumors and metastases.  This concentrates the agent in the targeted tissues and lowers its concentration in others, increasing efficacy and lowering toxicity.\n\n==Safety ratio==\nSometimes the term '''safety ratio''' is used instead, particularly when referring to [[psychoactive drugs]] used for non-therapeutic purposes, e.g. recreational use.<ref name=\"Drug comparison\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gable RS | title = Comparison of acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused psychoactive substances | journal = Addiction | volume = 99 | issue = 6 | pages = 686\u201396 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15139867 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00744.x | url = http://rgable.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/toxicity-addiction-offprint2.pdf }}</ref>  In such cases, the ''effective'' dose is the amount and frequency that produces the ''desired'' effect, which can vary, and can be greater or less than the therapeutically effective dose.\n\nThe ''Certain Safety Factor'', also referred to as the ''Margin of Safety (MOS)'', is the ratio of the [[lethal dose]] to 1% of population to the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]] to 99% of the population (LD{{sub|1}}/ED{{sub|99}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.courses.vcu.edu/ptxed/m2/faqs_damaj.htm|title=FAQs: Dr. Damaj|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref> This is a better safety index than the [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] for materials that have both desirable and undesirable effects, because it factors in the ends of the spectrum where doses may be necessary to produce a response in one person but can, at the same dose, be lethal in another.\n\n: <math>\\text{Certain safety factor} = \\mathrm{\\frac{LD_1}{ED_{99}}}</math>\n\n==Synergistic effect==\nA therapeutic index does not consider drug interactions or [[synergy|synergistic]] effects.  For example, the risk associated with benzodiazepines increases significantly when taken with alcohol, opiates, or stimulants when compared with being taken alone.{{medcn|date=September 2013}}  Therapeutic index also does not take into account the ease or difficulty of reaching a toxic or lethal dose. This is more of a consideration for recreational drug users, as the purity can be highly variable.\n\n==Protective index==\nThe [[protective index]] is a similar concept, except that it uses TD<sub>50</sub> (median ''toxic'' dose) in place of LD<sub>50</sub>.  For many substances, toxic effects can occur at levels far below those needed to cause death, and thus the protective index (if toxicity is properly specified) is often more informative about a substance's relative safety.  Nevertheless, the therapeutic index is still useful as it can be considered an [[upper bound]] for the protective index, and the former also has the advantages of objectivity and easier comprehension.\n\n==Therapeutic window==\nThe ''therapeutic window'' (or pharmaceutical window) of a drug is the range of drug dosages which can treat disease effectively without having toxic effects.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Rang | first1 = H.P. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Rang & Dale's Pharmacology | date = 2015 | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | isbn = 978-0-7020-5362-7 | section = Pharmacokinetics | pages = 125 | edition = 8th | display-authors = etal }}</ref> Medication with a small therapeutic window must be administered with care and control, frequently measuring blood concentration of the drug, to avoid harm. Medications with narrow therapeutic windows include theophylline, [[digoxin]], [[lithium (medication)|lithium]], and [[warfarin]].\n\n==Optimal biological dose==\nOptimal biological dose (OBD) is the quantity of a drug that will most effectively produce the desired effect while remaining in the range of acceptable toxicity.\n\n==Maximum tolerated dose==\nThe '''maximum tolerated dose''' (MTD) refers to the highest dose of a radiological or [[pharmacological agent|pharmacological]] treatment that will produce the desired effect without unacceptable [[toxicity]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= National Cancer Institute |accessdate=26 July 2010|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary/?CdrID=546597 |title=maximum tolerated dose |work=Dictionary of Cancer Terms}}</ref><ref>{{CRS|article = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition|url = http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf|author= Jasper Womach}}</ref>  The purpose of administering MTD is to determine whether long-term exposure to a chemical might lead to unacceptable [[adverse health effect]]s in a population, when the level of exposure is not sufficient to cause premature [[mortality rate|mortality]] due to short-term [[toxic effect]]s.  The maximum dose is used, rather than a lower dose, to reduce the number of [[human subjects research|test subjects]] (and, among other things, the cost of testing), to detect an effect that might occur only rarely.  This type of analysis is also used in establishing [[chemical residue]] tolerances in foods. Maximum tolerated dose studies are also done in [[clinical trials]].\n\nMTD is an essential aspect of a drug's profile. All modern healthcare systems dictate a maximum safe dose for each drug, and generally have numerous safeguards (e.g. insurance quantity limits and government-enforced maximum quantity/time-frame limits) to prevent the prescription and dispensing of quantities exceeding the highest dosage which has been demonstrated to be safe for members of the general patient population.\n\nPatients are often unable to tolerate the theoretical MTD of a drug due to the occurrence of side-effects which are not innately a manifestation of toxicity (not considered to severely threaten a patients health) but cause the patient sufficient distress and/or discomfort to result in non-compliance with treatment. Such examples include emotional \"blunting\" with antidepressants, [[pruritus]] with [[opiates]], and blurred vision with [[anticholinergics]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Drug titration]] \u2013 process of finding the correct dose\n*[[Effective dose (pharmacology)|Effective dose]]\n* [[EC50]]\n* [[IC50]]\n* [[LD50]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n{{Pharmacology}}\n\n[[Category:Pharmacokinetics]]\n[[Category:Life sciences industry]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=May 2010}}\nThe '''therapeutic index''' ('''TI'''; also referred to as '''therapeutic ratio''') is a quantitative measurement of the relative safety of a drug.

Or together with hydronium and electron, a free hydroxyl radical can damage base region of DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yokoya | first1 = A. | last2 = Shikazono | first2 = N. | last3 = Fujii | first3 = K. | last4 = Urushibara | first4 = A. | last5 = Akamatsu | first5 = K. | last6 = Watanabe | first6 = R. | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2008-10-01 | title = DNA damage induced by the direct effect of radiation | journal = Radiation Physics and Chemistry | series = The International Symposium on Charged Particle and Photon Interaction with Matter \u2013 ASR 2007 | volume = 77 | issue = 10\u201312 | pages = 1280\u201385 | doi =10.1016/j.radphyschem.2008.05.021 }}</ref>\n \nCancer cells have imbalance of signals in [[cell cycle]]. G1 and G2/M arrest are found to be major checkpoints by irradiation in human cells. G1 arrest delays repair mechanism before synthesis of DNA in S phase and mitosis in M phase, suggesting key checkpoint to lead survival of cells. G2/M arrest occurs when cells need to repair after S phase before the mitotic entry. It was also known that S phase is the most resistant to radiation and M phase was the most sensitive to radiation. [[p53]], a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in G1 and G2/M arrest, enabled the understanding of the cell cycle by radiation. For example, irradiation to myeloid leukemia cell leads to an increase in p53 and a decrease in the level of DNA synthesis. Patients with Ataxia telangiectasia delays have hypersensitivity to radiation due to the delay of accumulation of p53.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/ataxia-fact-sheet#q1|title=Ataxia Telangiectasia|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> In this case, cells are able to replicate without repair of their DNA, prone to incidence of cancer. Most cells are in G1 and S phase and irradiation at G2 phase showed increased radiosensitivity and thus G1 arrest has been on focus for therapeutic treatment.\nIrradiation to a tissue creates response to both irradiated and non-irridiated cells. It was found that even cells up to 50\u201375 cell diameter distant from irradiated cells have phenotype of enhanced genetic instability such as micronucleation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Soriani | first1 = Renata Rabelo | last2 = Satomi | first2 = Lucilia Cristina | last3 = Pinto | first3 = Terezinha de Jesus A. | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2005-07-01 | title = Effects of ionizing radiation in ginkgo and guarana | journal = Radiation Physics and Chemistry | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 239\u201342 | doi = 10.1016/j.radphyschem.2005.01.003 }}</ref> This suggests the effect of cell-to-cell communication such as paracrine and juxtacrine signaling. Normal cells do not lose DNA repair mechanism whereas cancer cells often lose during radiotherapy. However, the nature of high energy radiation can override the ability of damaged normal cell to repair, leading to cause another risk for carcinogenesis. This suggests a significant risk associated with radiation therapy. Thus, it is desirable to improve the therapeutic ratio during radiotherapy. Employing IG-IMRT, protons and heavy ions are likely to minimize dose to normal tissues by altered fractionation. Molecular targeting to DNA repair pathway can lead to radiosensitization or radioprotection. Examples are direct and indirect inhibitors on DNA double-strand breaks. Direct inhibitors target proteins (PARP family) and kinases (ATM, DNA-PKCs) that are involved in DNA repair.  Indirect inhibitors target proteins tumor cell signaling proteins such as EGFR and insulin growth factor.<ref name=\"Thoms 217\u2013222\"/>\n\nThe effective therapeutic index can be affected by [[Targeted drug delivery|targeting]], in which the therapeutic agent is concentrated in its area of effect.  For example, in [[Radiation treatment|radiation therapy]] for cancerous tumors, shaping the radiation beam precisely to the profile of a tumor in the \"beam's eye view\" can increase the delivered dose without increasing toxic effects, though such shaping might not change the therapeutic index. Similarly, chemotherapy or radiotherapy with infused or injected agents can be made more efficacious by attaching the agent to an oncophilic substance, as is done in [[peptide receptor radionuclide therapy]] for [[neuroendocrine tumors]] and in chemoembolization or radioactive microspheres therapy for liver tumors and metastases.  This concentrates the agent in the targeted tissues and lowers its concentration in others, increasing efficacy and lowering toxicity.\n\n==Safety ratio==\nSometimes the term '''safety ratio''' is used instead, particularly when referring to [[psychoactive drugs]] used for non-therapeutic purposes, e.g. recreational use.<ref name=\"Drug comparison\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gable RS | title = Comparison of acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused psychoactive substances | journal = Addiction | volume = 99 | issue = 6 | pages = 686\u201396 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15139867 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00744.x | url = http://rgable.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/toxicity-addiction-offprint2.pdf }}</ref>  In such cases, the ''effective'' dose is the amount and frequency that produces the ''desired'' effect, which can vary, and can be greater or less than the therapeutically effective dose.\n\nThe ''Certain Safety Factor'', also referred to as the ''Margin of Safety (MOS)'', is the ratio of the [[lethal dose]] to 1% of population to the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]] to 99% of the population (LD{{sub|1}}/ED{{sub|99}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.courses.vcu.edu/ptxed/m2/faqs_damaj.htm|title=FAQs: Dr. Damaj|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref> This is a better safety index than the [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] for materials that have both desirable and undesirable effects, because it factors in the ends of the spectrum where doses may be necessary to produce a response in one person but can, at the same dose, be lethal in another.\n\n: <math>\\text{Certain safety factor} = \\mathrm{\\frac{LD_1}{ED_{99}}}</math>\n\n==Synergistic effect==\nA therapeutic index does not consider drug interactions or [[synergy|synergistic]] effects.  For example, the risk associated with benzodiazepines increases significantly when taken with alcohol, opiates, or stimulants when compared with being taken alone.{{medcn|date=September 2013}}  Therapeutic index also does not take into account the ease or difficulty of reaching a toxic or lethal dose. This is more of a consideration for recreational drug users, as the purity can be highly variable.\n\n==Protective index==\nThe [[protective index]] is a similar concept, except that it uses TD<sub>50</sub> (median ''toxic'' dose) in place of LD<sub>50</sub>.  For many substances, toxic effects can occur at levels far below those needed to cause death, and thus the protective index (if toxicity is properly specified) is often more informative about a substance's relative safety.  Nevertheless, the therapeutic index is still useful as it can be considered an [[upper bound]] for the protective index, and the former also has the advantages of objectivity and easier comprehension.\n\n==Therapeutic window==\nThe ''therapeutic window'' (or pharmaceutical window) of a drug is the range of drug dosages which can treat disease effectively without having toxic effects.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Rang | first1 = H.P. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Rang & Dale's Pharmacology | date = 2015 | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | isbn = 978-0-7020-5362-7 | section = Pharmacokinetics | pages = 125 | edition = 8th | display-authors = etal }}</ref> Medication with a small therapeutic window must be administered with care and control, frequently measuring blood concentration of the drug, to avoid harm. Medications with narrow therapeutic windows include theophylline, [[digoxin]], [[lithium (medication)|lithium]], and [[warfarin]].\n\n==Optimal biological dose==\nOptimal biological dose (OBD) is the quantity of a drug that will most effectively produce the desired effect while remaining in the range of acceptable toxicity.\n\n==Maximum tolerated dose==\nThe '''maximum tolerated dose''' (MTD) refers to the highest dose of a radiological or [[pharmacological agent|pharmacological]] treatment that will produce the desired effect without unacceptable [[toxicity]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= National Cancer Institute |accessdate=26 July 2010|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary/?CdrID=546597 |title=maximum tolerated dose |work=Dictionary of Cancer Terms}}</ref><ref>{{CRS|article = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition|url = http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf|author= Jasper Womach}}</ref>  The purpose of administering MTD is to determine whether long-term exposure to a chemical might lead to unacceptable [[adverse health effect]]s in a population, when the level of exposure is not sufficient to cause premature [[mortality rate|mortality]] due to short-term [[toxic effect]]s.  The maximum dose is used, rather than a lower dose, to reduce the number of [[human subjects research|test subjects]] (and, among other things, the cost of testing), to detect an effect that might occur only rarely.  This type of analysis is also used in establishing [[chemical residue]] tolerances in foods. Maximum tolerated dose studies are also done in [[clinical trials]].\n\nMTD is an essential aspect of a drug's profile. All modern healthcare systems dictate a maximum safe dose for each drug, and generally have numerous safeguards (e.g. insurance quantity limits and government-enforced maximum quantity/time-frame limits) to prevent the prescription and dispensing of quantities exceeding the highest dosage which has been demonstrated to be safe for members of the general patient population.\n\nPatients are often unable to tolerate the theoretical MTD of a drug due to the occurrence of side-effects which are not innately a manifestation of toxicity (not considered to severely threaten a patients health) but cause the patient sufficient distress and/or discomfort to result in non-compliance with treatment. Such examples include emotional \"blunting\" with antidepressants, [[pruritus]] with [[opiates]], and blurred vision with [[anticholinergics]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Drug titration]] \u2013 process of finding the correct dose\n*[[Effective dose (pharmacology)|Effective dose]]\n* [[EC50]]\n* [[IC50]]\n* [[LD50]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n{{Pharmacology}}\n\n[[Category:Pharmacokinetics]]\n[[Category:Life sciences industry]]\n", "name_user": "SalineBrain", "label": "safe", "comment": "Paragraph breakouts for clarity.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"}

In June 1565 he was sent to pursue his education in France, having a yearly pension granted him by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], payable out of her French dowry.  He spent two years at the [[University of Paris|universities of Paris]] and Orleans.  On 4 January 1568 he was confirmed by royal charter in the bishopric of Galloway and [[Abbot of Tongland|abbacy]] of [[Tongland Abbey|Tongland]], vacated in his favour by his father; the charter specifies his skill in classical and oriental tongues.

He left books to the cathedral library, and a legacy for rebuilding the cloisters.\n\n==Works==\n*''Panegyrique de Congratulation... par Jean de Gordon Escossois, sieur de Long-orme, Gentil-homme ordinaire de la chambre du Roy Tres-Chrestien,'' &c., La Rochelle, 1603, 8vo; also in English, by E.G.

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). (Distribution rights remained under United Artists.) During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. He delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous.

The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.

Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis.

When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]].

Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program.

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). (Distribution rights remained under United Artists.) During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. He delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease.

In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous.

The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Uproduced attempts to film dune involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky|Alejandro Jodorowski]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]] and [[Pierre Morel]].\n</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors.

The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct. Other director's considered before Jackson took over are said to have included [[Neill Blomkamp|Neil Blomkamp]], [[David Yates]], [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] and [[Brett Ratner|Bret Ratner]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/hobbit-rumor-neill-blomkamp-direct-no-job-mgm-gets-together/|title=Neill Blomkamp Rumored to Direct THE HOBBIT and Why No One Is Getting the Job Until MGM Gets It Together|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Tel Toro's ''The Hobbit'' would have had a similar scenario to Jackson's eventual film, but with a different design aesthetic.
