[[Sulaymaniyah Museum|Slemani Museum]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].]]\nThe complex [[grammatical conjugation]] and [[declension]] of Old Persian yielded to the structure of Middle Persian in which the dual number disappeared, leaving only singular and plural, as did gender. Middle Persian developed the [[ez\u0101fe]] construction, expressed through ''\u012b'' (modern ''ye''), to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system.\n\nAlthough the \"middle period\" of the Iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the transition from Old to Middle Persian had probably already begun before the 4th century BC. However, Middle Persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the Sassanid era (224\u2013651) inscriptions, so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty. Moreover, as a literary language, Middle Persian is not attested until much later, in the 6th or 7th century. From the 8th century onward, Middle Persian gradually began yielding to New Persian, with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\nMiddle Persian is considered to be a later form of the same dialect as Old Persian.<ref>Nicholas Sims-Williams, \"The Iranian Languages\", in Steever, Sanford (ed.) (1993), ''The Indo-European Languages'', p. 129.</ref> The native name of Middle Persian was ''Parsig'' or ''Parsik'', after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest, that is, \"of ''Pars''\", Old Persian ''Parsa'', New Persian ''[[Fars Province|Fars]]''. This is the origin of the name ''Farsi'' as it is today used to signify New Persian. Following the collapse of the Sassanid state, ''Parsik'' came to be applied exclusively to (either Middle or New) Persian that was written in the [[Arabic script]]. From about the 9th century onward, as Middle Persian was on the threshold of becoming New Persian, the older form of the language came to be erroneously called ''[[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]'', which was actually but one of the ''writing systems'' used to render both Middle Persian as well as various other Middle Iranian languages. That writing system had previously been adopted by the Sassanids (who were Persians, i.e. from the southwest) from the preceding Arsacids (who were Parthians, i.e. from the northeast). While [[Ibn al-Muqaffa']] (eighth century) still distinguished between ''Pahlavi'' (i.e. Parthian) and ''Persian'' (in Arabic text: al-Farisiyah) (i.e. Middle Persian), this distinction is not evident in Arab commentaries written after that date.\n\nGernot Windfuhr considers new Persian as an evolution of the Old Persian language and the Middle Persian language<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Comrie|first=Bernard|title=The Major Languages of South Asia, the Middle East and Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IXJ1RbE8-8C|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-93257-3}}, p. 82. \"The evolution of Persian as the culturally dominant language of major parts of the Near East, from Anatolia and Iran, to Central Asia, to northwest India until recent centuries, began with the political domination of these areas by dynasties originating in southwestern province of Iran, Pars, later Arabicised to Fars: first the Achaemenids (599\u2013331 BC) whose official language was Old Persian; then the Sassanids (c. AD 225\u2013651) whose official language was Middle Persian. Hence, the entire country used to be called Perse by the ancient Greeks, a practice continued to this day. The more general designation 'Iran(-shahr)\" derives from Old Iranian aryanam (Khshathra)' (the realm) of Aryans'. The dominance of these two dynasties resulted in Old and Middle-Persian colonies throughout the empire, most importantly for the course of the development of Persian, in the north-east i.e., what is now Khorasan, northern Afghanistan and Central Asia, as documented by the Middle Persian texts of the Manichean found in the oasis city of Turfan in Chinese Turkistan ([[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]]).

In fact, a writer of Classical Persian had at one's disposal the entire Arabic lexicon and could use Arab terms freely either for literary effect or to display erudition. Classical Persian remained essentially unchanged until the nineteenth century, when the dialect of Teheran rose in prominence, having been chosen as the capital of Persia by the Qajar Dynasty in 1787.

This became the basis of what is now known as \"Contemporary Standard Persian\".\n\n== Varieties ==\nThere are three standard varieties of modern Persian:\n*''[[Western Persian|Iranian Persian]]'' (''Persian'', ''Western Persian'', or ''Farsi'') is spoken in [[Iran]], and by minorities in [[Iraq]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] states.\n*''[[Dari language|Eastern Persian]]'' (''Dari Persian'', ''Afghan Persian'', or ''Dari'') is spoken in [[Afghanistan]].\n*''[[Tajik language|Tajiki]]'' (''Tajik Persian'') is spoken in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. It is written in the [[Cyrillic script]].\n\nAll these three varieties are based on the classic Persian literature and its literary tradition. There are also several local dialects from Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard Persian. The [[Hazaragi dialect]] (in Central Afghanistan and Pakistan), [[Herat]]i (in Western Afghanistan), Darwazi (in Afghanistan and Tajikistan), and the [[Tehrani accent]] (in Iran, the basis of standard Iranian Persian) are examples of these dialects. Persian-speaking peoples of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/2005_817_17g_Beeman.pdf |title=Persian, Dari and Tajik |first=William |last=Beeman |work=[[Brown University]] |accessdate=30 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025210857/http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/2005_817_17g_Beeman.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe following are some languages closely related to Persian, or in some cases are considered dialects:\n*[[Luri language|Luri]] (or ''Lori''), spoken mainly in the southwestern Iranian provinces of [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]], [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province]], some western parts of [[Fars Province]] and some parts of [[Khuzestan Province]].\n*[[Lari language|Lari]] (in southern Iran)\n*[[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]], spoken in parts of Azerbaijan, Russia, and Transcaucasia.

Early New Persian had a series of five long vowels ({{IPAslink|i\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|u\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|\u0252\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|o\u02d0}} and {{IPAslink|e\u02d0}}) along with three short vowels {{IPAslink|\u00e6}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}. At some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern Iran, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Thus, older contrasts such as {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}} ''sh\u0113r'' \"lion\" vs. {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}} ''sh\u012br'' \"milk\", and {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u062f}} ''z\u016bd'' \"quick\" vs {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u0631}} ''z\u014dr'' \"strong\" were lost. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and in some words, ''\u0113'' and ''\u014d'' are merged into the diphthongs {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[o\u028a]}} (which are descendants of the diphthongs {{IPA|[\u00e6\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6\u028a]}} in Early New Persian), instead of merging into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Examples of the exception can be found in words such as {{lang|fa|\u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646}} {{IPA|[ro\u028a\u0283\u00e6n]}} (bright). Numerous other instances exist.\n\nHowever, in Dari, the archaic distinction of {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} (respectively known as {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''Y\u0101-ye majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''Y\u0101-ye ma'r\u016bf'') is still preserved as well as the distinction of {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} (known as {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''W\u0101w-e majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''W\u0101w-e ma'r\u016bf''). On the other hand, in standard Tajik, the length distinction has disappeared, and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged with {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} with {{IPA|/u/}}.<ref>Perry, J. R. (2005) ''A Tajik Persian Reference Grammar'' (Boston : Brill) {{ISBN|90-04-14323-8}}</ref> Therefore, contemporary Afghan Dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of Early New Persian.\n\nAccording to most studies on the subject (e.g. Samareh 1977, Pisowicz 1985, Najafi 2001), the three vowels traditionally considered long ({{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u0252/}}) are currently distinguished from their short counterparts ({{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}) by position of articulation rather than by length. However, there are studies (e.g. Hayes 1979, Windfuhr 1979) that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system, with {{IPA|/\u0252/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} phonologically long or bimoraic and {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} phonologically short or monomoraic.\n\nThere are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the Iranian system (such as Toosarvandani 2004). That offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity, which often suggests that Modern Persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of Classical Persian and a hypothetical future Iranian language, which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature.\n\nThe length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties (including Tajik).\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

The Turkish and Mongolian vocabulary in Persian is minor in comparison to that of Arabic and these words were mainly confined to military, pastoral terms and political sector (titles, administration, etc.).<ref>Xavier Planhol, \"Land of Iran\", ''Encyclopedia Iranica''. \"The Turks, on the other hand, posed a formidable threat: their penetration into Iranian lands was considerable, to such an extent that vast regions adapted their language. This process was all the more remarkable since, in spite of their almost uninterrupted political domination for nearly 1,500 years, the cultural influence of these rough nomads on Iran's refined civilization remained extremely tenuous. This is demonstrated by the mediocre linguistic contribution, for which exhaustive statistical studies have been made (Doerfer). The number of Turkish or Mongol words that entered Persian, though not negligible, remained limited to 2,135, i.e., 3 percent of the vocabulary at the most. These new words are confined on the one hand to the military and political sector (titles, administration, etc.) and, on the other hand, to technical pastoral terms. The contrast with Arab influence is striking. While cultural pressure of the Arabs on Iran had been intense, they in no way infringed upon the entire Iranian territory, whereas with the Turks, whose contributions to Iranian civilization were modest, vast regions of Iranian lands were assimilated, notwithstanding the fact that resistance by the latter was ultimately victorious. Several reasons may be offered.\"</ref> New military and political titles were coined based partially on Middle Persian (e.g. {{lang|fa|\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0634}} ''arte\u0161'' for \"army\", instead of the Uzbek {{lang|fa|\u0642\u0624\u0634\u06cc\u0646}} ''qo\u02bbshin''; {{lang|fa|\u0633\u0631\u0644\u0634\u06a9\u0631}} ''sarla\u0161kar''; {{lang|fa|\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646}} ''dary\u0101b\u0101n''; etc.) in the 20th century.\nPersian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially other [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-iv|title=ARMENIA AND IRAN iv.

Previously, two different scripts were used, [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]], used for Middle Persian, and the [[Avestan alphabet]] (in Persian, D\u012bndapirak or Din Dabire\u2014literally: religion script), used for religious purposes, primarily for the [[Avestan]] but sometimes for Middle Persian.\n\nIn the modern Persian script, [[Vowel length|historically short vowels]] are usually not written, only the historically long ones are represented in the text, so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing: Iranian Persian ''{{transl|fa|kerm}}'' \"worm\", ''{{transl|fa|karam}}'' \"generosity\", ''{{transl|fa|kerem}}'' \"cream\", and ''{{transl|fa|krom}}'' \"chrome\" are all spelled ''{{transl|fa|krm}}'' ({{lang|fa|\u06a9\u0631\u0645}}) in Persian. The reader must determine the word from context. The Arabic system of vocalization marks known as ''[[harakat]]'' is also used in Persian, although some of the symbols have different pronunciations. For example, a ''[[\u1e0dammah]]'' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u028a~u]}}, while in Iranian Persian it is pronounced {{IPA|[o]}}. This system is not used in mainstream Persian literature; it is primarily used for teaching and in some (but not all) dictionaries.\n[[File:Persian typewriter keyboard layout.svg|thumb|Persian typewriter keyboard layout]]\nThere are several letters generally only used in Arabic loanwords. These letters are pronounced the same as similar Persian letters. For example, there are four functionally identical letters for {{IPAslink|z}} ({{lang|fa|\u0632 \u0630 \u0636 \u0638}}), three letters for {{IPAslink|s}} ({{lang|fa|\u0633 \u0635 \u062b}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|t}} ({{lang|fa|\u0637 \u062a}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|h}} ({{lang|fa|\u062d \u0647}}).\nOn the other hand, there are four letters that don't exist in Arabic {{lang|fa| \u067e \u0686 \u0698 \u06af}}.\n\n==== Additions ====\nThe [[Persian alphabet]] adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n! Sound\n! Isolated form\n! Name\n|-\n| {{IPA|/p/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u067e}}\n| ''pe''\n|-\n| {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u0686}}\n| ''\u010de (che)''\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0292/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u0698}}\n| ''\u017ee (zhe or jhe)''\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0261/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u06af}}\n| ''ge (g\u0101f)''\n|}\n\nHistorically, there was also a special letter for the sound {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}. This letter is no longer used, as the /\u03b2/-sound changed to /b/, e.g. archaic \u0632\u06a4\u0627\u0646 /za\u03b2\u0101n/ > \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 /z\u00e6b\u0252n/ 'language'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/persian-language-1-early-new-persian|title=PERSIAN LANGUAGE i.

Name\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}\n|style=\"font-size: larger\"| {{lang|fa|\u06a4}}\n| ''\u03b2e''\n|}\n\n==== Variations ====\nThe Persian alphabet also modifies some letters of the Arabic alphabet. For example, ''alef with hamza below'' ( {{lang|ar|\u0625}} ) changes to ''[[aleph|alef]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u0627}} ); words using various [[hamza]]s get spelled with yet another kind of hamza (so that {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644}} becomes {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0626\u0648\u0644}}) even though the latter is also correct in Arabic; and ''[[teh marbuta]]'' ( {{lang|ar|\u0629}} ) changes to ''[[he (letter)|heh]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u0647}} ) or ''[[taw (letter)|teh]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u062a}} ).\n\nThe letters different in shape are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n! Arabic Style letter\n! Persian Style letter\n! name\n|-\n|style=\"font-size: 160%\"| \u0643\n|style=\"font-size: 160%\"| \u06a9\n| ''ke'' (k\u0101f)\n|-\n|style=\"font-size: 160%\"| \u064a\n|style=\"font-size: 160%\"| \u06cc\n| ''ye''\n|}\n\n=== Latin alphabet ===\n{{Main|Romanization of Persian}}\n\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] has published a standard for simplified [[transliteration]] of Persian into Latin, ISO 233-3, titled \"Information and documentation \u2013 Transliteration of Arabic characters into Latin characters \u2013 Part 3: Persian language \u2013 Simplified transliteration\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=2398 |title=ISO 233-3:1999 |publisher=Iso.org |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}</ref> but the transliteration scheme is not in widespread use.\n\nAnother Latin alphabet, based on the [[Common Turkic Alphabet#In the USSR|Common Turkic Alphabet]], was used in [[Tajikistan]] in the 1920s and 1930s. The alphabet was phased out in favor of [[Tajik Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"perry2005\" />\n\n[[Fingilish]] is Persian using [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. It is most commonly used in [[online chat|chat]], [[email]]s and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] applications. The orthography is not standardized, and varies among writers and even media (for example, typing 'aa' for the {{IPA|[\u0252]}} phoneme is easier on computer keyboards than on cellphone keyboards, resulting in smaller usage of the combination on cellphones).\n\n=== Tajik alphabet ===\n[[File:Akademijai ilmxhoi jumxhurii tojikiston.jpg|thumb|right|Tajiki advertisement for an academy]]\n{{Main|Tajik alphabet}}\n\nThe Cyrillic script was introduced for writing the [[Tajik language]] under the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the late 1930s, replacing the [[Tajik alphabet#Transliteration standards|Latin alphabet]] that had been used since the [[October Revolution]] and the Persian script that had been used earlier. After 1939, materials published in Persian in the Persian script were banned from the country.<ref name=\"perry2005\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.smallwars.quantico.usmc.mil/search/LessonsLearned/afghanistan/groundcombat.asp |title=Smallwars.quantico.usmc.mil |access-date=13 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122154531/http://www.smallwars.quantico.usmc.mil/search/LessonsLearned/afghanistan/groundcombat.asp |archive-date=22 January 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\nThe following text is from Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Sulaymaniyah Museum|Slemani Museum]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].]]\nThe complex [[grammatical conjugation]] and [[declension]] of Old Persian yielded to the structure of Middle Persian in which the dual number disappeared, leaving only singular and plural, as did gender. Middle Persian developed the [[ez\u0101fe]] construction, expressed through ''\u012b'' (modern ''ye''), to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system.\n\nAlthough the \"middle period\" of the Iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the transition from Old to Middle Persian had probably already begun before the 4th century BC. However, Middle Persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the Sassanid era (224\u2013651) inscriptions, so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty. Moreover, as a literary language, Middle Persian is not attested until much later, in the 6th or 7th century. From the 8th century onward, Middle Persian gradually began yielding to New Persian, with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\nMiddle Persian is considered to be a later form of the same dialect as Old Persian.<ref>Nicholas Sims-Williams, \"The Iranian Languages\", in Steever, Sanford (ed.) (1993), ''The Indo-European Languages'', p. 129.</ref> The native name of Middle Persian was ''Parsig'' or ''Parsik'', after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest, that is, \"of ''Pars''\", Old Persian ''Parsa'', New Persian ''[[Fars Province|Fars]]''. This is the origin of the name ''Farsi'' as it is today used to signify New Persian. Following the collapse of the Sassanid state, ''Parsik'' came to be applied exclusively to (either Middle or New) Persian that was written in the [[Arabic script]]. From about the 9th century onward, as Middle Persian was on the threshold of becoming New Persian, the older form of the language came to be erroneously called ''[[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]'', which was actually but one of the ''writing systems'' used to render both Middle Persian as well as various other Middle Iranian languages. That writing system had previously been adopted by the Sassanids (who were Persians, i.e. from the southwest) from the preceding Arsacids (who were Parthians, i.e. from the northeast). While [[Ibn al-Muqaffa']] (eighth century) still distinguished between ''Pahlavi'' (i.e. Parthian) and ''Persian'' (in Arabic text: al-Farisiyah) (i.e. Middle Persian), this distinction is not evident in Arab commentaries written after that date.\n\nGernot Windfuhr considers new Persian as an evolution of the Old Persian language and the Middle Persian language<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Comrie|first=Bernard|title=The Major Languages of South Asia, the Middle East and Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IXJ1RbE8-8C|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-93257-3}}, p. 82. \"The evolution of Persian as the culturally dominant language of major parts of the Near East, from Anatolia and Iran, to Central Asia, to northwest India until recent centuries, began with the political domination of these areas by dynasties originating in southwestern province of Iran, Pars, later Arabicised to Fars: first the Achaemenids (599\u2013331 BC) whose official language was Old Persian; then the Sassanids (c. AD 225\u2013651) whose official language was Middle Persian. Hence, the entire country used to be called Perse by the ancient Greeks, a practice continued to this day. The more general designation 'Iran(-shahr)\" derives from Old Iranian aryanam (Khshathra)' (the realm) of Aryans'. The dominance of these two dynasties resulted in Old and Middle-Persian colonies throughout the empire, most importantly for the course of the development of Persian, in the north-east i.e., what is now Khorasan, northern Afghanistan and Central Asia, as documented by the Middle Persian texts of the Manichean found in the oasis city of Turfan in Chinese Turkistan ([[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]]).

In fact, a writer of Classical Persian had at one's disposal the entire Arabic lexicon and could use Arab terms freely either for literary effect or to display erudition. Classical Persian remained essentially unchanged until the nineteenth century, when the dialect of Teheran rose in prominence, having been chosen as the capital of Persia by the Qajar Dynasty in 1787.

The ultimate goal was to prevent books from being printed with wrong use of words.

It was established by the initiative of [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]], and mainly by [[Hekmat E Shirazi|Hekmat e Shirazi]] and [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]], all prominent names in the nationalist movement of the time. \nThe academy was a key institution in the struggle to re-build Iran as a nation-state after the collapse of the Qajar dynasty. During the 1930s and 1940s, the academy led massive campaigns to replace the many [[Arabic]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], and [[Greek language|Greek]] loanwords whose widespread use in Persian during the centuries preceding the foundation of the Pahlavi dynasty had created a literary language considerably different from the spoken Persian of the time. This became the basis of what is now known as \"Contemporary Standard Persian\".\n\n== Varieties ==\nThere are three standard varieties of modern Persian:\n*''[[Western Persian|Iranian Persian]]'' (''Persian'', ''Western Persian'', or ''Farsi'') is spoken in [[Iran]], and by minorities in [[Iraq]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] states.\n*''[[Dari language|Eastern Persian]]'' (''Dari Persian'', ''Afghan Persian'', or ''Dari'') is spoken in [[Afghanistan]].\n*''[[Tajik language|Tajiki]]'' (''Tajik Persian'') is spoken in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. It is written in the [[Cyrillic script]].\n\nAll these three varieties are based on the classic Persian literature and its literary tradition. There are also several local dialects from Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard Persian. The [[Hazaragi dialect]] (in Central Afghanistan and Pakistan), [[Herat]]i (in Western Afghanistan), Darwazi (in Afghanistan and Tajikistan), and the [[Tehrani accent]] (in Iran, the basis of standard Iranian Persian) are examples of these dialects. Persian-speaking peoples of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/2005_817_17g_Beeman.pdf |title=Persian, Dari and Tajik |first=William |last=Beeman |work=[[Brown University]] |accessdate=30 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025210857/http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/2005_817_17g_Beeman.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe following are some languages closely related to Persian, or in some cases are considered dialects:\n*[[Luri language|Luri]] (or ''Lori''), spoken mainly in the southwestern Iranian provinces of [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]], [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province]], some western parts of [[Fars Province]] and some parts of [[Khuzestan Province]].\n*[[Lari language|Lari]] (in southern Iran)\n*[[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]], spoken in parts of Azerbaijan, Russia, and Transcaucasia.

Early New Persian had a series of five long vowels ({{IPAslink|i\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|u\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|\u0252\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|o\u02d0}} and {{IPAslink|e\u02d0}}) along with three short vowels {{IPAslink|\u00e6}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}. At some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern Iran, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Thus, older contrasts such as {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}} ''sh\u0113r'' \"lion\" vs. {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}} ''sh\u012br'' \"milk\", and {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u062f}} ''z\u016bd'' \"quick\" vs {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u0631}} ''z\u014dr'' \"strong\" were lost. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and in some words, ''\u0113'' and ''\u014d'' are merged into the diphthongs {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[o\u028a]}} (which are descendants of the diphthongs {{IPA|[\u00e6\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6\u028a]}} in Early New Persian), instead of merging into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Examples of the exception can be found in words such as {{lang|fa|\u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646}} {{IPA|[ro\u028a\u0283\u00e6n]}} (bright). Numerous other instances exist.\n\nHowever, in Dari, the archaic distinction of {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} (respectively known as {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''Y\u0101-ye majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''Y\u0101-ye ma'r\u016bf'') is still preserved as well as the distinction of {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} (known as {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''W\u0101w-e majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''W\u0101w-e ma'r\u016bf''). On the other hand, in standard Tajik, the length distinction has disappeared, and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged with {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} with {{IPA|/u/}}.<ref>Perry, J. R. (2005) ''A Tajik Persian Reference Grammar'' (Boston : Brill) {{ISBN|90-04-14323-8}}</ref> Therefore, contemporary Afghan Dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of Early New Persian.\n\nAccording to most studies on the subject (e.g. Samareh 1977, Pisowicz 1985, Najafi 2001), the three vowels traditionally considered long ({{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u0252/}}) are currently distinguished from their short counterparts ({{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}) by position of articulation rather than by length. However, there are studies (e.g. Hayes 1979, Windfuhr 1979) that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system, with {{IPA|/\u0252/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} phonologically long or bimoraic and {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} phonologically short or monomoraic.\n\nThere are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the Iranian system (such as Toosarvandani 2004). That offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity, which often suggests that Modern Persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of Classical Persian and a hypothetical future Iranian language, which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature.\n\nThe length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties (including Tajik).\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

The Turkish and Mongolian vocabulary in Persian is minor in comparison to that of Arabic and these words were mainly confined to military, pastoral terms and political sector (titles, administration, etc.).<ref>Xavier Planhol, \"Land of Iran\", ''Encyclopedia Iranica''. \"The Turks, on the other hand, posed a formidable threat: their penetration into Iranian lands was considerable, to such an extent that vast regions adapted their language. This process was all the more remarkable since, in spite of their almost uninterrupted political domination for nearly 1,500 years, the cultural influence of these rough nomads on Iran's refined civilization remained extremely tenuous. This is demonstrated by the mediocre linguistic contribution, for which exhaustive statistical studies have been made (Doerfer). The number of Turkish or Mongol words that entered Persian, though not negligible, remained limited to 2,135, i.e., 3 percent of the vocabulary at the most. These new words are confined on the one hand to the military and political sector (titles, administration, etc.) and, on the other hand, to technical pastoral terms. The contrast with Arab influence is striking. While cultural pressure of the Arabs on Iran had been intense, they in no way infringed upon the entire Iranian territory, whereas with the Turks, whose contributions to Iranian civilization were modest, vast regions of Iranian lands were assimilated, notwithstanding the fact that resistance by the latter was ultimately victorious. Several reasons may be offered.\"</ref> New military and political titles were coined based partially on Middle Persian (e.g. {{lang|fa|\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0634}} ''arte\u0161'' for \"army\", instead of the Uzbek {{lang|fa|\u0642\u0624\u0634\u06cc\u0646}} ''qo\u02bbshin''; {{lang|fa|\u0633\u0631\u0644\u0634\u06a9\u0631}} ''sarla\u0161kar''; {{lang|fa|\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646}} ''dary\u0101b\u0101n''; etc.) in the 20th century.\nPersian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially other [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-iv|title=ARMENIA AND IRAN iv.

There also exist several [[Romanization of Persian|romanization systems for Persian]].\n\n=== Persian alphabet ===\n{{Main|Persian alphabet}}\n\nModern Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian are written using the [[Persian alphabet]] which is a modified variant of the [[Arabic alphabet]], which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in Arabic language. After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest of Persia]], it took approximately 200 years which is referred to as [[Two Centuries of Silence]] in Iran, before Persians adopted the Arabic script in place of the older alphabet. Previously, two different scripts were used, [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]], used for Middle Persian, and the [[Avestan alphabet]] (in Persian, D\u012bndapirak or Din Dabire\u2014literally: religion script), used for religious purposes, primarily for the [[Avestan]] but sometimes for Middle Persian.\n\nIn the modern Persian script, [[Vowel length|historically short vowels]] are usually not written, only the historically long ones are represented in the text, so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing: Iranian Persian ''{{transl|fa|kerm}}'' \"worm\", ''{{transl|fa|karam}}'' \"generosity\", ''{{transl|fa|kerem}}'' \"cream\", and ''{{transl|fa|krom}}'' \"chrome\" are all spelled ''{{transl|fa|krm}}'' ({{lang|fa|\u06a9\u0631\u0645}}) in Persian. The reader must determine the word from context. The Arabic system of vocalization marks known as ''[[harakat]]'' is also used in Persian, although some of the symbols have different pronunciations. For example, a ''[[\u1e0dammah]]'' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u028a~u]}}, while in Iranian Persian it is pronounced {{IPA|[o]}}. This system is not used in mainstream Persian literature; it is primarily used for teaching and in some (but not all) dictionaries.\n[[File:Persian typewriter keyboard layout.svg|thumb|Persian typewriter keyboard layout]]\nThere are several letters generally only used in Arabic loanwords. These letters are pronounced the same as similar Persian letters. For example, there are four functionally identical letters for {{IPAslink|z}} ({{lang|fa|\u0632 \u0630 \u0636 \u0638}}), three letters for {{IPAslink|s}} ({{lang|fa|\u0633 \u0635 \u062b}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|t}} ({{lang|fa|\u0637 \u062a}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|h}} ({{lang|fa|\u062d \u0647}}).\nOn the other hand, there are four letters that don't exist in Arabic {{lang|fa| \u067e \u0686 \u0698 \u06af}}.\n\n==== Additions ====\nThe [[Persian alphabet]] adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n!

This letter is no longer used, as the /\u03b2/-sound changed to /b/, e.g. archaic \u0632\u06a4\u0627\u0646 /za\u03b2\u0101n/ > \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 /z\u00e6b\u0252n/ 'language'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/persian-language-1-early-new-persian|title=PERSIAN LANGUAGE i.

For example, ''alef with hamza below'' ( {{lang|ar|\u0625}} ) changes to ''[[aleph|alef]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u0627}} ); words using various [[hamza]]s get spelled with yet another kind of hamza (so that {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644}} becomes {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0626\u0648\u0644}}) even though the latter is also correct in Arabic; and ''[[teh marbuta]]'' ( {{lang|ar|\u0629}} ) changes to ''[[he (letter)|heh]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u0647}} ) or ''[[taw (letter)|teh]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u062a}} ).\n\nThe letters different in shape are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n!

The alphabet was phased out in favor of [[Tajik Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"perry2005\" />\n\n[[Fingilish]] is Persian using [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. It is most commonly used in [[online chat|chat]], [[email]]s and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] applications. The orthography is not standardized, and varies among writers and even media (for example, typing 'aa' for the {{IPA|[\u0252]}} phoneme is easier on computer keyboards than on cellphone keyboards, resulting in smaller usage of the combination on cellphones).\n\n=== Tajik alphabet ===\n[[File:Akademijai ilmxhoi jumxhurii tojikiston.jpg|thumb|right|Tajiki advertisement for an academy]]\n{{Main|Tajik alphabet}}\n\nThe Cyrillic script was introduced for writing the [[Tajik language]] under the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the late 1930s, replacing the [[Tajik alphabet#Transliteration standards|Latin alphabet]] that had been used since the [[October Revolution]] and the Persian script that had been used earlier.

It was replaced by the [[Honda CR-X del Sol]] for the 1992 model year. Although there are many supposed definitions for the acronym CR-X, the most widely accepted is \"Civic Renaissance Experimental\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/CRX|title=CRX|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the CRX (not CR-X) was marketed as an economy sport [[Kammback]], with room for two passengers. The European-spec car received a ZC {{convert|130\n|hp|abbr=on}} engine and a [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2 seating arrangement]]. Redesigned in 1988 and produced to 1991, the CRX was popular for its performance, nimble handling, and good fuel economy.

In North America, the CRX was marketed in two versions: economy and sport.  The economy model used a new aluminum 1.3 liter [[CVCC]] engine.  The sport model featured an aluminum 1.5 liter four cylinder with three valves per cylinder and available with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic.\n\nFor 1985, Honda replaced the economy model with an HF (high fuel) model featuring a 1.5 liter engine which uses an aluminum block but the 1984 CVCC cylinder head (two valves per cylinder) instead of the new aluminum head with three valves per cylinder. In spring 1985, Honda introduced an Si (Sports, injected) model featuring a more powerful 1.5 liter SOHC [[Programmed fuel injection|PGM-FI]] engine.  The Si model included a power sunroof, standard dual remote exterior mirrors, rear wiper, 13-inch alloy wheels and an Si-exclusive ducktail spoiler for the hatch.\n\nFor 1986, Honda updated the CRX with new aerodynamic headlights.  The Si received body color matched lower cladding, a revised rear spoiler, new bumper covers and 14-inch alloy wheels. The interior was upgraded and added a center console with cassette tape storage.  1987 was virtually unchanged from 1986 and would be the final year of the first generation CRX.\n\nThe first generation CRX was sold in some regions outside Japan as the \"[[Honda Civic]] CRX\". At its introduction, the CRX was available in Japan through ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' dealership sales channels, and accompanied the [[Honda Vigor|Vigor]], the [[Honda Quint|Quint]], and the [[Honda Prelude|Prelude]].\n[[File:Honda-BalladeSportsCR-X1.5i.JPG|thumb|left|1987 Honda Ballade Sports CR-X 1.5i (Japan)]]\n\n===Drivetrain===\nThe Japanese Si and European 1.6i-16 models came with a 1590 cc [[DOHC]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] putting out {{convert|135|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the UK-spec model and {{convert|140|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the [[Japanese domestic market|JDM]] model. Though similar versions of the same engine, the Japanese Si engine was stamped ZC, while the European engine was stamped ZC1.\nJapanese buyers took advantage of the largest, 1.5 L, engine while still paying the same amount of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n[[File:1987 Honda CRX Si, rear right (Lime Rock).jpg|thumb|left|1987 Honda CRX Si (U.S.)]]\n\nProject Synchronicity Honda Crx was a collaboration between American Honda and Racing Beat to install a second 1.5 liter engine with automatic transmission into the hatchback cargo area.<ref> Sherman, Don Car & Driver Magazine May 1985 p48-54 </ref> The installation of the second powertrain \"took six months and cost $20,000 dollars\". Phase Two of the project was to have Racing Beat install two 1.8 liter engines with automatic transmissions from the Honda Accord into Synchronicity.

The later 1.5 liter American-market CRX HF (high fuel economy) model (chassis codes EC1 and AF) could also reliably achieve very good gas mileage, more than a decade before gas-electric [[Hybrid car|hybrids]] appeared on the market, and at no price premium over the base model; the 1.5 liter is rated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) (under the new rating system) at {{convert|42|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} city and {{convert|51|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} highway.<ref>[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=2911 Gas Mileage of 1987 Honda Civic CRX HF], fueleconomy.gov website</ref>\n\n===U.S. model curb weights===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Colspan=\"2\"| CRX\n!| CRX HF\n!| CRX Si\n|-\n|\n| Manual\n| Automatic\n| Manual\n| Manual\n|-\n| 1984\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|\n| -\n|-\n| 1985\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1713|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|1953|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|-\n| '86-'87\n|{{convert|1865|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\">Helm Inc., Honda Civic CRX Service Manual 1986, p. 3-9</ref>\n|{{convert|1898|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|{{convert|1713|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|{{convert|1978|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|}\n\n==Second generation==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| image = 1991CRXSi.jpg\n| caption = 1991 Honda CRX Si in Tahitian green\n| production = 1987&ndash;1991\n| model_years = 1988-1991\n| wheelbase = {{convert|90.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|148.|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|147.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| width = {{convert|65.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|65.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| height = {{convert|50.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|50|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| weight = {{convert|820|-|1000|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = 1.5 L 62 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B6|D15B6]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (1988\u201389)<br> 72 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B6|D15B6]]'' I4 (1990\u201391)<br>1.5 L 92 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B2|D15B2]]'' I4<br>1.5 L 103 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B|D15B]]''<br>1.6 L 105 HP ''[[Honda D engine#D16A6|D16A6]]'' I4 (1988)<br>1.6 L 108 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A6|D16A6]]'' I4 (1989\u201391)<br>1.4 L ''[[Honda D engine#D14A1|D14A1]]'' I4{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}<br>1.6 L 130 hp '' I4<br>1.6 L 120hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A8|D16A8]]'' I4<br>1.6 L 125-129hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A9|D16A9]]'' I4<br>1.6 L 130 hp ''[[Honda ZC engine|D16ZC]]'' I4<br>1.6 L VTEC 150 hp ''[[Honda B engine#B16A1|B16A1]]'' I4\n|transmission = 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic (DX only)\n}}\n\n===Overview===\nThe chassis was significantly changed in 1988, from its original torsion bar in the front and beam axle and trailing link in the rear to 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, in line with its sister Civic/Ballade models. Outside of North America, this second generation CRX was available with a 1493&nbsp;cc SOHC or an updated version of the 1590&nbsp;cc DOHC ZC engine. Many of these were fitted with fuel injection as standard.\n\n[[File:Hondacrxsirstock.jpg|left|thumb|Honda CR-X SiR]]\nThe VTEC-equipped models also received a makeover, with updated bumpers, lights, hood, brakes, suspensions and dashboard designs amongst other things. Additionally, some of these design changes were added to the concurrent non-VTEC models.\n\nOne of the options for the [[Japanese Domestic Market]] (JDM) CR-X was a glass roof, a fixed glass panel which stretched from the top of the windshield to the top of the hatch opening. Relatively common in Japan, these are sought-after models in other markets.\n\n===Drivetrain===\nIn September 1989, Honda added the 1595&nbsp;cc [[Honda B engine|B16A]] [[VTEC]] engine to the lineup outside of North America. The VTEC (variable valve timing and lift electronic control) engine provided increased power at high RPMs while still allowing low fuel consumption and better idling at low RPMs. The B16A produced {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in the European 1.6i-VT model (where the engine bore the designation B16A1) and {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in the JDM SiR model. The CRX was the second car to receive a VTEC engine, shortly after the [[Honda Integra|Integra]], although the CRX was more popular and common.\n[[File:1990 honda crx sir 2.jpg|thumb|1990 Honda CR-X SiR]]\nThe CR-X equipped with the 1.6 DOHC engine (ZC engine) or the 1.6 DOHC VTEC engine (B16A) came with a different hood since the B16A and ZC engines were taller and required additional hood clearances in comparison to the 1.6 SOHC engines.  The ZC engine was only slightly taller than the 1.6 SOHC engine and required additional hood clearance to clear the cam gear cover.  A CR-X equipped with the ZC engine had a hood with a bump on one side which offered the additional necessary clearance.  Cars equipped with a B16A engine came with a hood that was raised across most of the engine bay to offer additional overall clearance for the taller engine.\n\n===US market===\nThree different trim levels were available: The standard (unlabeled, sometimes called the \"DX\") equipped with the 16-valve 1493&nbsp;cc \"D15B2\" engine and dual-point fuel injection (DPFI), the HF (\"high fuel efficiency\") model with the eight-valve 1493&nbsp;cc \"D15B6\" engine and multi-point fuel injection (MPFI), or the Si (sport injected) model with the 16-valve 1590&nbsp;cc \"D16A6\" engine and MPFI. \"DX\" models were available with an automatic transmission, all others had a five-speed manual transmission. A modification was made to the rear of the vehicle on all second generation vehicles in that a glass panel was installed on the upper half of the rear of the vehicle, above the tail lights which aided in rearward visibility in addition to the glass hatchback. This panel is heavily stippled black.\n\n===Features and equipment===\nAir-conditioning was a dealer-installed option on all models.  The Si model came with a power sliding [[sunroof]] and 14-inch alloy wheels.  Underneath, the Si model was equipped with a rear [[anti-sway bar]] along with variable ratio rack-and-pinion steering.  The 90-91 Si models had 4-wheel disc brakes.\n\n===Colors and trim===\nThere were a total of six colors offered each model year.  Four color options were available on the CRX and CRX Si and two color options were available for the CRX HF.  Color availability would vary based on trim package and the interior color would depend on the exterior color choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crxcommunity.com/viewtopic.php?t=5614|title=CRX Community Forum \u2022 View topic - OEM/Stock CRX Colors & Paint Codes|author=|date=|website=crxcommunity.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n!\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1988\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1989\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1990\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1991\t\t\t\t\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n!\tColor name\t!!\tCRX HF\t!!\tCRX\t!!\tCRX Si\t!!\tCRX HF\t!!\tCRX\t!!\tCRX Si\t!!\tCRX HF\t!!\tCRX\t!!\tCRX Si\t!!\tCRX HF\t!!\tCRX\t!!\tCRX Si\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tBlade silver metallic\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tBarbados yellow\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tSuperior blue metallic\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tPolar white\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tRio red\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tFlint black metallic\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tTorino red pearl\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tCelestial blue pearl\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tFrost white\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tX\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tTahitian green pearl\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\n|}\n\n===Curb weights===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Colspan=\"2\"| CRX\n!| CRX HF\n!| CRX Si\n|-\n|\n| Manual\n| Automatic\n| Manual\n| Manual\n|-\n| 1988<ref name=\"Honda CRX Specifications\">http://eu.crxsi.com/specs.htm</ref>\n|{{convert|1922|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|2017|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|-\n| 1989<ref name=\"Honda CRX Specifications\" />\n|{{convert|2048|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1834|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|2138|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|-\n| 1990\u20131991<ref name=\"Honda CRX Specifications\" />\n|{{convert|2103|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1967|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|2174|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|}\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n===Changes by model year===\n'''1988'''\n*First year of the second generation CRX.\n\n'''1989'''\n*Si and base model have door mounted seatbelts.

The del Sol was also badged as the CR-X del Sol in some markets, and known as simply the CR-X in others. It is because of this that the del Sol is generally considered the \"third Generation CR-X\" among enthusiasts, although it was arguably a very different car and Honda had seemingly quite different design goals when they built it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In the United States, the del Sol came in three trim lines: S (VXi in Japan, later VGi), Si (ESi in Europe), and VTEC (VTi in Europe) ; the JDM SiR model (not in US) featured a {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} B16A2 DOHC VTEC-engine.

In North America, the CRX was marketed in two versions: economy and sport.  The economy model used a new aluminum 1.3 liter [[CVCC]] engine.  The sport model featured an aluminum 1.5 liter four cylinder with three valves per cylinder and available with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic.\n\nFor 1985, Honda replaced the economy model with an HF (high fuel) model featuring a 1.5 liter engine which uses an aluminum block but the 1984 CVCC cylinder head (two valves per cylinder) instead of the new aluminum head with three valves per cylinder. In spring 1985, Honda introduced an Si (Sports, injected) model featuring a more powerful 1.5 liter SOHC [[Programmed fuel injection|PGM-FI]] engine.  The Si model included a power sunroof, standard dual remote exterior mirrors, rear wiper, 13-inch alloy wheels and an Si-exclusive ducktail spoiler for the hatch.\n\nFor 1986, Honda updated the CRX with new aerodynamic headlights.  The Si received body color matched lower cladding, a revised rear spoiler, new bumper covers and 14-inch alloy wheels. The interior was upgraded and added a center console with cassette tape storage.  1987 was virtually unchanged from 1986 and would be the final year of the first generation CRX.\n\nThe first generation CRX was sold in some regions outside Japan as the \"[[Honda Civic]] CRX\". At its introduction, the CRX was available in Japan through ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' dealership sales channels, and accompanied the [[Honda Vigor|Vigor]], the [[Honda Quint|Quint]], and the [[Honda Prelude|Prelude]].\n[[File:Honda-BalladeSportsCR-X1.5i.JPG|thumb|left|1987 Honda Ballade Sports CR-X 1.5i (Japan)]]\n\n===Drivetrain===\nThe Japanese Si and European 1.6i-16 models came with a 1590 cc [[DOHC]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] putting out {{convert|135|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the UK-spec model and {{convert|140|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the [[Japanese domestic market|JDM]] model. Though similar versions of the same engine, the Japanese Si engine was stamped ZC, while the European engine was stamped ZC1.\nJapanese buyers took advantage of the largest, 1.5 L, engine while still paying the same amount of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n[[File:1987 Honda CRX Si, rear right (Lime Rock).jpg|thumb|left|1987 Honda CRX Si (U.S.)]]\n\nProject Synchronicity Honda Crx was a collaboration between American Honda and Racing Beat to install a second 1.5 liter engine with automatic transmission into the hatchback cargo area.<ref> Sherman, Don Car & Driver Magazine May 1985 p48-54 </ref> The installation of the second powertrain \"took six months and cost $20,000 dollars\". Phase Two of the project was to have Racing Beat install two 1.8 liter engines with automatic transmissions from the Honda Accord into Synchronicity. The Honda CRX would be called Super Synchronicity because of the increase of performance from two larger engines.<ref> Sherman, Don Car & Driver Magazine October 1985 p94-100 </ref> Both Honda Accord 1.8 liter powertrains were fuel injected and upgrades were made to the suspension.  A Mugen body kit and upgraded wheels were also installed.<ref>https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a18734345/cd-project-cars-past-we-track-down-the-twin-engined-crx-newmans-own-turbo-and-our-72-pinto-race-car/</ref>\n\n===Fuel economy===\nThe original 1.3 liter car (chassis code AE532) had an EPA highway mileage rating of {{convert|52|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=26572|title=Compare Side-by-Side|work=fueleconomy.gov}}</ref> in 1984 and was reported to often achieve over {{convert|70|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} in favorable driving conditions.  The later 1.5 liter American-market CRX HF (high fuel economy) model (chassis codes EC1 and AF) could also reliably achieve very good gas mileage, more than a decade before gas-electric [[Hybrid car|hybrids]] appeared on the market, and at no price premium over the base model; the 1.5 liter is rated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) (under the new rating system) at {{convert|42|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} city and {{convert|51|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} highway.<ref>[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=2911 Gas Mileage of 1987 Honda Civic CRX HF], fueleconomy.gov website</ref>\n\n===U.S. model curb weights===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Colspan=\"2\"| CRX\n!| CRX HF\n!| CRX Si\n|-\n|\n| Manual\n| Automatic\n| Manual\n| Manual\n|-\n| 1984\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|\n| -\n|-\n| 1985\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1713|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|1953|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|-\n| '86-'87\n|{{convert|1865|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\">Helm Inc., Honda Civic CRX Service Manual 1986, p. 3-9</ref>\n|{{convert|1898|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|{{convert|1713|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|{{convert|1978|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|}\n\n==Second generation==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| image = 1991CRXSi.jpg\n| caption = 1991 Honda CRX Si in Tahitian green\n| production = 1987&ndash;1991\n| model_years = 1988-1991\n| wheelbase = {{convert|90.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|148.|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|147.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| width = {{convert|65.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|65.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| height = {{convert|50.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|50|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| weight = {{convert|820|-|1000|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = 1.5 L 62 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B6|D15B6]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (1988\u201389)<br> 72 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B6|D15B6]]'' I4 (1990\u201391)<br>1.5 L 92 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B2|D15B2]]'' I4<br>1.5 L 103 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B|D15B]]''<br>1.6 L 105 HP ''[[Honda D engine#D16A6|D16A6]]'' I4 (1988)<br>1.6 L 108 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A6|D16A6]]'' I4 (1989\u201391)<br>1.4 L ''[[Honda D engine#D14A1|D14A1]]'' I4{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}<br>1.6 L 130 hp '' I4<br>1.6 L 120hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A8|D16A8]]'' I4<br>1.6 L 125-129hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A9|D16A9]]'' I4<br>1.6 L 130 hp ''[[Honda ZC engine|D16ZC]]'' I4<br>1.6 L VTEC 150 hp ''[[Honda B engine#B16A1|B16A1]]'' I4\n|transmission = 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic (DX only)\n}}\n\n===Overview===\nThe chassis was significantly changed in 1988, from its original torsion bar in the front and beam axle and trailing link in the rear to 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, in line with its sister Civic/Ballade models. Outside of North America, this second generation CRX was available with a 1493&nbsp;cc SOHC or an updated version of the 1590&nbsp;cc DOHC ZC engine. Many of these were fitted with fuel injection as standard.\n\n[[File:Hondacrxsirstock.jpg|left|thumb|Honda CR-X SiR]]\nThe VTEC-equipped models also received a makeover, with updated bumpers, lights, hood, brakes, suspensions and dashboard designs amongst other things. Additionally, some of these design changes were added to the concurrent non-VTEC models.\n\nOne of the options for the [[Japanese Domestic Market]] (JDM) CR-X was a glass roof, a fixed glass panel which stretched from the top of the windshield to the top of the hatch opening. Relatively common in Japan, these are sought-after models in other markets.\n\n===Drivetrain===\nIn September 1989, Honda added the 1595&nbsp;cc [[Honda B engine|B16A]] [[VTEC]] engine to the lineup outside of North America. The VTEC (variable valve timing and lift electronic control) engine provided increased power at high RPMs while still allowing low fuel consumption and better idling at low RPMs. The B16A produced {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in the European 1.6i-VT model (where the engine bore the designation B16A1) and {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in the JDM SiR model. The CRX was the second car to receive a VTEC engine, shortly after the [[Honda Integra|Integra]], although the CRX was more popular and common.\n[[File:1990 honda crx sir 2.jpg|thumb|1990 Honda CR-X SiR]]\nThe CR-X equipped with the 1.6 DOHC engine (ZC engine) or the 1.6 DOHC VTEC engine (B16A) came with a different hood since the B16A and ZC engines were taller and required additional hood clearances in comparison to the 1.6 SOHC engines.  The ZC engine was only slightly taller than the 1.6 SOHC engine and required additional hood clearance to clear the cam gear cover.  A CR-X equipped with the ZC engine had a hood with a bump on one side which offered the additional necessary clearance.  Cars equipped with a B16A engine came with a hood that was raised across most of the engine bay to offer additional overall clearance for the taller engine.\n\n===US market===\nThree different trim levels were available: The standard (unlabeled, sometimes called the \"DX\") equipped with the 16-valve 1493&nbsp;cc \"D15B2\" engine and dual-point fuel injection (DPFI), the HF (\"high fuel efficiency\") model with the eight-valve 1493&nbsp;cc \"D15B6\" engine and multi-point fuel injection (MPFI), or the Si (sport injected) model with the 16-valve 1590&nbsp;cc \"D16A6\" engine and MPFI. \"DX\" models were available with an automatic transmission, all others had a five-speed manual transmission. A modification was made to the rear of the vehicle on all second generation vehicles in that a glass panel was installed on the upper half of the rear of the vehicle, above the tail lights which aided in rearward visibility in addition to the glass hatchback. This panel is heavily stippled black.\n\n===Features and equipment===\nAir-conditioning was a dealer-installed option on all models.  The Si model came with a power sliding [[sunroof]] and 14-inch alloy wheels.  Underneath, the Si model was equipped with a rear [[anti-sway bar]] along with variable ratio rack-and-pinion steering.

The del Sol was also badged as the CR-X del Sol in some markets, and known as simply the CR-X in others. It is because of this that the del Sol is generally considered the \"third Generation CR-X\" among enthusiasts, although it was arguably a very different car and Honda had seemingly quite different design goals when they built it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In the United States, the del Sol came in three trim lines: S (VXi in Japan, later VGi), Si (ESi in Europe), and VTEC (VTi in Europe) ; the JDM SiR model (not in US) featured a {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} B16A2 DOHC VTEC-engine. Production of the del Sol ended in 1997, and thus, the CR-X line was retired.\n\n==Comparison to other Honda vehicles==\nArticles on the 1st generation [[Honda Insight#History|Honda Insight]] have compared its appearance to that of the 1984\u20131991 CRX.<ref>{{cite web|author=Adrian Akau |url=http://www.gizmag.com/2010-honda-insight-world-premiere/10762/ |title=2010 Honda Insight world premiere |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, thirteen years after the end of CRX production, Honda released the [[Honda CR-Z|CR-Z]], regarded as the [[spiritual successor]] to the CRX.<ref name=\"20071009insideline\">{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122954|title= 2007 Tokyo Auto Show Preview: Honda CR-Z|accessdate= 22 February 2008|date= 9 October 2007|work= Inside Line|publisher= [[edmunds.com|edmunds]]|quote= Honda says the name of its sporty two-passenger concept for Tokyo \u2014 CR-Z \u2014 stands for \"Compact Renaissance Zero.\"}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe CRX was ''Motor Trend''{{'}}s [[Car of the Year|Import Car of the Year]] for 1984 and 1990, with the CRX-SI model also taking that title in 1988.

This provided great opportunities for new, small automakers{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} which could develop new cars more rapidly than the huge legacy automakers. [[Studebaker]] was the first to introduce an all-new postwar model, but Tucker took a different track, designing a safety car with innovative features and modern styling. His specifications called for a [[water-cooled]] aluminum block<ref name=fordmuseum/> [[flat-6]] [[RR layout|rear engine]], [[disc brake]]s, four-wheel [[independent suspension]],<ref name=fordmuseum/> [[fuel injection]], the location of all instruments within reach of the steering wheel, seat belts, and a padded dashboard.\n\n[[File:Tucker Torpedo Brochure c. 1947.jpg|thumb|left|Tucker Torpedo brochure, c. 1947. This concept drawing includes a centrally positioned steering wheel, doors that wrap up into the roof, and front fenders that turn when the car is cornering. These features did not reach production]]\nEven before the war's end, Preston Tucker began working on plans for his new automobile. In the summer of 1944, he hired noted car designer George S. Lawson to style his new automobile.<ref>Lawson SEC Trial Testimony, National Archives, Chicago</ref> Lawson worked on the project for over a year and a half before his design debuted publicly, beginning about February 1946 and found as late as a year later in March 1947.<ref>{{cite news |title= Car of the Future |work= San Antonio Light |date= February 11, 1946 |page= 5}}</ref> Lawson was named the Tucker Corporation's \"chief stylist\" in February 1946, immediately upon the company's formation.<ref>{{cite news |title= Torpedo Car Will Be Made in Chicago |url= https://newspaperarchive.com/us/michigan/traverse-city/traverse-city-record-eagle/1946/02-11/page-2 |work= [[Traverse City Record-Eagle]] |agency= [[United Press International]] |date= February 11, 1946 |page= 2}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1946, Lawson resigned from the company after a disagreement with Preston Tucker, and shortly thereafter, stylist [[Alex Tremulis]] of local Chicago design firm Tammen & Denison was hired and furthered the development of the Lawson design. Tucker gave Tammen & Denison and Tremulis a three-month contract, which expired in March 1947 and was not renewed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tremulis SEC Trial Testimony, National Archives, Chicago</ref> The culmination of Tremulis' efforts during this phase of design development was featured in a full-page advertisement run in numerous national newspapers in March 1947. Tremulis' design was based directly upon the work of George Lawson, but incorporated his own artistic flair.\n\nSimultaneous with Tremulis' departure, Preston Tucker hired a team of five designers ([[Read Viemeister]], Budd Steinhilber, Tucker Madawick, Hal Bergstrom and Phillip Egan) from the New York design firm [[Lippincott (brand consultancy)|J. Gordon Lippincott]], who updated Tremulis' design just as Tremulis had done with Lawson's.<ref name=\"Egan 1989\">{{cite book |last= Egan |first= Philip S. |title= Design and Destiny: The Making of the Tucker Automobile |year= 1989 |publisher= On the Mark |location= Orange, CA |isbn= 978-0-924321-00-9 |edition= 1st |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/designdestinymak00egan }}{{page needed|date= April 2014}}</ref> \n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|total_width = 400\n|image1 = 1948 Tucker Torpedo - Flickr - exfordy (2).jpg\n|image2 = Tucker.jpg\n|footer = '''(Left)''': Tucker Torpedo photographed at the 2008 Goodwood Festival of Speed, England; '''(right)''': Tucker 48 at the San Diego Automotive Museum\n}}\nAfter a month's absence, Tremulis was rehired and the two independent design groups developed full-size clay models side by side in direct competition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Surviving photographs of the two models reveal that Tremulis' clay design remained unchanged from his March 1947 advertisement proposal and was not chosen for production.

The SEC, however, failed to prove its case, and Tucker was acquitted of all charges in January 1950.<ref>{{cite news |title= Tucker Acquitted of Fraud; Wants to Build Autos |work=[[Jacksonville Daily Journal]] |date= January 24, 1950 |page= 1}}</ref> However, the company never recovered.\n\nTremulis, like George Lawson, was eventually named the Tucker Corporation's \"chief stylist,\" although the first reference to him holding this position does not appear until 1948, after the Tucker '48's exterior styling was completed.<ref>''Tucker Topics,\" Tucker Corporation, 1948</ref>\n\nThe Tucker automobile was originally named the \"Torpedo,\" but was changed to \"Tucker '48\" around the time of Lawson's departure and Tremulis' arrival, reportedly because Tucker did not want to remind the public of the horrors of World War II.

Over 3,000 people showed up at the factory in Chicago for lunch, a train tour of the plant, and the unveiling of the first prototype. The unveiling appeared doomed, however, as last-minute problems cropped up. The night before the premiere, two of the prototype's independent suspension arms snapped under the car's weight. (The prototype was extremely heavy; much heavier than the other '48s.) Minor engine problems were fixed, and the car was presentable by the time of the premiere. However, the experimental 589 engine was extremely loud. Tucker told the band to play as loud as possible to drown out the noise. Additionally the high-voltage starter required the use of outside power to get the engine started, so Tucker had the engineering team keep the engine running during the entire event, fearing that the public would see how much effort was required to get the engine started.<ref name=Wipff/> As the car was driven on to the platform, the liquid coolant boiled over and some steam escaped from the car, but no one seemed to notice.<ref name=\"Egan 1989\"/>\n\n[[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], one of the top [[Columnist|newspaper columnists]] of his time, reported publicly that the car was a fraud because it could not go backward and it went \"goose-geese\" going down the road.<ref name=duchene>{{cite news |last= Duchene |first= Paul |title= Preston Tucker: The Man behind the Car |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-01/classified/sc-cons-0127-autocover-side-20110127_1_alex-tremulis-preston-tucker-tucker-automobile |accessdate= February 10, 2012 |newspaper= Chicago Tribune |date=February 1, 2011}}</ref> Despite the fact that this problem was limited to the first prototype only, a symptom of the speed with which the first car was put together, the damage to the car's reputation was done, and a storm of negative media followed.<ref name=duchene/>\n\nTucker suffered another setback when his bids to obtain two steel mills to provide raw materials for his cars were rejected by the [[War Assets Administration]] under a shroud of questionable politics.<ref>{{cite news |last= Mitten |first= Ray |title= Tucker Fights Republic for Steel Plant |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19480125&id=8lsbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H00EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1711,2960560 |accessdate= February 10, 2012 |newspaper= The Pittsburgh Press |date= January 24, 1948|page=18}}</ref>\n\n==Continued development==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\n\n=== Engine ===\n[[File:Tucker589.JPG|thumb|Tucker 589cu.in. prototype direct drive engine.

The [[valve train]] proved problematic and the engine only produced approximately {{convert|88|hp|abbr=on}}. The high oil pressure required a 24-volt electrical system, up to 60 volts to get it started, and a long cranking time at start-up. Additionally, the oil pressure required to maintain valve function was not achieved until the engine was turning at higher RPM and Tucker's engineers struggled with keeping the valve train working at idle and lower speeds/RPM.<ref name=Wipff/> Having wasted nearly a year trying to make the 589 work, Tucker started looking for alternatives.\n\nThe company first tried the [[Lycoming engine|Lycoming]] aircraft engine, but it would not fit in the car's rear engine compartment.\n\nAn [[Air cooling|air-cooled]] flat-6 engine, the [[Franklin O-335|O-335]] made by [[Franklin Engine Company|Air Cooled Motors]] (and originally intended for the [[Bell 47]]),<ref name=burgess>{{cite book |last= Burgess-Wise |first= David |title= The World of Automobiles: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Motor Car |year= 1977 |publisher= Purnell Reference |location= Milwaukee |isbn= 978-0-8393-6009-4 |editor-last= Ward |editor-first= Ian |edition= Reference |page= 2386}}</ref> fit, and its {{convert|166|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}} pleased Tucker. He purchased four samples for $5,000 each, and his engineers converted the {{Convert|334|cid|cc}} engine to [[water-cooled|water cooling]] (a decision that has puzzled historians ever since).<ref name=burgess/> The Franklin engine was heavily modified by Tucker's engineers, including Eddie Offutt and Tucker's son Preston, Jr. at his Ypsilanti machine shop. Using an aircraft engine in an automotive application required significant modification; thus, very few parts of the original Franklin engine were retained in the final Tucker engine. This durable modification of the engine was tested at maximum power for 150 hours, the equivalent of {{convert|18000|mi|km}}, at full throttle.<ref>{{cite book |author = Auto editors of Consumer Guide |title= Cars of the Fascinating '40s: A Decade of Challenges and Changes |publisher= Publications International |year= 2002 |location= Lincolnwood, IL |pages= 264\u2013265 |isbn= 0-7853-6274-6}}</ref>\n\nTucker quickly bought Air Cooled Motors for $1.8 million to secure the engine source, then canceled all of the company's aircraft contracts so its resources could be focused on making automotive engines. This was a significant decision, since at the time of Tucker's purchase, Franklin held over 65% of post-war U.S. aviation engine production contracts. The loss of income was substantial.\n\n=== Transmission ===\n\nWith the horizontal, between-the-wheels 589 motor and its double torque converter(s) (and no reverse) drive system out, Tucker now needed a transmission to mate with the Franklin O-335. This motor was also horizontal, but its driveshaft pointed towards the front of the car. It was discovered, after a few sketches were made, that it was theoretically possible to adapt a previous transmission design intended for [[FF layout|front-engine/front wheel drive]] use. This transmission served as a temporary \"fix\" for a very real problem for the success of the Tucker.\n\n'''Pre-Selector manual transmission'''\n\nCord-Auburn Gear-Bendix Unit- It was discovered that the [[Cord Automobile|Cord]] [[Cord 810/812|810/812]]'s Auburn Gear, front-wheel-drive; 4-speed transmission, with the Bendix \"Electric Hand\" electro-vacuum shifting mechanism, fit the immediate design requirements needed to get the cars built, and on the road; until a future automatic (Tucker-built transmission) was worked out. This transmission was designed originally behind a standard V-8 engine, and pointed forward towards the front of the car, for the front wheels. However, this transmission came with a poor reputation, following its original use, in the [[Cord 810]] automobile. (In 1936, when the Cord 810 made its debut at the New York Automobile show, the transmissions were so problematic that 810 models were mostly shown without any transmission installed. Problems abounded until the last Cord was produced in 1937.) The Cord transmissions, even with refurbishing, were initially inadequate for the power and torque of the O-335 engine. The Cords lacked adequate lubrication and the main shaft was so long that it warped under load (causing gears to pop out of play), and the gear-teeth were quite weak. Nevertheless, in the Tucker, this transmission worked well enough for the new engine configuration; it provided an adequate (albeit fragile) transmission, with a reverse gear. The company then sent several of its staff, including Preston Tucker Jr., on a campaign to buy used Cord transmissions, for reconditioning; a total of 22 used transmissions were acquired from junkyards and used car dealers. These transmissions were taken to the Ypsilanti Machine And Tool Company. After refurbishment, several were mated to the O-335 and found to work, providing four speeds forward and reverse. It was decided, consequently,  that the Cord design, nearly 12 years old, would become the \"manual transmission\" for the 1948 and subsequent Tucker automobiles. About eight to 10 of the 22 Cords were found to be usable and \u2013 since newly-made Cord Y-1 transmissions were not yet available \u2013 were installed in production Tucker vehicles. Several of these cars, with Cord transmissions, have survived.\n\n'''Ypsilanti Y-1 transmission''' Ypsilanti Machine and Tool Company, which was tapped to recondition the Cord units, began immediately redesigning the transmission for mass production for Tucker. This new design, which had few similar parts to the Cord transmission, still used the same basic indirect transmission design, but had all new gearing, shafts and electro-vacuum controls. Tucker and his engineers modified it, installing stronger gears and lengthening the case. The modified Cord transmission was named the Tucker Y-1 (Ypsilanti-1) and was installed in a few Tuckers. Both also used a Bendix designed electric vacuum shift mechanism with no mechanical linkage to the steering column shift lever. These EVS's had problems of their own with electrical connections and vacuum leaks that hindered shifting, so a new fully mechanical shift design would have been needed, had the Tucker made it into 1949, and beyond.\n\n'''Tucker-Matic drive'''[[File:Tucker335andTuckermaticR12.JPG|thumb|Tucker 335 engine and Tuckermatic R-1-2 transmission (trans recovered from car #1042; note second torque converter on the end).]]\nTo solve the transmission problems with a new final transmission design, Warren Rice, creator of the [[Buick]] [[Dynaflow]] transmission, was consulted. A unique [[continuously variable transmission]] called the \"Tucker-Matic\" was designed, which was strong enough to handle the Franklin O-335's power and torque. It was a simple but effective design, with double torque converters and only 27 basic moving parts which was about 90 fewer than normally required for a contemporary automatic. The double torque converters allowed a continuously variable drive ratio with only one forward gear and one reverse gear which used the torque converters to vary the transmission ratio based on load and engine speed.\n\nThe only surviving car with a Tucker-Matic installed had a standard column shift lever, with a three position quadrant on the steering column. Up was reverse, the middle was neutral, and down was drive. Due to the Tucker-Matic's design, no lower gear selections were necessary, hence there was no need for a multi gated selector like other automatics.\n\nThree versions of the Tucker-Matic were made, the R-1, R-1-2, and R-3, (R for Warren Rice, its designer). The first version, the R-1, was not installed on any of the final cars. It required the engine to be off in order to select a gear. The R-1-2 was improved by adding a [[layshaft]] brake to allow gear selection while the engine was running. This version was installed on cars #1026 and 1042 only. The R-3 version had further improvements including a [[centrifugal clutch]] to help shifting between forward and reverse even further, but it was never installed in any of the final cars.\n\nBecause the two torque converters on the Tuckermatic made the engine-transmission unit longer, the fuel tank in the Tucker '48 had to be moved from behind the rear seat to in front of the dashboard for all Tuckers from car #1026 forward, even though only two of them actually had the Tuckermatic installed. This had the added advantage of improving weight distribution in the car.\n\n'''Other drives contemplated for the Tucker 48''' A Borg-Warner based, 3-speed automatic was supposedly tested and was installed on car #1048 at some point when the company was in business. Although no histories written ever mentioned such a drive. That said, Tucker ultimately wanted to design his own transmission for the final car, which came to fruition with the Tucker-Matic discussed below. In 1949, #1048 was sold at the receivership auction WITHOUT a transmission installed. Today, #1048 has the 4 speed pre-selector transmission that was used on all but 2 of the Original 50 pilot models. It is likely this transmission was privately installed after the auction transpired. Further likely is that the unit was the Ypsilanti Built Y-1 transmission.\n\n===Suspension and body===\n[[File:RearTorsionTubeandFrontSandwich.JPG|thumb|Tucker rear suspension rubber torsion tube (left) and Sandwich type front suspension (right) used on cars #1001\u20131025.]]\n[[File:RubberTorsionTube2Front.JPG|thumb|Tucker Rubber Torsion Tube (version2) Front Suspension used on car #1026-on. This unit taken from car #1046 for V8 conversion.]]\nSuspension designs, especially the front suspension, had to be changed throughout development. Rather than steel springs, Tucker used an elastomeric (rubber) 4-wheel independent<ref name=flory /> suspension similar to what was used on the race cars he developed with [[Harry Miller (auto racing)|Harry Miller]] at the [[Indianapolis 500]]. The rubber elastomers were developed with assistance from the [[Firestone Tire Company]] and used a special [[Vulcanization]] process to produce a specific spring rate.\n\nTucker's suspension designs were plagued with severe stiffness throughout development, which, while good for handling, caused front-wheel corner lift when cornering on uneven surfaces. The test bed and the prototype had a double-rubber disc type front and rear suspension, similar to Miller's race cars, which was too weak for the weight of a passenger car. On cars #1001 and 1002 the rear wheels could not be removed without removing the fender or suspension due to the stiffness of the suspension and the rear wheel arch fender design. From car #1003 on, the rear fender shape was changed so the tire could be removed easily. Aside from the fender changes, the rear suspension remained the same from car #1001 on.\n\nThree versions of the front suspension were installed in the cars (aside from the rubber-disc style used on the prototype). Cars #1001\u20131002 used a rubber torsion tube design, which suffered from severe toe-in during heavy braking. Tucker then switched to a rubber sandwich type suspension (with a rubber block sandwiched between the upper and lower A-arms) on cars #1003\u20131025, however, this type was severely stiff. Starting on car #1026, Tucker finally settled on a suspension design with a modified version of the rubber torsion tube with the toe-in braking problem corrected.\n\nOriginal Tucker paint color codes:<ref name=fordmuseum />\n* 100: Black\n* 200: Waltz Blue\n* 300: Green\n* 400: Beige\n* 500: Grey (Silver)\n* 600: Maroon\n\nOriginal Tucker interior trim color codes:<ref name=\"lemaymarymount.org\"/>\n* 900: Green\n* 920: Blue\n* 940: Beige\n\n===Funding and publicity===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TuckeratIndy.png|left|thumb|200px|Tucker tests the car at Indy500 Speedway.]] -->\nHaving raised $17,000,000 in a stock issue, one of the first speculative [[initial public offering|IPO]]s, Tucker needed more money to continue development of the car. He sold dealerships and distributorships throughout the country. Another money maker was the Tucker Accessories Program. In order to secure a spot on the Tucker waiting list, future buyers could purchase accessories, like seat covers, radio, and luggage, before their car was built. This brought in an additional $2,000,000.\n\nWith the final design in place, Preston Tucker took the pre-production cars on the road to show them in towns across the country. The cars were an instant success, with crowds gathering wherever they stopped. One report says Tucker was pulled over by a police officer intent on getting a better look at the car.{{cn|date=August 2015}}\n\nTo prove the road-worthiness of his cars, Tucker and his engineers ran several cars at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in several endurance tests. During this testing, car #1027 was rolled three times at 95 miles per hour (153&nbsp;km/h), and the driver (chief mechanic Eddie Offutt) walked away with just bruises. During the crash, the windshield popped out as designed, verifying Tucker's safety features were effective. Afterwards, upon replacing a damaged tire, the car started up and was driven off the track.\n\n== SEC investigation and demise ==\n\n{{Main|Preston Tucker}}\n\n[[File:1948 Tucker Torpedo rear.jpg|right|thumb|1948 Tucker at [[Petersen Automotive Museum]], Los Angeles, California, United States]]\nOne of Tucker's most innovative business ideas caused trouble for the company. His Accessories Program raised funds by selling accessories before the car was even in production. After the war, demand for new cars was greater than dealers could supply, and most dealers had waiting lists for new cars. Preference was given to returning veterans, which meant that non-veterans were bumped down on the waiting lists indefinitely. Tucker's program allowed potential buyers that purchased Tucker accessories to obtain a guaranteed spot on the Tucker dealer waiting list for a Tucker '48 car.\n\nThis concept was investigated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and the [[United States Attorney]], and led to an [[indictment]] of company executives. Although all charges were eventually dropped, the negative publicity destroyed the company and halted production of the car.\n\n== Tucker '48 cars ==\nThe first Tucker produced was a prototype sedan, known as the \"Tin Goose\". Fifty-eight frames and bodies were built at the factory. From these parts, 36 sedans were finished before the factory was closed. After the factory closed, but before liquidation of his assets, Tucker retained a core of employees who assembled an additional 14 sedans, for a total of 50. A 51st car was partially completed. A few of the remaining frames and bodies were built into complete cars specifically #1052 and #1057 (the 1949 prototype with design changes), but the fate of others is unknown.\n\nIn the early 1950s, [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Ft. Lauderdale, Florida]], fairgrounds owner Nick Jenin purchased over ten Tuckers, the original Tucker testbed chassis, numerous Tucker parts, photos and documents.<ref name=ash>{{cite news |last= Ash |first= Agnes |title= The Car Arrived Before Its Time <!--|accessdate=February 10, 2012--> |newspaper= The Miami News |date= May 8, 1960}}</ref> He developed a traveling display called \"The Fabulous Tuckers\".

[[Studebaker]] was the first to introduce an all-new postwar model, but Tucker took a different track, designing a safety car with innovative features and modern styling.

These features did not reach production]]\nEven before the war's end, Preston Tucker began working on plans for his new automobile. In the summer of 1944, he hired noted car designer George S. Lawson to style his new automobile.<ref>Lawson SEC Trial Testimony, National Archives, Chicago</ref> Lawson worked on the project for over a year and a half before his design debuted publicly, beginning about February 1946 and found as late as a year later in March 1947.<ref>{{cite news |title= Car of the Future |work= San Antonio Light |date= February 11, 1946 |page= 5}}</ref> Lawson was named the Tucker Corporation's \"chief stylist\" in February 1946, immediately upon the company's formation.<ref>{{cite news |title= Torpedo Car Will Be Made in Chicago |url= https://newspaperarchive.com/us/michigan/traverse-city/traverse-city-record-eagle/1946/02-11/page-2 |work= [[Traverse City Record-Eagle]] |agency= [[United Press International]] |date= February 11, 1946 |page= 2}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1946, Lawson resigned from the company after a disagreement with Preston Tucker, and shortly thereafter, stylist [[Alex Tremulis]] of local Chicago design firm Tammen & Denison was hired and furthered the development of the Lawson design. Tucker gave Tammen & Denison and Tremulis a three-month contract, which expired in March 1947 and was not renewed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tremulis SEC Trial Testimony, National Archives, Chicago</ref> The culmination of Tremulis' efforts during this phase of design development was featured in a full-page advertisement run in numerous national newspapers in March 1947. Tremulis' design was based directly upon the work of George Lawson, but incorporated his own artistic flair.\n\nSimultaneous with Tremulis' departure, Preston Tucker hired a team of five designers ([[Read Viemeister]], Budd Steinhilber, Tucker Madawick, Hal Bergstrom and Phillip Egan) from the New York design firm [[Lippincott (brand consultancy)|J.

The car's parking brake had a separate key so it could be locked in place to prevent theft. The doors extended into the roof, to ease entry and exit.<ref name=flory/> Each Tucker that was built differed somewhat from the previous car, as each car built was basically a \"prototype\" where design features and engineering concepts were tried, improved, or discarded throughout the production cycle. The door releases on the interior of the Tucker came from the Lincoln Zephyr. The steering columns used in the Tucker were donated by Ford and are from the 1941 Lincoln. Preston Tucker held a patent for a collapsible steering column design. A glove box was added to the front door panels instead of the more conventional location in the dashboard to provide space for the \"crash chamber\" that the Tucker is now famous for. This is a padded area ahead of the passenger seat, free from obstructions, providing the front seat passengers an area to protect themselves in the event of an accident.<ref name=\"lemaymarymount.org\"/> The engine and transmission were mounted on a separate [[subframe]] which was secured with only six bolts. The entire drive train could thus be lowered and removed from the car in minutes. Tucker envisioned loaner engines being quickly swapped in for service in just 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Duchene|first=Paul|title=11 things you didn't know about the Tucker '48|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-01/classified/sc-cons-0127-autocover-side-20110127-48_1_alex-tremulis-tucker-corp-engine|accessdate=February 10, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nTucker envisioned several other innovations that were later abandoned.

Over 3,000 people showed up at the factory in Chicago for lunch, a train tour of the plant, and the unveiling of the first prototype. The unveiling appeared doomed, however, as last-minute problems cropped up. The night before the premiere, two of the prototype's independent suspension arms snapped under the car's weight. (The prototype was extremely heavy; much heavier than the other '48s.) Minor engine problems were fixed, and the car was presentable by the time of the premiere. However, the experimental 589 engine was extremely loud. Tucker told the band to play as loud as possible to drown out the noise. Additionally the high-voltage starter required the use of outside power to get the engine started, so Tucker had the engineering team keep the engine running during the entire event, fearing that the public would see how much effort was required to get the engine started.<ref name=Wipff/> As the car was driven on to the platform, the liquid coolant boiled over and some steam escaped from the car, but no one seemed to notice.<ref name=\"Egan 1989\"/>\n\n[[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], one of the top [[Columnist|newspaper columnists]] of his time, reported publicly that the car was a fraud because it could not go backward and it went \"goose-geese\" going down the road.<ref name=duchene>{{cite news |last= Duchene |first= Paul |title= Preston Tucker: The Man behind the Car |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-01/classified/sc-cons-0127-autocover-side-20110127_1_alex-tremulis-preston-tucker-tucker-automobile |accessdate= February 10, 2012 |newspaper= Chicago Tribune |date=February 1, 2011}}</ref> Despite the fact that this problem was limited to the first prototype only, a symptom of the speed with which the first car was put together, the damage to the car's reputation was done, and a storm of negative media followed.<ref name=duchene/>\n\nTucker suffered another setback when his bids to obtain two steel mills to provide raw materials for his cars were rejected by the [[War Assets Administration]] under a shroud of questionable politics.<ref>{{cite news |last= Mitten |first= Ray |title= Tucker Fights Republic for Steel Plant |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19480125&id=8lsbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H00EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1711,2960560 |accessdate= February 10, 2012 |newspaper= The Pittsburgh Press |date= January 24, 1948|page=18}}</ref>\n\n==Continued development==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\n\n=== Engine ===\n[[File:Tucker589.JPG|thumb|Tucker 589cu.in. prototype direct drive engine. (Note torque converters at each end and the early rubber disk-type suspension used on prototype)]]\n[[File:Tucker335andY1.JPG|thumb|Franklin O-335 engine and Tucker Y-1 transmission.]]\n\nTucker had promised {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}}, but his innovative engine was not working out. The [[valve train]] proved problematic and the engine only produced approximately {{convert|88|hp|abbr=on}}. The high oil pressure required a 24-volt electrical system, up to 60 volts to get it started, and a long cranking time at start-up. Additionally, the oil pressure required to maintain valve function was not achieved until the engine was turning at higher RPM and Tucker's engineers struggled with keeping the valve train working at idle and lower speeds/RPM.<ref name=Wipff/> Having wasted nearly a year trying to make the 589 work, Tucker started looking for alternatives.\n\nThe company first tried the [[Lycoming engine|Lycoming]] aircraft engine, but it would not fit in the car's rear engine compartment.\n\nAn [[Air cooling|air-cooled]] flat-6 engine, the [[Franklin O-335|O-335]] made by [[Franklin Engine Company|Air Cooled Motors]] (and originally intended for the [[Bell 47]]),<ref name=burgess>{{cite book |last= Burgess-Wise |first= David |title= The World of Automobiles: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Motor Car |year= 1977 |publisher= Purnell Reference |location= Milwaukee |isbn= 978-0-8393-6009-4 |editor-last= Ward |editor-first= Ian |edition= Reference |page= 2386}}</ref> fit, and its {{convert|166|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}} pleased Tucker. He purchased four samples for $5,000 each, and his engineers converted the {{Convert|334|cid|cc}} engine to [[water-cooled|water cooling]] (a decision that has puzzled historians ever since).<ref name=burgess/> The Franklin engine was heavily modified by Tucker's engineers, including Eddie Offutt and Tucker's son Preston, Jr. at his Ypsilanti machine shop. Using an aircraft engine in an automotive application required significant modification; thus, very few parts of the original Franklin engine were retained in the final Tucker engine. This durable modification of the engine was tested at maximum power for 150 hours, the equivalent of {{convert|18000|mi|km}}, at full throttle.<ref>{{cite book |author = Auto editors of Consumer Guide |title= Cars of the Fascinating '40s: A Decade of Challenges and Changes |publisher= Publications International |year= 2002 |location= Lincolnwood, IL |pages= 264\u2013265 |isbn= 0-7853-6274-6}}</ref>\n\nTucker quickly bought Air Cooled Motors for $1.8 million to secure the engine source, then canceled all of the company's aircraft contracts so its resources could be focused on making automotive engines. This was a significant decision, since at the time of Tucker's purchase, Franklin held over 65% of post-war U.S. aviation engine production contracts. The loss of income was substantial.\n\n=== Transmission ===\n\nWith the horizontal, between-the-wheels 589 motor and its double torque converter(s) (and no reverse) drive system out, Tucker now needed a transmission to mate with the Franklin O-335. This motor was also horizontal, but its driveshaft pointed towards the front of the car. It was discovered, after a few sketches were made, that it was theoretically possible to adapt a previous transmission design intended for [[FF layout|front-engine/front wheel drive]] use. This transmission served as a temporary \"fix\" for a very real problem for the success of the Tucker.\n\n'''Pre-Selector manual transmission'''\n\nCord-Auburn Gear-Bendix Unit- It was discovered that the [[Cord Automobile|Cord]] [[Cord 810/812|810/812]]'s Auburn Gear, front-wheel-drive; 4-speed transmission, with the Bendix \"Electric Hand\" electro-vacuum shifting mechanism, fit the immediate design requirements needed to get the cars built, and on the road; until a future automatic (Tucker-built transmission) was worked out. This transmission was designed originally behind a standard V-8 engine, and pointed forward towards the front of the car, for the front wheels. However, this transmission came with a poor reputation, following its original use, in the [[Cord 810]] automobile. (In 1936, when the Cord 810 made its debut at the New York Automobile show, the transmissions were so problematic that 810 models were mostly shown without any transmission installed. Problems abounded until the last Cord was produced in 1937.) The Cord transmissions, even with refurbishing, were initially inadequate for the power and torque of the O-335 engine. The Cords lacked adequate lubrication and the main shaft was so long that it warped under load (causing gears to pop out of play), and the gear-teeth were quite weak. Nevertheless, in the Tucker, this transmission worked well enough for the new engine configuration; it provided an adequate (albeit fragile) transmission, with a reverse gear. The company then sent several of its staff, including Preston Tucker Jr., on a campaign to buy used Cord transmissions, for reconditioning; a total of 22 used transmissions were acquired from junkyards and used car dealers. These transmissions were taken to the Ypsilanti Machine And Tool Company. After refurbishment, several were mated to the O-335 and found to work, providing four speeds forward and reverse. It was decided, consequently,  that the Cord design, nearly 12 years old, would become the \"manual transmission\" for the 1948 and subsequent Tucker automobiles. About eight to 10 of the 22 Cords were found to be usable and \u2013 since newly-made Cord Y-1 transmissions were not yet available \u2013 were installed in production Tucker vehicles. Several of these cars, with Cord transmissions, have survived.\n\n'''Ypsilanti Y-1 transmission''' Ypsilanti Machine and Tool Company, which was tapped to recondition the Cord units, began immediately redesigning the transmission for mass production for Tucker. This new design, which had few similar parts to the Cord transmission, still used the same basic indirect transmission design, but had all new gearing, shafts and electro-vacuum controls. Tucker and his engineers modified it, installing stronger gears and lengthening the case. The modified Cord transmission was named the Tucker Y-1 (Ypsilanti-1) and was installed in a few Tuckers. Both also used a Bendix designed electric vacuum shift mechanism with no mechanical linkage to the steering column shift lever. These EVS's had problems of their own with electrical connections and vacuum leaks that hindered shifting, so a new fully mechanical shift design would have been needed, had the Tucker made it into 1949, and beyond.\n\n'''Tucker-Matic drive'''[[File:Tucker335andTuckermaticR12.JPG|thumb|Tucker 335 engine and Tuckermatic R-1-2 transmission (trans recovered from car #1042; note second torque converter on the end).]]\nTo solve the transmission problems with a new final transmission design, Warren Rice, creator of the [[Buick]] [[Dynaflow]] transmission, was consulted. A unique [[continuously variable transmission]] called the \"Tucker-Matic\" was designed, which was strong enough to handle the Franklin O-335's power and torque. It was a simple but effective design, with double torque converters and only 27 basic moving parts which was about 90 fewer than normally required for a contemporary automatic. The double torque converters allowed a continuously variable drive ratio with only one forward gear and one reverse gear which used the torque converters to vary the transmission ratio based on load and engine speed.\n\nThe only surviving car with a Tucker-Matic installed had a standard column shift lever, with a three position quadrant on the steering column. Up was reverse, the middle was neutral, and down was drive. Due to the Tucker-Matic's design, no lower gear selections were necessary, hence there was no need for a multi gated selector like other automatics.\n\nThree versions of the Tucker-Matic were made, the R-1, R-1-2, and R-3, (R for Warren Rice, its designer). The first version, the R-1, was not installed on any of the final cars. It required the engine to be off in order to select a gear. The R-1-2 was improved by adding a [[layshaft]] brake to allow gear selection while the engine was running. This version was installed on cars #1026 and 1042 only. The R-3 version had further improvements including a [[centrifugal clutch]] to help shifting between forward and reverse even further, but it was never installed in any of the final cars.\n\nBecause the two torque converters on the Tuckermatic made the engine-transmission unit longer, the fuel tank in the Tucker '48 had to be moved from behind the rear seat to in front of the dashboard for all Tuckers from car #1026 forward, even though only two of them actually had the Tuckermatic installed. This had the added advantage of improving weight distribution in the car.\n\n'''Other drives contemplated for the Tucker 48''' A Borg-Warner based, 3-speed automatic was supposedly tested and was installed on car #1048 at some point when the company was in business. Although no histories written ever mentioned such a drive. That said, Tucker ultimately wanted to design his own transmission for the final car, which came to fruition with the Tucker-Matic discussed below. In 1949, #1048 was sold at the receivership auction WITHOUT a transmission installed. Today, #1048 has the 4 speed pre-selector transmission that was used on all but 2 of the Original 50 pilot models. It is likely this transmission was privately installed after the auction transpired. Further likely is that the unit was the Ypsilanti Built Y-1 transmission.\n\n===Suspension and body===\n[[File:RearTorsionTubeandFrontSandwich.JPG|thumb|Tucker rear suspension rubber torsion tube (left) and Sandwich type front suspension (right) used on cars #1001\u20131025.]]\n[[File:RubberTorsionTube2Front.JPG|thumb|Tucker Rubber Torsion Tube (version2) Front Suspension used on car #1026-on. This unit taken from car #1046 for V8 conversion.]]\nSuspension designs, especially the front suspension, had to be changed throughout development. Rather than steel springs, Tucker used an elastomeric (rubber) 4-wheel independent<ref name=flory /> suspension similar to what was used on the race cars he developed with [[Harry Miller (auto racing)|Harry Miller]] at the [[Indianapolis 500]]. The rubber elastomers were developed with assistance from the [[Firestone Tire Company]] and used a special [[Vulcanization]] process to produce a specific spring rate.\n\nTucker's suspension designs were plagued with severe stiffness throughout development, which, while good for handling, caused front-wheel corner lift when cornering on uneven surfaces. The test bed and the prototype had a double-rubber disc type front and rear suspension, similar to Miller's race cars, which was too weak for the weight of a passenger car. On cars #1001 and 1002 the rear wheels could not be removed without removing the fender or suspension due to the stiffness of the suspension and the rear wheel arch fender design. From car #1003 on, the rear fender shape was changed so the tire could be removed easily. Aside from the fender changes, the rear suspension remained the same from car #1001 on.\n\nThree versions of the front suspension were installed in the cars (aside from the rubber-disc style used on the prototype). Cars #1001\u20131002 used a rubber torsion tube design, which suffered from severe toe-in during heavy braking. Tucker then switched to a rubber sandwich type suspension (with a rubber block sandwiched between the upper and lower A-arms) on cars #1003\u20131025, however, this type was severely stiff. Starting on car #1026, Tucker finally settled on a suspension design with a modified version of the rubber torsion tube with the toe-in braking problem corrected.\n\nOriginal Tucker paint color codes:<ref name=fordmuseum />\n* 100: Black\n* 200: Waltz Blue\n* 300: Green\n* 400: Beige\n* 500: Grey (Silver)\n* 600: Maroon\n\nOriginal Tucker interior trim color codes:<ref name=\"lemaymarymount.org\"/>\n* 900: Green\n* 920: Blue\n* 940: Beige\n\n===Funding and publicity===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TuckeratIndy.png|left|thumb|200px|Tucker tests the car at Indy500 Speedway.]] -->\nHaving raised $17,000,000 in a stock issue, one of the first speculative [[initial public offering|IPO]]s, Tucker needed more money to continue development of the car. He sold dealerships and distributorships throughout the country. Another money maker was the Tucker Accessories Program. In order to secure a spot on the Tucker waiting list, future buyers could purchase accessories, like seat covers, radio, and luggage, before their car was built. This brought in an additional $2,000,000.\n\nWith the final design in place, Preston Tucker took the pre-production cars on the road to show them in towns across the country. The cars were an instant success, with crowds gathering wherever they stopped. One report says Tucker was pulled over by a police officer intent on getting a better look at the car.{{cn|date=August 2015}}\n\nTo prove the road-worthiness of his cars, Tucker and his engineers ran several cars at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in several endurance tests. During this testing, car #1027 was rolled three times at 95 miles per hour (153&nbsp;km/h), and the driver (chief mechanic Eddie Offutt) walked away with just bruises. During the crash, the windshield popped out as designed, verifying Tucker's safety features were effective. Afterwards, upon replacing a damaged tire, the car started up and was driven off the track.\n\n== SEC investigation and demise ==\n\n{{Main|Preston Tucker}}\n\n[[File:1948 Tucker Torpedo rear.jpg|right|thumb|1948 Tucker at [[Petersen Automotive Museum]], Los Angeles, California, United States]]\nOne of Tucker's most innovative business ideas caused trouble for the company. His Accessories Program raised funds by selling accessories before the car was even in production. After the war, demand for new cars was greater than dealers could supply, and most dealers had waiting lists for new cars. Preference was given to returning veterans, which meant that non-veterans were bumped down on the waiting lists indefinitely. Tucker's program allowed potential buyers that purchased Tucker accessories to obtain a guaranteed spot on the Tucker dealer waiting list for a Tucker '48 car.\n\nThis concept was investigated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and the [[United States Attorney]], and led to an [[indictment]] of company executives. Although all charges were eventually dropped, the negative publicity destroyed the company and halted production of the car.\n\n== Tucker '48 cars ==\nThe first Tucker produced was a prototype sedan, known as the \"Tin Goose\". Fifty-eight frames and bodies were built at the factory. From these parts, 36 sedans were finished before the factory was closed. After the factory closed, but before liquidation of his assets, Tucker retained a core of employees who assembled an additional 14 sedans, for a total of 50. A 51st car was partially completed. A few of the remaining frames and bodies were built into complete cars specifically #1052 and #1057 (the 1949 prototype with design changes), but the fate of others is unknown.\n\nIn the early 1950s, [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Ft.
