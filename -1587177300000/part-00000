University of California Press</ref> In [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Guthrie's geographic classification]], Swahili is in Bantu zone G, whereas the other Sabaki languages are in zone E70, commonly under the name ''Nyika.'' Local folk-theories of the language have often considered Swahili to be a [[mixed language]] because of its many loanwords from Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]], and the fact that the Swahili language emerged as a result of trade between the east African coastal Bantu-speaking tribes and traders from Arabia, Persia, Asia (south and southeast) as well as Europe (Portugal). However, historical linguists do not consider the Arabic influence on Swahili to be significant enough to classify it as a mixed language, since Arabic influence is limited to lexical items, most of which have only been borrowed after 1500, while the grammatical and syntactic structure of the language is typically Bantu.<ref>Derek Nurse, Thomas T.

The Swahili language is a mix of several East African Bantu languages and Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Malay language|Malay]] of traders interacted with Bantu speaking communities at the [[Swahili coast]]. The Swahili language is a daughter language of the [[Pokomo language]] which is also known as Kingozi. Technically the [[Pokomo]] language is the pure Swahili without foreign loanwords. Most of the Bantu Swahili vocabulary is derived primarily from the Pokomo, Taita and Mijikenda languages and secondarily from other East African Bantu languages. Approximately 30% of the Swahili vocabulary is derived from Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Malay language|Malay]] with Arabic contributing a majority of the foreign loan words in the Swahili language. It was originally written  in [[Arabic script]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glcom.com/hassan/swahili_history.html |title=Swahili history |last=Juma |first=Abdurahman |publisher=glcom.com |url-status= |access-date=30 September 2017}}</ref> The Swahili language is by fact a [[creole language]] and/or hybrid language because it is mix of several East African Bantu languages with Arabic, Persian, Hindustani, Portuguese and Malay and emerged as a result of interaction. \n\nThe earliest known documents written in Swahili are letters written in [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] in 1711 in the Arabic script that were sent to the Portuguese of Mozambique and their local allies.

With  the arrival of the Arabs in East Africa, they used Swahili as a language of trade as well as teaching Islam to the local [[Bantu peoples]]. This resulted in Swahili first being written in the Arabic alphabet. The later contact with the Portuguese resulted in the increase of vocabulary of the Swahili language. The language was formalised in an institutional level when the Germans took over after the [[Berlin conference]]. After seeing that there is already a widespread language the Germans decided to formalise it and made it the official language to be used in schools, thus schools in Swahili are called Shule(German = Schule), in government, trade and the court system. With the Germans controlling the major Swahili speaking region in East Africa, they changed the alphabet system from Arabic to Latin. After the first World war, Britain took over East Africa and found that Swahili was rooted in most areas East Africa and wasn't only spoken at the coastal regions, they decided to formalise it as language to be used across the East African region(although in British East Africa of Kenya and Uganda most areas used English and their native language while Swahili was mostly restricted to the coast). In June 1928, an inter territorial conference attended by representatives of [[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zanzibar]] took place in [[Mombasa]]. The Zanzibar dialect was chosen as standard Swahili for those areas,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/Swahili |title=Swahili |publisher=About World Languages}}</ref> and the standard orthography for Swahili was adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lexikos.journals.ac.za/pub/article/viewFile/918/437 |title=Dictionaries and the Standardization of Spelling in Swahili |publisher=Lexikos | last=Mdee |first=James S. |volume=9 |year=1999 |pages=126\u201327 |access-date=2 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Current status===\nSwahili has become a second language spoken by tens of millions in three [[African Great Lakes]] countries ([[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]]) where it is an official or national language while being the first language to many people in Tanzania especially along the coastal regions of Tanga, Pwani, Dar es salaam, Mtwara and Lindi. In the inner regions of Tanzania, Swahili is spoken with an accent influenced by local languages and dialects, and as a first language for most people born in the cities, whilst being spoken as a second language in rural areas. The widespread use of Swahili as a nation language in Tanzania came after Tanganyika got her independence in 1961 and the government decided that it would be used as a language to unify the new nation. That saw the use of Swahili in all  levels of government, trade, art as well as schools in which primary school children  are taught in Swahili, before switching to English in Secondary schools (although Swahili is still taught as an independent subject). In 1985, with the 8\u20134\u20134 system of education, Swahili was made a compulsory subject in all Kenyan schools.<ref name=\"laban\">{{cite news | last1=Wanambisi | first1=Laban | title=International schools must teach Kiswahili, Kenya's history \u2013 Matiang'i | url=https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2016/12/international-schools-must-teach-kiswahili-kenyas-history-matiangi/ | accessdate=8 December 2016 | agency=Capital News | date=5 December 2016}}</ref> Swahili and closely related languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people in [[Burundi]], [[Comoros]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Rwanda]].<ref>Nurse & Thomas Spear (1985) ''The Swahili''</ref> The language was still understood in the southern ports of the [[Red Sea]] in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Kharusi\">{{cite journal | last=Kharusi | first=N.

Key activities mandated for the organization include creating a healthy atmosphere for the development of Swahili, encouraging use of the language in government and business functions, coordinating activities of other organizations involved with Swahili, standardizing the language. Although other bodies and agencies can propose new vocabularies, BAKITA is the only organisation in the world that can approve its usage in the Swahili language.\nIn Kenya, ''Chama cha Kiswahili cha Taifa'' (CHAKITA) was established in 1998 to research and propose means to which Kiswahili can be integrated to a national language.\n\nSwahili is among the first languages in Africa for which [[language technology]] applications have been developed.

With the arrival of Arabs in East Africa they brought Islam and to which they set up Madrasas and used Swahili to teach Islam to the natives. As the Arab presence grew, more and more native were converted to Islam and were taught using the Swahili language.\n\n==== Christianity ====\nThe arrival of Europeans in East Africa, Christianity was introduced in East Africa. While the Arabs were mostly centered at the coastal areas, European missionaries went further inland spreading Christianity. With the first missionary posts in East Africa being located in the coastal areas, the missionaries picked up Swahili and used it to spread Christianity since it had a lot  of similarities with a lot of indigenous languages.\n\n=== Politics ===\nDuring the struggle for Tanganyika independence, [[Tanganyika African National Union|Tanganyika African  National Union]] used Swahili as language of mass organisation and political movement. This included publishing pamphlets and radio broadcasts to rally the people to fight for independence. After independence, Swahili was adopted as the national language of the nation. Till this day, Tanzanians carry a sense of pride when it comes to Swahili especially when it is used to unite over 120 tribes across Tanzania. Swahili was used to strengthen solidarity among the people and a sense of togetherness and for that Swahili remains a key identity of the Tanzanian people.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Selfref|For assistance with IPA transcriptions of Swahili for Wikipedia articles, see [[Help:IPA/Swahili]].}}\n\nUnlike the majority of Niger-Congo languages,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Niger-Congo-languages|title=Niger-Congo languages|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> Swahili lacks [[Tone (linguistics)|contrastive tone]] (pitch contour).

There are a few [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for native sounds, ''ch'' , ''sh'' , ''ng''' and ''ny''; ''q'' and ''x'' are not used,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/other/swahili/guide/alphabet.shtml |title=A Guide to Swahili \u2013 The Swahili alphabet |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref> ''c'' is not used apart from unassimilated English loans and, occasionally, as a substitute for ''k'' in advertisements. There are also several digraphs for Arabic sounds which many speakers outside of ethnic Swahili areas have trouble differentiating.\n\nThe language used to be written in the Arabic script. Unlike adaptations of the Arabic script for other languages, relatively little accommodation was made for Swahili. There were also differences in orthographic conventions between cities and authors and over the centuries, some quite precise but others different enough to cause difficulties with intelligibility.\n\n{{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} were often conflated, but in some spellings, {{IPA|/e/}} was distinguished from {{IPA|/i/}} by rotating the ''[[kasrah|kasra]]'' 90\u00b0 and  {{IPA|/o/}} was distinguished from  {{IPA|/u/}} by writing the ''[[damma]]'' backwards.\n\nSeveral Swahili consonants do not have equivalents in Arabic, and for them, often no special letters were created unlike, for example, [[Urdu script|Urdu]] script. Instead, the closest Arabic sound is substituted. Not only did that mean that one letter often stands for more than one sound, but also writers made different choices of which consonant to substitute.

See [[Talk:Swahili language#The noun classes section needs an introduction]].|small=no|date=July 2019}}\nSwahili nouns are separable into classes, which are roughly analogous to [[gender]]s in other languages.  For example, just as suffix <-o> in Spanish marks masculine objects, and <-a> marks feminine ones, so, in Swahili, prefixes mark groups of similar objects: <m-> marks single human beings (''mtoto'' 'child'), <wa-> marks multiple humans (''watoto'' 'children'), <u-> marks abstract nouns (''utoto'' 'childhood'), and so on.  Similar prefixes must be used on verbs and particles in agreement with the governing noun in a phrase.  This is a characteristic feature of all the Bantu languages of sub-Saharan Africa, and traces of it are also found in the [[Niger-Congo]] languages of West Africa.\n\n====Semantic motivation====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nThe ''ki-/vi-'' class historically consisted of two separate genders, artefacts (Bantu class 7/8, utensils and hand tools mostly) and diminutives (Bantu class 12/13), which were conflated at a stage ancestral to Swahili. Examples of the former are ''kisu'' \"knife\", ''kiti'' \"chair\" (from ''mti'' \"tree, wood\"), ''chombo'' \"vessel\" (a contraction of ''ki-ombo''). Examples of the latter are ''kitoto'' \"infant\", from ''mtoto'' \"child\"; ''kitawi'' \"frond\", from ''tawi'' \"branch\"; and ''chumba'' (''ki-umba'') \"room\", from ''nyumba'' \"house\". It is the diminutive sense that has been furthest extended. An extension common to diminutives in many languages is ''approximation'' and ''resemblance'' (having a 'little bit' of some characteristic, like ''-y'' or ''-ish'' in English). For example, there is ''kijani'' \"green\", from ''jani'' \"leaf\" (compare English 'leafy'), ''kichaka'' \"bush\" from ''chaka'' \"clump\", and ''kivuli'' \"shadow\" from ''uvuli'' \"shade\". A 'little bit' of a verb would be an instance of an action, and such ''instantiations'' (usually not very active ones) are found: ''kifo'' \"death\", from the verb ''-fa'' \"to die\"; ''kiota'' \"nest\" from ''-ota'' \"to brood\"; ''chakula'' \"food\" from ''kula'' \"to eat\"; ''kivuko'' \"a ford, a pass\" from ''-vuka'' \"to cross\"; and ''kilimia'' \"the [[Pleiades]]\", from ''-limia'' \"to farm with\", from its role in guiding planting. A resemblance, or being a bit like something, implies marginal status in a category, so things that are marginal examples of their class may take the ''ki-/vi-'' prefixes. One example is ''chura'' (''ki-ura'') \"frog\", which is only half terrestrial and therefore is marginal as an animal. This extension may account for disabilities as well: ''kilema'' \"a cripple\", ''kipofu'' \"a blind person\", ''kiziwi'' \"a deaf person\". Finally, diminutives often denote contempt, and contempt is sometimes expressed against things that are dangerous. This might be the historical explanation for ''kifaru'' \"rhinoceros\", ''kingugwa'' \"spotted hyena\", and ''kiboko'' \"hippopotamus\" (perhaps originally meaning \"stubby legs\").\n\nAnother class with broad semantic extension is the ''m-/mi-'' class (Bantu classes 3/4). This is often called the 'tree' class, because ''mti, miti'' \"tree(s)\" is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities neither human nor typical animals: trees and other plants, such as ''mwitu'' 'forest' and ''mtama'' 'millet' (and from there, things made from plants, like ''mkeka'' 'mat'); supernatural and natural forces, such as ''mwezi'' 'moon', ''mlima'' 'mountain', ''mto'' 'river'; active things, such as ''moto'' 'fire', including active body parts (''moyo'' 'heart', ''mkono'' 'hand, arm'); and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as ''mji'' 'village', and, by analogy, ''mzinga'' 'beehive/cannon'. From the central idea of ''tree'', which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as ''mwavuli'' 'umbrella', ''moshi'' 'smoke', ''msumari'' 'nail'; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as ''mfuo'' \"metal forging\", from ''-fua'' \"to forge\", or ''mlio'' \"a sound\", from ''-lia'' \"to make a sound\". Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, ''mkono'' is an active body part, and ''mto'' is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as ''mpaka'' 'border' and ''mwendo'' 'journey', are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as ''mwaka'' 'year' and perhaps ''mshahara'' 'wages'. Animals exceptional in some way and so not easily fitting in the other classes may be placed in this class.\n\nThe other classes have foundations that may at first seem similarly counterintuitive.<ref>See Contini-Morava for details.</ref> In short,\n*Classes 1\u20132 include most words for people: kin terms, professions, ethnicities, etc., including translations of most English words ending in ''-er.'' They include a couple of generic words for animals: ''mnyama'' 'beast', ''mdudu'' 'bug'.\n*Classes 5\u20136 have a broad semantic range of groups, expanses, and augmentatives. Although interrelated, it is easier to illustrate if broken down:\n**Augmentatives, such as ''joka'' 'serpent' from ''nyoka'' 'snake', lead to titles and other terms of respect (the opposite of diminutives, which lead to terms of contempt): ''Bwana'' 'Sir', ''shangazi'' 'aunt', ''fundi'' 'craftsman', ''kadhi'' 'judge'\n**Expanses: ''ziwa'' 'lake', ''bonde'' 'valley', ''taifa'' 'country', ''anga'' 'sky'\n***from this, mass nouns: ''maji'' 'water', ''vumbi'' 'dust' (and other liquids and fine particulates which may cover broad expanses), ''kaa'' 'charcoal', ''mali'' 'wealth', ''maridhawa'' 'abundance'\n**Collectives: ''kundi'' 'group', ''kabila'' 'language/ethnic group', ''jeshi'' 'army', ''daraja'' ' stairs', ''manyoya'' 'fur, feathers', ''mapesa'' 'small change', ''manyasi'' 'weeds', ''jongoo'' 'millipede' (large set of legs), ''marimba'' 'xylophone' (large set of keys)\n***from this, individual things found in groups: ''jiwe'' 'stone', ''tawi'' 'branch', ''ua'' 'flower', ''tunda'' 'fruit' (also the names of most fruits), ''yai'' 'egg', ''mapacha'' 'twins', ''jino'' 'tooth', ''tumbo'' 'stomach' (cf. English \"guts\"), and paired body parts such as ''jicho'' 'eye', ''bawa'' 'wing', etc.\n***also collective or dialogic actions, which occur among groups of people: ''neno'' 'a word', from ''kunena'' 'to speak' (and by extension, mental verbal processes: ''wazo'' 'thought', ''maana'' 'meaning'); ''pigo'' 'a stroke, blow', from ''kupiga'' 'to hit'; ''gomvi'' 'a quarrel', ''shauri'' 'advice, plan', ''kosa'' 'mistake', ''jambo'' 'affair', ''penzi'' 'love', ''jibu'' 'answer', ''agano'' 'promise', ''malipo'' 'payment'\n***From pairing, reproduction is suggested as another extension (fruit, egg, testicle, flower, twins, etc.), but these generally duplicate one or more of the subcategories above\n*Classes 9\u201310 are used for most typical animals: ''ndege'' 'bird', ''samaki'' 'fish', and the specific names of typical beasts, birds, and bugs. However, this is the 'other' class, for words not fitting well elsewhere, and about half of the class 9\u201310 nouns are foreign loanwords. Loans may be classified as 9\u201310 because they lack the prefixes inherent in other classes, and most native class 9\u201310 nouns have no prefix. Thus they do not form a coherent semantic class, though there are still semantic extensions from individual words.\n*Class 11 (which takes class 10 for the plural) are mostly nouns with an \"extended outline shape\", in either one dimension or two:\n**mass nouns that are generally localized rather than covering vast expanses: ''uji'' 'porridge', ''wali'' 'cooked rice'\n**broad: ''ukuta'' 'wall', ''ukucha'' 'fingernail', ''upande'' 'side' (\u2248 ''ubavu'' 'rib'), ''wavu'' 'net', ''wayo'' 'sole, footprint', ''ua'' 'fence, yard', ''uteo'' 'winnowing basket'\n**long: ''utambi'' 'wick', ''utepe'' 'stripe', ''uta'' 'bow', ''ubavu'' 'rib', ''ufa'' 'crack', ''unywele'' 'a hair'\n***from 'a hair', [[singulative]]s of nouns, which are often class 6 ('collectives') in the plural: ''unyoya'' 'a feather', ''uvumbi'' 'a grain of dust', ''ushanga'' 'a bead'.\n*Class 14 are abstractions, such as ''utoto'' 'childhood' (from ''mtoto'' 'a child') and have no plural. They have the same prefixes and concord as class 11, except optionally for adjectival concord.\n*Class 15 are verbal infinitives.\n*Classes 16\u201318 are locatives. The Bantu nouns of these classes have been lost; the only permanent member is the Arabic loan ''mahali'' 'place(s)', but  in Mombasa Swahili, the old prefixes survive: ''pahali'' 'place', ''mwahali'' 'places'. However, any noun with the locative suffix ''-ni'' takes class 16\u201318 agreement. The distinction between them is that class 16 agreement is used if the location is intended to be definite (\"at\"), class 17 if indefinite (\"around\") or involves motion (\"to, toward\"), and class 18 if it involves containment (\"within\"): ''mahali pazuri'' 'a good spot', ''mahali kuzuri'' 'a nice area', ''mahali muzuri'' (it's nice in there).\n\n===Agreement===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nSwahili phrases agree with nouns in a system of [[Agreement (linguistics)|concord]], but if the noun refers to a human, they accord with noun classes 1\u20132 regardless of their noun class. Verbs agree with the noun class of their subjects and objects; adjectives, prepositions and demonstratives agree with the noun class of their nouns. In Standard Swahili ''(Kiswahili sanifu)'', based on the dialect spoken in Zanzibar, the system is rather complex; however, it is drastically simplified in many local variants where Swahili is not a native language, such as in Nairobi. In non-native Swahili, concord reflects only animacy: human subjects and objects trigger ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-'' in verbal concord, while non-human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger ''i-, zi-''. Infinitives vary between standard ''ku-'' and reduced ''i-.''<ref>Kamil Ud Deen, 2005. ''The acquisition of Swahili''.</ref> (\"Of\" is animate ''wa'' and inanimate ''ya, za.'')\n\nIn Standard Swahili, human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger animacy concord in ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-,'' and non-human subjects and objects trigger a variety of gender-concord prefixes.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Swahili noun-class concord\n|-\n!NC!!Semantic<br/>field!!Noun<br/>-C, -V!!Subj.!!Obj!!''-a''!!Adjective<br/>-C, -i, -e<ref group=\"*\">Most Swahili adjectives begin with either a consonant or the vowels ''i-'' or ''e-'', listed separately above.

University of California Press</ref> In [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Guthrie's geographic classification]], Swahili is in Bantu zone G, whereas the other Sabaki languages are in zone E70, commonly under the name ''Nyika.'' Local folk-theories of the language have often considered Swahili to be a [[mixed language]] because of its many loanwords from Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]], and the fact that the Swahili language emerged as a result of trade between the east African coastal Bantu-speaking tribes and traders from Arabia, Persia, Asia (south and southeast) as well as Europe (Portugal). However, historical linguists do not consider the Arabic influence on Swahili to be significant enough to classify it as a mixed language, since Arabic influence is limited to lexical items, most of which have only been borrowed after 1500, while the grammatical and syntactic structure of the language is typically Bantu.<ref>Derek Nurse, Thomas T.

Most of the Bantu Swahili vocabulary is derived primarily from the Pokomo, Taita and Mijikenda languages and secondarily from other East African Bantu languages. Approximately 30% of the Swahili vocabulary is derived from Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Malay language|Malay]] with Arabic contributing a majority of the foreign loan words in the Swahili language.

With  the arrival of the Arabs in East Africa, they used Swahili as a language of trade as well as teaching Islam to the local [[Bantu peoples]]. This resulted in Swahili first being written in the Arabic alphabet. The later contact with the Portuguese resulted in the increase of vocabulary of the Swahili language. The language was formalised in an institutional level when the Germans took over after the [[Berlin conference]]. After seeing that there is already a widespread language the Germans decided to formalise it and made it the official language to be used in schools, thus schools in Swahili are called Shule(German = Schule), in government, trade and the court system. With the Germans controlling the major Swahili speaking region in East Africa, they changed the alphabet system from Arabic to Latin. After the first World war, Britain took over East Africa and found that Swahili was rooted in most areas East Africa and wasn't only spoken at the coastal regions, they decided to formalise it as language to be used across the East African region(although in British East Africa of Kenya and Uganda most areas used English and their native language while Swahili was mostly restricted to the coast). In June 1928, an inter territorial conference attended by representatives of [[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zanzibar]] took place in [[Mombasa]]. The Zanzibar dialect was chosen as standard Swahili for those areas,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/Swahili |title=Swahili |publisher=About World Languages}}</ref> and the standard orthography for Swahili was adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lexikos.journals.ac.za/pub/article/viewFile/918/437 |title=Dictionaries and the Standardization of Spelling in Swahili |publisher=Lexikos | last=Mdee |first=James S. |volume=9 |year=1999 |pages=126\u201327 |access-date=2 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Current status===\nSwahili has become a second language spoken by tens of millions in three [[African Great Lakes]] countries ([[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]]) where it is an official or national language while being the first language to many people in Tanzania especially along the coastal regions of Tanga, Pwani, Dar es salaam, Mtwara and Lindi. In the inner regions of Tanzania, Swahili is spoken with an accent influenced by local languages and dialects, and as a first language for most people born in the cities, whilst being spoken as a second language in rural areas. The widespread use of Swahili as a nation language in Tanzania came after Tanganyika got her independence in 1961 and the government decided that it would be used as a language to unify the new nation. That saw the use of Swahili in all  levels of government, trade, art as well as schools in which primary school children  are taught in Swahili, before switching to English in Secondary schools (although Swahili is still taught as an independent subject). In 1985, with the 8\u20134\u20134 system of education, Swahili was made a compulsory subject in all Kenyan schools.<ref name=\"laban\">{{cite news | last1=Wanambisi | first1=Laban | title=International schools must teach Kiswahili, Kenya's history \u2013 Matiang'i | url=https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2016/12/international-schools-must-teach-kiswahili-kenyas-history-matiangi/ | accessdate=8 December 2016 | agency=Capital News | date=5 December 2016}}</ref> Swahili and closely related languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people in [[Burundi]], [[Comoros]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Rwanda]].<ref>Nurse & Thomas Spear (1985) ''The Swahili''</ref> The language was still understood in the southern ports of the [[Red Sea]] in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Kharusi\">{{cite journal | last=Kharusi | first=N.

Key activities mandated for the organization include creating a healthy atmosphere for the development of Swahili, encouraging use of the language in government and business functions, coordinating activities of other organizations involved with Swahili, standardizing the language. Although other bodies and agencies can propose new vocabularies, BAKITA is the only organisation in the world that can approve its usage in the Swahili language.\nIn Kenya, ''Chama cha Kiswahili cha Taifa'' (CHAKITA) was established in 1998 to research and propose means to which Kiswahili can be integrated to a national language.\n\nSwahili is among the first languages in Africa for which [[language technology]] applications have been developed.

With the arrival of Arabs in East Africa they brought Islam and to which they set up Madrasas and used Swahili to teach Islam to the natives. As the Arab presence grew, more and more native were converted to Islam and were taught using the Swahili language.\n\n==== Christianity ====\nThe arrival of Europeans in East Africa, Christianity was introduced in East Africa. While the Arabs were mostly centered at the coastal areas, European missionaries went further inland spreading Christianity. With the first missionary posts in East Africa being located in the coastal areas, the missionaries picked up Swahili and used it to spread Christianity since it had a lot  of similarities with a lot of indigenous languages.\n\n=== Politics ===\nDuring the struggle for Tanganyika independence, [[Tanganyika African National Union|Tanganyika African  National Union]] used Swahili as language of mass organisation and political movement. This included publishing pamphlets and radio broadcasts to rally the people to fight for independence. After independence, Swahili was adopted as the national language of the nation. Till this day, Tanzanians carry a sense of pride when it comes to Swahili especially when it is used to unite over 120 tribes across Tanzania. Swahili was used to strengthen solidarity among the people and a sense of togetherness and for that Swahili remains a key identity of the Tanzanian people.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Selfref|For assistance with IPA transcriptions of Swahili for Wikipedia articles, see [[Help:IPA/Swahili]].}}\n\nUnlike the majority of Niger-Congo languages,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Niger-Congo-languages|title=Niger-Congo languages|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> Swahili lacks [[Tone (linguistics)|contrastive tone]] (pitch contour).

However, these long vowels are not considered to be [[Phoneme|phonemic]].

There are a few [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for native sounds, ''ch'' , ''sh'' , ''ng''' and ''ny''; ''q'' and ''x'' are not used,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/other/swahili/guide/alphabet.shtml |title=A Guide to Swahili \u2013 The Swahili alphabet |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref> ''c'' is not used apart from unassimilated English loans and, occasionally, as a substitute for ''k'' in advertisements. There are also several digraphs for Arabic sounds which many speakers outside of ethnic Swahili areas have trouble differentiating.\n\nThe language used to be written in the Arabic script. Unlike adaptations of the Arabic script for other languages, relatively little accommodation was made for Swahili. There were also differences in orthographic conventions between cities and authors and over the centuries, some quite precise but others different enough to cause difficulties with intelligibility.\n\n{{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} were often conflated, but in some spellings, {{IPA|/e/}} was distinguished from {{IPA|/i/}} by rotating the ''[[kasrah|kasra]]'' 90\u00b0 and  {{IPA|/o/}} was distinguished from  {{IPA|/u/}} by writing the ''[[damma]]'' backwards.\n\nSeveral Swahili consonants do not have equivalents in Arabic, and for them, often no special letters were created unlike, for example, [[Urdu script|Urdu]] script. Instead, the closest Arabic sound is substituted. Not only did that mean that one letter often stands for more than one sound, but also writers made different choices of which consonant to substitute.

See [[Talk:Swahili language#The noun classes section needs an introduction]].|small=no|date=July 2019}}\nSwahili nouns are separable into classes, which are roughly analogous to [[gender]]s in other languages.  For example, just as suffix <-o> in Spanish marks masculine objects, and <-a> marks feminine ones, so, in Swahili, prefixes mark groups of similar objects: <m-> marks single human beings (''mtoto'' 'child'), <wa-> marks multiple humans (''watoto'' 'children'), <u-> marks abstract nouns (''utoto'' 'childhood'), and so on.  Similar prefixes must be used on verbs and particles in agreement with the governing noun in a phrase.  This is a characteristic feature of all the Bantu languages of sub-Saharan Africa, and traces of it are also found in the [[Niger-Congo]] languages of West Africa.\n\n====Semantic motivation====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nThe ''ki-/vi-'' class historically consisted of two separate genders, artefacts (Bantu class 7/8, utensils and hand tools mostly) and diminutives (Bantu class 12/13), which were conflated at a stage ancestral to Swahili. Examples of the former are ''kisu'' \"knife\", ''kiti'' \"chair\" (from ''mti'' \"tree, wood\"), ''chombo'' \"vessel\" (a contraction of ''ki-ombo''). Examples of the latter are ''kitoto'' \"infant\", from ''mtoto'' \"child\"; ''kitawi'' \"frond\", from ''tawi'' \"branch\"; and ''chumba'' (''ki-umba'') \"room\", from ''nyumba'' \"house\". It is the diminutive sense that has been furthest extended. An extension common to diminutives in many languages is ''approximation'' and ''resemblance'' (having a 'little bit' of some characteristic, like ''-y'' or ''-ish'' in English). For example, there is ''kijani'' \"green\", from ''jani'' \"leaf\" (compare English 'leafy'), ''kichaka'' \"bush\" from ''chaka'' \"clump\", and ''kivuli'' \"shadow\" from ''uvuli'' \"shade\". A 'little bit' of a verb would be an instance of an action, and such ''instantiations'' (usually not very active ones) are found: ''kifo'' \"death\", from the verb ''-fa'' \"to die\"; ''kiota'' \"nest\" from ''-ota'' \"to brood\"; ''chakula'' \"food\" from ''kula'' \"to eat\"; ''kivuko'' \"a ford, a pass\" from ''-vuka'' \"to cross\"; and ''kilimia'' \"the [[Pleiades]]\", from ''-limia'' \"to farm with\", from its role in guiding planting. A resemblance, or being a bit like something, implies marginal status in a category, so things that are marginal examples of their class may take the ''ki-/vi-'' prefixes. One example is ''chura'' (''ki-ura'') \"frog\", which is only half terrestrial and therefore is marginal as an animal. This extension may account for disabilities as well: ''kilema'' \"a cripple\", ''kipofu'' \"a blind person\", ''kiziwi'' \"a deaf person\". Finally, diminutives often denote contempt, and contempt is sometimes expressed against things that are dangerous. This might be the historical explanation for ''kifaru'' \"rhinoceros\", ''kingugwa'' \"spotted hyena\", and ''kiboko'' \"hippopotamus\" (perhaps originally meaning \"stubby legs\").\n\nAnother class with broad semantic extension is the ''m-/mi-'' class (Bantu classes 3/4). This is often called the 'tree' class, because ''mti, miti'' \"tree(s)\" is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities neither human nor typical animals: trees and other plants, such as ''mwitu'' 'forest' and ''mtama'' 'millet' (and from there, things made from plants, like ''mkeka'' 'mat'); supernatural and natural forces, such as ''mwezi'' 'moon', ''mlima'' 'mountain', ''mto'' 'river'; active things, such as ''moto'' 'fire', including active body parts (''moyo'' 'heart', ''mkono'' 'hand, arm'); and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as ''mji'' 'village', and, by analogy, ''mzinga'' 'beehive/cannon'. From the central idea of ''tree'', which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as ''mwavuli'' 'umbrella', ''moshi'' 'smoke', ''msumari'' 'nail'; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as ''mfuo'' \"metal forging\", from ''-fua'' \"to forge\", or ''mlio'' \"a sound\", from ''-lia'' \"to make a sound\". Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, ''mkono'' is an active body part, and ''mto'' is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as ''mpaka'' 'border' and ''mwendo'' 'journey', are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as ''mwaka'' 'year' and perhaps ''mshahara'' 'wages'. Animals exceptional in some way and so not easily fitting in the other classes may be placed in this class.\n\nThe other classes have foundations that may at first seem similarly counterintuitive.<ref>See Contini-Morava for details.</ref> In short,\n*Classes 1\u20132 include most words for people: kin terms, professions, ethnicities, etc., including translations of most English words ending in ''-er.'' They include a couple of generic words for animals: ''mnyama'' 'beast', ''mdudu'' 'bug'.\n*Classes 5\u20136 have a broad semantic range of groups, expanses, and augmentatives. Although interrelated, it is easier to illustrate if broken down:\n**Augmentatives, such as ''joka'' 'serpent' from ''nyoka'' 'snake', lead to titles and other terms of respect (the opposite of diminutives, which lead to terms of contempt): ''Bwana'' 'Sir', ''shangazi'' 'aunt', ''fundi'' 'craftsman', ''kadhi'' 'judge'\n**Expanses: ''ziwa'' 'lake', ''bonde'' 'valley', ''taifa'' 'country', ''anga'' 'sky'\n***from this, mass nouns: ''maji'' 'water', ''vumbi'' 'dust' (and other liquids and fine particulates which may cover broad expanses), ''kaa'' 'charcoal', ''mali'' 'wealth', ''maridhawa'' 'abundance'\n**Collectives: ''kundi'' 'group', ''kabila'' 'language/ethnic group', ''jeshi'' 'army', ''daraja'' ' stairs', ''manyoya'' 'fur, feathers', ''mapesa'' 'small change', ''manyasi'' 'weeds', ''jongoo'' 'millipede' (large set of legs), ''marimba'' 'xylophone' (large set of keys)\n***from this, individual things found in groups: ''jiwe'' 'stone', ''tawi'' 'branch', ''ua'' 'flower', ''tunda'' 'fruit' (also the names of most fruits), ''yai'' 'egg', ''mapacha'' 'twins', ''jino'' 'tooth', ''tumbo'' 'stomach' (cf. English \"guts\"), and paired body parts such as ''jicho'' 'eye', ''bawa'' 'wing', etc.\n***also collective or dialogic actions, which occur among groups of people: ''neno'' 'a word', from ''kunena'' 'to speak' (and by extension, mental verbal processes: ''wazo'' 'thought', ''maana'' 'meaning'); ''pigo'' 'a stroke, blow', from ''kupiga'' 'to hit'; ''gomvi'' 'a quarrel', ''shauri'' 'advice, plan', ''kosa'' 'mistake', ''jambo'' 'affair', ''penzi'' 'love', ''jibu'' 'answer', ''agano'' 'promise', ''malipo'' 'payment'\n***From pairing, reproduction is suggested as another extension (fruit, egg, testicle, flower, twins, etc.), but these generally duplicate one or more of the subcategories above\n*Classes 9\u201310 are used for most typical animals: ''ndege'' 'bird', ''samaki'' 'fish', and the specific names of typical beasts, birds, and bugs. However, this is the 'other' class, for words not fitting well elsewhere, and about half of the class 9\u201310 nouns are foreign loanwords. Loans may be classified as 9\u201310 because they lack the prefixes inherent in other classes, and most native class 9\u201310 nouns have no prefix. Thus they do not form a coherent semantic class, though there are still semantic extensions from individual words.\n*Class 11 (which takes class 10 for the plural) are mostly nouns with an \"extended outline shape\", in either one dimension or two:\n**mass nouns that are generally localized rather than covering vast expanses: ''uji'' 'porridge', ''wali'' 'cooked rice'\n**broad: ''ukuta'' 'wall', ''ukucha'' 'fingernail', ''upande'' 'side' (\u2248 ''ubavu'' 'rib'), ''wavu'' 'net', ''wayo'' 'sole, footprint', ''ua'' 'fence, yard', ''uteo'' 'winnowing basket'\n**long: ''utambi'' 'wick', ''utepe'' 'stripe', ''uta'' 'bow', ''ubavu'' 'rib', ''ufa'' 'crack', ''unywele'' 'a hair'\n***from 'a hair', [[singulative]]s of nouns, which are often class 6 ('collectives') in the plural: ''unyoya'' 'a feather', ''uvumbi'' 'a grain of dust', ''ushanga'' 'a bead'.\n*Class 14 are abstractions, such as ''utoto'' 'childhood' (from ''mtoto'' 'a child') and have no plural. They have the same prefixes and concord as class 11, except optionally for adjectival concord.\n*Class 15 are verbal infinitives.\n*Classes 16\u201318 are locatives. The Bantu nouns of these classes have been lost; the only permanent member is the Arabic loan ''mahali'' 'place(s)', but  in Mombasa Swahili, the old prefixes survive: ''pahali'' 'place', ''mwahali'' 'places'. However, any noun with the locative suffix ''-ni'' takes class 16\u201318 agreement. The distinction between them is that class 16 agreement is used if the location is intended to be definite (\"at\"), class 17 if indefinite (\"around\") or involves motion (\"to, toward\"), and class 18 if it involves containment (\"within\"): ''mahali pazuri'' 'a good spot', ''mahali kuzuri'' 'a nice area', ''mahali muzuri'' (it's nice in there).\n\n===Agreement===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nSwahili phrases agree with nouns in a system of [[Agreement (linguistics)|concord]], but if the noun refers to a human, they accord with noun classes 1\u20132 regardless of their noun class. Verbs agree with the noun class of their subjects and objects; adjectives, prepositions and demonstratives agree with the noun class of their nouns. In Standard Swahili ''(Kiswahili sanifu)'', based on the dialect spoken in Zanzibar, the system is rather complex; however, it is drastically simplified in many local variants where Swahili is not a native language, such as in Nairobi. In non-native Swahili, concord reflects only animacy: human subjects and objects trigger ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-'' in verbal concord, while non-human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger ''i-, zi-''. Infinitives vary between standard ''ku-'' and reduced ''i-.''<ref>Kamil Ud Deen, 2005. ''The acquisition of Swahili''.</ref> (\"Of\" is animate ''wa'' and inanimate ''ya, za.'')\n\nIn Standard Swahili, human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger animacy concord in ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-,'' and non-human subjects and objects trigger a variety of gender-concord prefixes.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Swahili noun-class concord\n|-\n!NC!!Semantic<br/>field!!Noun<br/>-C, -V!!Subj.!!Obj!!''-a''!!Adjective<br/>-C, -i, -e<ref group=\"*\">Most Swahili adjectives begin with either a consonant or the vowels ''i-'' or ''e-'', listed separately above.

In contrast to many other [[Music sequencer|software sequencers]], Ableton Live is designed to be an [[Musical instrument|instrument]] for live [[performance]]s as well as a tool for [[composer|composing]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[Arrangement|arranging]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], and [[Audio mastering|mastering]], as shown by Ableton's companion hardware product, [[Ableton Push]]. It is also used by [[Disc jockey|DJs]], as it offers a suite of controls for [[beatmatching]], [[Crossfade (audio engineering)|crossfading]], and other different effects used by [[turntablism|turntablists]], and was one of the first music applications to automatically beatmatch [[song]]s. Live is available in three versions. Intro, Standard, and Suite. The current version of Live is \"Ableton Live 10\".\n\n==History==\nAbleton co-founders Gerhard Behles, [[Robert Henke]], and Bernd Roggendorf developed Live from homemade software Behles and Henke had created to facilitate their live music performances as [[Monolake]], releasing the first version of Live in 2001 as [[commercial software]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Battino |first1=David |last2=Richards |first2=Kelli |title=The Art of Digital Music |date=2005 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=0-87930-830-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/artofdigitalmusi00davi/page/3 3] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/artofdigitalmusi00davi/page/3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Slater |first1=Maya-Roisin |title=The Untold Story of Ableton Live\u2014the Program That Transformed Electronic Music Performance Forever |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/78je3z/ableton-live-history-interview-founders-berhard-behles-robert-henke |website=Vice.com |publisher=Vice Media LLC |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref> Ableton Live is written in [[C++]].

Live utilizes audio [[sampling (music)|sample]] or [[MIDI]] sequences, referred to as Clips, which are arranged to be played live (i.e. triggered) or played back in a pre-arranged order. [[MIDI]] triggers notes on Live's built in instruments, as well as third party VST instruments or external hardware.\n\nThe Session View offers a grid-based representation of all of the Clips in a Live Set. These clips can be arranged into scenes which can then be triggered as a unit. For instance a [[drum]], [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[guitar]] track might comprise a single scene. When moving on to the next scene, which may feature a [[Bassline|synth bassline]], the artist will trigger the scene, activating the clips for that scene. \n\nThe Arrangement View offers a horizontal music production timeline of Clips that is more similar to a traditional software sequencer interface. The Arrangement View is used for recording tracks from the session view and further manipulating their arrangement and effects. It is also used for manual MIDI sequencing.<ref>{{cite web |title=A brief history of Ableton Live |url=https://www.musicradar.com/tuition/tech/a-brief-history-of-ableton-live-357837 |website=Future Music |publisher=Future Music Publishing Quay House |accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Instruments===\nThe Intro version of Live includes four instruments (Impulse, Simpler, Instrument Rack, and Drum Rack) and the Standard version of Live additionally includes External Instrument, with users having the option to purchase additional instruments. By contrast, Live Suite includes all available instruments.\n \n* '''Impulse''' - a traditional drum triggering instrument which allows the user to define a kit of up to eight drum sounds, each based on a single sample. There are a number of effects available such as basic equalization, attack, decay, pitch shift, etc. Once the kit is defined, rhythms and beats are created through Live's MIDI sequencer.\n<!-- Yes, it's called SIMPLER, not SAMPLER -->\n* '''Simpler''' - a basic [[sampling (music)|sampling]] instrument. It functions using a single audio sample, applying simple effects, and envelopes, finally applying pitch transformations in the form of [[Granular synthesis]]. In this case, incoming MIDI does not trigger drums as it does in ''Impulse'', but selects the final pitch of the sample, with C3 playing the sample at its original pitch.\n* '''Drum Rack''' - a sampler for drums. MIDI notes trigger individual \"Simplers\" so rather than triggering one sample at multiple pitches, individual samples are triggered at predefined pitches, as is suitable for MIDI drum programming. As is usual with Ableton almost anything can be drag dropped to or from the drum racks; for example, one can drop an audio clip or any MIDI device onto a drum rack note.\n* '''Instrument Rack''' - allows the user to combine multiple instruments and effects into a single device, allowing for split and layered sounds with customized macro controls.\n* '''Analog''' - simulates an [[analog synthesizer]].\n* '''Bass''' - a monophonic virtual analog bass synthesizer.\n* '''Collision''' - a mallet [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] [[physical modelling synthesis|physical modelling synthesizer]].\n* '''Drum Synths''' - 8 devices for creating drum and percussion sounds via synthesis.\n* '''Electric''' - an [[electric piano]] instrument.\n* '''[[Ableton Operator|Operator]]''' - an [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesizer]].\n* '''Poli''' - a virtual analog synthesizer that combines [[Subtractive synthesis|subtractive]] and [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesis]] \n* '''Sampler''' - an enhanced [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]].\n* '''Tension''' - a string [[physical modelling synthesis|physical modelling synthesizer]].\n* '''Wavetable''' - a [[wavetable synthesizer]] featuring two oscillators and remappable modulation sources.\n\n\nAbleton also has available a selection of '''Add-on Sample Packs''' with which a user can expand the sound libraries for their instruments. \n* '''Session Drums''' - a collection of sampled [[drum kits]].\n* '''Latin Percussion''' - a collection of sampled [[latin percussion]] hits and loops.\n* '''Essential Instruments Collection''' - a large collection of acoustic and electric instrument samples.\n* '''Orchestral Instrument Collection''' - a collection of four different orchestral libraries, which can be purchased individually or as a bundle: Orchestral Strings, Orchestral Brass, Orchestral Woodwinds and Orchestral Percussion. The Orchestral Instrument Collection is included upon purchase of Live Suite but must be downloaded separately.\n\n===Dedicated hardware instruments===\n[[Akai]] Professional makes the APC40 mk II, a MIDI controller designed to work solely with Ableton Live. A smaller version, the APC20, was released in 2010. Though there are many MIDI controllers compatible with Ableton, these Akai units try to closely map the actual Ableton Live layout onto physical space. [[Novation Digital Music Systems]] has created the \"Launchpad\" which is a pad device that has been designed for use with Ableton. Ableton has also released their own [[MIDI]] controller, the [[Ableton Push|Push]], which is the first pad-based controller that embraces scales and melody.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/using-push/|title=Using Push \u2014 Ableton Reference Manual Version 10  - Ableton|website=www.ableton.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110183011/https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/using-push/|archivedate=2014-11-10}}</ref> In November 2015, Ableton released an updated [[MIDI]] controller, the [[Ableton Push|Push 2]], along with Live 9.5.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=32038 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023010937/https://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=32038 |archivedate=2017-10-23 }} Resident Advisor News: Ableton unveils Push 2 and Live 9.5</ref>\n\n===Effects===\nMost of Live's [[Sound effect|effects]] are already common effects in the [[digital signal processing]] world which have been adapted to fit Live's interface. They are tailored to suit Live's target audience &ndash; [[electronic musician]]s and [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s - but may also be used for other recording tasks such as processing a guitar rig. The effects featured in Ableton Live are grouped into two categories - MIDI effects and audio effects.\n\n{|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Audio Effects\n!MIDI Effects\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{|\n|\n* Amp\n* Audio Effect Rack\n* Auto [[Audio filter|Filter]]\n* Auto Pan\n* Beat Repeat\n* Cabinet\n* Channel EQ\n* [[Chorus effect|Chorus]]\n* Color Limiter\n* [[Dynamic range compression|Compressor]]\n* Convolution Reverb\n* Corpus\n* CV Clock In\n* CV Clock Out\n* CV Envelope Follower\n* CV Instrument\n* CV In\n* CV LFO\n* CV Shaper\n* CV Triggers\n* CV Utility\n* [[Delay (audio effect)|Delay]]\n* Drum Buss\n* Dynamic [[Tube sound|Tube]]\n* [[Echo]]\n* EQ Three\n* Erosion\n|\n* External Audio Effect\n* Filter [[Delay (audio effect)|Delay]]\n* [[Flanging|Flanger]]\n* Frequency Shifter\n* [[Noise gate|Gate]]\n* Gated Delay\n* Glue Compressor\n* Grain Delay\n* [[Compressor limiter|Limiter]]\n* [[Music loop|Looper]]\n* Pedal\n* Pitch Hack\n* Re-Enveloper\n* Spectral Blur\n* Surround Panner\n* [[Dynamic range compression#Multiband compression|Multiband Dynamics]]\n* [[Distortion (music)|Overdrive]]\n* Resonators\n* [[Spectrum analyzer|Spectrum]]\n* [[Phaser (effect)|Phaser]]\n* Redux\n* [[Reverberation|Reverb]]\n* [[Clipping (audio)|Saturator]]\n* Tuner\n* Utility\n* [[Gramophone record|Vinyl]] [[Distortion (music)|Distortion]]\n* [[Vocoder]]\n|}\n\n|\n* [[Arpeggiator]]\n* [[Chord (music)|Chord]]\n* Envelope\n* Envelope Follower\n* Expression Control\n* LFO\n* Melodic Steps\n* MIDI Monitor\n* MIDI Effect Rack\n* Note Echo\n* Note Length\n* [[Pitch shift|Pitch]]\n* Random\n* Rotating Rhythm Generator\n* [[Scale (music)|Scale]]\n* Shaper\n* Velocity\n|}\n\nLive is also able to host [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST plugins]] and, on the [[macOS]] version, [[Audio Units|Audio Unit]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] as well as [[Max for Live]] devices since Live 9.\n\n===Working with audio clips===\n[[File:DJ Sasha at Arenele Romane, Bucharest (2006) (rear view).jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] playing a DJ set using Ableton Live running on an iMac G5.]] In addition to the instruments mentioned above, Live can work with samples. Live attempts to do beat analysis of the samples to find their [[metre (music)|meter]], number of bars and the number of [[beats per minute]]. This makes it possible for Live to shift these samples to fit into [[Loop (music)|loops]] that are tied into the piece's global [[tempo]].\n\nAdditionally, Live's Time Warp feature can be used to either correct or adjust beat positions in the sample. By setting warp markers to a specific point in the sample, arbitrary points in the sample can be pegged to positions in the measure. For instance a drum beat that fell 250 ms after the midpoint in measure may be adjusted so that it will be played back precisely at the midpoint.\n\nSome artists and online stores, such as The Covert Operators and Puremagnetik, now make available sample packs that are pre-adjusted, with tempo information and warp markers added. The audio files are accompanied with an \"analysis file\" in Live's native format (.asd files).<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = The Covert Operators - Ableton Live Packs\n |url         = http://www.thecovertoperators.org/\n |accessdate  = 2011-08-05\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807200816/http://www.thecovertoperators.org/\n |archivedate = 2011-08-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Puremagnetik\n| url=http://www.puremagnetik.com/\n| accessdate = 2008-12-17 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081216002904/http://puremagnetik.com/| archivedate= 16 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAbleton Live also supports Audio To MIDI, which converts audio samples into a sequence of MIDI notes using three different conversion methods including conversion to Melody, Harmony, or Rhythm. Once finished, Live will create a new MIDI track containing the fresh MIDI notes along with an instrument to play back the notes. Audio to midi conversion is not always 100% accurate and may require the artist or producer to manually adjust some notes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hands-on with Ableton Live 9: Audio to MIDI|url = http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/hands-on-with-ableton-live-9-audio-to-midi-571604|website = MusicRadar|access-date = 2016-02-23|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303115726/http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/hands-on-with-ableton-live-9-audio-to-midi-571604|archivedate = 2016-03-03}}</ref> See [[Fourier transform]].\n\n===Envelopes===\nAlmost all of the parameters in Live can be automated by envelopes which may be drawn either on clips, in which case they will be used in every performance of that clip, or on the entire arrangement. The most obvious examples are volume or track panning, but envelopes are also used in Live to control parameters of audio devices such as the root note of a resonator or a filter's cutoff frequency. Clip envelopes may also be mapped to [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] controls, which can also control parameters in real-time using sliders, faders and such. Using the global transport record function will also record changes made to these parameters, creating an envelope for them.\n\n===User interface===\nMuch of Live's interface comes from being designed for use in live performance as well as for production.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Tusa\n |first       = Scott\n |title       = Getting Started with Ableton Live\n |url         = http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2005/02/16/ableton_intro.html\n |publisher   = O'Reilly Digital Media\n |accessdate  = 2009-04-19\n |quote       = This user-friendly program was designed for live performances by musicians who wanted to use the recording studio like a musical instrument.

In contrast to many other [[Music sequencer|software sequencers]], Ableton Live is designed to be an [[Musical instrument|instrument]] for live [[performance]]s as well as a tool for [[composer|composing]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[Arrangement|arranging]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], and [[Audio mastering|mastering]], as shown by Ableton's companion hardware product, [[Ableton Push]]. It is also used by [[Disc jockey|DJs]], as it offers a suite of controls for [[beatmatching]], [[Crossfade (audio engineering)|crossfading]], and other different effects used by [[turntablism|turntablists]], and was one of the first music applications to automatically beatmatch [[song]]s. Live is available in three versions. Intro, Standard, and Suite. The current version of Live is \"Ableton Live 10\".\n\n==History==\nAbleton co-founders Gerhard Behles, [[Robert Henke]], and Bernd Roggendorf developed Live from homemade software Behles and Henke had created to facilitate their live music performances as [[Monolake]], releasing the first version of Live in 2001 as [[commercial software]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Battino |first1=David |last2=Richards |first2=Kelli |title=The Art of Digital Music |date=2005 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=0-87930-830-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/artofdigitalmusi00davi/page/3 3] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/artofdigitalmusi00davi/page/3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Slater |first1=Maya-Roisin |title=The Untold Story of Ableton Live\u2014the Program That Transformed Electronic Music Performance Forever |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/78je3z/ableton-live-history-interview-founders-berhard-behles-robert-henke |website=Vice.com |publisher=Vice Media LLC |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref> Ableton Live is written in [[C++]].

Live utilizes audio [[sampling (music)|sample]] or [[MIDI]] sequences, referred to as Clips, which are arranged to be played live (i.e. triggered) or played back in a pre-arranged order. [[MIDI]] triggers notes on Live's built in instruments, as well as third party VST instruments or external hardware.\n\nThe Session View offers a grid-based representation of all of the Clips in a Live Set. These clips can be arranged into scenes which can then be triggered as a unit. For instance a [[drum]], [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[guitar]] track might comprise a single scene. When moving on to the next scene, which may feature a [[Bassline|synth bassline]], the artist will trigger the scene, activating the clips for that scene. \n\nThe Arrangement View offers a horizontal music production timeline of Clips that is more similar to a traditional software sequencer interface. The Arrangement View is used for recording tracks from the session view and further manipulating their arrangement and effects. It is also used for manual MIDI sequencing.<ref>{{cite web |title=A brief history of Ableton Live |url=https://www.musicradar.com/tuition/tech/a-brief-history-of-ableton-live-357837 |website=Future Music |publisher=Future Music Publishing Quay House |accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Instruments===\nThe Intro version of Live includes four instruments (Impulse, Simpler, Instrument Rack, and Drum Rack) and the Standard version of Live additionally includes External Instrument, with users having the option to purchase additional instruments. By contrast, Live Suite includes all available instruments.\n \n* '''Impulse''' - a traditional drum triggering instrument which allows the user to define a kit of up to eight drum sounds, each based on a single sample. There are a number of effects available such as basic equalization, attack, decay, pitch shift, etc. Once the kit is defined, rhythms and beats are created through Live's MIDI sequencer.\n<!-- Yes, it's called SIMPLER, not SAMPLER -->\n* '''Simpler''' - a basic [[sampling (music)|sampling]] instrument. It functions using a single audio sample, applying simple effects, and envelopes, finally applying pitch transformations in the form of [[Granular synthesis]]. In this case, incoming MIDI does not trigger drums as it does in ''Impulse'', but selects the final pitch of the sample, with C3 playing the sample at its original pitch.\n* '''Drum Rack''' - a sampler for drums. MIDI notes trigger individual \"Simplers\" so rather than triggering one sample at multiple pitches, individual samples are triggered at predefined pitches, as is suitable for MIDI drum programming. As is usual with Ableton almost anything can be drag dropped to or from the drum racks; for example, one can drop an audio clip or any MIDI device onto a drum rack note.\n* '''Instrument Rack''' - allows the user to combine multiple instruments and effects into a single device, allowing for split and layered sounds with customized macro controls.\n* '''Analog''' - simulates an [[analog synthesizer]].\n* '''Bass''' - a monophonic virtual analog bass synthesizer.\n* '''Collision''' - a mallet [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] [[physical modelling synthesis|physical modelling synthesizer]].\n* '''Drum Synths''' - 8 devices for creating drum and percussion sounds via synthesis.\n* '''Electric''' - an [[electric piano]] instrument.\n* '''[[Ableton Operator|Operator]]''' - an [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesizer]].\n* '''Poli''' - a virtual analog synthesizer that combines [[Subtractive synthesis|subtractive]] and [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesis]] \n* '''Sampler''' - an enhanced [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]].\n* '''Tension''' - a string [[physical modelling synthesis|physical modelling synthesizer]].\n* '''Wavetable''' - a [[wavetable synthesizer]] featuring two oscillators and remappable modulation sources.\n\n\nAbleton also has available a selection of '''Add-on Sample Packs''' with which a user can expand the sound libraries for their instruments. \n* '''Session Drums''' - a collection of sampled [[drum kits]].\n* '''Latin Percussion''' - a collection of sampled [[latin percussion]] hits and loops.\n* '''Essential Instruments Collection''' - a large collection of acoustic and electric instrument samples.\n* '''Orchestral Instrument Collection''' - a collection of four different orchestral libraries, which can be purchased individually or as a bundle: Orchestral Strings, Orchestral Brass, Orchestral Woodwinds and Orchestral Percussion. The Orchestral Instrument Collection is included upon purchase of Live Suite but must be downloaded separately.\n\n===Dedicated hardware instruments===\n[[Akai]] Professional makes the APC40 mk II, a MIDI controller designed to work solely with Ableton Live. A smaller version, the APC20, was released in 2010. Though there are many MIDI controllers compatible with Ableton, these Akai units try to closely map the actual Ableton Live layout onto physical space. [[Novation Digital Music Systems]] has created the \"Launchpad\" which is a pad device that has been designed for use with Ableton. Ableton has also released their own [[MIDI]] controller, the [[Ableton Push|Push]], which is the first pad-based controller that embraces scales and melody.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/using-push/|title=Using Push \u2014 Ableton Reference Manual Version 10  - Ableton|website=www.ableton.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110183011/https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/using-push/|archivedate=2014-11-10}}</ref> In November 2015, Ableton released an updated [[MIDI]] controller, the [[Ableton Push|Push 2]], along with Live 9.5.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=32038 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023010937/https://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=32038 |archivedate=2017-10-23 }} Resident Advisor News: Ableton unveils Push 2 and Live 9.5</ref>\n\n===Effects===\nMost of Live's [[Sound effect|effects]] are already common effects in the [[digital signal processing]] world which have been adapted to fit Live's interface. They are tailored to suit Live's target audience &ndash; [[electronic musician]]s and [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s - but may also be used for other recording tasks such as processing a guitar rig. The effects featured in Ableton Live are grouped into two categories - MIDI effects and audio effects.\n\n{|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Audio Effects\n!MIDI Effects\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{|\n|\n* Amp\n* Audio Effect Rack\n* Auto [[Audio filter|Filter]]\n* Auto Pan\n* Beat Repeat\n* Cabinet\n* Channel EQ\n* [[Chorus effect|Chorus]]\n* Color Limiter\n* [[Dynamic range compression|Compressor]]\n* Convolution Reverb\n* Corpus\n* CV Clock In\n* CV Clock Out\n* CV Envelope Follower\n* CV Instrument\n* CV In\n* CV LFO\n* CV Shaper\n* CV Triggers\n* CV Utility\n* [[Delay (audio effect)|Delay]]\n* Drum Buss\n* Dynamic [[Tube sound|Tube]]\n* [[Echo]]\n* EQ Three\n* Erosion\n|\n* External Audio Effect\n* Filter [[Delay (audio effect)|Delay]]\n* [[Flanging|Flanger]]\n* Frequency Shifter\n* [[Noise gate|Gate]]\n* Gated Delay\n* Glue Compressor\n* Grain Delay\n* [[Compressor limiter|Limiter]]\n* [[Music loop|Looper]]\n* Pedal\n* Pitch Hack\n* Re-Enveloper\n* Spectral Blur\n* Surround Panner\n* [[Dynamic range compression#Multiband compression|Multiband Dynamics]]\n* [[Distortion (music)|Overdrive]]\n* Resonators\n* [[Spectrum analyzer|Spectrum]]\n* [[Phaser (effect)|Phaser]]\n* Redux\n* [[Reverberation|Reverb]]\n* [[Clipping (audio)|Saturator]]\n* Tuner\n* Utility\n* [[Gramophone record|Vinyl]] [[Distortion (music)|Distortion]]\n* [[Vocoder]]\n|}\n\n|\n* [[Arpeggiator]]\n* [[Chord (music)|Chord]]\n* Envelope\n* Envelope Follower\n* Expression Control\n* LFO\n* Melodic Steps\n* MIDI Monitor\n* MIDI Effect Rack\n* Note Echo\n* Note Length\n* [[Pitch shift|Pitch]]\n* Random\n* Rotating Rhythm Generator\n* [[Scale (music)|Scale]]\n* Shaper\n* Velocity\n|}\n\nLive is also able to host [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST plugins]] and, on the [[macOS]] version, [[Audio Units|Audio Unit]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] as well as [[Max for Live]] devices since Live 9.\n\n===Working with audio clips===\n[[File:DJ Sasha at Arenele Romane, Bucharest (2006) (rear view).jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] playing a DJ set using Ableton Live running on an iMac G5.]] In addition to the instruments mentioned above, Live can work with samples. Live attempts to do beat analysis of the samples to find their [[metre (music)|meter]], number of bars and the number of [[beats per minute]]. This makes it possible for Live to shift these samples to fit into [[Loop (music)|loops]] that are tied into the piece's global [[tempo]].\n\nAdditionally, Live's Time Warp feature can be used to either correct or adjust beat positions in the sample. By setting warp markers to a specific point in the sample, arbitrary points in the sample can be pegged to positions in the measure. For instance a drum beat that fell 250 ms after the midpoint in measure may be adjusted so that it will be played back precisely at the midpoint.\n\nSome artists and online stores, such as The Covert Operators and Puremagnetik, now make available sample packs that are pre-adjusted, with tempo information and warp markers added. The audio files are accompanied with an \"analysis file\" in Live's native format (.asd files).<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = The Covert Operators - Ableton Live Packs\n |url         = http://www.thecovertoperators.org/\n |accessdate  = 2011-08-05\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807200816/http://www.thecovertoperators.org/\n |archivedate = 2011-08-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Puremagnetik\n| url=http://www.puremagnetik.com/\n| accessdate = 2008-12-17 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081216002904/http://puremagnetik.com/| archivedate= 16 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAbleton Live also supports Audio To MIDI, which converts audio samples into a sequence of MIDI notes using three different conversion methods including conversion to Melody, Harmony, or Rhythm. Once finished, Live will create a new MIDI track containing the fresh MIDI notes along with an instrument to play back the notes. Audio to midi conversion is not always 100% accurate and may require the artist or producer to manually adjust some notes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hands-on with Ableton Live 9: Audio to MIDI|url = http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/hands-on-with-ableton-live-9-audio-to-midi-571604|website = MusicRadar|access-date = 2016-02-23|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303115726/http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/hands-on-with-ableton-live-9-audio-to-midi-571604|archivedate = 2016-03-03}}</ref> See [[Fourier transform]].\n\n===Envelopes===\nAlmost all of the parameters in Live can be automated by envelopes which may be drawn either on clips, in which case they will be used in every performance of that clip, or on the entire arrangement. The most obvious examples are volume or track panning, but envelopes are also used in Live to control parameters of audio devices such as the root note of a resonator or a filter's cutoff frequency. Clip envelopes may also be mapped to [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] controls, which can also control parameters in real-time using sliders, faders and such. Using the global transport record function will also record changes made to these parameters, creating an envelope for them.\n\n===User Interface===\nMuch of Live's interface comes from being designed for use in live performance as well as for production.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Tusa\n |first       = Scott\n |title       = Getting Started with Ableton Live\n |url         = http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2005/02/16/ableton_intro.html\n |publisher   = O'Reilly Digital Media\n |accessdate  = 2009-04-19\n |quote       = This user-friendly program was designed for live performances by musicians who wanted to use the recording studio like a musical instrument.

For the first time, an [[upper house]] came into existence in Thailand. The Senate was to be fully elected, however, the elections would be indirect, as the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]] would elect the senators, for six-year terms. The 1946 Constitution was soon abrogated in a military coup.

She is the [[Black hair|black-haired]] wife of [[caveman]] [[Barney Rubble]] and the adoptive mother of [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]. Her best friend is her next-door neighbor [[Wilma Flintstone]].\n\nBetty lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy primitive versions of modern conveniences such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s and [[washing machine]]s. She speaks with an Midwestern accent.\n\nBetty's personality was based on the [[stock character]] of the lead character's best friend's wife, commonly seen in 1950s television (other prominent examples including [[Trixie Norton]] of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', which by conflicting accounts was a major inspiration for ''The Flintstones'', and [[Ethel Mertz]] of ''[[I Love Lucy]]''). Much like Trixie or Ethel, Betty spent a lot of her time socializing with Wilma, and the two would often end up working together to bail their husbands out of whatever scheme of Fred's had landed them in trouble, sometimes scheming with each other.\n\n==Character==\nBetty is rarely seen failing to follow the lead of Barney or Wilma, so may appear to be the least developed character in the show. In spite of this, Betty is portrayed as having a distinctly emotional marriage with Barney, which often includes pet names and more obvious affection than the dynamic and energetic interaction between Fred and Wilma. Occasions when Betty leads the action are extremely scarce: one episode centers around her working undercover as a gentle old lady to earn money for a present for Barney; in another, the plot focuses on her and Wilma's suspicions of Barney being involved with another woman (who turns out to be Fred in a disguise in order to attend a ball game free of charge). This lack of protagonism (her continuous presence almost becoming a backdrop for supporting characters Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm and Dino) makes Betty less of the lead that the show's general concept might imply.\n\n==Biography==\nBetty is a friend of Wilma since their childhood. As a child, she lived with her parents who ran a [[convenience store]] and her older brother Brad. She also has a married sister  with a baby son named Marblehead Standstone<ref> \"The Surprise\"</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Betty and Wilma were employed as [[Cigarette girl (person)|cigarette girls]]/waitresses at a resort. There, they first met and fell in love with their future husbands, Fred and Barney. Eventually, Betty and Barney were married, presumably not long after Fred and Wilma.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref>\n\nBetty became a [[homemaker]], keeping house with such prehistoric aids as a baby [[mammoth]] [[vacuum cleaner]], [[pelican]] [[washing machine]], and so forth. Betty, much like Wilma, also enjoyed volunteering for various charitable/women's organizations in Bedrock, shopping, and (occasionally) meeting the celebrities of their world, including \"[[Tony Curtis|Stony Curtis]]\", \"[[Cary Grant|Cary Granite]]\", and \"[[Ann-Margret#1960s|Ann-Margrock]]\". Betty at one time also had a job working for an 'old lady' who turned out to be a young lady in disguise and who was using Betty to pass counterfeit money; this was the only episode centered principally around Betty.<ref>\"Old Lady Betty,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Despite her cheerful nature she has occasions to be angry at Barney <ref>\"The Flintstone Flyer\"; \"The Diner\"; \"Peek a Boo camera\"</ref> and once knocked out crooks with her stone purse who tried to kill Barney<ref>The Soft Untouchables</ref>\n\nIn the fourth season of the original series, Betty and Barney found an abandoned infant on their doorstep, by the name of \"Bamm-Bamm.\" After a court battle for possession of Bamm-Bamm (in which the Rubbles faced the opposition's noted prehistoric lawyer \"[[Perry Mason]]ry\"), the couple were allowed to adopt Bamm-Bamm.<ref>\"Little Bamm-Bamm,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> The Rubbles never had biological children.\n\nWhen Bamm-Bamm was a teenager, Betty gained employment as a [[reporter]] for one of Bedrock's [[newspaper]]s, the ''Daily Granite'' (presumably a parody of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' of [[Superman]] fame), under the editorial guidance of Lou Granite (presumably a parody of [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]] of the contemporaneous [[Lou Grant (TV series)|eponymous series]], and formerly of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''). While employed there, she shared various adventures with prehistoric [[superhero]] Captain Caveman, who (in a [[secret identity]]) also works for the newspaper.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" />\n\nLater still, after Bamm-Bamm grew up and left home, Betty started a successful catering business with her neighbor and friend Wilma, before becoming a [[grandmother]] to Bamm-Bamm's twin children, Chip and Roxy.<ref name=\"hollyrock\" />\n\n==Portrayal==\n[[June Foray]] voiced Betty in a 1959 ''Flintstones'' pilot titled ''The Flagstones'', but [[Bea Benaderet]] was cast for the series and voiced Betty for the first 4 seasons before stepping down in 1964 (due to her scheduling conflicts with ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''). [[Gerry Johnson]] took over the role for the last 2 seasons. [[Anna Bentinck]] has since performed the role in later ''Flintstones'' media since 1990\u20132003.\n\nIn [[The Flintstones (film)|the 1994 film]], Betty was portrayed by [[Rosie O'Donnell]],<ref>{{cite news|title= ROSIE: She Cuts Through the Rubble and Tells It Straight Up: The Comic-Turned-Actress Is a Real-Life Rizzo Who Says What's on Her Mind |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1994-03-24|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-24/news/ol-37930_1_real-life|accessdate=2010-11-10|first=Janice|last=Page}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= A New Stage in Her Career: O'Donnell's Made It in Movies, but Broadway Was Her Dream |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1994-03-29|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-29/entertainment/ca-39836_1_movie-career/4|accessdate=2010-11-10|first=Janice|last=Page}}</ref> who reportedly won the role because she captured the high pitch laugh at her audition.

She is the [[Black hair|black-haired]] wife of [[caveman]] [[Barney Rubble]] and the adoptive mother of [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]. Her best friend is her next-door neighbor [[Wilma Flintstone]].\n\nBetty lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy primitive versions of modern conveniences such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s and [[washing machine]]s. She speaks with an Midwestern accent.\n\nBetty's personality was based on the [[stock character]] of the lead character's best friend's wife, commonly seen in 1950s television (other prominent examples including [[Trixie Norton]] of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', which by conflicting accounts was a major inspiration for ''The Flintstones'', and [[Ethel Mertz]] of ''[[I Love Lucy]]''). Much like Trixie or Ethel, Betty spent a lot of her time socializing with Wilma, and the two would often end up working together to bail their husbands out of whatever scheme of Fred's had landed them in trouble, sometimes scheming with each other.\n\n==Character==\nBetty is rarely seen failing to follow the lead of Barney or Wilma, so may appear to be the least developed character in the show. In spite of this, Betty is portrayed as having a distinctly emotional marriage with Barney, which often includes pet names and more obvious affection than the dynamic and energetic interaction between Fred and Wilma. Occasions when Betty leads the action are extremely scarce: one episode centers around her working undercover as a gentle old lady to earn money for a present for Barney; in another, the plot focuses on her and Wilma's suspicions of Barney being involved with another woman (who turns out to be Fred in a disguise in order to attend a ball game free of charge). This lack of protagonism (her continuous presence almost becoming a backdrop for supporting characters Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm and Dino) makes Betty less of the lead that the show's general concept might imply.\n\n==Biography==\nBetty is a friend of Wilma since their childhood. As a child, she lived with her parents who ran a [[convenience store]] and her older brother Brad. She also has a married sister  with a baby son named Marblehead Standstone<ref> \"The Surprise\"</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Betty and Wilma were employed as [[Cigarette girl (person)|cigarette girls]]/waitresses at a resort. There, they first met and fell in love with their future husbands, Fred and Barney. Eventually, Betty and Barney were married, presumably not long after Fred and Wilma.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref>\n\nBetty became a [[homemaker]], keeping house with such prehistoric aids as a baby [[mammoth]] [[vacuum cleaner]], [[pelican]] [[washing machine]], and so forth. Betty, much like Wilma, also enjoyed volunteering for various charitable/women's organizations in Bedrock, shopping, and (occasionally) meeting the celebrities of their world, including \"[[Tony Curtis|Stony Curtis]]\", \"[[Cary Grant|Cary Granite]]\", and \"[[Ann-Margret#1960s|Ann-Margrock]]\". Betty at one time also had a job working for an 'old lady' who turned out to be a young lady in disguise and who was using Betty to pass counterfeit money; this was the only episode centered principally around Betty.<ref>\"Old Lady Betty,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Despite her cheerful nature she has occasions to be angry at Barney <ref>\"The Flintstone Flyer\"; \"The Diner\"; \"Peek a Boo camera\"</ref> and once knocked out crooks with her stone purse who tried to kill Barney<ref>The Soft Untouchables</ref>\n\nIn the fourth season of the original series, Betty and Barney found an abandoned infant on their doorstep, by the name of \"Bamm-Bamm.\" After a court battle for possession of Bamm-Bamm (in which the Rubbles faced the opposition's noted prehistoric lawyer \"[[Perry Mason]]ry\"), the couple were allowed to adopt Bamm-Bamm.<ref>\"Little Bamm-Bamm,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> The Rubbles never had biological children.\n\nWhen Bamm-Bamm was a teenager, Betty gained employment as a [[reporter]] for one of Bedrock's [[newspaper]]s, the ''Daily Granite'' (presumably a parody of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' of [[Superman]] fame), under the editorial guidance of Lou Granite (presumably a parody of [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]] of the contemporaneous [[Lou Grant (TV series)|eponymous series]], and formerly of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''). While employed there, she shared various adventures with prehistoric [[superhero]] Captain Caveman, who (in a [[secret identity]]) also works for the newspaper.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" />\n\nLater still, after Bamm-Bamm grew up and left home, Betty started a successful catering business with her neighbor and friend Wilma, before becoming a [[grandmother]] to Bamm-Bamm's twin children, Chip and Roxy.<ref name=\"hollyrock\" />\n\n==Portrayal==\n[[June Foray]] voiced Betty in a 1959 ''Flintstones'' pilot titled ''The Flagstones'', but [[Bea Benaderet]] was cast for the series and voiced Betty for the first 4 seasons before stepping down in 1964 (due to her scheduling conflicts with ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''). [[Gerry Johnson]] took over the role for the last 2 seasons. [[Anna Bentinck]] has since performed the role in later ''Flintstones'' media since 1990\u20132003.\n\nIn [[The Flintstones (film)|the 1994 film]], Betty was portrayed by [[Rosie O'Donnell]],<ref>{{cite news|title= ROSIE: She Cuts Through the Rubble and Tells It Straight Up: The Comic-Turned-Actress Is a Real-Life Rizzo Who Says What's on Her Mind |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1994-03-24|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-24/news/ol-37930_1_real-life|accessdate=2010-11-10|first=Janice|last=Page}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= A New Stage in Her Career: O'Donnell's Made It in Movies, but Broadway Was Her Dream |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1994-03-29|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-29/entertainment/ca-39836_1_movie-career/4|accessdate=2010-11-10|first=Janice|last=Page}}</ref> who reportedly won the role because she captured the high pitch laugh at her audition.

Truman.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A game of [[Texas hold 'em]] in progress. \"Hold 'em\" is a popular form of poker.]]\n\n'''Poker''' is any of a number of [[card game]]s in which [[Card player|players]] [[betting (poker)|wager]] over which [[poker hand|hand]] is best according to that specific game's rules in ways similar [[List of poker hands|to these rankings]]. Often using a [[Standard 52-card deck|standard deck]], poker games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number [[Poker dealer|dealt]] face up or face down, and the number [[Community card poker|shared by all players]], but all have rules which involve one or more rounds of betting.\n\nIn most modern poker games the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the ''[[blind (poker)|blind]]'' or ''ante''). In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players. The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match (or \"call\") the maximum previous bet, or [[betting (poker)#Fold|fold]], losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand. A player who matches a bet may also \"raise\" (increase) the bet. The betting round ends when all players have either called the last bet or folded. If all but one player folds on any round, the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand. If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round, a [[showdown (poker)|showdown]] takes place where the hands are revealed, and the player with the winning hand takes the pot.\n\nWith the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive [[expected value]] or who is trying to [[Bluff (poker)|bluff]] other players for various strategic reasons. Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of [[probability]], [[psychology]], and [[game theory]]. have a good day!\n\nPoker has increased in popularity since the beginning of the 20th century and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely popular activity, both for participants and spectators, including online, with many professional players and multimillion-dollar tournament prizes.\n\n==History==\n{{summarize|from|better=y|History of poker|date=April 2018}}\n{{Main|History of poker}}\nPoker was developed sometime during the early 19th century in the United States. Since those early beginnings, the game has grown to become an extremely popular pastime worldwide.\n\nIn the 1937 edition of Foster's Complete [[Edmond Hoyle|Hoyle]], [[R. F. Foster (games)|R. F. Foster]] wrote: \"the game of poker, as first played in the United States, five cards to each player from a twenty-card pack, is undoubtedly the Persian game of [[As-Nas]].\" By the 1990s some gaming historians including [[David Parlett]] started to challenge the notion that poker is a direct derivative of As-Nas. Developments in the 1970s led to poker becoming far more popular than it was before. Modern [[Poker tournament|tournament]] play became popular in American casinos after the [[World Series of Poker]] began, in 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaming.unlv.edu/WSOP/history.html|title=World Series of Poker Retrospective: Horseshoe History|website=gaming.unlv.edu|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Poker on television]] increased the popularity of the game during the turn of the [[millennium]]. This resulted in the [[poker boom]] few years later between 2003-2006.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Imageframe|width=300|caption=Examples of top poker hand categories|align=right|content=\n[[List of poker hand categories#Straight flush|Straight flush]]<br /><!--\n-->{{card|club|J|60px}}{{card|club|10|60px}}{{card|club|9|60px}}{{card|club|8|60px}}{{card|club|7|60px}}\n----\n[[List of poker hand categories#Four of a kind|Four of a kind]]<br /><!--\n-->{{card|club|6|60px}}{{card|diamond|6|60px}}{{card|heart|6|60px}}{{card|spade|6|60px}}{{card|club|A|60px}}\n}}\n{{details|topic=betting rules|Betting in poker}}\n{{For|more details on rules for the most common poker variants|List of poker hands|List of poker variants}}\nIn casual play, the right to [[poker dealer|deal]] a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a ''[[button (poker)|dealer button]]'' (or ''buck''). In a [[casino]], a house dealer handles the [[playing card|cards]] for each hand, but the button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting. The cards are dealt clockwise around the [[poker table]], one at a time.\n\nOne or more players are usually required to make [[Betting (poker)#Forced bets|forced bets]], usually either an ''ante'' or a ''blind bet'' (sometimes both). The dealer [[shuffle]]s the cards, the player on the chair to his or her right [[cut (playing cards)|cuts]], and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time, beginning with the player to his or her left. Cards may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial deal, the first of what may be several [[betting (poker)|betting]] rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot.\n\nAt any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to ''call'' (match) the bet, and all opponents instead ''fold'', the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins. This is what makes [[bluff (poker)|bluffing]] possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker, one that distinguishes it from other vying games and from other games that make use of [[hand rankings|poker hand rankings]].\n\nAt the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a [[showdown (poker)|showdown]], in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot. A poker hand comprises five cards; in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them, only the best five-card combination counts.\n\n==Variants==\n{{Main|List of poker variants}}\n[[File:2006 WSOP Main Event Table.jpg|thumb|upright|[[2006 World Series of Poker|2006 WSOP]] Main Event table]]\n\nPoker variations are played where a \"high hand\" or a \"low hand\" may be the best desired hand.  In other words, when playing a poker variant with \"low poker\" the best hand is one that contains the lowest cards (and it can get further complicated by including or not including flushes and straights etc. from \"high hand poker\").  So while the \"majority\" of poker game variations are played \"high hand\", where the best high \"straight, flush etc.\" wins, there are poker variations where the \"worst hand\" wins, such as \"low ball, acey-deucey, high-lo split etc. game variations\".  To summarize, there can be variations that are \"high poker\", \"low poker\", and \"high low split\".  In the case of \"high low split\" the pot is divided among the best high hand and low hand.\n\nPoker has many [[List of poker variants|variations]],<ref>Richard D. Harroch, Lou Krieger. ''Poker for Dummies''. John Wiley & Sons, 2010</ref><ref>Reuben, Stewart 2001. ''Starting out in Poker''. London: Everyman/Mind Sports. {{ISBN|1-85744-272-5}}</ref> all following a similar pattern of play<ref>[[David Sklansky|Sklansky, David]]. ''The Theory of Poker''. Two Plus Two Pub, 1999.</ref> and generally using the same hand ranking hierarchy. There are four main families of variants, largely grouped by the protocol of card-dealing and betting:\n\n;Straight: A complete hand is dealt to each player, and players bet in one round, with raising and re-raising allowed. This is the oldest poker family; the root of the game as now played was a game known as [[Primero]], which evolved into the game [[three-card brag]], a very popular gentleman's game around the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and still enjoyed in the U.K. today. ''Straight'' hands of five cards are sometimes used as a final showdown, but poker is almost always played in a more complex form to allow for additional strategy.\n;[[Stud poker]]: Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face-down and face-up rounds, or ''streets'', with a round of betting following each. This is the next-oldest family; as poker progressed from three to five-card hands, they were often dealt one card at a time, either face-down or face-up, with a betting round between each. The most popular stud variant today, [[seven-card stud]], deals two extra cards to each player (three face-down, four face-up) from which they must make the best possible 5-card hand.\n;[[Draw poker]]: A complete hand is dealt to each player, face-down, and after betting, players are allowed to attempt to change their hand (with the object of improving it) by discarding unwanted cards and being dealt new ones. [[Five-card draw]] is the most famous variation in this family.\n;[[Community card poker]]: Also known as \"flop poker\", community card poker is a variation of stud poker.  Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt to the center of the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5-card hand. [[Texas hold 'em]] and [[Omaha hold 'em|Omaha]] are two well-known variants of the community card family.\n\nThere are several methods for defining the structure of betting during a hand of poker. The three most common structures are known as \"fixed-limit\", \"pot-limit\", and \"no-limit\". In fixed-limit poker, betting and raising must be done by standardized amounts. For instance, if the required bet is X, an initial bettor may only bet X; if a player wishes to raise a bet, they may only raise by X. In pot-limit poker, a player may bet or raise any amount up to the size of the pot. When calculating the maximum raise allowed, all previous bets and calls, including the intending raiser's call, are first added to the pot. The raiser may then raise the previous bet by the full amount of the pot. In no-limit poker, a player may wager their entire betting stack at any point that they are allowed to make a bet. In all games, if a player does not have enough betting chips to fully match a bet, they may go \"all-in\", allowing them to show down their hand for the amount of chips they have remaining.\n\nOther games that use poker hand rankings may likewise be referred to as ''poker''. [[Video poker]] is a [[single-player video game]] that functions much like a [[slot machine]]; most video poker machines play draw poker, where the player bets, a hand is dealt, and the player can discard and replace cards. Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player's initial bet.\n\n[[Strip poker]] is a traditional poker variation where players remove clothing when they lose bets. Since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds, strip poker can be played with any form of poker; however, it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds, like five card draw.\n\nAnother game with the ''poker'' name, but with a vastly different mode of play, is called ''[[Acey Deucey (card game)|Acey-Deucey]]'' or ''[[Red dog poker|Red Dog]]'' poker. This game is more similar to [[Blackjack]] in its layout and betting; each player bets against the house, and then is dealt two cards. For the player to win, the third card dealt (after an opportunity to raise the bet) must have a value in-between the first two. Payout is based on the odds that this is possible, based on the difference in values of the first two cards. Other poker-like games played at casinos against the house include [[three card poker]] and [[pai gow poker]].\n\n==Computer programs==\nA variety of [[computer poker player]]s have been developed by researchers at the [[University of Alberta]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and the [[University of Auckland]] amongst others.\n\nIn a January 2015 article<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1259433 |pmid=25574016 |title=Heads-up limit hold'em poker is solved |journal=Science |volume=347 |issue=6218 |pages=145\u2013149  |year=2015 |last1=Bowling |first1=M. |last2=Burch |first2=N. |last3=Johanson |first3=M. |last4=Tammelin |first4=O.|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Ebowling/papers/15science.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.697.72 }}</ref> published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', a group of researchers mostly from the [[University of Alberta]] announced that they \"essentially weakly solved\" [[Heads up poker|heads-up]] limit ''Texas Hold 'em'' with their development of their [[Cepheus (poker bot)|Cepheus poker bot]].

Truman.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A game of [[Texas hold 'em]] in progress. \"Hold 'em\" is a popular form of poker.]]\n\n'''Poker''' is any of a number of [[card game]]s in which [[Card player|players]] [[betting (poker)|wager]] over which [[poker hand|hand]] is best according to that specific game's rules in ways similar [[List of poker hands|to these rankings]]. Often using a [[Standard 52-card deck|standard deck]], poker games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number [[Poker dealer|dealt]] face up or face down, and the number [[Community card poker|shared by all players]], but all have rules which involve one or more rounds of betting.\n\nIn most modern poker games the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the ''[[blind (poker)|blind]]'' or ''ante''). In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players. The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match (or \"call\") the maximum previous bet, or [[betting (poker)#Fold|fold]], losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand. A player who matches a bet may also \"raise\" (increase) the bet. The betting round ends when all players have either called the last bet or folded. If all but one player folds on any round, the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand. If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round, a [[showdown (poker)|showdown]] takes place where the hands are revealed, and the player with the winning hand takes the pot.\n\nWith the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive [[expected value]] or who is trying to [[Bluff (poker)|bluff]] other players for various strategic reasons. Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of [[probability]], [[psychology]], and [[game theory]].\n\nPoker has increased in popularity since the beginning of the 20th century and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely popular activity, both for participants and spectators, including online, with many professional players and multimillion-dollar tournament prizes.\n\n==History==\n{{summarize|from|better=y|History of poker|date=April 2018}}\n{{Main|History of poker}}\nPoker was developed sometime during the early 19th century in the United States. Since those early beginnings, the game has grown to become an extremely popular pastime worldwide.\n\nIn the 1937 edition of Foster's Complete [[Edmond Hoyle|Hoyle]], [[R. F. Foster (games)|R. F. Foster]] wrote: \"the game of poker, as first played in the United States, five cards to each player from a twenty-card pack, is undoubtedly the Persian game of [[As-Nas]].\" By the 1990s some gaming historians including [[David Parlett]] started to challenge the notion that poker is a direct derivative of As-Nas. Developments in the 1970s led to poker becoming far more popular than it was before. Modern [[Poker tournament|tournament]] play became popular in American casinos after the [[World Series of Poker]] began, in 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaming.unlv.edu/WSOP/history.html|title=World Series of Poker Retrospective: Horseshoe History|website=gaming.unlv.edu|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Poker on television]] increased the popularity of the game during the turn of the [[millennium]]. This resulted in the [[poker boom]] few years later between 2003-2006.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Imageframe|width=300|caption=Examples of top poker hand categories|align=right|content=\n[[List of poker hand categories#Straight flush|Straight flush]]<br /><!--\n-->{{card|club|J|60px}}{{card|club|10|60px}}{{card|club|9|60px}}{{card|club|8|60px}}{{card|club|7|60px}}\n----\n[[List of poker hand categories#Four of a kind|Four of a kind]]<br /><!--\n-->{{card|club|6|60px}}{{card|diamond|6|60px}}{{card|heart|6|60px}}{{card|spade|6|60px}}{{card|club|A|60px}}\n}}\n{{details|topic=betting rules|Betting in poker}}\n{{For|more details on rules for the most common poker variants|List of poker hands|List of poker variants}}\nIn casual play, the right to [[poker dealer|deal]] a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a ''[[button (poker)|dealer button]]'' (or ''buck''). In a [[casino]], a house dealer handles the [[playing card|cards]] for each hand, but the button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting. The cards are dealt clockwise around the [[poker table]], one at a time.\n\nOne or more players are usually required to make [[Betting (poker)#Forced bets|forced bets]], usually either an ''ante'' or a ''blind bet'' (sometimes both). The dealer [[shuffle]]s the cards, the player on the chair to his or her right [[cut (playing cards)|cuts]], and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time, beginning with the player to his or her left. Cards may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial deal, the first of what may be several [[betting (poker)|betting]] rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot.\n\nAt any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to ''call'' (match) the bet, and all opponents instead ''fold'', the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins. This is what makes [[bluff (poker)|bluffing]] possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker, one that distinguishes it from other vying games and from other games that make use of [[hand rankings|poker hand rankings]].\n\nAt the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a [[showdown (poker)|showdown]], in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot. A poker hand comprises five cards; in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them, only the best five-card combination counts.\n\n==Variants==\n{{Main|List of poker variants}}\n[[File:2006 WSOP Main Event Table.jpg|thumb|upright|[[2006 World Series of Poker|2006 WSOP]] Main Event table]]\n\nPoker variations are played where a \"high hand\" or a \"low hand\" may be the best desired hand.  In other words, when playing a poker variant with \"low poker\" the best hand is one that contains the lowest cards (and it can get further complicated by including or not including flushes and straights etc. from \"high hand poker\").  So while the \"majority\" of poker game variations are played \"high hand\", where the best high \"straight, flush etc.\" wins, there are poker variations where the \"worst hand\" wins, such as \"low ball, acey-deucey, high-lo split etc. game variations\".  To summarize, there can be variations that are \"high poker\", \"low poker\", and \"high low split\".  In the case of \"high low split\" the pot is divided among the best high hand and low hand.\n\nPoker has many [[List of poker variants|variations]],<ref>Richard D. Harroch, Lou Krieger. ''Poker for Dummies''. John Wiley & Sons, 2010</ref><ref>Reuben, Stewart 2001. ''Starting out in Poker''. London: Everyman/Mind Sports. {{ISBN|1-85744-272-5}}</ref> all following a similar pattern of play<ref>[[David Sklansky|Sklansky, David]]. ''The Theory of Poker''. Two Plus Two Pub, 1999.</ref> and generally using the same hand ranking hierarchy. There are four main families of variants, largely grouped by the protocol of card-dealing and betting:\n\n;Straight: A complete hand is dealt to each player, and players bet in one round, with raising and re-raising allowed. This is the oldest poker family; the root of the game as now played was a game known as [[Primero]], which evolved into the game [[three-card brag]], a very popular gentleman's game around the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and still enjoyed in the U.K. today. ''Straight'' hands of five cards are sometimes used as a final showdown, but poker is almost always played in a more complex form to allow for additional strategy.\n;[[Stud poker]]: Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face-down and face-up rounds, or ''streets'', with a round of betting following each. This is the next-oldest family; as poker progressed from three to five-card hands, they were often dealt one card at a time, either face-down or face-up, with a betting round between each. The most popular stud variant today, [[seven-card stud]], deals two extra cards to each player (three face-down, four face-up) from which they must make the best possible 5-card hand.\n;[[Draw poker]]: A complete hand is dealt to each player, face-down, and after betting, players are allowed to attempt to change their hand (with the object of improving it) by discarding unwanted cards and being dealt new ones. [[Five-card draw]] is the most famous variation in this family.\n;[[Community card poker]]: Also known as \"flop poker\", community card poker is a variation of stud poker.  Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt to the center of the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5-card hand. [[Texas hold 'em]] and [[Omaha hold 'em|Omaha]] are two well-known variants of the community card family.\n\nThere are several methods for defining the structure of betting during a hand of poker. The three most common structures are known as \"fixed-limit\", \"pot-limit\", and \"no-limit\". In fixed-limit poker, betting and raising must be done by standardized amounts. For instance, if the required bet is X, an initial bettor may only bet X; if a player wishes to raise a bet, they may only raise by X. In pot-limit poker, a player may bet or raise any amount up to the size of the pot. When calculating the maximum raise allowed, all previous bets and calls, including the intending raiser's call, are first added to the pot. The raiser may then raise the previous bet by the full amount of the pot. In no-limit poker, a player may wager their entire betting stack at any point that they are allowed to make a bet. In all games, if a player does not have enough betting chips to fully match a bet, they may go \"all-in\", allowing them to show down their hand for the amount of chips they have remaining.\n\nOther games that use poker hand rankings may likewise be referred to as ''poker''. [[Video poker]] is a [[single-player video game]] that functions much like a [[slot machine]]; most video poker machines play draw poker, where the player bets, a hand is dealt, and the player can discard and replace cards. Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player's initial bet.\n\n[[Strip poker]] is a traditional poker variation where players remove clothing when they lose bets. Since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds, strip poker can be played with any form of poker; however, it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds, like five card draw.\n\nAnother game with the ''poker'' name, but with a vastly different mode of play, is called ''[[Acey Deucey (card game)|Acey-Deucey]]'' or ''[[Red dog poker|Red Dog]]'' poker. This game is more similar to [[Blackjack]] in its layout and betting; each player bets against the house, and then is dealt two cards. For the player to win, the third card dealt (after an opportunity to raise the bet) must have a value in-between the first two. Payout is based on the odds that this is possible, based on the difference in values of the first two cards. Other poker-like games played at casinos against the house include [[three card poker]] and [[pai gow poker]].\n\n==Computer programs==\nA variety of [[computer poker player]]s have been developed by researchers at the [[University of Alberta]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and the [[University of Auckland]] amongst others.\n\nIn a January 2015 article<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1259433 |pmid=25574016 |title=Heads-up limit hold'em poker is solved |journal=Science |volume=347 |issue=6218 |pages=145\u2013149  |year=2015 |last1=Bowling |first1=M. |last2=Burch |first2=N. |last3=Johanson |first3=M. |last4=Tammelin |first4=O.|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Ebowling/papers/15science.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.697.72 }}</ref> published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', a group of researchers mostly from the [[University of Alberta]] announced that they \"essentially weakly solved\" [[Heads up poker|heads-up]] limit ''Texas Hold 'em'' with their development of their [[Cepheus (poker bot)|Cepheus poker bot]].

The ground also holds conference and banqueting suites, the ''Black Cats Bar'', and a club shop selling Sunderland merchandise.\n\n==Planning and construction==\nFollowing the release of the [[Taylor Report]] in January 1990, Sunderland was obliged to make plans to turn their [[Roker Park]] home into an all-seater stadium.<ref name=\"roker\">Days, pp297-298.</ref> Roker Park was a ground that mainly consisted of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held far fewer spectators than before.<ref name=\"roker\" /> Enclosed by residential streets on all sides, expansion was practically impossible. So, by 1991, Sunderland chairman [[Bob Murray (businessman)|Bob Murray]] had started to scour the local area for possible sites to build a new all-seater stadium.<ref name=\"roker\" />\n\nThe front-runner that emerged was a proposed stadium located on an area of land adjacent to the [[Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd|Nissan car plant]].<ref name=\"possiblestadium\">Days, pp299-300</ref> The 49,000 all-seater ground was labelled \"the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] of the North\" by Sunderland fans and would boast a capacity that not even [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United's]] [[Old Trafford]] exceeded until 1996.<ref name=\"possiblestadium\" /> The plans did not come to fruition. Shortly after the plans were announced in 1992, [[Nissan]] launched an official objection, ultimately forcing Sunderland to abandon the idea.<ref name=\"possiblestadium\" /> By 1995, the site of the [[Wearmouth Colliery]], which had closed in December 1993, was identified as the club's preferred location for a new stadium.<ref name=\"possiblestadium\" /> The area, on the north bank of the [[River Wear]] in the Sheepfolds district of Sunderland, was only a few hundred yards from Roker Park, and close to the centre of the city.\n[[File:Stadium of Light - geograph.org.uk - 1493764.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the West Stand]]\nIn 1993, Sunderland's planned new stadium was on the shortlist for [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] venues, as England had been named as hosts of the competition in May 1992. However, it soon become clear that a new stadium in Sunderland would not be ready in time for the tournament.\n\nOn 13 November 1995, the Sunderland chairman Bob Murray announced that the [[Tyne and Wear Development Corporation]] had approved plans for Sunderland to build a 34,000-seater stadium on the Monkwearmouth site.<ref name=\"p301\">Days, p301</ref>\nBallast Wiltshier plc, a contracting company that had built the [[Amsterdam Arena]], was contracted to build the stadium at an initial cost of \u00a315&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"p301\" /> In June 1996, as the planned capacity rose to more than 40,000, construction work began.<ref name=\"p301\" /> The capacity was revised again in early 1997, and the stadium was completed on time, with a capacity of 42,000.<ref name=\"p301\" /> The stadium's design allows possible expansion of a further tier; completed expansion of the whole upper tier would produce a capacity of 63,000, although it is believed by some that the stadium can expand to a maximum capacity of 84,000, this would seem unlikely ever to be exercised.<ref name=\"p300\" />\n[[File:Sunderland AFC's Stadium of Light - geograph.org.uk - 1697188.jpg|left|thumb|Game being played at the Stadium of Light]]\nThe stadium was opened on 30 July 1997 by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], with bands such as [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], [[Upside Down (boyband)|Upside Down]] and [[Kavana (singer)|Kavana]] playing.

Shortly after the plans were announced in 1992, [[Nissan]] launched an official objection, ultimately forcing Sunderland to abandon the idea.<ref name=\"possiblestadium\" /> By 1995, the site of the [[Wearmouth Colliery]], which had closed in December 1993, was identified as the club's preferred location for a new stadium.<ref name=\"possiblestadium\" /> The area, on the north bank of the [[River Wear]] in the Sheepfolds district of Sunderland, was only a few hundred yards from Roker Park, and close to the centre of the city.\n[[File:Stadium of Light - geograph.org.uk - 1493764.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the West Stand]]\nIn 1993, Sunderland's planned new stadium was on the shortlist for [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] venues, as England had been named as hosts of the competition in May 1992. However, it soon become clear that a new stadium in Sunderland would not be ready in time for the tournament.\n\nOn 13 November 1995, the Sunderland chairman Bob Murray announced that the [[Tyne and Wear Development Corporation]] had approved plans for Sunderland to build a 34,000-seater stadium on the Monkwearmouth site.<ref name=\"p301\">Days, p301</ref>\nBallast Wiltshier plc, a contracting company that had built the [[Amsterdam Arena]], was contracted to build the stadium at an initial cost of \u00a315&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"p301\" /> In June 1996, as the planned capacity rose to more than 40,000, construction work began.<ref name=\"p301\" /> The capacity was revised again in early 1997, and the stadium was completed on time, with a capacity of 42,000.<ref name=\"p301\" /> The stadium's design allows possible expansion of a further tier; completed expansion of the whole upper tier would produce a capacity of 63,000, although it is believed by some that the stadium can expand to a maximum capacity of 84,000, this would seem unlikely ever to be exercised.<ref name=\"p300\" />\n[[File:Sunderland AFC's Stadium of Light - geograph.org.uk - 1697188.jpg|left|thumb|Game being played at the Stadium of Light]]\nThe stadium was opened on 30 July 1997 by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], with bands such as [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], [[Upside Down (boyband)|Upside Down]] and [[Kavana (singer)|Kavana]] playing.

It\u2019s like, say, Elland Road or Old Trafford. We are the only club whose stadium has that name, and it was because of the history of the region that I named it''. <ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>In the same interview, Murray revealed that shortly after the stadium opened he was approached by a representative of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government asking if he would consider renaming the stadium after [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], who died in September 1997.<ref name=\":0\" /> Murray refused the request as he believed the stadium should be named in honour of those in the region who had worked in darkness.\n\nThe 'Of Light' suffix became a recognisable part of the Sunderland A.F.C. brand, and was used in a number of other areas related to the club; the [[Academy of Light]] is the club's training facility and youth academy, the [[Foundation of Light]] is a [[registered Charity|registered charity]] affiliated with the club and the [[Beacon of Light]] is a sports and education centre, owned by the Foundation, which is adjacent to the stadium. The club's official magazine was called ''Legion of Light'' before it was discontinued in January 2017.\n\nIn March 2010, Sunderland Chairman [[Niall Quinn]] announced the club were considering plans to sell naming rights to the stadium as a new way to boost income.<ref name=\":1\" /> The plans were shelved shortly after.
