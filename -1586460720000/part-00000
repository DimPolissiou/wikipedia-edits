The site is located at Doonside Road, [[Doonside, New South Wales|Doonside]], [[City of Blacktown]], [[Sydney]] [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 8 December 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1428>{{cite NSW SHR|5051257|Bungarribee Homestead Complex - Archaeological Site|hr=01428|fn=EF14/4405; 09/2307; H00/167|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe land on which the Bungarribee Homestead house site and farm estate are located was originally occupied by the people of the Warrawarry group of the [[Darug]] people. They were based around Eastern Creek and the surrounding forest and grassland and used these for food and shelter, hunting and gathering a wide array of animal and plant foods including fresh water fish, crayfish and shellfish.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nA close examination of the documentation of [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]]'s first exploration of [[Parramatta]]'s western hinterland in April 1788 reveals that the orthodox view that he went only as far as [[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect Hill]] or a lttle beyond is deeply flawed. His party is much more likely to have traversed [[Toongabbie]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]] and [[Blacktown]] to climb Bungarribee Hill, Doonside and reaching Eastern Creek and [[Rooty Hill, New South Wales|Rooty Hill]].<ref name=nswshr-1428-2244>Flynn, 1995, 9</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBy the time of European settlement in the western regions after 1790, the original Aboriginal groups had been severely affected by an outbreak of smallpox that had first devastated the groups closest to the European settlement but rapidly spread through the entire [[Sydney]] district. Many of the surviving groups in the west had likely begun to come together to form amalgamated bands in order to survive.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nOnce European settlers began to move into the west, conflicts began to occur between them and the Warrawarry. The clearing and alienation of land by Europeans and consequent reduction in native foods led to clashes between surviving Aboriginal groups and the settlers. By the late 1790s, violence was becoming a feature of the interaction between the two cultures. In 1801 [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|Governor Hunter]] ordered Aboriginals to be kept away from settlers' areas because of the perceived threat. By 1814 the population had dwindled and the survivors were forced to rely heavily on Europeans for food. A number of groups were reported camped on estates at Mamre, [[South Creek (New South Wales)|South Creek]] and Eastern Creek (it is not known if this was near Bungarribee).<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAlthough bands of Aboriginal people continued to live around the estates and growing settlements up to the 1840s, by this time there were less than 300 recorded Darug people left, 10% of the 1788 population.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2245>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007b, 5</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nFor many years \"Bungarribee\" was thought to mean \"the burial place of a king\" and was derived from the name of an Aboriginal man named \"[[Bungaree]]\" (also spelt Bungaroo, Boongaree). Bungaree reputedly died in the vicinity of Bungarribee. King Bungaree was a Guringai man who lived to the north of Sydney in the [[Broken Bay]] area. He was well known around Sydney, particularly for the role he played in key voyages of both [[Matthew Flinders]] and [[Phillip Gidley King]] during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was the first Aboriginal man to be presented with a breastplate by [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]], in 1815 (engraved with 'Boongaree Chief of the Broken Bay Tribe, 1815'). According to Philip Clarke, Bungaree died in 1830 and is buried in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]]. It is now thought that the name \"Bungarribee\" is derived from joining together two Darug words which in combination can be translated as \"creek with cockatoos\" or \"creek with campsite\". Neither Bungarribee or Bell's creeks are permanent water sources so this interpretation of the name appears plausible.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2246>Godden Mackay Logan, 2009b, 7</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe site of (the later Bungarribee farm estate) was within the larger site of the [[Government Depot Site, Rooty Hill|Rooty Hill Government Farm]], an area of 38,728 acres (387.28ha) (Godden Mackay Logan, 2009b, 7 says the area was 17,000 acres). This had been established by [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]] from 1802 as a means to ensure ongoing supply of good pasture for Government herds, as well as land for cultivation of crops and produce. King saw the farms (there were four large farm sites in the Sydney area in total) also as a way to keep the fledgling colonial economy out of the exclusive hands of profiteers and market manipulators.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe farm runs were left largely unaltered from their natural state, save for an overseer's hut and scattered huts for convict shepherds and labourers, as well as stockyards and fences to enclose grazing areas. At Rooty Hill much of the development was to the north-west of the (later Bungarribee farm estate) although fencing may have been erected within its area.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBy the time of Governor Macquarie in 1810, the demands of private landholders and settlers was growing to the point that Macquarie began to subdivide lots from the Government Farms. Macquarie also believed that the worst was over for the colony in terms of food production and that the need for large Government Farms to supply the colony was no longer so pronounced.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===John Campbell===\n\nFrom {{circa}} 1815 Macquarie began to grant parcels of land from the Rooty Hill Farm to settlers, which marked the beginning of organised European agricultural activity in the area. The largest portion in the subject area was that of John Campbell's 2000 acres which he took up in {{circa|1822}}. \n\nCampbell was a retired military officer from Scotland who arrived in Australia on board the Lusitania in November 1821 (with a wife, four sons & five daughters. Campbell, accompanied by his wife and nine children and bearing a letter of introduction from the [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl of Bathurst]] (then Secretary of State<ref name=nswshr-1428-2252>Petrie, 1935</ref>) to Governor Macquarie, was intent on making his fortune by taking up land and farming. Despite being described by Broadbent (1997) as an \"unappealing man\" and an \"unconscionable self-interested sponger\", Campbell appears to have had considerable knowledge of farming and was relatively highly regarded by the colonial government at the time. Campbell's knowledge and status are reflected in his appointments as a committee member of the Agricultural Society of NSW (1822) and later \"Joint Commissioner of Crown Lands\"<ref>(Austral Archaeology, 2000)</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nCampbell's land grant was bounded by Eastern Creek in the west, in the north by the current Bungarribee Road (and its line west of Doonside Road), in the south by the [[Great Western Highway]] and in the east by the approximate line of Reservoir Road. Campbell erected a temporary residence on the high point of his land and began to clear and cultivate, with the help of 22 convict labourers.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2247>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 9</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAn 1821 Colonial Secretary's record notes authorising John Campbell to select 22 convicts, 'having 80 acres cleared at [[Prospect, New South Wales|Prospect]] under conditions of the notice of 17 November 1821. \"Until the party have hutted themselves at a central spot on your estate (he says less than one week) they are to continue drawing rations from Parramatta...\".<ref name=nswshr-1428-2248>BJ Johnson, 2000, p.3</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe 1822 Land and Stock Muster lists John Campbell as granted 2000 acres (at \"Parramatta\") with 130 acres cleared, 15 acres wheat, 5 acres barley and 2 acres potatoes. Stock are 24 cattle, 28 hogs and 1 horse. In the General Muster of 1822 he is no. A03201 with sons 3202, -03, also wife No. A3178 and 6 children 3179-3184, all \"came free\" on \"Lusitania\"..<ref name=nswshr-1428-2249>BJ Johnson, \n2000, p.4</ref> He was assigned 6 convicts for 6 months victualling from the King's Stores, and applied for 5 mechanics and 4 labourers..<ref name=nswshr-1428-2250>BJ Johnson, 2000, p.3</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAlmost immediately after Campbell received his grant he began building a homestead on that land \"suited to his status as a former officer and colonial gentleman\". The homestead and estate (a grant of 2000 acres between Prospect and Rooty Hill<ref name=nswshr-1428-2252/>) were named Bungarabee which was also the name of the creek which cut east-west through the grant. It is an Aboriginal composition, a derivation of which was briefly associated with the Black Town native school.<ref name=nswshr-1428/> He built on the western slope of Bungarribee Hill (on an elevated plateau above the 100 year flood line) in 1822. Construction work utilised [[assigned convict]] labour and was preceded by or occurred in concert with clearing sections of the natural vegetation on Campbell's land..<ref name=nswshr-1428-2253>Austral Archaeology, 2000</ref> The main portion of the house was circular, with one room on the ground floor and one above, both a full circle in shape. Thus all windows, doors and mantelpieces had to be curved, and the difficulty of properly carrying out such accurate work with the labour available must have been very great. Yet it was done, and stood for over 100 years, testimony to the skill involved.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2252/>\n\nCampbell's temporary residence was enlarged in 1825 and incorporated into his grand new home. He positioned his new house on the top of the highest hill on the property, with the main living section facing to the west, providing views to the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] in the distance. Situated on the highest point, the house was clearly visible to travellers passing along the Western Road and in time it became a landmark in the area. (Although now demolished, the site retains its landmark qualities through the Bunya pine ([[Araucaria bidwillii]]), hoop pine ([[Araucaria cunninghamii]]), Mediterranean cypress / pencil pine ([[Cupressus sempervirens]]), [[Port Jackson]] fig ([[Ficus rubiginosa]]) and peppercorn tree ([[Schinus molle]] var. areira) that remain on the site and are visible from Doonside Road and were part of the Bungarribee house garden.). As well as the house, a number of large outbuildings and farm structures were erected on the raised area, including a brick convict barracks, a large brick barn, a number of stables, blacksmith's shop, carpenter's shop and other associated buildings.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2247/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe first recorded mention of a kitchen (vegetable and fruit) garden at Bungarribee appears in a sale notice for the estate following Campbell's death, who had established the property in 1823. An auction notice for the estate in [[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] from August 1828 until its sale in September 1828 described the property as including \"a garden consisting of 8 acres with a great number and variety of young fruit trees well watered\". Of interest is the description of the trees as \"young fruit trees\", suggesting at least part of the garden was a recent addition (although at this stage none of the garden would have been over five years old). The size at 8 acres represents two types of garden likely to have been on site: the kitchen garden itself and an associated orchard. A garden of that size would be able to support the entire household, staff and convict labourers on the site. A letter in the [[Maitland Mercury|Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser]] of 23 March 1846 reported that 63 people lived at Bungarribee (during the occupancy of the East India Company). This probably represents roughly the number employed on the estate throughout the 1830s. A workforce this large goes some way to explaining why the garden would cover an area as large as 8 acres. A second sale notice from 1882 also mentions the existence of a kitchen and flower garden, vineyard and orchard, but gives no further description of plantings or size<ref name=nswshr-1428-2254>Godden Mackay Logan, 2009a, 3</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe problems encountered by Campbell during the construction of the estate were considerable. In 1824 approximately one year after beginning work on Bungarribee, Campbell was in debt to his creditors including Simon Levey and [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]].<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nCampbell was appointed a magistrate for the district, and in those days this was a real distinction. [[Thomas Brisbane|Governor Brisbane]], Macquarie's successor, on one occasion found it necessary to give some samples of the penalties inflicted by various magistrates, and he quoted one wherein Mr Campbell figured. The bench consisted of Lieutenant [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]], of Prospect ([[Veteran Hall Remains|Veteran Hall]]), Donald Macleod, and John Campbell, Esquires. Christopher Lawler, a convict employed at Rooty Hill, was the culprit, and was charged with 'having a quart tin in his possession stolen from the Huts on Mr Campbell's farm.' Lawler was sentenced to receive 25 lashes every second morning until he produced the remainder of the property stolen. This was evidently a customary sentence, as others are cited, but Lawler evidently would not or could not produce the remainder, for a note states that after receiving 100 lashes he was returned to his gang.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2255>Bertie, 1935</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn 1826 Campbell's wife died and in 1827 Campbell himself died at the age of 56. Their tragic deaths and the invention of Chief Bungaroo and other stories involving the murder of a convict and the firearm suicide of an officer in one of the bedrooms led to a proliferation of stories about the house being cursed or haunted.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Thomas Icely===\n\nBungarribee was sold to [[Thomas Icely]] in 1828 for 3652 pounds with financial assistance from John Macarthur. Icely arrived in NSW on the Surrey in 1820, and within five years had an estimated capital of over 30,000 pounds.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIcely made extensive purchases of horses, cattle and sheep, and was given a grant of land to the extent of 2560 acres in the [[Carcoar, New South Wales|Carcoar]] district. The estate which was increased by purchases, was named [[Coombing Park]] after a creek on the station. Here Icely prospered and became one of the leading pastoralists of the day.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBungarribee was used for breeding and fattening purposes. In the days before the advent of the railway, moving stock or wool was a slow and laborious business. The roads of the day were little more than tracks, and a full day's journey by bullock wagon would be covered by a truck in less than an hour now. In such circumstances such an estate as Bungarribee, adjacent to Sydney, would be of great value as an appendage to a pastoral property in the country.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2255/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIcely was owner during EJH Knapp's 1832 survey, and is listed as a horse breeder (noting that ge sold it in 1832).<ref name=nswshr-1428-2259>BJ Johnson, 2000, p.4</ref> The large stables shown by Knapp in 1832 may have been built by Icely, who was a noted horse breeder. The 1828 Muster showed Icely had 14,770 acres, including 1230 cleared and 138 cultivated. He had 65 horses, 1450 cattle and 7500 sheep (compared to John Campbell's record in the 1822 Muster of having only one horse but 24 cattle and 28 hogs).<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe 1832 Knapp survey of Eastern Creek and north boundaries of the 2000 acres of property transferred from Campbell to Icely. This showed in some detail the house, outbuildings (stables, dairy and barracks?), also extensive formal gardens covering 120 x 100 meters.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2260\">BJ Johnson, 2000, p.6</ref> Knapp was government surveyor. His plan is the only known plan that shows the outline and dimensions of the kitchen garden and positions it in relation to the house. The plan shows a rectangular garden divided internally into 16 individual beds with what appear to be paths running in a grid pattern through it. Around the perimeter appears a border, which may also represent border plantings. A central path running north-south has three circular features with smaller garden beds in the centre. This plan is similar to ideas for kitchen garden planting being put forward by the likes of Thomas Shepherd (Sydney's first commercial nurseryman and garden designer) and Scottish/English writer [[John Claudius Loudon]] at this time, although it is further from the house than they recommended. This is probably due to the site's topography, with the house and associated outbuildings built on a raised, relatively narrow portion of the site while the garden was located to the northwest, on a flat adjacent to one of the creeks that ran through the estate.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2254/> The garden is shown in a number of other media (sic), most notably two paintings of the estate during the ownership of the East India Company. Of these, it is most clearly shown in T.Rider's painting of the site c.1850 which (looking to the homestead group across the estate), shows the garden enclosed by a timber railing fence, separated from the house by a large paddock.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2261\">Godden Mackay Logan, 2009a, 4</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Charles Smith===\n\nCharles Smith, a thoroughbred horse breeder, resided at Bungarribee from 1832-40.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2262>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007, 10</ref>\nA tenant during Charles Smith's ownership was Mr Henry Herman Kater (1840-41), who arrived in NSW in 1839 on the \"Euphrates\", which he had chartered and loaded with horses and cattle. He was a Cambridge graduate, and had acted as one of the Earl of Marshal's Gold Staff Officers at [[Queen Victoria]]'s coronation. He bought Bungarribee soon after arrival, and pastured his valuable livestock there. Amongst the horses were Capapie, Tross, Cantab, Paraquay, The Giggler and Georgiana, from which descended many of the finest racehorses in Australia. Kater decided to specialise in horse breeding, and sold his cattle to Mr William Suttor of Bathurst, thus helping to form the celebrated herd built up by Suttor.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2255/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn 1840 Kater brought his bride to Bungarribee, Eliza Charlotte Darvall, daughter of Major Edward Darvall, and on 20 September 1841 a son was born, named [[Henry Kater (politician)|Henry Edward]]. Kater Jr became a well known pastoralist, and was appointed a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], and died in 1924.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2255\" /><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn late 1841 Kater departed Bungarribee, and Smith leased the property to Joseph Armstrong. He came from the strata of society where families are not discussed, and any imprints he had did not come from a University. Nevertheless Smith was a remarkable man, wealthy, and a great sportsman. He was described as 'one of the greatest promoters of horses breeding, a sporting butcher, who carries on his trade in a large plot of land where Kidman's and Lassetter's stores are (George, Market & York Streets), but taking in the whole square into [[York Street, Sydney|York Street]]. Smith was an eminent horse breeder and was a frequent winner. He had a stud farm at Bungarribee, and an establishment at [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]]. He owned more blood stock of the highest type than any other breeder at the one time'. Smith died in 1845, and Bungarribee passed into the occupation of agents of the East India Company, who used it as a depot for horses intended for remounts in India.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2255\" /><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===East India Company and various late twentieth century owners===\n\nThe property was occupied by the East India Company between {{circa|1843}}-6) and from 1846-51 by [[Benjamin Boyd]], prominent colonial merchant and entrepreneur. Boyd used its convict barracks for a period as accommodation for South Pacific ([[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanaka]]) labour he had working on his properties.<ref>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007, 10</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIt then passed through a number of tenants, one being Captains Dallas and Apperley, who used the property as an assembly depot and \"rest station\" for horses purchased in NSW as remounts for the British army in India. After the East India Company there seems to have been a return to horse breeding, cattle grazing, agriculture and dairying.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2253/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAn 1846 record (Lt. Col. Godfrey C Mundy), notes Bungarabee (sic) as the H.E.I (East India) Company stud establishment (just on the eve of abolition)...and consisting of an excellent dwelling house and offices, stables permanent and temporary for several hundred horses, with some fine open paddocks around them...'.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2265>BJ Johnson, 2000, p.5</ref> Other records imply that Icely and Kater both used the horse stud from which the East India Company exported late in the 1840s.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2266\">BJ Johnson, 2000, p.6</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nJ.K.Cleeve bred and raced horses.<ref>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 10</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428-2267>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 10</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBungarribee House itself eventually passed into the hands of a Thomas Cleaver and during WWII the American Air force built a sealed runway on the property which was used as an emergency training ground.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe modification and change in function of some structures appears to have been a feature of the second half of the nineteenth century.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nA 1935 article described Bungarribee as 'with its burden of a century's life, standing like a battered old man, calmly awaiting the call that will write \"finis\" in its history.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2255\" /><ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\n===Commonwealth and military ownership===\n\nIn {{circa}} 1941, the Bungarribee estate, excluding the house, as well as properties adjoining the estate, was resumed by the Commonwealth for use by the military. The house and land to the east of Eastern Creek (which bisects the property north-south) remained in the possession of the last private owner of the site, Thomas Cleaver. The military's interest in the site was for the construction of an airfield to serve as the training site and as an overshoot runway for the nearby [[RAAF Station Schofields]] airbase. A runway was constructed of compressed gravel with aircraft hides and taxi ways to the south. The runway extended on the southern side of Bungarribee Creek, in a south-westerly direction from close to the junction of Eastern and Bungarribee Creeks, crossing Doonside Road and ending near McCormack Street ([[Arndell Park, New South Wales|Arndell Park]]), approximately 1.8km in length. Following the war's end, the estate remained in Commonwealth ownership, with the Cleaver family continuing to run dairy cattle on the northern portion.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2269>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 10</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn 1949, the Historic Buildings Committee of the [[Australian Institute of Architects|Royal Australian Institute of Architects]] recommended that the house should be immediately \"restored\" in recognition of its significance.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nA 1951 aerial photo shows the house and stables in accordance with Knapp's record, but later smaller buildings as well. Some trees on this photo still exist.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2259/> Walter's letter (Appendix V) may relate to some outbuildings of 1913, standing in 1951). The same photo also shows the full extent of the American 1942 runway of 1500 metres sealed length. On inspection much of the sealed pavement has been broken, but it is an interesting residual artifact.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2270>BJ Johnson, p.3</ref>\n\n===Overseas Telecommunications Commission ownership and demolition===\n\nThe [[Overseas Telecommunications Commission]] acquired the site, though Godden Mackay Logan note it as 1949, and one local map has a notation \"Commonwealth Gazette\", 13 October 1949 re resumption of site. The OTC developed it for a new international transmitting communications station. This work, including the construction of staff housing, had no bearing on the demolition of the house in 1957 or surviving outbuildings in the early 1970s. The house with the exception of the barn and meat house was demolished in 1957.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBy this time it had been unoccupied for a number of years and was deemed beyond repair. Despite some local opposition and a campaign by the fledgling National Trust for its retention and restoration, it was demolished. The only structure to survive was the two-storey brick barn, which OTC used for storage.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2271>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 11</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nJohn Lawson, a member of the local historical society had offered to restore the house at his own expense, only to be turned down by OTC. Lawson was required to level the site, not grade the foundations. As such, partial remains survive. The most undisturbed of these are the kitchen and servants' wing. To the south of the barracks and barn sites, OTC built staff housing during the mid 1950s, behind the site of the barn along Doonside Road along the Bungarribee driveway. At the intersection of Doonside and Douglas Roads, the remains of these and the garden plantings can still be seen today.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2272>Austral Archaeology 2000, modified Moore, 2006</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBy the 1990s, telecommunication technology had surpassed the need for radio transmitting and the OTC site was closed. The station buildings and aerial masts had been removed by 2001.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2271/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n[[File:Bungarribee Homestead footings.jpg|thumb|Footings of the homestead, 2016]]\nArchaeological test excavations were undertaken in June 2000. The removal of the top layer of grass and vegetation revealed the remaining homestead walls, floor surfaces and footings. The wall foundations and verandah footings have a maximum dimension of 38m along the east-west axis and 22.5m along the north-south axis. As described in the historic records the homestead featured \"a two-storied, circular conical roofed tower with two single storey verandah wings radiating from it - an L shaped house with a drum at the junction of the two arms. The exposure of the homestead footprint clearly revealed the \"drum\" of the building and the two wings which radiated in a west to east and north to south direction respectively. Clearly evident around the drum and two wings of the homestead is the sandstone alignment for the verandah.

The development of the OTC site involved the building of a modern 2 storey transmitting station to the south of Bungarribee Creek and erection of a series of aerials across the entire land holding for transmitting radio signals. The new OTC station was accessed via the Great Western Highway, west of Doonside Road. It was officially opened by the [[Postmaster-General of New South Wales|Postmaster-General]] in February 1957. To the north of Bungarribee house site, on Doonside Road, an area was also developed for staff housing, with a curving access road, street plantings and dwelling houses. The housing was designed by prominent architectural firm Hennessy, Hennessy & Co. which OTC commissioned for the housing and the transmitting station (as well as the Receiving Station and accompanying accommodation at [[Bringelly, New South Wales|Bringelly]]).<ref name=nswshr-1428-2275>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 10-11</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Recent developments===\n\nc.2005 aerial photographs of the property in context show the OTC staff housing has been removed, while its layout and tree plantings survive.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2276>Read, S., pers.comm/file, 7 February 2006</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn September 2015 Environment Minister [[Mark Speakman]] announced approval of the lease of a 16.5-ha site for a new zoo on land adjoining Bungarribee's picnic area and playground. The new zoo - subsequently known as the [[Sydney Zoo]] - was due to open in late 2017 and attract about 745,000 visitors a year. It was subsequently delayed until early 2019.<ref>Media release, 7/9/15</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sydneyzoo.com/ | title=Sydney Zoo | accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn March 2017 [[Western Sydney Parklands]]' $15 million Bungarribee Park was opened, making it the largest recreational space in [[Western Sydney]] since the construction of [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]]'s [[Bicentennial Park, Homebush Bay|Bicentennial Park]]. It provided for the wetland around Bungarribee and Eastern creeks to be protected, with 20 hectares of native wildflower and thousands of native trees will be planted to restore the [[Cumberland Plain]].<ref name=nswshr-1428-2277>OEH website, 22 March 2017</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\n* 1821 50 acres cleared at Prospect\n* 1822 2000 acres (at \"Parramatta\") with 130 acres cleared, 15 acres wheat, 5 acres barley and 2 acres potatoes.

The Eastern Boundary of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is Doonside Road at Douglas Road and the heritage curtilage extends for an area approximately 2.6 by 1.6 km. It is part of an original grant of 2000 acres received by John Campbell on 30 June 1823. The grant was bounded on the north by a line bearing east 180 chains 50 links commencing at Eastern Creek, on the east side by a line bearing south 150 chains to the Great Western Road, on the south by that road and on the west by Eastern Creek.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2278>Austral Archaeology 2000</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe archaeological potential of the site was reported as extremely high as at 10 July 2000, as the site consists of the rare, largely intact footings of an 1820s homestead including main house, outbuilding, barracks and original garden plantings.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe archaeological footprint of the complex is largely intact. It is expected to contain some occupation deposits relating to all phases of occupation on the site. The original vegetation (including large plantings) is largely intact.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Garden and grounds===\nAbove ground are remnants of the former garden of Bungarribee estate, with landmark mature coniferous trees including Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pine (A.cunninghamii), Mediterranean cypress or pencil pine, (Cupressus sempervirens), Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa), Himalayan blue pine (Pinus wallichiana) and peppercorn tree (Schinus molle var. areira) and boxthorn, (Lycium ferocissimum) indicating the location of the former homestead garden and possible former farm hedging on the site. An 1832 Knapp survey showed a square 8 acre formal kitchen garden north-west of the homestead site and other records note an orchard area from the time of the Campbells and into the 1830s<ref name=nswshr-1428-2279>Stuart Read, from 6/2000 photograph in Britton & Morris, 2000</ref><ref>other site photographs</ref><ref>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007b</ref><ref>Landcom, 2013</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Homestead(s)===\nCampbell built a temporary dwelling on the property in c.1822, prior to building the main house, which was started by 1825. The temporary residence was later incorporated into the main dwelling as the servants' quarters.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2280>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007b,6</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe main house featured a two-storey, circular conical roofed tower with two single story verandah wings radiating from it in an L shape. Historical accounts note that the walls of the two storey circular section were solid and constructed of soft red sandstock bricks from Parramatta/Prospect. The one storey walls of the radiating wings and the internal walls were of half timber \u2013 post and rail \u2013 with sandstock bricks forming the infill panels of the walls. Window and door openings throughout the house were spanned by timber [[Lintel (architecture)|lintels]] and the solid brick portions of the house also featured decorative flat and semi-circular brick arches. Vertical lathes were nailed to the rails on the external walls which were ultimately finished in white washed stucco. The roof structure and floors were built of adzed and pit sawn timber joined with handmade iron nails and the roof itself was covered with shingles. The open colonnaded [[Veranda|verandahs]] and halls features [[sandstone]] flagging and the building boasted a substantial cellar.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281>Austral Archaeology: June 2000</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe main portion of the house was circular, with one room on the ground floor and one above, both a full circle in shape. Thus all windows, doors and mantelpieces had to be curved, and the difficulty of properly carrying out such accurate work with the labour available must have been very great..., testimony to the skill involved.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2252/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe main ground floor living rooms featured glazed [[French doors]], opening onto the verandah. The house had 5 bedrooms on the ground floor and one in the first floor tower. It also featured formal living and dining rooms, a withdrawing room for the gentlemen, servants' quarters (in the original family cottage which was incorporated into the rear of the house) and a cellar underneath the main house accessed via an internal pantry. Later reports indicated that the cellar may have had a passage running from it towards the Bungarribee Creek and that a large underground tank or cistern was located to the rear of the main house. The house was built in the Picturesque style, which had been made popular in England by the architect John Nash in the early 19th century and had begun to appear in colonial design from the 1820s. In NSW this style never gained much attention, with more examples in Tasmania than the mainland. Bungarribee house was its most recognisable expression in New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2282>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007b, 6-7</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Outbuildings===\nAs well as the house, a number of large outbuildings and farm structures were erected on the raised area, including a brick convict barracks, a large brick barn, a number of stables, blacksmith's shop, carpenter's shop and other associated buildings.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2247/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe barn, which appears to have been huge, was located to the east of the house and was a solid brick building built from clay stocks interlaced with hard-burnt shale bricks laid in a [[Brickwork|Flemish bond]].  The roof of the barn featured \"tusk and tenon\" joinery which allowed nails to be used sparingly. The men's quarters may also have been built of the same bricks and were described as being behind the barn, having brick floors with lofts above where the servants used to sleep.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2283\">Austral Archaeology June 2000</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\nThe modification and change in function of some structures appears to have been a feature of the second half of the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\nOTC acquired the site to develop a communications station in 1950. OTC built staff housing there during the 1950s, the remains of which can still be seen on site today along with their garden plantings.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\nArchaeological test excavations were undertaken in June 2000. The removal of the top layer of grass and vegetation revealed the remaining homestead walls, floor surfaces and footings. The wall [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] and verandah footings have a maximum dimension of 38m along the east-west axis and 22.5m along the north-south axis. As described in the historic records, the homestead featured \"a two-storeyed, circular conical roofed tower with two single storey verandah wings radiating from it - an L shaped house with a drum at the junction of the two arms.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\nThe exposure of the homestead footprint clearly revealed the \"drum\" of the building and the two wings which radiated in a west to east and north to south direction respectively. Clearly evident around the drum and two wings of the homestead is the sandstone alignment for the verandah. Also revealed are the servants' area (which appears to include the base of a kitchen fireplace/wood stove) and a cement or line washed brick floor (which may have been part of the laundry or scullery area. The stone cobbled flooring of an early outbuilding (whitewashed building with half-storey, west of the barn - ref. J. Fowles 1858) and the convict barracks to the rear of the house were also located. In addition to structural remains there was cultural material lying on the surface including glass and ceramic fragments and other European domestic artefacts. (These items were stated to be bagged and removed during the dig).<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nLocations for the cellars, large enclosed stockyards, piggery, store, ham house, stable, carpenter and blacksmiths' shop, and tennis court have not yet been found, although it is expected given the high level of preservation in the main house that remains of these structures will also be present.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/>\n\nThe site is affected by contaminated soils. There are elevated lead levels and some asbestos present although the majority of the asbestos was removed during site remediation works in 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe [[Bungarribee Homestead]] complex represents a rare, intact footprint of a very early farmstead including a main house, outbuildings and plantings. The remains, as defined by the heritage curtilage are considered to have State significance based on their historic, aesthetic, social and technical/research values.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe homestead has a strong association with settler John Campbell who arrived in the colony in 1821 seeking to increase his fortunes. Bungarribee is a reflection of the ambition of Campbell, but also of other settlers who desired a new and prosperous life. The homestead is architecturally and aesthetically significant and contributed to the influence of the \"cottage ornee\" style in the colony.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2290>Broadbent 1997:145</ref> The homestead was also an important reminder of the social status of its owners with its \"Italianate tower seen across paddocks from the Western Road,... as important an architectural landmark in the colony as Mrs Macquarie's Gothic forts on [[Sydney Harbour]]\".<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAs a cultural resource, this complex is highly significant for the potential to yield information regarding the evolving pastoral and economic activities of an early homestead in the western region of Sydney. It has the potential to yield information regarding the initial construction and occupation of the homestead, the barracks, barn and other outbuildings. This resource has the potential to provide information relating to the domestic conditions and social status of early settlers, and the working life and conditions of domestic and farm assistants employed on this estate.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBungarribee Homestead archaeological site was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 8 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe historic value of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is considered to be high.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe Bungarribee Homestead Complex has the potential to contain further substantial sub-surface cultural resources that would contribute to our current understanding of the evolving cultural history of NSW. The site has the potential to contribute information regarding the early pastoral movement and settlement into western Sydney. Specifically, the homestead complex has strong associations with John Campbell a retired military officer who arrived in the colony from Scotland in 1821. It is understood that Campbell arrived in the colony with his wife, nine children and a letter of introduction from the Earl of Bathurst to Governor Macquarie.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2291>Austral May 2000</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nLike many early settlers, Campbell arrived in the colony with the intention of increasing his fortune. The Bungarribee estate is a reflection of his and future owners' ambitions and ideals. Campbell found himself in financial difficulties which threatened his ownership of Bungarribee, however due to his associations with John Macarthur, he was able to ease himself from this situation. Although Campbell died in 1827 he \"left behind one of the most charming houses built in early Colonial NSW\".<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2290\"/> The style of the homestead is described as \"subtly Italianate\" and its character \"unashamedly picturesque\".<ref name=nswshr-1428-2290/><ref name=nswshr-1428-2283/><ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2292\">Broadbent, 1997</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe aesthetic value of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is considered to be High.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe Bungarribee Homestead Complex is significant for it sensory and architectural appeal. This appeal would undoubtedly have been evident to the historic occupants of the homestead, as it is to the present day visitor. The homestead was designed to have a panoramic view of the surrounding rural landscape. The drawing room verandah windows would have provided a western horizon highlighting the Blue Mountains. The design of the circular room or drum of the main homestead building would not only have been a feature of the home, but would also have provided and architectural feature that showcased the panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. The design of the Bungarribee verandah can also be considered to be significant in its influence of future designs of homesteads in the colony and in the establishment of the style of the \"cottage orne\".<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBroadbent describes Bungarribee as a \"delightful, sensitive and eccentric adaption of the vernacular bungalow form\" and is significant in its reflection of the desire of early settlers to tame the wild landscape with designs inspired and filtered down from the \"vernacular architecture of the Italian campagna\".<ref name=nswshr-1428-2290/> This is reflected in the location of the homestead on an elevated flat above the surrounding floodplain of Bungarribee and Eastern Creeks, which would have provided a serene and fertile setting for the early occupants of Bungarribee. The remnant historic pines also provide a reminder of the early European influence on the environmental landscape.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe social value of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is considered to be moderate to high.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nPrior to its demolition, the Bungarribee homestead was a significant landmark in the Doonside/Rooty Hill area. The site today provides many locals with a poignant reminder of the early settlement of this region of Sydney. Many locals today have childhood recollections of stories told to them by family and friends regarding the Bungarribee homestead with its grand verandah, and the large barn that once stood to the east of the home. Historically, the homestead and its pastoral activities would have provided employment as well as an economic base for the local Doonside/ Rooty Hill region.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe technical/research value of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is considered to be high.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe Complex has the potential to yield significant information about the evolving agricultural and pastoral activities of an early homestead in the western region of Sydney. It has the potential to yield information relating to the initial construction and occupation of the homestead, as well as the barracks, barn and other outbuildings, as very little is currently understood about its construction phases. Bungarribee Homestead's long and continual occupation from its construction in 1823 to its demolition in 1957, would provide significant information relating to the changing economic status of early homesteads in rural settings. The site also has the potential to provide significant information relating to the domestic conditions and social status of early settlers, and the working life and conditions of domestic employees as well as farm assistants.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Bungarribee Doonside}}\n{{Portal|New South Wales}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=Austral Archaeology Pty Ltd|date=2000|title=Archaeological Test Excavations at Bungarribee Homestead, Great Western Highway, Doonside}}\n* {{cite book|author=Austral Archaeology Pty Ltd|date=2000|title=An Archaeological and Heritage Impact Assessment of the Telstra OTC Site, Great Western Highway, Doonside}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bertie|first=C.H.|date=1935|title=Touched by the Lazy Hand of Time, in 'The Home'}}\n* {{cite book|author=BJ Johnson Consulting P/L|date=2000|title=HAM00-06 Bungaribee archival survey - Report}}\n* {{cite book|author=Britton, G. & Morris, C., for the National Trust of Australia (NSW)|date=2000|title=Colonial Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain & Camden - 4.33.4 - Bungarribee House}}\n*{{cite book|last=Broadbent|first=James|date=1997|title=The Australian Colonial House: Architecture and Society in New South Wales, 1788-1842}}\n* {{cite book|author=Broadbent, James & Hughes, Joy|date=1997|title=Francis Greenway Architect (-Bungarribee, Eastern Creek)}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cogno|first=Luisa|date=2004|title=A lost treasure (Blacktown Advocate 21/1/04)}}\n* {{cite book|last=Flynn|first=Michael|date=1995|title='Place of Eels: Aboriginal Parramatta in Australian History'}}\n\n* {{cite book|author=Fowles, Joseph (painter) (in :State Library of NSW)|date=2005|title=Bungarrabee, 1858 (in: Pride of Place - 19th century oil paintings from the Mitchell & Dixson collections)}}\n* {{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan|date=2008|title=Bungarribee Homestead, Doonside - Former Kitchen Gardens - Archaeological Assessment and Research Design, May 2008}}\n\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan (a)|date=2009|title=Bungarribee Homestead, Doonside - Former Kitchen Garden - Historical Analysis}}\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan (b)|date=2009|title=Bungarribee - Interpretation Strategy - Draft report, July 2009}}\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan|date=2009|title=Bungarribee Homestead, Doonside - Former Kitchen Gardens - Archaeological Test Excavation Report, December 2009}}\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan P/L (a)|date=2007|title=Heritage Impact Statement: Doonside Residential Parcel & Parklands Bungarribee Precinct, Western Sydney Parklands}}\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan P/L (b)|date=2007|title=Conservation Management Plan: Doonside Residential Parcel, Western Sydney Parklands}}\n*{{cite book|author=Landcom (& Australian Tree Consulting ATC), 10 January 2013|date=2013|title=Bunya Heritage and View Park - Tree Management Strategy (& Plan)}}\n*{{cite book|last=Latta|first=David|date=|title=Lost Glories - a memorial to forgotten Australian buildings (- Bungarribee chapter)}}\n*{{cite book|author=Morris, C., & Britton, G./NSW National Trust (for the Heritage Council of NSW)|date=2000|title=Colonial  Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain and Camden, NSW|number=4.33.4}}\n*{{cite book|last=Proudfoot|first=Helen|date=1987|title=Exploring Sydney's West (- section on Blacktown/3.

The site is located at Doonside Road, [[Doonside, New South Wales|Doonside]], [[City of Blacktown]], [[Sydney]] [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 8 December 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1428>{{cite NSW SHR|5051257|Bungarribee Homestead Complex - Archaeological Site|hr=01428|fn=EF14/4405; 09/2307; H00/167|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe land on which the Bungarribee Homestead house site and farm estate are located was originally occupied by the people of the Warrawarry group of the [[Darug]] people. They were based around Eastern Creek and the surrounding forest and grassland and used these for food and shelter, hunting and gathering a wide array of animal and plant foods including fresh water fish, crayfish and shellfish.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nA close examination of the documentation of [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]]'s first exploration of [[Parramatta]]'s western hinterland in April 1788 reveals that the orthodox view that he went only as far as [[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect Hill]] or a lttle beyond is deeply flawed. His party is much more likely to have traversed [[Toongabbie]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]] and [[Blacktown]] to climb Bungarribee Hill, Doonside and reaching Eastern Creek and [[Rooty Hill, New South Wales|Rooty Hill]].<ref name=nswshr-1428-2244>Flynn, 1995, 9</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBy the time of European settlement in the western regions after 1790, the original Aboriginal groups had been severely affected by an outbreak of smallpox that had first devastated the groups closest to the European settlement but rapidly spread through the entire [[Sydney]] district. Many of the surviving groups in the west had likely begun to come together to form amalgamated bands in order to survive.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nOnce European settlers began to move into the west, conflicts began to occur between them and the Warrawarry. The clearing and alienation of land by Europeans and consequent reduction in native foods led to clashes between surviving Aboriginal groups and the settlers. By the late 1790s, violence was becoming a feature of the interaction between the two cultures. In 1801 [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|Governor Hunter]] ordered Aboriginals to be kept away from settlers' areas because of the perceived threat. By 1814 the population had dwindled and the survivors were forced to rely heavily on Europeans for food. A number of groups were reported camped on estates at Mamre, [[South Creek (New South Wales)|South Creek]] and Eastern Creek (it is not known if this was near Bungarribee).<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAlthough bands of Aboriginal people continued to live around the estates and growing settlements up to the 1840s, by this time there were less than 300 recorded Darug people left, 10% of the 1788 population.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2245>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007b, 5</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nFor many years \"Bungarribee\" was thought to mean \"the burial place of a king\" and was derived from the name of an Aboriginal man named \"[[Bungaree]]\" (also spelt Bungaroo, Boongaree). Bungaree reputedly died in the vicinity of Bungarribee. King Bungaree was a Guringai man who lived to the north of Sydney in the [[Broken Bay]] area. He was well known around Sydney, particularly for the role he played in key voyages of both [[Matthew Flinders]] and [[Phillip Gidley King]] during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was the first Aboriginal man to be presented with a breastplate by [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]], in 1815 (engraved with 'Boongaree Chief of the Broken Bay Tribe, 1815'). According to Philip Clarke, Bungaree died in 1830 and is buried in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]]. It is now thought that the name \"Bungarribee\" is derived from joining together two Darug words which in combination can be translated as \"creek with cockatoos\" or \"creek with campsite\". Neither Bungarribee or Bell's creeks are permanent water sources so this interpretation of the name appears plausible.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2246>Godden Mackay Logan, 2009b, 7</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe site of (the later Bungarribee farm estate) was within the larger site of the [[Government Depot Site, Rooty Hill|Rooty Hill Government Farm]], an area of 38,728 acres (387.28ha) (Godden Mackay Logan, 2009b, 7 says the area was 17,000 acres). This had been established by [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]] from 1802 as a means to ensure ongoing supply of good pasture for Government herds, as well as land for cultivation of crops and produce. King saw the farms (there were four large farm sites in the Sydney area in total) also as a way to keep the fledgling colonial economy out of the exclusive hands of profiteers and market manipulators.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe farm runs were left largely unaltered from their natural state, save for an overseer's hut and scattered huts for convict shepherds and labourers, as well as stockyards and fences to enclose grazing areas. At Rooty Hill much of the development was to the north-west of the (later Bungarribee farm estate) although fencing may have been erected within its area.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBy the time of Governor Macquarie in 1810, the demands of private landholders and settlers was growing to the point that Macquarie began to subdivide lots from the Government Farms. Macquarie also believed that the worst was over for the colony in terms of food production and that the need for large Government Farms to supply the colony was no longer so pronounced.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===John Campbell===\n\nFrom {{circa}} 1815 Macquarie began to grant parcels of land from the Rooty Hill Farm to settlers, which marked the beginning of organised European agricultural activity in the area. The largest portion in the subject area was that of John Campbell's 2000 acres which he took up in {{circa|1822}}. \n\nCampbell was a retired military officer from Scotland who arrived in Australia on board the Lusitania in November 1821 (with a wife, four sons & five daughters. Campbell, accompanied by his wife and nine children and bearing a letter of introduction from the [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl of Bathurst]] (then Secretary of State<ref name=nswshr-1428-2252>Petrie, 1935</ref>) to Governor Macquarie, was intent on making his fortune by taking up land and farming. Despite being described by Broadbent (1997) as an \"unappealing man\" and an \"unconscionable self-interested sponger\", Campbell appears to have had considerable knowledge of farming and was relatively highly regarded by the colonial government at the time. Campbell's knowledge and status are reflected in his appointments as a committee member of the Agricultural Society of NSW (1822) and later \"Joint Commissioner of Crown Lands\"<ref>(Austral Archaeology, 2000)</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nCampbell's land grant was bounded by Eastern Creek in the west, in the north by the current Bungarribee Road (and its line west of Doonside Road), in the south by the [[Great Western Highway]] and in the east by the approximate line of Reservoir Road. Campbell erected a temporary residence on the high point of his land and began to clear and cultivate, with the help of 22 convict labourers.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2247>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 9</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAn 1821 Colonial Secretary's record notes authorising John Campbell to select 22 convicts, 'having 80 acres cleared at [[Prospect, New South Wales|Prospect]] under conditions of the notice of 17 November 1821. \"Until the party have hutted themselves at a central spot on your estate (he says less than one week) they are to continue drawing rations from Parramatta...\".<ref name=nswshr-1428-2248>BJ Johnson, 2000, p.3</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe 1822 Land and Stock Muster lists John Campbell as granted 2000 acres (at \"Parramatta\") with 130 acres cleared, 15 acres wheat, 5 acres barley and 2 acres potatoes. Stock are 24 cattle, 28 hogs and 1 horse. In the General Muster of 1822 he is no. A03201 with sons 3202, -03, also wife No. A3178 and 6 children 3179-3184, all \"came free\" on \"Lusitania\"..<ref name=nswshr-1428-2249>BJ Johnson, \n2000, p.4</ref> He was assigned 6 convicts for 6 months victualling from the King's Stores, and applied for 5 mechanics and 4 labourers..<ref name=nswshr-1428-2250>BJ Johnson, 2000, p.3</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAlmost immediately after Campbell received his grant he began building a homestead on that land \"suited to his status as a former officer and colonial gentleman\". The homestead and estate (a grant of 2000 acres between Prospect and Rooty Hill<ref name=nswshr-1428-2252/>) were named Bungarabee which was also the name of the creek which cut east-west through the grant. It is an Aboriginal composition, a derivation of which was briefly associated with the Black Town native school.<ref name=nswshr-1428/> He built on the western slope of Bungarribee Hill (on an elevated plateau above the 100 year flood line) in 1822. Construction work utilised [[assigned convict]] labour and was preceded by or occurred in concert with clearing sections of the natural vegetation on Campbell's land..<ref name=nswshr-1428-2253>Austral Archaeology, 2000</ref> The main portion of the house was circular, with one room on the ground floor and one above, both a full circle in shape. Thus all windows, doors and mantelpieces had to be curved, and the difficulty of properly carrying out such accurate work with the labour available must have been very great. Yet it was done, and stood for over 100 years, testimony to the skill involved.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2252/>\n\nCampbell's temporary residence was enlarged in 1825 and incorporated into his grand new home. He positioned his new house on the top of the highest hill on the property, with the main living section facing to the west, providing views to the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] in the distance. Situated on the highest point, the house was clearly visible to travellers passing along the Western Road and in time it became a landmark in the area. (Although now demolished, the site retains its landmark qualities through the Bunya pine ([[Araucaria bidwillii]]), hoop pine ([[Araucaria cunninghamii]]), Mediterranean cypress / pencil pine ([[Cupressus sempervirens]]), [[Port Jackson]] fig ([[Ficus rubiginosa]]) and peppercorn tree ([[Schinus molle]] var. areira) that remain on the site and are visible from Doonside Road and were part of the Bungarribee house garden.). As well as the house, a number of large outbuildings and farm structures were erected on the raised area, including a brick convict barracks, a large brick barn, a number of stables, blacksmith's shop, carpenter's shop and other associated buildings.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2247/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe first recorded mention of a kitchen (vegetable and fruit) garden at Bungarribee appears in a sale notice for the estate following Campbell's death, who had established the property in 1823. An auction notice for the estate in [[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] from August 1828 until its sale in September 1828 described the property as including \"a garden consisting of 8 acres with a great number and variety of young fruit trees well watered\". Of interest is the description of the trees as \"young fruit trees\", suggesting at least part of the garden was a recent addition (although at this stage none of the garden would have been over five years old). The size at 8 acres represents two types of garden likely to have been on site: the kitchen garden itself and an associated orchard. A garden of that size would be able to support the entire household, staff and convict labourers on the site. A letter in the [[Maitland Mercury|Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser]] of 23 March 1846 reported that 63 people lived at Bungarribee (during the occupancy of the East India Company). This probably represents roughly the number employed on the estate throughout the 1830s. A workforce this large goes some way to explaining why the garden would cover an area as large as 8 acres. A second sale notice from 1882 also mentions the existence of a kitchen and flower garden, vineyard and orchard, but gives no further description of plantings or size<ref name=nswshr-1428-2254>Godden Mackay Logan, 2009a, 3</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe problems encountered by Campbell during the construction of the estate were considerable. In 1824 approximately one year after beginning work on Bungarribee, Campbell was in debt to his creditors including Simon Levey and [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]].<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nCampbell was appointed a magistrate for the district, and in those days this was a real distinction. [[Thomas Brisbane|Governor Brisbane]], Macquarie's successor, on one occasion found it necessary to give some samples of the penalties inflicted by various magistrates, and he quoted one wherein Mr Campbell figured. The bench consisted of Lieutenant [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]], of Prospect ([[Veteran Hall Remains|Veteran Hall]]), Donald Macleod, and John Campbell, Esquires. Christopher Lawler, a convict employed at Rooty Hill, was the culprit, and was charged with 'having a quart tin in his possession stolen from the Huts on Mr Campbell's farm.' Lawler was sentenced to receive 25 lashes every second morning until he produced the remainder of the property stolen. This was evidently a customary sentence, as others are cited, but Lawler evidently would not or could not produce the remainder, for a note states that after receiving 100 lashes he was returned to his gang.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2255>Bertie, 1935</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn 1826 Campbell's wife died and in 1827 Campbell himself died at the age of 56. Their tragic deaths and the invention of Chief Bungaroo and other stories involving the murder of a convict and the firearm suicide of an officer in one of the bedrooms led to a proliferation of stories about the house being cursed or haunted.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Thomas Icely===\n\nBungarribee was sold to [[Thomas Icely]] in 1828 for 3652 pounds with financial assistance from John Macarthur. Icely arrived in NSW on the Surrey in 1820, and within five years had an estimated capital of over 30,000 pounds.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIcely made extensive purchases of horses, cattle and sheep, and was given a grant of land to the extent of 2560 acres in the [[Carcoar, New South Wales|Carcoar]] district. The estate which was increased by purchases, was named [[Coombing Park]] after a creek on the station. Here Icely prospered and became one of the leading pastoralists of the day.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBungarribee was used for breeding and fattening purposes. In the days before the advent of the railway, moving stock or wool was a slow and laborious business. The roads of the day were little more than tracks, and a full day's journey by bullock wagon would be covered by a truck in less than an hour now. In such circumstances such an estate as Bungarribee, adjacent to Sydney, would be of great value as an appendage to a pastoral property in the country.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2255/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIcely was owner during EJH Knapp's 1832 survey, and is listed as a horse breeder (noting that ge sold it in 1832).<ref name=nswshr-1428-2259>BJ Johnson, 2000, p.4</ref> The large stables shown by Knapp in 1832 may have been built by Icely, who was a noted horse breeder. The 1828 Muster showed Icely had 14,770 acres, including 1230 cleared and 138 cultivated. He had 65 horses, 1450 cattle and 7500 sheep (compared to John Campbell's record in the 1822 Muster of having only one horse but 24 cattle and 28 hogs).<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe 1832 Knapp survey of Eastern Creek and north boundaries of the 2000 acres of property transferred from Campbell to Icely. This showed in some detail the house, outbuildings (stables, dairy and barracks?), also extensive formal gardens covering 120 x 100 meters.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2260\">BJ Johnson, 2000, p.6</ref> Knapp was government surveyor. His plan is the only known plan that shows the outline and dimensions of the kitchen garden and positions it in relation to the house. The plan shows a rectangular garden divided internally into 16 individual beds with what appear to be paths running in a grid pattern through it. Around the perimeter appears a border, which may also represent border plantings. A central path running north-south has three circular features with smaller garden beds in the centre. This plan is similar to ideas for kitchen garden planting being put forward by the likes of Thomas Shepherd (Sydney's first commercial nurseryman and garden designer) and Scottish/English writer [[John Claudius Loudon]] at this time, although it is further from the house than they recommended. This is probably due to the site's topography, with the house and associated outbuildings built on a raised, relatively narrow portion of the site while the garden was located to the northwest, on a flat adjacent to one of the creeks that ran through the estate.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2254/> The garden is shown in a number of other media (sic), most notably two paintings of the estate during the ownership of the East India Company. Of these, it is most clearly shown in T.Rider's painting of the site c.1850 which (looking to the homestead group across the estate), shows the garden enclosed by a timber railing fence, separated from the house by a large paddock.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2261\">Godden Mackay Logan, 2009a, 4</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Charles Smith===\n\nCharles Smith, a thoroughbred horse breeder, resided at Bungarribee from 1832-40.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2262>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007, 10</ref>\nA tenant during Charles Smith's ownership was Mr Henry Herman Kater (1840-41), who arrived in NSW in 1839 on the \"Euphrates\", which he had chartered and loaded with horses and cattle. He was a Cambridge graduate, and had acted as one of the Earl of Marshal's Gold Staff Officers at [[Queen Victoria]]'s coronation. He bought Bungarribee soon after arrival, and pastured his valuable livestock there. Amongst the horses were Capapie, Tross, Cantab, Paraquay, The Giggler and Georgiana, from which descended many of the finest racehorses in Australia. Kater decided to specialise in horse breeding, and sold his cattle to Mr William Suttor of Bathurst, thus helping to form the celebrated herd built up by Suttor.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2255/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn 1840 Kater brought his bride to Bungarribee, Eliza Charlotte Darvall, daughter of Major Edward Darvall, and on 20 September 1841 a son was born, named [[Henry Kater (politician)|Henry Edward]]. Kater Jr became a well known pastoralist, and was appointed a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], and died in 1924.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2255\" /><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn late 1841 Kater departed Bungarribee, and Smith leased the property to Joseph Armstrong. He came from the strata of society where families are not discussed, and any imprints he had did not come from a University. Nevertheless Smith was a remarkable man, wealthy, and a great sportsman. He was described as 'one of the greatest promoters of horses breeding, a sporting butcher, who carries on his trade in a large plot of land where Kidman's and Lassetter's stores are (George, Market & York Streets), but taking in the whole square into [[York Street, Sydney|York Street]]. Smith was an eminent horse breeder and was a frequent winner. He had a stud farm at Bungarribee, and an establishment at [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]]. He owned more blood stock of the highest type than any other breeder at the one time'. Smith died in 1845, and Bungarribee passed into the occupation of agents of the East India Company, who used it as a depot for horses intended for remounts in India.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2255\" /><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===East India Company and various late twentieth century owners===\n\nThe property was occupied by the East India Company between {{circa|1843}}-6) and from 1846-51 by [[Benjamin Boyd]], prominent colonial merchant and entrepreneur. Boyd used its convict barracks for a period as accommodation for South Pacific ([[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanaka]]) labour he had working on his properties.<ref>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007, 10</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIt then passed though through a number of tenants, one being Captains Dallas and Apperley, who used the property as an assembly depot and \"rest station\" for horses purchased in NSW as remounts for the British army in India. After the East India Company there seems to have been a return to horse breeding, cattle grazing, agriculture and dairying.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2253/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAn 1846 record (Lt. Col. Godfrey C Mundy), notes Bungarabee (sic) as the H.E.I (East India) Company stud establishment (just on the eve of abolition)...and consisting of an excellent dwelling house and offices, stables permanent and temporary for several hundred horses, with some fine open paddocks around them...'.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2265>BJ Johnson, 2000, p.5</ref> Other records imply that Icely and Kater both used the horse stud from which the East India Company exported late in the 1840s.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2266\">BJ Johnson, 2000, p.6</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nJ.K.Cleeve bred and raced horses.<ref>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 10</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428-2267>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 10</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBungarribee House itself eventually passed into the hands of a Thomas Cleaver and during WWII the American Air force built a sealed runway on the property which was used as an emergency training ground.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe modification and change in function of some structures appears to have been a feature of the second half of the nineteenth century.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nA 1935 article described Bungarribee as 'with its burden of a century's life, standing like a battered old man, calmly awaiting the call that will write \"finis\" in its history.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2255\" /><ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\n===Commonwealth and military ownership===\n\nIn {{circa}} 1941, the Bungarribee estate, excluding the house, as well as properties adjoining the estate, was resumed by the Commonwealth for use by the military. The house and land to the east of Eastern Creek (which bisects the property north-south) remained in the possession of the last private owner of the site, Thomas Cleaver. The military's interest in the site was for the construction of an airfield to serve as the training site and as an overshoot runway for the nearby [[RAAF Station Schofields]] airbase. A runway was constructed of compressed gravel with aircraft hides and taxi ways to the south. The runway extended on the southern side of Bungarribee Creek, in a south-westerly direction from close to the junction of Eastern and Bungarribee Creeks, crossing Doonside Road and ending near McCormack Street ([[Arndell Park, New South Wales|Arndell Park]]), approximately 1.8km in length. Following the war's end, the estate remained in Commonwealth ownership, with the Cleaver family continuing to run dairy cattle on the northern portion.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2269>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 10</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn 1949, the Historic Buildings Committee of the [[Australian Institute of Architects|Royal Australian Institute of Architects]] recommended that the house should be immediately \"restored\" in recognition of its significance.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nA 1951 aerial photo shows the house and stables in accordance with Knapp's record, but later smaller buildings as well. Some trees on this photo still exist.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2259/> Walter's letter (Appendix V) may relate to some outbuildings of 1913, standing in 1951). The same photo also shows the full extent of the American 1942 runway of 1500 metres sealed length. On inspection much of the sealed pavement has been broken, but it is an interesting residual artifact.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2270>BJ Johnson, p.3</ref>\n\n===Overseas Telecommunications Commission ownership and demolition===\n\nThe [[Overseas Telecommunications Commission]] acquired the site, though Godden Mackay Logan note it as 1949, and one local map has a notation \"Commonwealth Gazette\", 13 October 1949 re resumption of site. The OTC developed it for a new international transmitting communications station. This work, including the construction of staff housing, had no bearing on the demolition of the house in 1957 or surviving outbuildings in the early 1970s. The house with the exception of the barn and meat house was demolished in 1957.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBy this time it had been unoccupied for a number of years and was deemed beyond repair. Despite some local opposition and a campaign by the fledgling National Trust for its retention and restoration, it was demolished. The only structure to survive was the two storey brick barn, which OTC used for storage.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2271>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 11</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nJohn Lawson, a member of the local historical society had offered to restore the house at his own expense, only to be turned down by OTC. Lawson was required to level the site, not grade the foundations. As such, partial remains survive. The most undisturbed of these are the kitchen and servants' wing. To the south of the barracks and barn sites, OTC built staff housing during the mid 1950s, behind the site of the barn along Doonside Road along the Bungarribee driveway. At the intersection of Doonside and Douglas Roads, the remains of these and the garden plantings can still be seen today.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2272>Austral Archaeology 2000, modified Moore, 2006</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBy the 1990s, telecommunication technology had surpassed the need for radio transmitting and the OTC site was closed. The station buildings and aerial masts had been removed by 2001.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2271/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n[[File:Bungarribee Homestead footings.jpg|thumb|Footings of the homestead, 2016]]\nArchaeological test excavations were undertaken in June 2000. The removal of the top layer of grass and vegetation revealed the remaining homestead walls, floor surfaces and footings. The wall foundations and verandah footings have a maximum dimension of 38m along the east-west axis and 22.5m along the north-south axis. As described in the historic records the homestead featured \"a two-storied, circular conical roofed tower with two single storey verandah wings radiating from it - an L shaped house with a drum at the junction of the two arms. The exposure of the homestead footprint clearly revealed the \"drum\" of the building and the two wings which radiated in a west to east and north to south direction respectively. Clearly evident around the drum and two wings of the homestead is the sandstone alignment for the verandah. Also revealed are the servants area (which appears to include the base of a kitchen fireplace/wood stove) and a cement or line washed brick floor (which may have been part of the laundry or scullery area). The stone cobbled flooring of an early outbuilding and the barracks to the rear of the house were also located. In addition to structural remains there was cultural material lying on the surface including glass and ceramic fragments and other European domestic artefacts.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nLocations for the cellars, large enclosed stockyards, piggery, store, ham house, stable, carpenter and blacksmiths' shop and tennis court have not yet been found, although it is expected given the high level of preservation in the main house that remains of these structures will also be present.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2273>Austral Archaeology, June 2000</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAbove ground are remnants of the former garden of Bungarribee estate, with landmark mature coniferous trees including Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pine (A.cunninghamii) and Mediterranean cypress or pencil pine, (Cupressus sempervirens) indicating the location of the former homestead on the site.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2274>Stuart Read, from 6/2000 photograph in Britton & Morris, 2000</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nOTC occupied the Bungarribee estate from 1949 until {{circa|2001}}, although the station ceased operations during the 1990s. The development of the OTC site involved the building of a modern 2 storey transmitting station to the south of Bungarribee Creek and erection of a series of aerials across the entire land holding for transmitting radio signals. The new OTC station was accessed via the Great Western Highway, west of Doonside Road. It was officially opened by the [[Postmaster-General of New South Wales|Postmaster-General]] in February 1957. To the north of Bungarribee house site, on Doonside Road, an area was also developed for staff housing, with a curving access road, street plantings and dwelling houses. The housing was designed by prominent architectural firm Hennessy, Hennessy & Co. which OTC commissioned for the housing and the transmitting station (as well as the Receiving Station and accompanying accommodation at [[Bringelly, New South Wales|Bringelly]]).<ref name=nswshr-1428-2275>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007a, 10-11</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Recent developments===\n\nc.2005 aerial photographs of the property in context show the OTC staff housing has been removed, while its layout and tree plantings survive.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2276>Read, S., pers.comm/file, 7 February 2006</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nIn September 2015 Environment Minister [[Mark Speakman]] announced approval of the lease of a 16.5ha site for a new zoo on land adjoining Bungarribee's picnic area and playground. The new zoo - subsequently known as the [[Sydney Zoo]] - was due to open in late 2017 and attract about 745,000 visitors a year.

The Eastern Boundary of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is Doonside Road at Douglas Road and the heritage curtilage extends for an area approximately 2.6 by 1.6 km. It is part of an original grant of 2000 acres received by John Campbell on 30 June 1823. The grant was bounded on the north by a line bearing east 180 chains 50 links commencing at Eastern Creek, on the east side by a line bearing south 150 chains to the Great Western Road, on the south by that road and on the west by Eastern Creek.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2278>Austral Archaeology 2000</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe archaeological potential of the site was reported as extremely high as at 10 July 2000, as the site consists of the rare, largely intact footings of an 1820s homestead including main house, outbuilding, barracks and original garden plantings.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe archaeological footprint of the complex is largely intact. It is expected to contain some occupation deposits relating to all phases of occupation on the site. The original vegetation (including large plantings) is largely intact.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Garden and grounds===\nAbove ground are remnants of the former garden of Bungarribee estate, with landmark mature coniferous trees including Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pine (A.cunninghamii), Mediterranean cypress or pencil pine, (Cupressus sempervirens), Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa), Himalayan blue pine (Pinus wallichiana) and peppercorn tree (Schinus molle var. areira) and boxthorn, (Lycium ferocissimum) indicating the location of the former homestead garden and possible former farm hedging on the site. An 1832 Knapp survey showed a square 8 acre formal kitchen garden north-west of the homestead site and other records note an orchard area from the time of the Campbells and into the 1830s<ref name=nswshr-1428-2279>Stuart Read, from 6/2000 photograph in Britton & Morris, 2000</ref><ref>other site photographs</ref><ref>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007b</ref><ref>Landcom, 2013</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Homestead(s)===\nCampbell built a temporary dwelling on the property in c.1822, prior to building the main house, which was started by 1825. The temporary residence was later incorporated into the main dwelling as the servants' quarters.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2280>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007b,6</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe main house featured a two-storey, circular conical roofed tower with two single story verandah wings radiating from it in an L shape. Historical accounts note that the walls of the two storey circular section were solid and constructed of soft red sandstock bricks from Parramatta/Prospect. The one storey walls of the radiating wings and the internal walls were of half timber - post and rail - with sandstock bricks forming the infill panels of the walls. Window and door openings throughout the house were spanned by timber [[Lintel (architecture)|lintels]] and the solid brick portions of the house also featured decorative flat and semi circular brick arches. Vertical lathes were nailed to the rails on the external walls which were ultimately finished in white washed stucco. The roof structure and floors were built of adzed and pit sawn timber joined with handmade iron nails and the roof itself was covered with shingles. The open colonnaded [[Veranda|verandahs]] and halls features [[sandstone]] flagging and the building boasted a substantial cellar.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281>Austral Archaeology: June 2000</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe main portion of the house was circular, with one room on the ground floor and one above, both a full circle in shape. Thus all windows, doors and mantelpieces had to be curved, and the difficulty of properly carrying out such accurate work with the labour available must have been very great..., testimony to the skill involved.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2252/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe main ground floor living rooms featured glazed [[French doors]], opening onto the verandah. The house had 5 bedrooms on the ground floor and one in the first floor tower. It also featured formal living and dining rooms, a withdrawing room for the gentlemen, servants' quarters (in the original family cottage which was incorporated into the rear of the house) and a cellar underneath the main house accessed via an internal pantry. Later reports indicated that the cellar may have had a passage running from it towards the Bungarribee Creek and that a large underground tank or cistern was located to the rear of the main house. The house was built in the Picturesque style, which had been made popular in England by the architect John Nash in the early 19th century and had begun to appear in colonial design from the 1820s. In NSW this style never gained much attention, with more examples in Tasmania than the mainland. Bungarribee house was its most recognisable expression in New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2282>Godden Mackay Logan, 2007b, 6-7</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n===Outbuildings===\nAs well as the house, a number of large outbuildings and farm structures were erected on the raised area, including a brick convict barracks, a large brick barn, a number of stables, blacksmith's shop, carpenter's shop and other associated buildings.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2247/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe barn, which appears to have been huge, was located to the east of the house and was a solid brick building built from clay stocks interlaced with hard-burnt shale bricks laid in a [[Brickwork|Flemish bond]].  The roof of the barn featured \"tusk and tenon\" joinery which allowed nails to be used sparingly. The men's quarters may also have been built of the same bricks and were described as being behind the barn, having brick floors with lofts above where the servants used to sleep.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2283\">Austral Archaeology June 2000</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\nThe modification and change in function of some structures appears to have been a feature of the second half of the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\nOTC acquired the site to develop a communications station in 1950. OTC built staff housing there during the 1950s, the remains of which can still be seen on site today along with their garden plantings.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\nArchaeological test excavations were undertaken in June 2000. The removal of the top layer of grass and vegetation revealed the remaining homestead walls, floor surfaces and footings. The wall [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] and verandah footings have a maximum dimension of 38m along the east-west axis and 22.5m along the north-south axis. As described in the historic records, the homestead featured \"a two-storeyed, circular conical roofed tower with two single storey verandah wings radiating from it - an L shaped house with a drum at the junction of the two arms.<ref name=\"nswshr-1428\" />\n\nThe exposure of the homestead footprint clearly revealed the \"drum\" of the building and the two wings which radiated in a west to east and north to south direction respectively. Clearly evident around the drum and two wings of the homestead is the sandstone alignment for the verandah. Also revealed are the servants area (which appears to include the base of a kitchen fireplace/wood stove) and a cement or line washed brick floor (which may have been part of the laundry or scullery area. The stone cobbled flooring of an early outbuilding (whitewashed building with half-storey, west of the barn - ref. J. Fowles 1858) and the convict barracks to the rear of the house were also located. In addition to structural remains there was cultural material lying on the surface including glass and ceramic fragments and other European domestic artefacts. (These items were stated to be bagged and removed during the dig).<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nLocations for the cellars, large enclosed stockyards, piggery, store, ham house, stable, carpenter and blacksmiths' shop, and tennis court have not yet been found, although it is expected given the high level of preservation in the main house that remains of these structures will also be present.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/>\n\nThe site is affected by contaminated soils. There are elevated lead levels and some asbestos present although the majority of the asbestos was removed during site remediation works in 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe [[Bungarribee Homestead]] complex represents a rare, intact footprint of a very early farmstead including a main house, outbuildings and plantings. The remains, as defined by the heritage curtilage are considered to have State significance based on their historic, aesthetic, social and technical/research values.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe homestead has a strong association with settler John Campbell who arrived in the colony in 1821 seeking to increase his fortunes. Bungarribee is a reflection of the ambition of Campbell, but also of other settlers who desired a new and prosperous life. The homestead is architecturally and aesthetically significant and contributed to the influence of the \"cottage ornee\" style in the colony.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2290>Broadbent 1997:145</ref> The homestead was also an important reminder of the social status of its owners with its \"Italianate tower seen across paddocks from the Western Road,... as important an architectural landmark in the colony as Mrs Macquarie's Gothic forts on [[Sydney Harbour]]\".<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nAs a cultural resource, this complex is highly significant for the potential to yield information regarding the evolving pastoral and economic activities of an early homestead in the western region of Sydney. It has the potential to yield information regarding the initial construction and occupation of the homestead, the barracks, barn and other outbuildings. This resource has the potential to provide information relating to the domestic conditions and social status of early settlers, and the working life and conditions of domestic and farm assistants employed on this estate.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBungarribee Homestead archaeological site was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 8 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe historic value of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is considered to be high.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe Bungarribee Homestead Complex has the potential to contain further substantial sub-surface cultural resources that would contribute to our current understanding of the evolving cultural history of NSW. The site has the potential to contribute information regarding the early pastoral movement and settlement into western Sydney. Specifically, the homestead complex has strong associations with John Campbell a retired military officer who arrived in the colony from Scotland in 1821. It is understood that Campbell arrived in the colony with his wife, nine children and a letter of introduction from the Earl of Bathurst to Governor Macquarie.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2291>Austral May 2000</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nLike many early settlers, Campbell arrived in the colony with the intention of increasing his fortune. The Bungarribee estate is a reflection of his and future owners' ambitions and ideals. Campbell found himself in financial difficulties which threatened his ownership of Bungarribee, however due to his associations with John Macarthur, he was able to ease himself from this situation. Although Campbell died in 1827 he \"left behind one of the most charming houses built in early Colonial NSW\".<ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2290\"/> The style of the homestead is described as \"subtly Italianate\" and its character \"unashamedly picturesque\".<ref name=nswshr-1428-2290/><ref name=nswshr-1428-2283/><ref name=\"nswshr-1428-2292\">Broadbent, 1997</ref><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe aesthetic value of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is considered to be High.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe Bungarribee Homestead Complex is significant for it sensory and architectural appeal. This appeal would undoubtedly have been evident to the historic occupants of the homestead, as it is to the present day visitor. The homestead was designed to have a panoramic view of the surrounding rural landscape. The drawing room verandah windows would have provided a western horizon highlighting the Blue Mountains. The design of the circular room or drum of the main homestead building would not only have been a feature of the home, but would also have provided and architectural feature that showcased the panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. The design of the Bungarribee verandah can also be considered to be significant in its influence of future designs of homesteads in the colony and in the establishment of the style of the \"cottage orne\".<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nBroadbent describes Bungarribee as a \"delightful, sensitive and eccentric adaption of the vernacular bungalow form\" and is significant in its reflection of the desire of early settlers to tame the wild landscape with designs inspired and filtered down from the \"vernacular architecture of the Italian campagna\".<ref name=nswshr-1428-2290/> This is reflected in the location of the homestead on an elevated flat above the surrounding floodplain of Bungarribee and Eastern Creeks, which would have provided a serene and fertile setting for the early occupants of Bungarribee. The remnant historic pines also provide a reminder of the early European influence on the environmental landscape.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe social value of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is considered to be moderate to high.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nPrior to its demolition, the Bungarribee homestead was a significant landmark in the Doonside/Rooty Hill area. The site today provides many locals with a poignant reminder of the early settlement of this region of Sydney. Many locals today have childhood recollections of stories told to them by family and friends regarding the Bungarribee homestead with its grand verandah, and the large barn that once stood to the east of the home. Historically, the homestead and its pastoral activities would have provided employment as well as an economic base for the local Doonside/ Rooty Hill region.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe technical/research value of the Bungarribee Homestead Complex is considered to be high.<ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\nThe Complex has the potential to yield significant information about the evolving agricultural and pastoral activities of an early homestead in the western region of Sydney. It has the potential to yield information relating to the initial construction and occupation of the homestead, as well as the barracks, barn and other outbuildings, as very little is currently understood about its construction phases. Bungarribee Homestead's long and continual occupation from its construction in 1823 to its demolition in 1957, would provide significant information relating to the changing economic status of early homesteads in rural settings. The site also has the potential to provide significant information relating to the domestic conditions and social status of early settlers, and the working life and conditions of domestic employees as well as farm assistants.<ref name=nswshr-1428-2281/><ref name=nswshr-1428/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Bungarribee Doonside}}\n{{Portal|New South Wales}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=Austral Archaeology Pty Ltd|date=2000|title=Archaeological Test Excavations at Bungarribee Homestead, Great Western Highway, Doonside}}\n* {{cite book|author=Austral Archaeology Pty Ltd|date=2000|title=An Archaeological and Heritage Impact Assessment of the Telstra OTC Site, Great Western Highway, Doonside}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bertie|first=C.H.|date=1935|title=Touched by the Lazy Hand of Time, in 'The Home'}}\n* {{cite book|author=BJ Johnson Consulting P/L|date=2000|title=HAM00-06 Bungaribee archival survey - Report}}\n* {{cite book|author=Britton, G. & Morris, C., for the National Trust of Australia (NSW)|date=2000|title=Colonial Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain & Camden - 4.33.4 - Bungarribee House}}\n*{{cite book|last=Broadbent|first=James|date=1997|title=The Australian Colonial House: Architecture and Society in New South Wales, 1788-1842}}\n* {{cite book|author=Broadbent, James & Hughes, Joy|date=1997|title=Francis Greenway Architect (-Bungarribee, Eastern Creek)}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cogno|first=Luisa|date=2004|title=A lost treasure (Blacktown Advocate 21/1/04)}}\n* {{cite book|last=Flynn|first=Michael|date=1995|title='Place of Eels: Aboriginal Parramatta in Australian History'}}\n\n* {{cite book|author=Fowles, Joseph (painter) (in :State Library of NSW)|date=2005|title=Bungarrabee, 1858 (in: Pride of Place - 19th century oil paintings from the Mitchell & Dixson collections)}}\n* {{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan|date=2008|title=Bungarribee Homestead, Doonside - Former Kitchen Gardens - Archaeological Assessment and Research Design, May 2008}}\n\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan (a)|date=2009|title=Bungarribee Homestead, Doonside - Former Kitchen Garden - Historical Analysis}}\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan (b)|date=2009|title=Bungarribee - Interpretation Strategy - Draft report, July 2009}}\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan|date=2009|title=Bungarribee Homestead, Doonside - Former Kitchen Gardens - Archaeological Test Excavation Report, December 2009}}\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan P/L (a)|date=2007|title=Heritage Impact Statement: Doonside Residential Parcel & Parklands Bungarribee Precinct, Western Sydney Parklands}}\n*{{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan P/L (b)|date=2007|title=Conservation Management Plan: Doonside Residential Parcel, Western Sydney Parklands}}\n*{{cite book|author=Landcom (& Australian Tree Consulting ATC), 10 January 2013|date=2013|title=Bunya Heritage and View Park - Tree Management Strategy (& Plan)}}\n*{{cite book|last=Latta|first=David|date=|title=Lost Glories - a memorial to forgotten Australian buildings (- Bungarribee chapter)}}\n*{{cite book|author=Morris, C., & Britton, G./NSW National Trust (for the Heritage Council of NSW)|date=2000|title=Colonial  Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain and Camden, NSW|number=4.33.4}}\n*{{cite book|last=Proudfoot|first=Helen|date=1987|title=Exploring Sydney's West (- section on Blacktown/3.

{"title_page": "List of musical symbols", "text_new": "{{short description|none}}\n{{Selfref|For the use of musical symbols on Wikipedia, see [[Help:Musical symbols]].}}\n'''Musical symbols''' are marks and symbols used since about the 13th century in [[musical notation]] of [[sheet music|musical scores]]. Some are used to notate [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[tempo]], [[metre (music)|metre]], [[Duration (music)|duration]] and [[articulation (music)|articulation]] of a [[musical note|note]] or a [[section (music)|passage]] of music. In some cases, symbols provide information about the form of a piece (e.g., how many repeats of a section) or about how to play the note (e.g., with violin family instruments, a note may be bowed or plucked). Some symbols are instrument-specific notation giving the performer information about which finger, hand or foot to use.\n\n==Lines==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px; padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-staff.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staff (music)|Staff]]'''<br />The staff is the fundamental latticework of music notation, on which symbols are placed. The five staff lines and four intervening spaces correspond to pitches of the [[diatonic scale]]; which pitch is meant by a given line or space is defined by the [[clef]]. In British usage, the word \"stave\" is often used \n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-ledger.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Ledger line|Ledger or leger lines]]'''<br /> These extend the staff to pitches that fall above or below it. Such ledger lines are placed behind the note heads, and extend a small distance to each side. Multiple ledger lines can be used when necessary to notate pitches even farther above or below the staff.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-bar.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Bar (music)|Bar line]]'''<br />These separate measures (see [[#Time signatures|time signatures]] below for an explanation of ''measures''). Also used for changes in [[time signature]]. Bar lines are extended to connect multiple staves in certain types of music, such as for keyboard or harp, and in conductor scores, but such extensions are not used for other types of music, such as vocal scores.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-doublebar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Double bar line, Double barline'''<br />These separate two sections of music, or are placed before a change in [[key signature]] and/or [[time signature]].\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-endbar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Bold double bar line, Bold double barline'''<br />These indicate the conclusion of a movement or an entire composition.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-dottedbar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Dotted bar line, Dotted barline'''<br />Subdivides long measures of complex meter into shorter segments for ease of reading, usually according to natural rhythmic subdivisions.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Staff-bracket.jpg|30px]]\n|'''Bracket'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that sound simultaneously. In general contemporary usage the bracket usually connects the staves of separate instruments (e.g., flute and clarinet; two trumpets; etc.) or multiple vocal parts in a choir or ensemble, whereas the ''brace'' connects multiple parts for a ''single'' instrument (e.g., the right-hand and left-hand staves of a piano or harp part).\n|-\n| [[File:Accolade.svg|30px]]\n|'''Brace'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that are played simultaneously in piano, keyboard, harp, or some pitched percussion music.<ref>[https://sites.coloradocollege.edu/musicengraving/engraving-convention/braces-and-bracket/ \"Music Notation and Engraving \u2013 Braces and Bracket], [[Colorado College]] Music Department</ref> Depending on the instruments playing, the brace (occasionally called an '''accolade''' in some old texts) varies in design and style.\n|}\n\n== Clefs ==\n{{main|Clef}}\nClefs define the pitch range, or [[tessitura]], of the staff on which it is placed. A clef is usually the ''leftmost'' symbol on a staff. Additional clefs may appear in the middle of a staff to indicate a change in register for instruments with a wide range. In early music, clefs could be placed on any of several lines on a staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-GClef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[G clef]] ([[Treble clef]])'''<br />The centre of the spiral assigns the second line from the bottom to the pitch G above middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996>{{cite book |page=49 |last1=Gerou |first1=Tom |last2=Lusk |first2=Linda |date=1996 |title=Essential Dictionary of Music Notation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dictionary-Music-Notation-Pocket/dp/0882847309 |publisher=Alfred Music|isbn=0-88284-768-6}}</ref> The treble clef is the most commonly encountered clef in modern notation, and is used for most modern vocal music. Middle C is the first ledger line below the staff here. \n|-\n| [[File:Music-Cclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[C clef]] ([[Alto clef|Alto]], and [[Tenor clef|Tenor]] clefs)'''<br />These clefs point to the line representing middle C. As illustrated here, it makes the ''center line on the staff'' middle C, and is referred to as the \"alto clef\". This clef is used in modern notation for the [[viola]]. While all clefs can be placed anywhere on the staff to indicate various tessitura, the C clef is most often considered a \"movable\" clef: it is frequently seen pointing instead to the fourth line and called a \"tenor clef\". This clef is used very often in music written for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[trombone]], and [[double bass]]; it replaces the bass clef when the number of ledger lines above the bass staff hinders easy reading.<br /> Until the classical era, the C clef was also frequently seen pointing to other lines, mostly in vocal music, but today this has been supplanted by the universal use of the treble and bass clefs. Modern editions of music from such periods generally transpose the original C clef parts to either treble (female voices), octave treble (tenors), or bass clef (tenors and basses). It can be occasionally seen in modern music on the third space (between the third and fourth lines), in which case it has the same function as an octave treble clef. This unusual practice runs the risk of misreading, however, because the traditional function of all clefs is to identify staff lines, not spaces.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-Fclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[F clef]] ([[Bass clef]])'''<br />The line between the dots in this clef denotes F below middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996 /> Positioned here, it makes the ''second line from the top'' of the staff F below middle C, and is called a \"bass clef\". This clef appears nearly as often as the treble clef, especially in choral music, where it represents the bass and baritone voices. Middle C is the first ledger line above the staff here. In old music, particularly vocal scores, this clef is sometimes encountered centered on the third staff line, in which position it is referred to as a ''baritone clef''; this usage has essentially become obsolete.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-unpitchedclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Neutral clef'''<br />Used for pitchless instruments, such as some of those [[percussion notation|used for percussion]]. Each line can represent a specific percussion instrument within a set, such as in a drum set. Two different styles of neutral clefs are pictured here. It may also be drawn with a separate single-line staff for each untuned percussion instrument.\n|-\n| [[File:Octaveclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Octave clef'''<br />Treble and bass clefs can also be modified by octave numbers. An eight or fifteen above a clef raises the intended pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. Similarly, an eight or fifteen below a clef lowers the pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. A treble clef with an eight below is the most commonly used, typically used for guitar and similar instruments, as well as for tenor parts in choral music.\n|-\n| [[File:Tablature.svg|100px]]\n|'''Tablature'''<br />For stringed instruments, such as the guitar, it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB sign is often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the staff is not necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for standard 6-stringed guitars, six lines would be used). Numbers on the lines show which fret to play the string on. This TAB sign, like the percussion clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a clef. Similarly, the horizontal lines do not constitute a staff in the usual sense, because the spaces between the lines in a tablature are never used.\n|}\n\n== Notes and rests ==\n\n{{main|Note value}}\n[[Musical note]] and [[rest (music)|rest]] values are not absolutely defined, but are proportional in duration to all other note and rest values. The whole note is the reference value, and the other notes are named (in American usage) in comparison; i.e., a quarter note is a quarter of the length of a whole note.\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Note\n!width=*|British name / American name\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Rest\n|-\n| [[File:Music-octwholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Maxima (music)|Large (Latin: Maxima) / Octuple whole note]]'''<ref name=256th/>\n| [[File:Music-octwholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-quadwholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Longa (music)|Long / Quadruple whole note]]'''<ref name=256th/>\n| [[File:Music-quadwholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-doublewholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Double whole note|Breve / Double whole note]]'''\n| [[File:Music-doublewholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-wholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Whole note|Semibreve / Whole note]]'''\n| [[File:Music-wholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-halfnote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Half note|Minim / Half note]]'''\n| [[File:Music-halfrest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-quarternote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Quarter note|Crotchet / Quarter note]]'''<ref>Examples of the older form are found in the work of English music publishers up to the 20th century, e.g., W.

In metered music, beams reflect the rhythmic grouping of notes. They may also group short phrases of notes of the same value, regardless of the meter; this is more common in ametrical passages. In older printings of vocal music, beams are often only used when several notes are to be sung on one syllable of the text \u2013 [[melisma]]tic singing; modern notation encourages the use of beaming in a consistent manner with instrumental engraving, and the presence of beams or flags no longer informs the singer about the lyrics. Today, due to the body of music in which traditional metric states are not always assumed, beaming is at the discretion of composers and arrangers, who often use irregular beams to emphasize a particular rhythmic pattern.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dotnote.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Dotted note]]'''<br />Placing a dot to the right of a notehead lengthens the note's duration by one-half. Additional dots lengthen the previous dot instead of the original note, thus a note with one dot is one and one half its original value, a note with two dots is one and three quarters, a note with three dots is one and seven eighths, and so on. Rests can be dotted in the same manner as notes. In other words, ''n'' dots lengthen the note's or rest's original duration ''d'' to {{nowrap|''d'' \u00d7 (2 \u2212 2<sup>''\u2212n''</sup>)}}.\n|-\n| [[File:Ghost note.png]]\n|'''[[Ghost note]]'''<br />A note with a rhythmic value, but no discernible pitch when played. It is represented by a ([[saltire]]) cross (similar to the letter ''x'') for a note head instead of an oval. Composers will primarily use this notation to represent percussive pitches.  This notation is also used in parts where spoken words are used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-measurerest.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Multiple measure rest|Multi-measure rest]]'''<br />Indicates the number of measures in a resting part without a change in meter to conserve space and to simplify notation.

Usually used when the note to modify is already sharpened by the key signature.\n|}\n\n===Key signatures===\n[[Key signature]]s define the prevailing [[Key (music)|key]] of the music that follows, thus avoiding the use of accidentals for many notes. If no key signature appears, the key is assumed to be C major/A minor, but can also signify a neutral key, employing individual accidentals as required for each note. The key signature examples shown here are described as they would appear on a ''treble'' staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:C-flat-major a-flat-minor.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat key signature'''<br />'''''Lowers''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of flats in the key signature, starting with the leftmost, i.e., B{{music|\u266d}}, and proceeding to the right; for example, if only the first two flats are used, the key is B{{music|\u266d}} major/G minor, and all B's and E's are \"flatted\" (US) or \"flattened\" (UK), i.e., lowered to B{{music|\u266d}} and E{{music|\u266d}}.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. I,24 \"at least one note has to be sharpened or flattened\"</ref>\n|-\n| [[File:C-sharp-major a-sharp-minor.svg|100px]]\n|'''Sharp key signature'''<br />'''''Raises''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of sharps in the key signature, also proceeding from left to right; for example, if only the first four sharps are used, the key is E major/C{{music|\u266f}} minor, and the corresponding pitches are raised.\n|}\n\n=== Quarter tones ===\nThere is no universally accepted notation for [[microtonal music]], with varying systems being used depending on the situation. A common notation for [[quarter tone]]s involves writing the fraction ''{{1/4}}'' next to an arrow pointing up or down. Below are other forms of notation:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-demiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demiflat'''<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by one quarter tone. (Another notation for the demiflat is a flat with a diagonal slash through its stem. In systems where pitches are divided into intervals smaller than a quarter tone, the slashed flat represents a lower note than the reversed flat.)\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat-and-a-half''' (sesquiflat)<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by three [[quarter tone]]s. As with a demiflat, a slashed double-flat symbol is also used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-demisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demisharp'''<br />Raises the pitch of a note by one quarter tone.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Sharp-and-a-half''' (sesquisharp)<br />Raises the pitch of a note by three quarter tones. Occasionally represented with two vertical and three diagonal bars instead.\n|}\n\nA symbol with one vertical and three diagonal bars indicates a sharp with some form of alternate tuning.\n\nIn [[19 equal temperament]], where a whole tone is divided into ''three'' steps instead of two, music is typically notated in a way that flats and sharps are not usually enharmonic (thus a C{{music|#}} represents a third of a step lower than D{{music|b}}); this has the advantage of not requiring any nonstandard notation.\n\n== Time signatures ==\n{{main|Time signature}}\n[[Time signature]]s define the meter of the music. Music is \"marked off\" in uniform sections called bars or measures, and time signatures establish the number of beats in each. This does not necessarily indicate which beats to emphasize, however, so a time signature that conveys information about the way the piece actually sounds is thus chosen. Time signatures tend to ''suggest'' prevailing groupings of beats or pulses.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-timesig.svg|100px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 simple time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 4 represents the crotchet or quarter-note). The top number indicates how many of these note values appear in each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of three crotchets (quarter-notes). For example, {{music|time|3|4}} is pronounced as \"three-four time\" or \"three-quarter time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Compound duple drum pattern.png|200px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 compound time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the ''subdivisions'' of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 8 represents the quaver or eighth-note). The top number indicates how many of these subdivisions appear in each measure. Usually each beat is composed of three subdivisions. To derive the unit of the basic pulse in compound meters, double this value and add a dot, and divide the top number by 3 to determine how many of these pulses there are each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of two dotted crotchets (dotted quarter-notes). This is pronounced as \"Six-Eight Time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Music-commontime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Common time]]'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|4|4}} time. It derives from the broken circle that represented \"imperfect\" duple meter in fourteenth-century [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|mensural time signatures]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-cuttime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Alla breve]] or Cut time'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|2|2}} time, indicating two minim (or half-note) beats per measure. Here, a crotchet (or quarter note) would get half a beat.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-metronome.svg|80px]]\n|'''[[Metronome]] mark'''<br />Written at the start of a score, and at any significant change of tempo, this symbol precisely defines the tempo of the music by assigning absolute durations to all note values within the score. In this particular example, the performer is told that 120 crotchets, or quarter notes, fit into one minute of time. Many publishers precede the marking with letters \"'''M.M.'''\", referring to [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel|Maelzel]]'s [[Metronome]].\n|}\n\n== Note relationships ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tie.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tie (music)|Tie]]'''<br />Indicates that the two (or more) notes joined together are to be played as one note with the time values added together. To be a tie, the notes must be identical \u2013 that is, they must be on the same line or the same space. Otherwise, it is a slur (see below).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-slur.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-legato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Slur (music)|Slur]]'''<br />Indicates to play two or more notes in one physical stroke, one uninterrupted breath, or (on instruments with neither breath nor bow) connected into a phrase as if played in a single breath. In certain contexts, a slur may only indicate to play the notes [[legato]]. In this case, rearticulation is permitted.<br />Slurs and ties are similar in appearance. A tie is distinguishable because it always joins two immediately adjacent notes of the same pitch, whereas a slur may join any number of notes of varying pitches. In vocal music a slur normally indicates that notes grouped together by the slur should be sung to a single syllable.<br />A ''phrase mark'' (or less commonly, ''ligature'') is a mark that is visually identical to a slur, but connects a passage of music over several measures. A phrase mark indicates a musical phrase and may not necessarily require that the music be slurred.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-glissando.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Glissando]]''' or '''[[Portamento]]'''<br />A continuous, unbroken glide from one note to the next that includes the pitches between. Some instruments, such as the trombone, timpani, non-fretted string instruments, electronic instruments, and the human voice can make this glide continuously (portamento), while other instruments such as the piano or mallet instruments blur the discrete pitches between the start and end notes to mimic a continuous slide (glissando).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triplet.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tuplet]]'''<br />A number of notes of irregular duration are performed within the duration of a given number of notes of regular time value; e.g., five notes played in the normal duration of four notes; seven notes played in the normal duration of two; three notes played in the normal duration of four. Tuplets are named according to the number of irregular notes; e.g., duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triad.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Chord (music)|Chord]]'''<br />Several notes sounded simultaneously (\"solid\" or \"block\"), or in succession (\"broken\"). Two-note chords are called a '''[[dyad (music)|dyad]]''' or an [[Interval (music)|'''interval''']]; three-note chords built from generic third intervals are called '''[[triad (music)|triads]]'''. A chord may contain any number of notes.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-arpeggio.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiated]] chord'''<br />A chord with notes played in rapid succession, usually ascending, each note being sustained as the others are played. It is also called a \"broken chord\" or \"rolled chord\".\n|}\n\n== Dynamics ==\n{{main|Dynamics (music)}}\nDynamics are indicators of the relative intensity or volume of a musical line.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music dynamic pianississimo.svg|73px]]\n|'''Pianississimo'''<ref name=ppp group=D>Dynamics with 3 letters (i.e., {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) are often referred to by adding an extra \"iss\" (''pianissimo'' to ''pianississimo''). This is improper Italian and would translate literally to \"softestest\" in English, but acceptable as a musical term; such a dynamic can also be described as ''molto pianissimo'', ''piano pianissimo'' or ''molto fortissimo'' and ''forte fortissimo'' in somewhat more proper Italian.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}</ref><br />Extremely soft.

If no dynamic appears, ''mezzo-forte'' is assumed to be the prevailing dynamic level.\n|-\n| [[File:Music dynamic forte.svg|29px]]\n|'''Forte'''<br />Loud. Used as often as ''piano'' to indicate contrast.\n|-\n| [[File:Music dynamic fortissimo.svg|46px]]\n|'''Fortissimo'''<br />Very loud. Usually the loudest indication in a piece, though louder dynamics are often specified with additional {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s (such as fortississimo \u2013 seen below).\n|-\n| [[File:Music dynamic fortississimo.svg|53px]]\n|'''Fortississimo'''<ref group=D name=ppp /><br />Extremely loud.

Can be extended in the same manner as crescendo.\n|}\n<references group=D />\nOther commonly used dynamics build upon these values. For example, \"''pianississimo''\" (represented as {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}) means \"so softly as to be almost inaudible\", and \"''fortississimo''\" ({{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) means \"extremely loud\".  Dynamics are relative, and the meaning of each level is at the discretion of the performer or, in the case of ensembles, the conductor. However, modern legislation to curb high noise levels in the workplace in an effort to prevent damage to musicians' hearing has posed a challenge to the interpretation of very loud dynamics in some large orchestral works, as noise levels within the orchestra itself can easily exceed safe levels when all instruments are playing at full volume<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/arts/music/20noise.html \"No Fortissimo? Symphony Told to Keep It Down\"] by [[Sarah Lyall]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (20 April 2008)</ref>. \n\nA small {{serif|'''''s'''''}} in front of the dynamic notations means ''subito'' (meaning \"suddenly\" in Italian), and means that the dynamic is to change to the new notation rapidly. Subito is commonly used with sforzandos, but can appear with all other dynamic notations, most commonly as {{serif|'''''sff'''''}} (subitofortissimo) or {{serif|'''''spp'''''}} (subitopianissimo).\n\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-forte-piano.png|50px]]\n|'''[[Fortepiano (musical dynamic)|Forte-piano]]'''<br />A section of music in which the music should initially be played loudly (''forte''), then immediately softly (''piano'').\n|}\n\nAnother value that rarely appears is ''[[niente]]'' or {{serif|'''''n'''''}}, which means \"nothing\". This may be used at the end of a diminuendo to indicate \"fade out to nothing\".\n\n== Articulation marks ==\n[[Articulation (music)|Articulations]] (or [[Accent (music)|accents]]) specify how to perform individual notes within a phrase or passage. They can be fine-tuned by combining more than one such symbol over or under a note. They may also appear in conjunction with phrasing marks listed above.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-staccato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccato]]'''<br />This indicates the musician should ''play the note shorter than notated'', usually half the value; the rest of the metric value is then silent. Staccato marks may appear on notes of any value, shortening their performed duration without speeding the music itself.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-staccatissimo.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccatissimo]]''' or '''[[Spiccato]]'''<br />Indicates a ''longer silence after the note'' (as described above), making the note very short. Usually applied to quarter notes or shorter. (In the past, this marking\u2019s meaning was more ambiguous: it sometimes was used interchangeably with staccato, and sometimes indicated an accent and not staccato. These usages are now almost defunct, but still appear in some scores.) In string instruments this indicates a bowing technique in which the bow bounces lightly upon the string.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Accent (music)|Accent]] '''<br />Play the note louder, or with a harder attack than surrounding unaccented notes. May appear on notes of any duration.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-tenuto.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tenuto]]'''<br />This symbol indicates ''play the note at its full value, or slightly longer''. It can also indicate a degree of emphasis, especially when combined with dynamic markings to indicate a change in loudness, or combined with a staccato dot to indicate a slight detachment (''[[portato]]'' or ''[[mezzo staccato]]'').\n|-\n| [[File:Music-strong-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Marcato]]'''<br />''Play the note somewhat louder or more forcefully than a note with a regular accent mark'' (open horizontal wedge). In organ notation, this means ''play a pedal note with the toe''. Above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-fermata.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Fermata]] (Pause)'''<br />A note, chord, or rest sustained longer than its customary value. Usually appears over all parts at the same metrical location in a piece, to show a halt in [[tempo]]. It can be placed above or below the note. The fermata is held for as long as the performer or conductor desires, but is often set as twice the original value of the designated notes.\n|}\n\n== Ornaments ==\nOrnaments modify the pitch pattern of individual notes.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-trill.svg|100px]][[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Trill (music)|Trill]]'''<br />A rapid alternation between the specified note and the next higher note (according to key signature) within its duration, also called a \"shake\". When followed by a wavy horizontal line, this symbol indicates an extended, or running, trill. In modern music the trill begins on the main note and ends with the lower [[auxiliary note]] then the main note, which requires a triplet immediately before the turn. In music up to the time of Haydn or Mozart the trill begins on the upper auxiliary note and there is no triplet.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. V,29</ref> In percussion notation, a trill is sometimes used to indicate a [[tremolo]]. In French baroque notation, the trill, or ''tremblement'', was notated as a small cross above or beside the note.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-mordent.svg|100px]]\n|'''Upper [[mordent]]'''<br />Rapidly play the principal note, the next higher note (according to key signature) then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In most music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended. In [[handbells]], this symbol is a \"shake\" and indicates the rapid shaking of the bells for the duration of the note.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-inverted-mordent.svg|100px]]\n|'''Lower mordent (inverted)'''<br />Rapidly play the principal note, the note below it, then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In much music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[File:Music-turn-2.svg|60px]][[File:Music-turn (inverted).png|60px]][[File:Music-inverted turn.png|60px]]}}\n|'''[[Turn (music)|Turn]]'''<br />When placed directly above the note, the turn (also known as a ''gruppetto'') indicates a sequence of upper auxiliary note, principal note, lower auxiliary note, and a return to the principal note. When placed to the right of the note, the principal note is played first, followed by the above pattern. Placing a vertical line through the turn symbol or inverting it, it indicates an ''inverted turn'', in which the order of the auxiliary notes is reversed.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-appoggiatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Appoggiatura]]'''<br />The first half of the principal note's duration has the pitch of the grace note (the first two-thirds if the principal note is a dotted note).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-acciaccatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Acciaccatura]]'''<br />The acciaccatura is of very brief duration, as though brushed on the way to the principal note, which receives virtually all of its notated duration. In percussion notation, the acciaccatura symbol denotes the [[Flam (drum rudiment)|flam]] rudiment, the miniature note still positioned behind the main note but on the same line or space of the staff. The flam note is usually played just before the natural durational subdivision the main note is played on, with the timing and duration of the main note remaining unchanged. Also known by the English translation of the Italian term, '''crushed note''', and in German as ''Zusammenschlag'' (simultaneous stroke).\n|}\n\n== Octave signs ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-ottavaalta.svg|100px]]\n| '''Ottava'''<br />''8<sup>va</sup>'' (pronounced ''ottava alta'') is placed {{em|above}} the staff (as shown) to tell the musician to play the passage one [[octave]] higher.<br />When this sign (or in recent notation practice, an ''8<sup>vb</sup>'' \u2013 both signs reading ''ottava bassa'') is placed {{em|below}} the staff, it indicates to play the passage one octave lower.<ref>George Heussenstamm, ''The Norton Manual of Music Notation'' (New York and London: W.

A ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' sign ''below'' the staff indicates ''play the passage two octaves lower''.\n|}\n''8<sup>va</sup>'' and ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' are sometimes abbreviated further to ''8'' and ''15''. When they appear below the staff, the word ''bassa'' is sometimes added.\n\n== Repetition and codas ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tremolo.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music Tremolo shortcut.jpg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tremolo]]'''<br />A rapidly repeated note. If the tremolo is between two notes, then they are played in rapid alternation. The number of slashes through the stem (or number of diagonal bars between two notes) indicates the frequency to repeat (or alternate) the note. As shown here, the note is to be repeated at a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) rate, but it is a common convention for three slashes to be interpreted as \"as fast as possible\", or at any rate at a speed to be left to the player's judgment.<br />In [[percussion notation]], tremolos indicate rolls, [[diddle]]s, and [[Drag (percussion)|drags]]. Typically, a single tremolo line on a sufficiently short note (such as a sixteenth) is played as a drag, and a combination of three stem and tremolo lines indicates a [[double-stroke roll]] (or a [[single-stroke roll]], in the case of [[timpani]], mallet percussion and some untuned percussion instruments such as [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[bass drum]]) for a period equivalent to the duration of the note. In other cases, the interpretation of tremolos is highly variable, and should be examined by the director and performers.<br />The tremolo symbol also represents [[flutter-tonguing]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-repeat.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Repeat sign]]s'''<br />Enclose a passage that is to be played more than once. If there is no left repeat sign, the right repeat sign sends the performer back to the start of the piece or the nearest double bar.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-simile.svg|100px]]\n|'''Simile marks'''<br />Denote that preceding groups of beats or measures are to be repeated. In the examples here, the first usually means to repeat the previous measure, and the second usually means to repeat the previous two measures.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-volte.svg|100px]]\n|'''Volta brackets''' ('''1st and 2nd endings''', or '''1st- and 2nd-time bars''')<br />A repeated passage is to be played with different endings on different playings; it is possible to have more than two endings (1st, 2nd, 3rd ...).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dacapo.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Da capo]]'''<br /> (lit. \"From top\") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music from its beginning. This is usually followed by ''al fine'' (lit. \"to the end\"), which means to repeat to the word ''fine'' and stop, or ''al coda'' (lit. \"to the coda (sign)\"), which means repeat to the coda sign and then jump forward.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dalsegno.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Dal segno]]'''<br /> (lit. \"From the sign\") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music starting at the nearest ''segno''. This is followed by ''al fine'' or ''al coda'' just as with ''da capo''.\n|-\n| [[File:SegnoTeken.svg|50px]]\n|'''Segno'''<br />Mark used with ''dal segno''.\n|-\n| [[File:Coda sign.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Coda (music)|Coda]]'''<br />Indicates a forward jump in the music to its ending passage, marked with the same sign.

On the [[French horn|horn]], this accent indicates a \"stopped note\" (a note played with the stopping hand shoved further into the bell of the horn). In percussion this notation denotes, among many other specific uses, to close the hi-hat by pressing the pedal, or that an instrument is to be \"choked\" (muted with the hand).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-snappizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''Snap pizzicato'''<br />On a stringed instrument, a note played by stretching a string away from the frame of the instrument and letting it go, making it \"snap\" against the frame.

On a valved brass instrument, it means to play the note \"open\" (without lowering any valve, or without mute). In organ notation, this means to play a pedal note with the heel (above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot). In percussion notation this denotes, among many other specific uses, to open the hi-hat by releasing the pedal, or allow an instrument to ring.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-upbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Up bow''' or '''Sull'arco'''<br />On a bowed string instrument, the note is played while drawing the bow upward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with an upstroke.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-downbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Down bow''' or '''Gi\u00f9 arco'''<br />Like ''sull'arco'', except the bow is drawn downward.

Some are used to notate [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[tempo]], [[metre (music)|metre]], [[Duration (music)|duration]] and [[articulation (music)|articulation]] of a [[musical note|note]] or a [[section (music)|passage]] of music. In some cases, symbols provide information about the form of a piece (e.g., how many repeats of a section) or about how to play the note (e.g., with violin family instruments, a note may be bowed or plucked). Some symbols are instrument-specific notation giving the performer information about which finger, hand or foot to use.\n\n==Lines==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px; padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-staff.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staff (music)|Staff]]'''<br />The staff is the fundamental latticework of music notation, on which symbols are placed. The five staff lines and four intervening spaces correspond to pitches of the [[diatonic scale]]; which pitch is meant by a given line or space is defined by the [[clef]]. In British usage, the word \"stave\" is often used.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-ledger.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Ledger line|Ledger or leger lines]]'''<br /> These extend the staff to pitches that fall above or below it.

In general contemporary usage the bracket usually connects the staves of separate instruments (e.g., flute and clarinet; two trumpets; etc.) or multiple vocal parts in a choir or ensemble, whereas the ''brace'' connects multiple parts for a ''single'' instrument (e.g., the right-hand and left-hand staves of a piano or harp part).\n|-\n| [[File:Accolade.svg|30px]]\n|'''Brace'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that are played simultaneously in piano, keyboard, harp, or some pitched percussion music.<ref>[https://sites.coloradocollege.edu/musicengraving/engraving-convention/braces-and-bracket/ \"Music Notation and Engraving \u2013 Braces and Bracket], [[Colorado College]] Music Department</ref> Depending on the instruments playing, the brace (occasionally called an '''accolade''' in some old texts) varies in design and style.\n|}\n\n== Clefs ==\n{{main|Clef}}\nClefs define the pitch range, or [[tessitura]], of the staff on which it is placed. A clef is usually the ''leftmost'' symbol on a staff. Additional clefs may appear in the middle of a staff to indicate a change in register for instruments with a wide range. In early music, clefs could be placed on any of several lines on a staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-GClef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[G clef]] ([[Treble clef]])'''<br />The centre of the spiral assigns the second line from the bottom to the pitch G above middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996>{{cite book |page=49 |last1=Gerou |first1=Tom |last2=Lusk |first2=Linda |date=1996 |title=Essential Dictionary of Music Notation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dictionary-Music-Notation-Pocket/dp/0882847309 |publisher=Alfred Music|isbn=0-88284-768-6}}</ref> The treble clef is the most commonly encountered clef in modern notation, and is used for most modern vocal music. Middle C is the first ledger line below the staff here. \n|-\n| [[File:Music-Cclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[C clef]] ([[Alto clef|Alto]], and [[Tenor clef|Tenor]] clefs)'''<br />These clefs point to the line representing middle C. As illustrated here, it makes the ''center line on the staff'' middle C, and is referred to as the \"alto clef\". This clef is used in modern notation for the [[viola]]. While all clefs can be placed anywhere on the staff to indicate various tessitura, the C clef is most often considered a \"movable\" clef: it is frequently seen pointing instead to the fourth line and called a \"tenor clef\". This clef is used very often in music written for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[trombone]], and [[double bass]]; it replaces the bass clef when the number of ledger lines above the bass staff hinders easy reading.<br /> Until the classical era, the C clef was also frequently seen pointing to other lines, mostly in vocal music, but today this has been supplanted by the universal use of the treble and bass clefs. Modern editions of music from such periods generally transpose the original C clef parts to either treble (female voices), octave treble (tenors), or bass clef (tenors and basses). It can be occasionally seen in modern music on the third space (between the third and fourth lines), in which case it has the same function as an octave treble clef. This unusual practice runs the risk of misreading, however, because the traditional function of all clefs is to identify staff lines, not spaces.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-Fclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[F clef]] ([[Bass clef]])'''<br />The line between the dots in this clef denotes F below middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996 /> Positioned here, it makes the ''second line from the top'' of the staff F below middle C, and is called a \"bass clef\". This clef appears nearly as often as the treble clef, especially in choral music, where it represents the bass and baritone voices. Middle C is the first ledger line above the staff here. In old music, particularly vocal scores, this clef is sometimes encountered centered on the third staff line, in which position it is referred to as a ''baritone clef''; this usage has essentially become obsolete.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-unpitchedclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Neutral clef'''<br />Used for pitchless instruments, such as some of those [[percussion notation|used for percussion]]. Each line can represent a specific percussion instrument within a set, such as in a drum set. Two different styles of neutral clefs are pictured here. It may also be drawn with a separate single-line staff for each untuned percussion instrument.\n|-\n| [[File:Octaveclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Octave clef'''<br />Treble and bass clefs can also be modified by octave numbers. An eight or fifteen above a clef raises the intended pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. Similarly, an eight or fifteen below a clef lowers the pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. A treble clef with an eight below is the most commonly used, typically used for guitar and similar instruments, as well as for tenor parts in choral music.\n|-\n| [[File:Tablature.svg|100px]]\n|'''Tablature'''<br />For stringed instruments, such as the guitar, it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB sign is often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the staff is not necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for standard 6-stringed guitars, six lines would be used). Numbers on the lines show which fret to play the string on. This TAB sign, like the percussion clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a clef. Similarly, the horizontal lines do not constitute a staff in the usual sense, because the spaces between the lines in a tablature are never used.\n|}\n\n== Notes and rests ==\n\n{{main|Note value}}\n[[Musical note]] and [[rest (music)|rest]] values are not absolutely defined, but are proportional in duration to all other note and rest values.

In metered music, beams reflect the rhythmic grouping of notes. They may also group short phrases of notes of the same value, regardless of the meter; this is more common in ametrical passages. In older printings of vocal music, beams are often only used when several notes are to be sung on one syllable of the text \u2013 [[melisma]]tic singing; modern notation encourages the use of beaming in a consistent manner with instrumental engraving, and the presence of beams or flags no longer informs the singer about the lyrics. Today, due to the body of music in which traditional metric states are not always assumed, beaming is at the discretion of composers and arrangers, who often use irregular beams to emphasize a particular rhythmic pattern.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dotnote.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Dotted note]]'''<br />Placing a dot to the right of a notehead lengthens the note's duration by one-half. Additional dots lengthen the previous dot instead of the original note, thus a note with one dot is one and one half its original value, a note with two dots is one and three quarters, a note with three dots is one and seven eighths, and so on. Rests can be dotted in the same manner as notes. In other words, ''n'' dots lengthen the note's or rest's original duration ''d'' to {{nowrap|''d'' \u00d7 (2 \u2212 2<sup>''\u2212n''</sup>)}}.\n|-\n| [[File:Ghost note.png]]\n|'''[[Ghost note]]'''<br />A note with a rhythmic value, but no discernible pitch when played. It is represented by a ([[saltire]]) cross (similar to the letter ''x'') for a note head instead of an oval. Composers will primarily use this notation to represent percussive pitches.  This notation is also used in parts where spoken words are used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-measurerest.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Multiple measure rest|Multi-measure rest]]'''<br />Indicates the number of measures in a resting part without a change in meter to conserve space and to simplify notation.

A common notation for [[quarter tone]]s involves writing the fraction ''{{1/4}}'' next to an arrow pointing up or down. Below are other forms of notation:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-demiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demiflat'''<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by one quarter tone. (Another notation for the demiflat is a flat with a diagonal slash through its stem. In systems where pitches are divided into intervals smaller than a quarter tone, the slashed flat represents a lower note than the reversed flat.)\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat-and-a-half''' (sesquiflat)<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by three [[quarter tone]]s. As with a demiflat, a slashed double-flat symbol is also used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-demisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demisharp'''<br />Raises the pitch of a note by one quarter tone.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Sharp-and-a-half''' (sesquisharp)<br />Raises the pitch of a note by three quarter tones. Occasionally represented with two vertical and three diagonal bars instead.\n|}\n\nA symbol with one vertical and three diagonal bars indicates a sharp with some form of alternate tuning.\n\nIn [[19 equal temperament]], where a whole tone is divided into ''three'' steps instead of two, music is typically notated in a way that flats and sharps are not usually enharmonic (thus a C{{music|#}} represents a third of a step lower than D{{music|b}}); this has the advantage of not requiring any nonstandard notation.\n\n== Time signatures ==\n{{main|Time signature}}\n[[Time signature]]s define the meter of the music. Music is \"marked off\" in uniform sections called bars or measures, and time signatures establish the number of beats in each. This does not necessarily indicate which beats to emphasize, however, so a time signature that conveys information about the way the piece actually sounds is thus chosen. Time signatures tend to ''suggest'' prevailing groupings of beats or pulses.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-timesig.svg|100px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 simple time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 4 represents the crotchet or quarter-note). The top number indicates how many of these note values appear in each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of three crotchets (quarter-notes). For example, {{music|time|3|4}} is pronounced as \"three-four time\" or \"three-quarter time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Compound duple drum pattern.png|200px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 compound time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the ''subdivisions'' of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 8 represents the quaver or eighth-note). The top number indicates how many of these subdivisions appear in each measure. Usually each beat is composed of three subdivisions. To derive the unit of the basic pulse in compound meters, double this value and add a dot, and divide the top number by 3 to determine how many of these pulses there are each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of two dotted crotchets (dotted quarter-notes). This is pronounced as \"Six-Eight Time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Music-commontime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Common time]]'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|4|4}} time. It derives from the broken circle that represented \"imperfect\" duple meter in fourteenth-century [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|mensural time signatures]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-cuttime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Alla breve]] or Cut time'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|2|2}} time, indicating two minim (or half-note) beats per measure. Here, a crotchet (or quarter note) would get half a beat.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-metronome.svg|80px]]\n|'''[[Metronome]] mark'''<br />Written at the start of a score, and at any significant change of tempo, this symbol precisely defines the tempo of the music by assigning absolute durations to all note values within the score. In this particular example, the performer is told that 120 crotchets, or quarter notes, fit into one minute of time. Many publishers precede the marking with letters \"'''M.M.'''\", referring to [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel|Maelzel]]'s [[Metronome]].\n|}\n\n== Note relationships ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tie.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tie (music)|Tie]]'''<br />Indicates that the two (or more) notes joined together are to be played as one note with the time values added together. To be a tie, the notes must be identical \u2013 that is, they must be on the same line or the same space. Otherwise, it is a slur (see below).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-slur.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-legato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Slur (music)|Slur]]'''<br />Indicates to play two or more notes in one physical stroke, one uninterrupted breath, or (on instruments with neither breath nor bow) connected into a phrase as if played in a single breath. In certain contexts, a slur may only indicate to play the notes [[legato]]. In this case, rearticulation is permitted.<br />Slurs and ties are similar in appearance. A tie is distinguishable because it always joins two immediately adjacent notes of the same pitch, whereas a slur may join any number of notes of varying pitches. In vocal music a slur normally indicates that notes grouped together by the slur should be sung to a single syllable.<br />A ''phrase mark'' (or less commonly, ''ligature'') is a mark that is visually identical to a slur, but connects a passage of music over several measures. A phrase mark indicates a musical phrase and may not necessarily require that the music be slurred.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-glissando.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Glissando]]''' or '''[[Portamento]]'''<br />A continuous, unbroken glide from one note to the next that includes the pitches between. Some instruments, such as the trombone, timpani, non-fretted string instruments, electronic instruments, and the human voice can make this glide continuously (portamento), while other instruments such as the piano or mallet instruments blur the discrete pitches between the start and end notes to mimic a continuous slide (glissando).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triplet.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tuplet]]'''<br />A number of notes of irregular duration are performed within the duration of a given number of notes of regular time value; e.g., five notes played in the normal duration of four notes; seven notes played in the normal duration of two; three notes played in the normal duration of four. Tuplets are named according to the number of irregular notes; e.g., duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triad.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Chord (music)|Chord]]'''<br />Several notes sounded simultaneously (\"solid\" or \"block\"), or in succession (\"broken\"). Two-note chords are called a '''[[dyad (music)|dyad]]''' or an [[Interval (music)|'''interval''']]; three-note chords built from generic third intervals are called '''[[triad (music)|triads]]'''. A chord may contain any number of notes.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-arpeggio.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiated]] chord'''<br />A chord with notes played in rapid succession, usually ascending, each note being sustained as the others are played. It is also called a \"broken chord\" or \"rolled chord\".\n|}\n\n== Dynamics ==\n{{main|Dynamics (music)}}\nDynamics are indicators of the relative intensity or volume of a musical line.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music dynamic pianississimo.svg|73px]]\n|'''Pianississimo'''<ref name=ppp group=D>Dynamics with 3 letters (i.e., {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) are often referred to by adding an extra \"iss\" (''pianissimo'' to ''pianississimo'').

Dynamics are relative, and the meaning of each level is at the discretion of the performer or, in the case of ensembles, the conductor. However, modern legislation to curb high noise levels in the workplace in an effort to prevent damage to musicians' hearing has posed a challenge to the interpretation of very loud dynamics in some large orchestral works, as noise levels within the orchestra itself can easily exceed safe levels when all instruments are playing at full volume<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/arts/music/20noise.html \"No Fortissimo?

Subito is commonly used with sforzandos, but can appear with all other dynamic notations, most commonly as {{serif|'''''sff'''''}} (subitofortissimo) or {{serif|'''''spp'''''}} (subitopianissimo).\n\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-forte-piano.png|50px]]\n|'''[[Fortepiano (musical dynamic)|Forte-piano]]'''<br />A section of music in which the music should initially be played loudly (''forte''), then immediately softly (''piano'').\n|}\n\nAnother value that rarely appears is ''[[niente]]'' or {{serif|'''''n'''''}}, which means \"nothing\". This may be used at the end of a diminuendo to indicate \"fade out to nothing\".\n\n== Articulation marks ==\n[[Articulation (music)|Articulations]] (or [[Accent (music)|accents]]) specify how to perform individual notes within a phrase or passage. They can be fine-tuned by combining more than one such symbol over or under a note. They may also appear in conjunction with phrasing marks listed above.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-staccato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccato]]'''<br />This indicates the musician should ''play the note shorter than notated'', usually half the value; the rest of the metric value is then silent. Staccato marks may appear on notes of any value, shortening their performed duration without speeding the music itself.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-staccatissimo.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccatissimo]]''' or '''[[Spiccato]]'''<br />Indicates a ''longer silence after the note'' (as described above), making the note very short. Usually applied to quarter notes or shorter. (In the past, this marking\u2019s meaning was more ambiguous: it sometimes was used interchangeably with staccato, and sometimes indicated an accent and not staccato. These usages are now almost defunct, but still appear in some scores.) In string instruments this indicates a bowing technique in which the bow bounces lightly upon the string.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Accent (music)|Accent]] '''<br />Play the note louder, or with a harder attack than surrounding unaccented notes. May appear on notes of any duration.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-tenuto.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tenuto]]'''<br />This symbol indicates ''play the note at its full value, or slightly longer''. It can also indicate a degree of emphasis, especially when combined with dynamic markings to indicate a change in loudness, or combined with a staccato dot to indicate a slight detachment (''[[portato]]'' or ''[[mezzo staccato]]'').\n|-\n| [[File:Music-strong-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Marcato]]'''<br />''Play the note somewhat louder or more forcefully than a note with a regular accent mark'' (open horizontal wedge). In organ notation, this means ''play a pedal note with the toe''. Above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-fermata.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Fermata]] (Pause)'''<br />A note, chord, or rest sustained longer than its customary value. Usually appears over all parts at the same metrical location in a piece, to show a halt in [[tempo]]. It can be placed above or below the note. The fermata is held for as long as the performer or conductor desires, but is often set as twice the original value of the designated notes.\n|}\n\n== Ornaments ==\nOrnaments modify the pitch pattern of individual notes.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-trill.svg|100px]][[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Trill (music)|Trill]]'''<br />A rapid alternation between the specified note and the next higher note (according to key signature) within its duration, also called a \"shake\". When followed by a wavy horizontal line, this symbol indicates an extended, or running, trill. In modern music the trill begins on the main note and ends with the lower [[auxiliary note]] then the main note, which requires a triplet immediately before the turn. In music up to the time of Haydn or Mozart the trill begins on the upper auxiliary note and there is no triplet.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. V,29</ref> In percussion notation, a trill is sometimes used to indicate a [[tremolo]]. In French baroque notation, the trill, or ''tremblement'', was notated as a small cross above or beside the note.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-mordent.svg|100px]]\n|'''Upper [[mordent]]'''<br />Rapidly play the principal note, the next higher note (according to key signature) then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In most music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended. In [[handbells]], this symbol is a \"shake\" and indicates the rapid shaking of the bells for the duration of the note.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-inverted-mordent.svg|100px]]\n|'''Lower mordent (inverted)'''<br />Rapidly play the principal note, the note below it, then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In much music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[File:Music-turn-2.svg|60px]][[File:Music-turn (inverted).png|60px]][[File:Music-inverted turn.png|60px]]}}\n|'''[[Turn (music)|Turn]]'''<br />When placed directly above the note, the turn (also known as a ''gruppetto'') indicates a sequence of upper auxiliary note, principal note, lower auxiliary note, and a return to the principal note. When placed to the right of the note, the principal note is played first, followed by the above pattern. Placing a vertical line through the turn symbol or inverting it, it indicates an ''inverted turn'', in which the order of the auxiliary notes is reversed.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-appoggiatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Appoggiatura]]'''<br />The first half of the principal note's duration has the pitch of the grace note (the first two-thirds if the principal note is a dotted note).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-acciaccatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Acciaccatura]]'''<br />The acciaccatura is of very brief duration, as though brushed on the way to the principal note, which receives virtually all of its notated duration. In percussion notation, the acciaccatura symbol denotes the [[Flam (drum rudiment)|flam]] rudiment, the miniature note still positioned behind the main note but on the same line or space of the staff. The flam note is usually played just before the natural durational subdivision the main note is played on, with the timing and duration of the main note remaining unchanged. Also known by the English translation of the Italian term, '''crushed note''', and in German as ''Zusammenschlag'' (simultaneous stroke).\n|}\n\n== Octave signs ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-ottavaalta.svg|100px]]\n| '''Ottava'''<br />''8<sup>va</sup>'' (pronounced ''ottava alta'') is placed {{em|above}} the staff (as shown) to tell the musician to play the passage one [[octave]] higher.<br />When this sign (or in recent notation practice, an ''8<sup>vb</sup>'' \u2013 both signs reading ''ottava bassa'') is placed {{em|below}} the staff, it indicates to play the passage one octave lower.<ref>George Heussenstamm, ''The Norton Manual of Music Notation'' (New York and London: W. W. Norton & Company), p. 16</ref><ref>Anthony Donato, ''Preparing Music Manuscript'' (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc.), pp. 42-43</ref>\n|-\n|[[File:Music-quindicesimaalta.svg|100px]]\n| '''Quindicesima'''<br />The ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' sign is placed ''above'' the staff (as shown) to mean ''play the passage two octaves higher''. A ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' sign ''below'' the staff indicates ''play the passage two octaves lower''.\n|}\n''8<sup>va</sup>'' and ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' are sometimes abbreviated further to ''8'' and ''15''. When they appear below the staff, the word ''bassa'' is sometimes added.\n\n== Repetition and codas ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tremolo.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music Tremolo shortcut.jpg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tremolo]]'''<br />A rapidly repeated note. If the tremolo is between two notes, then they are played in rapid alternation. The number of slashes through the stem (or number of diagonal bars between two notes) indicates the frequency to repeat (or alternate) the note. As shown here, the note is to be repeated at a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) rate, but it is a common convention for three slashes to be interpreted as \"as fast as possible\", or at any rate at a speed to be left to the player's judgment.<br />In [[percussion notation]], tremolos indicate rolls, [[diddle]]s, and [[Drag (percussion)|drags]]. Typically, a single tremolo line on a sufficiently short note (such as a sixteenth) is played as a drag, and a combination of three stem and tremolo lines indicates a [[double-stroke roll]] (or a [[single-stroke roll]], in the case of [[timpani]], mallet percussion and some untuned percussion instruments such as [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[bass drum]]) for a period equivalent to the duration of the note. In other cases, the interpretation of tremolos is highly variable, and should be examined by the director and performers.<br />The tremolo symbol also represents [[flutter-tonguing]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-repeat.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Repeat sign]]s'''<br />Enclose a passage that is to be played more than once. If there is no left repeat sign, the right repeat sign sends the performer back to the start of the piece or the nearest double bar.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-simile.svg|100px]]\n|'''Simile marks'''<br />Denote that preceding groups of beats or measures are to be repeated. In the examples here, the first usually means to repeat the previous measure, and the second usually means to repeat the previous two measures.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-volte.svg|100px]]\n|'''Volta brackets''' ('''1st and 2nd endings''', or '''1st- and 2nd-time bars''')<br />A repeated passage is to be played with different endings on different playings; it is possible to have more than two endings (1st, 2nd, 3rd ...).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dacapo.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Da capo]]'''<br /> (lit. \"From top\") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music from its beginning. This is usually followed by ''al fine'' (lit. \"to the end\"), which means to repeat to the word ''fine'' and stop, or ''al coda'' (lit. \"to the coda (sign)\"), which means repeat to the coda sign and then jump forward.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dalsegno.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Dal segno]]'''<br /> (lit. \"From the sign\") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music starting at the nearest ''segno''. This is followed by ''al fine'' or ''al coda'' just as with ''da capo''.\n|-\n| [[File:SegnoTeken.svg|50px]]\n|'''Segno'''<br />Mark used with ''dal segno''.\n|-\n| [[File:Coda sign.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Coda (music)|Coda]]'''<br />Indicates a forward jump in the music to its ending passage, marked with the same sign. Only used after playing through a ''D.S. al coda'' (Dal segno al coda) or ''D.C. al coda'' (Da capo al coda).\n|}\n\n== Instrument-specific notation ==\n=== Bowed string instruments ===\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Bart\u00f3k pizzicato|Left-hand pizzicato]]''' or '''[[Stopped note]]'''<br />A note on a stringed instrument where the string is plucked with the left hand (the hand that usually stops the strings) rather than bowed. On the [[French horn|horn]], this accent indicates a \"stopped note\" (a note played with the stopping hand shoved further into the bell of the horn). In percussion this notation denotes, among many other specific uses, to close the hi-hat by pressing the pedal, or that an instrument is to be \"choked\" (muted with the hand).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-snappizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''Snap pizzicato'''<br />On a stringed instrument, a note played by stretching a string away from the frame of the instrument and letting it go, making it \"snap\" against the frame. Also known as a [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] pizzicato.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-harmonic.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Harmonic#Harmonics on stringed instruments|Natural harmonic]]''' or '''Open note'''<br />On a stringed instrument, means to play a natural harmonic (also called '''flageolet'''). On a valved brass instrument, it means to play the note \"open\" (without lowering any valve, or without mute). In organ notation, this means to play a pedal note with the heel (above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot). In percussion notation this denotes, among many other specific uses, to open the hi-hat by releasing the pedal, or allow an instrument to ring.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-upbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Up bow''' or '''Sull'arco'''<br />On a bowed string instrument, the note is played while drawing the bow upward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with an upstroke.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-downbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Down bow''' or '''Gi\u00f9 arco'''<br />Like ''sull'arco'', except the bow is drawn downward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with a downstroke.\n|}\n\n=== Guitar ===\n\nThe guitar has a [[fingerpicking]] notation system derived from the names of the fingers in Spanish or Latin. They are written above, below, or beside the note to which they are attached. They read as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Symbol !! Spanish !! Italian !! Latin !! English !!

He went to study journalism and joined the communist party. In 1969 he finished university and started working for the ''[[Pravda]]'' newspaper. After the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] was outlawed in 1991, Seleznyov quit it. In 1993, however, he joined the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] led by [[Gennadiy Zyuganov]].\n\n==First term as the Speaker of the Duma==\nIn the 1995 Parliamentary elections in Russia, the Communist Party took the majority. However, Zyuganov did not become the speaker of the Duma as he was too busy with his 1996 Presidential campaign. Instead, he offered the job to his fellow communist Gennadiy Seleznyov. Seleznyov took office in 1996.\n\nAs speaker Seleznyov protested against many reforms of President [[Boris Yeltsin]] and the Party rejected several reforms like the proposed complete denationalization of land in 1998. When Prime Minister [[Sergei Kiriyenko]] opened the markets, Seleznyov protested saying the Russian economy wasn't ready yet. In 1999 the Communist Party once again took the largest number of seats and Seleznyov was re-inaugurated.\n\n==Preemptive Announcement of Volgodonsk Bombings==\n\nSeleznyov gained a degree of infamy during his time as speaker for his announcement, shortly before an apartment bombing in Moscow, that an apartment building in Volgodonsk had been bombed<ref>Goldfarb, Alexander; Litvinenko, Marina (2007), Death of a Dissident, Simon & Schuster, ISBN 978-1-4165-5165-2 </ref>.

(2005). Revisiting Russia's apartment block blasts. Journal of Slavic Military Studies, 18(4), 599-606.</ref>.\n\n==Governor candidate==\nIn 1999 Gennadiy Seleznyov also ran for [[Governor of Moscow Oblast]]. However, he lost to the former general and vice presidential candidate [[Boris Gromov]].\n\n==Second term==\n[[File:Vladimir Putin 21 November 2001-7.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Gennadiy Seleznyov and [[Vladimir Putin]], 21 November 2001]]\nSeleznyov originally supported the new President [[Vladimir Putin]] when the latter made a majority, making an alliance with the centrists and the ultra-rightist [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]]. He supported Putin on most issues. When in 2001 the communists lost many seats he surprisingly did not protest. Seleznyov then said that the Communist Party had to adapt to the new generation and to adopt liberal social values creating a Eurocommunist party. However, party leader [[Gennadiy Zyuganov]] dismissed such calls and in 2002 Seleznyov was expelled from the party.\n\n==Independent==\nFollowing his expulsion, Seleznyov remained the Duma Speaker. However, he was frequently attacked by both the leftists and the rightists. He received support from former Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and was considered a Social Democrat. In 2003 the party [[United Russia]] supporting President Putin took the majority in the Duma and [[Boris Gryzlov]] became the new Speaker.  Seleznov stood for the Duma as the leader of a new party, the [[Party of Russia's Rebirth]].  The party did very badly although Seleznov won a single member mandate in [[St Petersburg]], beating liberal MP [[Irina Khakamada]].\n\n==Personal life and death==\nSeleznyov had a son, [[Kirill Gennadiyevich Seleznyov|Kirill Seleznyov]] (b. 1974), who is a prominent Russian businessman and a top-manager of [[Gazprom]]. Gennadiy Seleznyov died from complications due to [[lung cancer]] in Moscow on 19 July 2015.<ref name=Kommersant_death>{{cite news|title=\u0423\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0432|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2771927|agency=[[Kommersant]]|date=19 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* [[Order For Merit to the Fatherland]], 2nd class\n* [[Order of Friendship of Peoples]]\n* Medal of Merit for the [[Stavropol Krai]] (2003)\n* [[Order of Francesc Skarina]] ([[Belarus]], 2001)\n* \"Person of the Year\" award\n* \"Silver Cross\" of the Russian Biographical Institute\n* Gold badge of honour \"Public Recognition\"\n* \"Dove of Peace\" of the International Public Foundation \"World Without Wars\" (Moscow)\n* Academician and Member of the International Academy of Social Sciences\n* Associate Professor of the [[Moscow University for the Humanities]]\n* Honorary Professor of Journalism, [[St. Petersburg State University]]\n* Member of the International Academy of Information Technology\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|Gennady Seleznyov}}\n\n{{Chairman of the State Duma}}\n{{Communist Party of the Russian Federation}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box | before = [[Ivan Rybkin]] | title = [[Chairman of the State Duma]] | years =17 January 1996-29 December 2003 | after = [[Boris Gryzlov]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seleznyov, Gennadiy}}\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:2015 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Serov]]\n[[Category:Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union members]]\n[[Category:Communist Party of the Russian Federation members]]\n[[Category:Party of Russia's Rebirth politicians]]\n[[Category:Patriots of Russia politicians]]\n[[Category:Chairman of the State Duma]]\n[[Category:First convocation members of the State Duma (Russian Federation)]]\n[[Category:Second convocation members of the State Duma (Russian Federation)]]\n[[Category:Third convocation members of the State Duma (Russian Federation)]]\n[[Category:Fourth convocation members of the State Duma (Russian Federation)]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\", 2nd class]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Friendship of Peoples]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Francysk Skaryna]]\n[[Category:Burials in Troyekurovskoye Cemetery]]\n", "text_old": "{{BLP sources|date=April 2011}}\n{{Infobox Speaker\n| name                =Gennadiy Seleznyov<br /><small>\u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0451\u0432</small>\n| image               =Gennady Seleznyov (2000-01-18).jpg\n| imagesize           =\n| office              = 1st Leader of the [[Party of Russia's Rebirth]]\n| term_start          = 29 October 2002\n| term_end            = 19 July 2015\n| successor           = [[Viktor Arkhipov]] (acting)<br>[[Igor Ashurbeyli]]\n| order1               =[[List of Chairmen of the State Duma|7th]]\n| office1              = Chairman of the State Duma\n| term_start1          =17 January 1996\n| term_end1            =29 December 2003\n| predecessor1         =[[Ivan Rybkin]]\n| successor1           =[[Boris Gryzlov]]\n| office2              = Member of the [[State Duma]]\n| term_start2          =12 December 1993\n| term_end2            =2 December 2007\n| birth_name          = Gennadiy Nikolayevich Seleznyov\n| birth_date          ={{Birth date|df=yes|1947|11|6}}\n| birth_place         =[[Serov (town)|Serov]], [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], [[RSFSR]]\n| death_date          ={{Death date and age|2015|7|19|1947|11|6|df=y}}\n| death_place         =[[Moscow]], Russia\n|nationality       = [[Russian nationality|Russian]]\n| party               =[[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] (1968\u20132002) [[Party of Russia's Rebirth]] (2002\u20132015)\n| spouse              =Irina Seleznyova\n| children            =Tatyana Seleznyova and [[Kirill Gennadiyevich Seleznyov|Kirill Seleznyov]]\n| relations           =\n| residence           =\n| alma_mater          =[[Saint Petersburg State University]]\n| religion            =\n| website             =\n| footnotes           =\n}}\n'''Gennadiy Nikolayevich Seleznyov''' ({{lang-ru|\u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0451\u0432}};
