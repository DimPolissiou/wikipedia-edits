Prior to construction of the light rail, [[Hillsbus]] and [[State Transit Authority|State Transit]] bus routes using George Street were permanently removed from the street. The network will be further redesigned when the light rail opens in 2020. Some bus routes from the Eastern Suburbs will be removed from the CBD, with many of the routes integrated with the light rail interchanges at Randwick and Kingsford. Some passengers will be required to change from bus to light rail to complete their journey.\n\nTo accommodate construction of the light rail on George Street, new bus timetables were introduced on 4 October 2015. Buses were diverted from George Street on to other streets in the CBD, including [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]], [[Castlereagh Street, Sydney|Castlereagh]], [[Park Street, Sydney|Park]], Druitt, Clarence and [[York Street, Sydney|York]] Streets.<ref name=\"TfNSW28May15\" /> Some routes had their terminus changed to such places as [[Railway Square]], [[Queen Victoria Building]] and [[King Street Wharf]].

The government claimed the increase was due to the design modifications, but a 2016 report produced by the Audit Office of New South Wales found that the increase was largely due to TfNSW underestimating the cost of the project.<ref name=\"dec design adjustment\">{{cite web |url = http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/cbd-and-south-east-light-rail-improvements-deliver-better-service-customers |title = CBD and South East Light Rail improvements to deliver a better service for customers |date=2 December 2014 |publisher=Transport for NSW |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214174608/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/cbd-and-south-east-light-rail-improvements-deliver-better-service-customers |archive-date=14 December 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-light-rail-line-costs-blow-out-to-22-billion--600-million-more-than-budgeted-20141109-11jazn.html Sydney light rail line costs blow out to $2.2 billion \u2013 $600 million more than budgeted] ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 10 November 2014/</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Costs are higher and benefits are lower than the approved business case |url = http://www.audit.nsw.gov.au/publications/latest-reports/performance/cbd-and-south-east-light-rail-project/executive-summary/1-executive-summary |publisher = Audit Office of New South Wales |accessdate = 1 December 2016 |date = 30 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\nA [[pedestrian zone]] was established along approximately 40% of George Street, between [[Bathurst Street, Sydney|Bathurst]] and [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter]] Streets.<ref name=\"TransportNSW13Dec12\" /><ref name=\"SSIA Supporting Document\">{{cite web |url = http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/projects/CSELR_State_Infrastructure_Application_June_2013.pdf |title = CBD and South East Light Rail \u2013 State Significant Infrastructure Application Supporting Document |publisher=[[Transport for NSW]] |date=21 June 2013 |accessdate = 12 July 2013 |page = 23 |url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927100041/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/projects/CSELR_State_Infrastructure_Application_June_2013.pdf |archivedate = 27 September 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=modificationreport>{{cite web|title=CBD and South East Light Rail \u2013 Modifications Report|url=https://majorprojects.affinitylive.com/public/bd9fa8e85aeb4396512d5e710e3d8da5/20141202_01_CBD_and_South_East_light_rail_modifications_report.pdf|publisher=Transport for NSW|accessdate=3 December 2014|pages=10\u201311, 17\u201321, 25, 46\u201349, 52}}</ref>\n\nThe section between Bathurst Street and Circular Quay is wire-free, with trams using [[Alstom]]'s proprietary [[ground-level power supply]] technology to run instead.<ref>{{cite news |last=Campion|first=Vikki |title=Sydney's new light rail system will feature futuristic wire-free trams to ensure clutter-free streets |url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/sydney8217s-new-light-rail-system-will-feature-futuristic-wirefree-trams-to-ensure-clutterfree-streets/story-fni0cx12-1226714773633 |newspaper=Daily Telegraph }}</ref> This was originally to have been achieved by equipping the trams with batteries and providing recharging facilities at stops.\n\nThe line is designed to handle special events in the [[Moore Park, New South Wales#Sports and recreation|Moore Park precinct]] and at [[Randwick Racecourse]].

The network will be further redesigned when the light rail opens in 2020. Some bus routes from the Eastern Suburbs will be removed from the CBD, with many of the routes integrated with the light rail interchanges at Randwick and Kingsford. Some passengers will be required to change from bus to light rail to complete their journey.\n\nTo accommodate construction of the light rail on George Street, new bus timetables were introduced on 4 October 2015. Buses were diverted from George Street on to other streets in the CBD, including [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]], [[Castlereagh Street, Sydney|Castlereagh]], [[Park Street, Sydney|Park]], Druitt, Clarence and [[York Street, Sydney|York]] Streets.<ref name=\"TfNSW28May15\" /> Some routes had their terminus changed to such places as [[Railway Square]], [[Queen Victoria Building]] and [[King Street Wharf]].

Some bus routes which were diverted from George Street to other streets during the construction, were proposed to terminate at Railway Square with their passengers to join the Light Rail while others will be rerouted permanently to the streets to which they were diverted.<ref name=\"EISVol2128132\">{{cite web|url=http://data.sydneylightrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/s3fs-public/CSELR_EIS_Volume_2.pdf|title=CSELR-Environmental-Impact-Statement Volume 2: Technical Papers 1 & 2|publisher=Transport for NSW|date=14 November 2013|accessdate=2 May 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401092645/http://data.sydneylightrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/s3fs-public/CSELR_EIS_Volume_2.pdf|archivedate=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Twenty bus routes were proposed to be withdrawn or curtailed between Kingsford/Randwick and Railway Square/Circular Quay. A number of bus routes using Anzac Parade would unload city bound passengers at the Nine Ways (now Juniors Kingsford) interchange to board the light rail, then continue along Anzac Parade to the [[University of New South Wales]] to unload passengers before terminating in Todman Avenue, Kensington. Some bus routes that were currently operating to the city via Randwick would become feeder services that drop off city bound passengers at the light rail terminus.\n\nThe proposed changes for the Eastern Suburbs bus routes as per the EIS were as follows:<ref name=\"EISVol2128132\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!colspan=\"4\"| Proposed Eastern Suburbs bus route changes\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\"| Route buses\n|-\n!

Consequently, the platform length was reduced from 90 metres to 75 metres.<ref name=\"dec design adjustment\"/><ref name=modificationreport/>\n\nCommunity submissions responding to the changes in the Modifications Report raised concerns about the safety of a large number of school students crossing the tracks during peak schools hours.

The soil is loosy, limy sand, while between the [[Marcal]] and [[R\u00e1ba]] rivers clay is the main component of the soil. The landscape is a [[plain]], with some hills and plateaus  with 114\u2013120 m above the sea level.\n\n==The history of the village==\nThe chronicles mention the village with several names: Kisszentmikl\u00f3s, Kerekszentmikl\u00f3s on the basis of its rotunda church from the 11th century. Charters from the \u00c1rp\u00e1d-house kings of Hungary mentions the village first from 1287 A. D., when [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] gives the village to Gergely de genere Osl, for his home defending merits. During the Mongolian invasion of 1241-1242 the village was destroyed. [[Lajos I of Hungary]] gives the village to the Kanizsay family. Then the Turkish invasion destroys the village in the 16th century. The Bishop of Gy\u0151r refounds the village in 1701. The old rotunda church has been rebuilt in the first years of the 20th century.\n\n==Sightseeings==\n*The rotunda of the 11th century.\n*The memorial of the heroes of the World Wars.\n*The [[Marcal]] river.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Gervers-Moln\u00e1r, V.

The soil is loosy, limy sand, while between the [[Marcal]] and [[R\u00e1ba]] rivers clay is the main component of the soil. The landscape is a [[plain]], with some hills and plateaus  with 114\u2013120 m above the sea level. \n\n==The history of the village==\nThe chronicles mention the village with several names: Kisszentmikl\u00f3s, Kerekszentmikl\u00f3s on the basis of its rotunda church from the 11th century. Charters from the \u00c1rp\u00e1d-house kings of Hungary mentions the village first from 1287 A. D., when [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] gives the village to Gergely de genere Osl, for his home defending merits. During the Mongolian invasion of 1241-1242 the village was destroyed. [[Lajos I of Hungary]] gives the village to the Kanizsay family. Then the Turkish invasion destroys the village in the 16th century. The Bishop of Gy\u0151r refounds the village in 1701. The old rotunda church has been rebuilt in the first years of the 20th century. \n\n==Sightseeings==\n*The rotunda of the 11th century.\n*The memorial of the heroes of the World Wars.\n*The [[Marcal]] river.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Gervers-Moln\u00e1r, V.
