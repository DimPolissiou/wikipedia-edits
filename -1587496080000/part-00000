The distinct identity of African-American culture is rooted in the historical experience of the African-American people, including the [[Middle Passage]]. The culture is both distinct and enormously influential on American and global worldwide culture as a whole.\n\nAfrican-American culture is rooted in the blend between the cultures of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]] and the Anglo-Celtic culture that has influenced and modified its development in the American South. Understanding its identity within the [[culture of the United States]], it is, in the anthropological sense, conscious of its origins as largely a blend of West and Central African cultures. Although slavery greatly restricted the ability of African-Americans to practice their original cultural traditions, many practices, values and beliefs survived, and over time have modified and/or blended with [[Culture of Europe|European cultures]] and other cultures such as that of [[Native Americans in the United States|Amerindians]]. African-American identity was established during the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery period]], producing a dynamic culture that has had and continues to have a profound impact on American culture as a whole, as well as that of the broader world.<ref name=\" Gomez\">{{cite book|last=Gomez|first=Michael Angelo|title=Exchanging Our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0807861715|page=[https://archive.org/details/exchangingourcou0000gome/page/12 12]|url=https://archive.org/details/exchangingourcou0000gome/page/12}}</ref>\n\nElaborate rituals and ceremonies were a significant part of African-Americans' ancestral culture. Many West African societies traditionally believed that spirits dwelled in their surrounding nature. From this disposition, they treated their environment with mindful care. They also generally believed that a spiritual life source existed after death and that ancestors in this spiritual realm could then mediate between the supreme [[Supreme Being|Creator]] and the living. Honor and prayer were displayed to these \"ancient ones\", the spirit of that past. West Africans also believed in spiritual possession.<ref name=\"Carson\">Clayborn Carson, Emma J. Lapsansky-Werner, and Gary B. Nash, ''The Struggle for Freedom: A History of African Americans, Vol 1 to 1877'' (Prentice Hall, 2012), p. 18.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Christianity began to spread across North Africa; this shift in religion began displacing traditional African spiritual practices. The enslaved Africans brought this complex religious dynamic within their culture to America. This fusion of traditional African beliefs with Christianity provided a commonplace for those practicing religion in Africa and America.<ref name=\"Carson\"/>\n\nAfter [[Slavery in the United States#The end of slavery|emancipation]], unique African-American traditions continued to flourish, as distinctive traditions or radical innovations in music, art, literature, religion, cuisine, and other fields. 20th-century sociologists, such as [[Gunnar Myrdal]], believed that African-Americans had lost most of their cultural ties with Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last=James |first=Jessica S. |title=What Neighborhood Poverty Studies Can Learn from African American Studies |date=June 2008 |journal=[[The Journal of Pan African Studies]] |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=26 |url=http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol2no4/2.4_What_Neighborhood_Poverty_Studies_Can_Learn_from_African_American_Studies.pdf }}</ref> But, anthropological field research by [[Melville J.

The physical isolation and societal marginalization of [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] and, later, of their free progeny, however, facilitated the retention of significant elements of traditional culture among Africans in the New World generally, and in the United States in particular. Slave owners deliberately tried to repress independent political or cultural organization in order to deal with the many slave rebellions or acts of resistance that took place in the United States, [[Brazil]], [[Haiti]], and the [[History of Guyana#Early colonization|Dutch Guyanas]].<ref>Price, Richard (1996). ''Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas''.

The imprint of Africa is evident in a myriad of ways: in politics, economics, language, music, hairstyles, fashion, dance, religion, cuisine, and worldview.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&psid=3043|title=Digital History|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu}}</ref>\n\nIn turn, African-American culture has had a pervasive, transformative impact on many elements of mainstream American culture. This process of mutual creative exchange is called [[creolization]].<ref name=\"slave_culture\"/> Over time, the culture of African slaves and their descendants has been ubiquitous in its impact on not only the dominant American culture, but on world culture as well.<ref>Genevi\u00e8ve Fabre, Robert G. O'Meally (1994). ''History and Memory in African-American Culture''. Oxford University Press. pp. 12\u2013208.</ref>\n\n===Oral tradition===\nSlaveholders limited or prohibited education of enslaved African-Americans because they feared it might empower their chattel and inspire or enable emancipatory ambitions. In the United States, the legislation that denied slaves formal education likely contributed to their maintaining a strong oral tradition, a common feature of indigenous African cultures.<ref name=\"oral\">{{cite web |author1=Maggie Papa |author2=Amy Gerber |author3=Abeer Mohamed |publisher=[[George Washington University]]|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~e73afram/ag-am-mp.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527050107/http://www.gwu.edu/~e73afram/ag-am-mp.html|archivedate=May 27, 2008 |title=African American Culture through Oral Tradition |accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref> African-based oral traditions became the primary means of preserving history, mores, and other cultural information among the people. This was consistent with the ''[[griot]]'' practices of oral history in many African and other cultures that did not rely on the written word. Many of these cultural elements have been passed from generation to generation through storytelling. The folktales provided African-Americans the opportunity to inspire and educate one another.<ref name=\"oral\"/>\n\nExamples of African-American folktales include [[trickster]] tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ug97/remus/anatar.html |title=Editor's Analysis of \"The Wonderful Tar Baby Story\" |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |accessdate=October 7, 2007}}</ref> and [[hero]]ic tales such as that of [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/john_henry/index.html |title=John Henry: The Steel Driving Man |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |publisher=[[ibiblio]]}}</ref> The ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' stories by [[Joel Chandler Harris]] helped to bring African-American folk tales into mainstream adoption.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncleremus.com/index.html |title=Uncle Remus |publisher=UncleRemus.com |year=2003 |accessdate=October 10, 2007}}</ref> Harris did not appreciate the complexity of the stories nor their potential for a lasting impact on society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncleremus.com/preface.html |title=EDITOR'S PREFACES |publisher=UncleRemus.com |year=2003 |accessdate=October 10, 2007}}</ref> Other narratives that appear as important, recurring motifs in African-American culture are the \"[[Signifying Monkey]]\", \"The Ballad of Shine\", and the legend of [[Stagger Lee (song)|Stagger Lee]].\n\nThe legacy of the African-American oral tradition manifests in diverse forms. African-American preachers tend to perform rather than simply speak. The emotion of the subject is carried through the speaker's tone, volume, and cadence, which tend to mirror the rising action, climax, and descending action of the sermon. The meaning of this manner of preaching is not easily understood by [[Euro-Americans]] or others of non-African origin. Often song, dance, verse, and structured pauses are placed throughout the sermon. [[Call and response]] is another pervasive element of the African-American oral tradition. It manifests in worship in what is commonly referred to as the \"amen corner\". In direct contrast to the tradition present in American and European cultures, it is an acceptable and common audience reaction to interrupt and affirm the speaker.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RvSIg9of6TYC |title=A Fire in the Bones: Reflections on African-American Religious History |last=Raboteau |first=Albert J. |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |isbn=0-8070-0933-4 |year=1995}}</ref>  This pattern of interaction is also in evidence in music, particularly in blues and jazz forms. Hyperbolic and provocative, even incendiary, rhetoric is another aspect of African-American oral tradition often evident in the pulpit in a tradition sometimes referred to as \"prophetic speech\".<ref>Fabre and O'Meally, pp. 219\u2013244.</ref>\n\nModernity and migration of [[Black people|black]] communities to the North has had a history of placing strain on the retention of black cultural practices and traditions. The urban and radically different spaces in which black culture was being produced raised fears in anthropologists and sociologists that the southern black folk aspect of black popular culture were at risk of being lost in history. The study over the fear of losing black popular cultural roots from the South have a topic of interest to many anthropologists, who among them include [[Zora Neale Hurston]]. Through her extensive studies of Southern folklore and cultural practices, Hurston has claimed that the popular Southern [[folklore]] traditions and practices are not dying off. Instead they are evolving, developing, and re-creating themselves in different regions.<ref>{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt14bt4hc.6|title=Black Regions of the Imagination|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781439909423|editor-last=DUNBAR|editor-first=EVE E.|series=African American Writers between the Nation and the World|pages=16\u201357|chapter=Becoming American through Ethnographic Writing|last1=Dunbar|first1=EVE E.}}</ref>\n\nOther aspects of African-American oral tradition include [[the dozens]],  [[Signifyin'|signifying]], [[trash talk]], rhyming, semantic inversion and word play, many of which have found their way into mainstream American popular culture and become international phenomena.<ref name=\"Michael L.

In the 1920s and 1930s, African-American music, literature, and art gained wide notice. Authors such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]] and [[Nella Larsen]] and poets such as [[Langston Hughes]], [[Claude McKay]], and [[Countee Cullen]] wrote works describing the African-American experience. [[Jazz]], [[swing music|swing]], [[blues]] and other musical forms entered American [[popular music]]. African-American artists such as [[William Johnson (artist)|William H.

Among the notable African-American political movements founded in the early 20th century are the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|Universal Negro Improvement Association]] and the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. The [[Nation of Islam]], a notable quasi-[[Islam]]ic religious movement, also began in the early 1930s.<ref name=\"harlem\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fatherryan.org/harlemrenaissance/ |title=The Harlem Renaissance |first=William H. |last=Johnson |publisher=fatherryan.org |accessdate=June 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601152141/http://www.fatherryan.org/harlemrenaissance/ |archivedate=June 1, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===African-American cultural movement===\n{{See also|Black Power|Black Arts Movement}}\nThe [[Black Power]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s followed in the wake of the [[non-violent]] [[Civil Rights Movement]].

During this time, there was a resurgence of interest in, and an embrace of, elements of African culture within African-American culture that had been suppressed or devalued to conform to Eurocentric America. [[Natural hair]]styles, such as the [[afro]], and African clothing, such as the [[dashiki]], gained popularity.

By the early 20th century, several musical forms with origins in the African-American community had transformed American popular music. Aided by the technological innovations of radio and phonograph records, [[ragtime]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], and [[swing music|swing]] also became popular overseas, and the 1920s became known as the [[Jazz Age]]. The early 20th century also saw the creation of the first African-American [[Broadway show]]s, films such as [[King Vidor]]'s [[Hallelujah! (1929 film)|'' Hallelujah!'']], and operas such as [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.\n\n[[Rock and roll]], [[doo wop]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[R&B]] developed in the mid-20th century. These genres became very popular in white audiences and were influences for other genres such as [[surf music|surf]]. During the 1970s, [[the dozens]], an urban African-American tradition of using rhyming slang to put down one's enemies (or friends), and the [[West Indian]] tradition of [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] developed into a new form of music. In the [[South Bronx]] the half speaking, half singing rhythmic street talk of \"rapping\" grew into the hugely successful cultural force known as [[hip hop]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.globaldarkness.com/articles/roots_of_hiphop.htm  |title=The Roots of Hip Hop |journal=RM Hip Hop Magazine |year=1986 |accessdate=November 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary===\n\nHip hop would become a multicultural movement, however, it still remained important to many African Americans.

[[House music]] was created in black communities in Chicago in the 1980s. African-American music has experienced far more widespread acceptance in American popular music in the 21st century than ever before.

Natural hair can be styled in a variety of ways, including the afro, twist outs, braid outs, and wash and go styles. It is a myth that natural hair presents styling problems or is hard to manage; this myth seems prevalent because mainstream culture has, for decades, attempted to get African-American women to conform to its standard of beauty (i.e., straight hair).

In his attesting to this fact the West African scholar [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] explained: \"The primary reason for the success of Islam in Black Africa [...] consequently stems from the fact that it was propagated peacefully at first by solitary Arabo-Berber travelers to certain Black kings and notables, who then spread it about them to those under their jurisdiction\".<ref>Cheikh Anta Diop, ''Precolonial Black Africa'', p. 163.</ref> Many first-generation slaves were often able to retain their Muslim identity, their descendants were not.

Holidays observed in African-American culture are not only observed by African Americans but are widely considered American holidays. The birthday of noted American [[civil rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr]] has been observed nationally since 1983.<ref name=\"student\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/01/30/extra.black.history.month/index.html |title=Extra!: History of Black History Month |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=June 1, 2007 |publisher=CNN |author=CNN Student News}}</ref> It is one of four federal holidays named for an individual.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/05/6103- |title=5 USC 6103 |publisher=Cornell Law School |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Black History Month]] is another example of another African-American observance that has been adopted nationally and its teaching is even required by law in some states. Black History Month is an attempt to focus attention on previously neglected aspects of the American history, chiefly the lives and stories of African Americans. It is observed during the month of February to coincide with the founding of the [[NAACP]] and the birthdays of [[Frederick Douglass]], a prominent African-American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], the [[United States president]] who signed the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=\"student\" />\n\nOn June 7, 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] decreed that June would be the month of black music. For the past 28 years, presidents have announced to Americans that [[Black Music Month]] (also called African-American Music Month) should be recognized as a critical part of American heritage. Black Music Month is highlighted with various events urging citizens to revel in the many forms of music from gospel to hip-hop.  African-American musicians, singers, and composers are also highlighted for their contributions to the nation's history and culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classbrain.com/artholiday/publish/article_141.shtml|title=Black Music Month|website=www.classbrain.com|accessdate= October 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLess-widely observed outside of the African-American community is [[Emancipation Day]] popularly known as [[Juneteenth]] or Freedom Day, in recognition of the official reading of the Emancipation Proclamation on June 19, 1865, in [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=juneteenth.com |year=2005 |url=http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm |title=History of Juneteenth |accessdate=March 15, 2007}}</ref> Juneteenth is a day when African Americans reflect on their unique history and heritage. It is one of the fastest growing African-American holidays with observances in the United States. Another holiday not widely observed outside of the African-American community is the birthday of Malcolm&nbsp;X. The day is observed on May 19 in American cities with a significant African-American population, including Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=University of Kansas Medical Center |year=2003 |url=http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/malcolm.html |title=Malcolm X's Birthday |accessdate=May 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601172051/http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/malcolm.html |archivedate=June 1, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAnother noted African-American holiday is [[Kwanzaa]]. Like Emancipation Day, it is not widely observed outside of the African-American community, although it is growing in popularity with both African-American and African communities. African-American scholar and activist [[Ron Karenga|\"Maulana\" Ron Karenga]] invented the festival of Kwanzaa in 1966, as an alternative to the increasing commercialization of [[Christmas]]. Derived from the harvest rituals of Africans, Kwanzaa is observed each year from December 26 through January 1. Participants in Kwanzaa celebrations affirm their African heritage and the importance of family and community by drinking from a unity cup; lighting red, black, and green candles; exchanging heritage symbols, such as African art; and recounting the lives of people who struggled for African and African-American freedom.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=OfficialKwanzaaWebsite.org |url=http://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/faq.shtml |title=Fundamental Questions About Kwanzaa |accessdate=May 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Negro Election Day]] is also another festival derived from rituals of African culture specifically West Africa and revolves around the voting of a black official in New England colonies during the 18th century.\n\n==Names==\n{{Main|African-American names}}\n{{See also|Slave name}}\n\nAlthough many African-American names are common among the larger population of the United States, distinct naming trends have emerged within African-American culture. Prior to the 1950s and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture.<ref name=\"Baby Name Wizard\"/> A dramatic shift in naming traditions began to take shape in the 1960s and 1970s in America. With the rise of the mid-century Civil Rights Movement, there was a dramatic rise in names of various origins.<ref name=\"individuality\">{{cite news|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Baby Names Reveal More About Parents Than Ever Before|url=http://www.livescience.com/9027-baby-names-reveal-parents.html|newspaper=Live Science|date=November 30, 2010}}</ref> The practice of adopting neo-African or [[Islamic]] names gained popularity during that era. Efforts to recover African heritage inspired selection of names with deeper cultural significance. Before this, using African names was uncommon because African Americans were several generations removed from the last ancestor to have an African name, as [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] were often given European names and most surnames are of Anglo origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://life.familyeducation.com/baby/baby-names/45480.html |title=Finding Our History: African-American Names |publisher=Family Education |accessdate=June 5, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAfrican-American names have origins in many languages including [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and African languages. One very notable influence on African-American names is the [[Muslim]] religion. [[Islamic names]] entered the popular culture with the rise of The [[Nation of Islam]] among Black Americans with its focus on civil rights. The popular name \"[[Aisha (given name)|Aisha]]\" has origins in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. Despite the origins of these names in the Muslim religion and the place of the Nation of Islam in the civil rights movement, many Muslim names such as [[Jamal]] and [[Malik]] entered popular usage among Black Americans simply because they were fashionable, and many Islamic names are now commonly used by African Americans regardless of their religion. Names of [[Africa]]n origin began to crop up as well. Names like Ashanti, [[Tanisha (name)|Tanisha]], Aaliyah, Malaika have origins in the continent of Africa.<ref name=\"Baby Name Wizard\">{{cite book|last=Wattenberg|first=Laura|title=The Baby Name Wizard, Revised 3rd Edition: A Magical Method for Finding the Perfect Name for Your Baby|date=May 7, 2013|publisher=Harmony|isbn=978-0770436476|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/babynamewizardma0000watt}}</ref><ref name=salon>{{cite news|last=Zax|first=David|title=What's up with black names, anyway?|url=http://www.salon.com/2008/08/25/creative_black_names/|newspaper=Salon.com|date=August 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common within the culture to invent new names, although many of the invented names took elements from popular existing names.

Even during slavery, however, many African-American families managed to maintain strong familial bonds. Free African men and women, who managed to buy their own freedom by being hired out, who were emancipated, or who had escaped their masters, often worked long and hard to buy the members of their families who remained in bondage and send for them.\n\nOthers, separated from blood kin, formed close bonds based on fictive kin; ''play'' relations, ''play'' aunts, cousins, and the like. This practice, a holdover from African oral traditions such as ''[[sanankouya]]'', survived Emancipation, with non-blood family friends commonly accorded the status and titles of blood relations. This broader, more African concept of what constitutes family and community, and the deeply rooted respect for elders that is part of African traditional societies, may be the genesis of the common use of the terms like \"cousin\" (or \"cuz\"), \"aunt\", \"uncle\", \"brother\", \"sister\", \"Mother\", and \"Mama\" when addressing other African-American people, some of whom may be complete strangers.\n\n===African-American family structure===\n\n{{Main|African-American family structure}}\n\nImmediately after slavery, African-American families struggled to reunite and rebuild what had been taken. As late as 1960, when most African Americans lived under some form of segregation, 78 percent of African-American families were headed by married couples. This number steadily declined during the latter half of the 20th century.<ref>Thomas Sowell, ''Affirmative Action around the World'', 2004. Basic Books. pp. 115\u2013156.</ref> For the first time since slavery, a majority of African-American children live in a household with only one parent, typically the mother.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackagenda.com/conferences/2002nbfc/wilderhamilton.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407000815/http://www.blackagenda.com/conferences/2002nbfc/wilderhamilton.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2008 |title=Uncovering the Truth: Understanding the Impact of American Culture on the Black Male Black Female Relationship |first=Elonda R. |last=Wilder-Hamilton |year=2002 |accessdate=June 3, 2007 |publisher=The Black Agenda}}</ref>\n\nThis apparent weakness is balanced by mutual-aid systems established by [[extended family]] members to provide emotional and economic support. Older family members pass on social and cultural traditions such as [[religion]] and [[manners]] to younger family members. In turn, the older family members are cared for by younger family members when they cannot care for themselves. These relationships exist at all economic levels in the African-American community, providing strength and support both to the African-American family and the community.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8xSQEZejTk4C |title=The Black Extended Family |last=Martin |first=Elmer P. |year=1980 |isbn=0-226-50797-1 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}</ref>\n\n==Politics and social issues==\nSince the passing of the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, African Americans are voting and being elected to public office in increasing numbers. {{as of|2008}} the United States had approximately 10,000 African-American elected officials.<ref>{{cite news |work= [[The New York Times]] |last= Scott |first= Janny |date= March 23, 2008 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/weekinreview/23scott.html |title= What Politicians Say When They Talk About Race |accessdate= June 24, 2008 }}</ref>\nAfrican Americans overwhelmingly associate with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

The distinct identity of African-American culture is rooted in the historical experience of the African-American people, including the [[Middle Passage]]. The culture is both distinct and enormously influential on American and global worldwide culture as a whole.\n\nAfrican-American culture is rooted in the blend between the cultures of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]] and the Anglo-Celtic culture that has influenced and modified its development in the American South. Understanding its identity within the [[culture of the United States]], it is, in the anthropological sense, conscious of its origins as largely a blend of West and Central African cultures. Although slavery greatly restricted the ability of African-Americans to practice their original cultural traditions, many practices, values and beliefs survived, and over time have modified and/or blended with [[Culture of Europe|European cultures]] and other cultures such as that of [[Native Americans in the United States|Amerindians]]. African-American identity was established during the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery period]], producing a dynamic culture that has had and continues to have a profound impact on American culture as a whole, as well as that of the broader world.<ref name=\" Gomez\">{{cite book|last=Gomez|first=Michael Angelo|title=Exchanging Our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0807861715|page=[https://archive.org/details/exchangingourcou0000gome/page/12 12]|url=https://archive.org/details/exchangingourcou0000gome/page/12}}</ref>\n\nElaborate rituals and ceremonies were a significant part of African-Americans' ancestral culture. Many West African societies traditionally believed that spirits dwelled in their surrounding nature. From this disposition, they treated their environment with mindful care. They also generally believed that a spiritual life source existed after death and that ancestors in this spiritual realm could then mediate between the supreme [[Supreme Being|Creator]] and the living. Honor and prayer were displayed to these \"ancient ones\", the spirit of that past. West Africans also believed in spiritual possession.<ref name=\"Carson\">Clayborn Carson, Emma J. Lapsansky-Werner, and Gary B. Nash, ''The Struggle for Freedom: A History of African Americans, Vol 1 to 1877'' (Prentice Hall, 2012), p. 18.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Christianity began to spread across North Africa; this shift in religion began displacing traditional African spiritual practices. The enslaved Africans brought this complex religious dynamic within their culture to America. This fusion of traditional African beliefs with Christianity provided a commonplace for those practicing religion in Africa and America.<ref name=\"Carson\"/>\n\nAfter [[Slavery in the United States#The end of slavery|emancipation]], unique African-American traditions continued to flourish, as distinctive traditions or radical innovations in music, art, literature, religion, cuisine, and other fields. 20th-century sociologists, such as [[Gunnar Myrdal]], believed that African-Americans had lost most of their cultural ties with Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last=James |first=Jessica S. |title=What Neighborhood Poverty Studies Can Learn from African American Studies |date=June 2008 |journal=[[The Journal of Pan African Studies]] |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=26 |url=http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol2no4/2.4_What_Neighborhood_Poverty_Studies_Can_Learn_from_African_American_Studies.pdf }}</ref> But, anthropological field research by [[Melville J.

The physical isolation and societal marginalization of [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] and, later, of their free progeny, however, facilitated the retention of significant elements of traditional culture among Africans in the New World generally, and in the United States in particular. Slave owners deliberately tried to repress independent political or cultural organization in order to deal with the many slave rebellions or acts of resistance that took place in the United States, [[Brazil]], [[Haiti]], and the [[History of Guyana#Early colonization|Dutch Guyanas]].<ref>Price, Richard (1996). ''Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas''.

The imprint of Africa is evident in a myriad of ways: in politics, economics, language, music, hairstyles, fashion, dance, religion, cuisine, and worldview.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&psid=3043|title=Digital History|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu}}</ref>\n\nIn turn, African-American culture has had a pervasive, transformative impact on many elements of mainstream American culture. This process of mutual creative exchange is called [[creolization]].<ref name=\"slave_culture\"/> Over time, the culture of African slaves and their descendants has been ubiquitous in its impact on not only the dominant American culture, but on world culture as well.<ref>Genevi\u00e8ve Fabre, Robert G. O'Meally (1994). ''History and Memory in African-American Culture''. Oxford University Press. pp. 12\u2013208.</ref>\n\n===Oral tradition===\nSlaveholders limited or prohibited education of enslaved African-Americans because they feared it might empower their chattel and inspire or enable emancipatory ambitions. In the United States, the legislation that denied slaves formal education likely contributed to their maintaining a strong oral tradition, a common feature of indigenous African cultures.<ref name=\"oral\">{{cite web |author1=Maggie Papa |author2=Amy Gerber |author3=Abeer Mohamed |publisher=[[George Washington University]]|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~e73afram/ag-am-mp.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527050107/http://www.gwu.edu/~e73afram/ag-am-mp.html|archivedate=May 27, 2008 |title=African American Culture through Oral Tradition |accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref> African-based oral traditions became the primary means of preserving history, mores, and other cultural information among the people. This was consistent with the ''[[griot]]'' practices of oral history in many African and other cultures that did not rely on the written word. Many of these cultural elements have been passed from generation to generation through storytelling. The folktales provided African-Americans the opportunity to inspire and educate one another.<ref name=\"oral\"/>\n\nExamples of African-American folktales include [[trickster]] tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ug97/remus/anatar.html |title=Editor's Analysis of \"The Wonderful Tar Baby Story\" |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |accessdate=October 7, 2007}}</ref> and [[hero]]ic tales such as that of [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/john_henry/index.html |title=John Henry: The Steel Driving Man |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |publisher=[[ibiblio]]}}</ref> The ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' stories by [[Joel Chandler Harris]] helped to bring African-American folk tales into mainstream adoption.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncleremus.com/index.html |title=Uncle Remus |publisher=UncleRemus.com |year=2003 |accessdate=October 10, 2007}}</ref> Harris did not appreciate the complexity of the stories nor their potential for a lasting impact on society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncleremus.com/preface.html |title=EDITOR'S PREFACES |publisher=UncleRemus.com |year=2003 |accessdate=October 10, 2007}}</ref> Other narratives that appear as important, recurring motifs in African-American culture are the \"[[Signifying Monkey]]\", \"The Ballad of Shine\", and the legend of [[Stagger Lee (song)|Stagger Lee]].\n\nThe legacy of the African-American oral tradition manifests in diverse forms. African-American preachers tend to perform rather than simply speak. The emotion of the subject is carried through the speaker's tone, volume, and cadence, which tend to mirror the rising action, climax, and descending action of the sermon. The meaning of this manner of preaching is not easily understood by [[Euro-Americans]] or others of non-African origin. Often song, dance, verse, and structured pauses are placed throughout the sermon. [[Call and response]] is another pervasive element of the African-American oral tradition. It manifests in worship in what is commonly referred to as the \"amen corner\". In direct contrast to the tradition present in American and European cultures, it is an acceptable and common audience reaction to interrupt and affirm the speaker.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RvSIg9of6TYC |title=A Fire in the Bones: Reflections on African-American Religious History |last=Raboteau |first=Albert J. |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |isbn=0-8070-0933-4 |year=1995}}</ref>  This pattern of interaction is also in evidence in music, particularly in blues and jazz forms. Hyperbolic and provocative, even incendiary, rhetoric is another aspect of African-American oral tradition often evident in the pulpit in a tradition sometimes referred to as \"prophetic speech\".<ref>Fabre and O'Meally, pp. 219\u2013244.</ref>\n\nModernity and migration of [[Black people|black]] communities to the North has had a history of placing strain on the retention of black cultural practices and traditions. The urban and radically different spaces in which black culture was being produced raised fears in anthropologists and sociologists that the southern black folk aspect of black popular culture were at risk of being lost in history. The study over the fear of losing black popular cultural roots from the South have a topic of interest to many anthropologists, who among them include [[Zora Neale Hurston]]. Through her extensive studies of Southern folklore and cultural practices, Hurston has claimed that the popular Southern [[folklore]] traditions and practices are not dying off. Instead they are evolving, developing, and re-creating themselves in different regions.<ref>{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt14bt4hc.6|title=Black Regions of the Imagination|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781439909423|editor-last=DUNBAR|editor-first=EVE E.|series=African American Writers between the Nation and the World|pages=16\u201357|chapter=Becoming American through Ethnographic Writing|last1=Dunbar|first1=EVE E.}}</ref>\n\nOther aspects of African-American oral tradition include [[the dozens]],  [[Signifyin'|signifying]], [[trash talk]], rhyming, semantic inversion and word play, many of which have found their way into mainstream American popular culture and become international phenomena.<ref name=\"Michael L.

During this time, there was a resurgence of interest in, and an embrace of, elements of African culture within African-American culture that had been suppressed or devalued to conform to Eurocentric America. [[Natural hair]]styles, such as the [[afro]], and African clothing, such as the [[dashiki]], gained popularity.

By the early 20th century, several musical forms with origins in the African-American community had transformed American popular music. Aided by the technological innovations of radio and phonograph records, [[ragtime]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], and [[swing music|swing]] also became popular overseas, and the 1920s became known as the [[Jazz Age]]. The early 20th century also saw the creation of the first African-American [[Broadway show]]s, films such as [[King Vidor]]'s [[Hallelujah! (1929 film)|'' Hallelujah!'']], and operas such as [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.\n\n[[Rock and roll]], [[doo wop]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[R&B]] developed in the mid-20th century. These genres became very popular in white audiences and were influences for other genres such as [[surf music|surf]]. During the 1970s, [[the dozens]], an urban African-American tradition of using rhyming slang to put down one's enemies (or friends), and the [[West Indian]] tradition of [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] developed into a new form of music. In the [[South Bronx]] the half speaking, half singing rhythmic street talk of \"rapping\" grew into the hugely successful cultural force known as [[hip hop]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.globaldarkness.com/articles/roots_of_hiphop.htm  |title=The Roots of Hip Hop |journal=RM Hip Hop Magazine |year=1986 |accessdate=November 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary===\n\nHip hop would become a multicultural movement, however, it still remained important to many African Americans.

[[House music]] was created in black communities in Chicago in the 1980s. African-American music has experienced far more widespread acceptance in American popular music in the 21st century than ever before.

Natural hair can be styled in a variety of ways, including the afro, twist outs, braid outs, and wash and go styles. It is a myth that natural hair presents styling problems or is hard to manage; this myth seems prevalent because mainstream culture has, for decades, attempted to get African-American women to conform to its standard of beauty (i.e., straight hair).

In his attesting to this fact the West African scholar [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] explained: \"The primary reason for the success of Islam in Black Africa [...] consequently stems from the fact that it was propagated peacefully at first by solitary Arabo-Berber travelers to certain Black kings and notables, who then spread it about them to those under their jurisdiction\".<ref>Cheikh Anta Diop, ''Precolonial Black Africa'', p. 163.</ref> Many first-generation slaves were often able to retain their Muslim identity, their descendants were not.

Holidays observed in African-American culture are not only observed by African Americans but are widely considered American holidays. The birthday of noted American [[civil rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr]] has been observed nationally since 1983.<ref name=\"student\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/01/30/extra.black.history.month/index.html |title=Extra!: History of Black History Month |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=June 1, 2007 |publisher=CNN |author=CNN Student News}}</ref> It is one of four federal holidays named for an individual.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/05/6103- |title=5 USC 6103 |publisher=Cornell Law School |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Black History Month]] is another example of another African-American observance that has been adopted nationally and its teaching is even required by law in some states. Black History Month is an attempt to focus attention on previously neglected aspects of the American history, chiefly the lives and stories of African Americans. It is observed during the month of February to coincide with the founding of the [[NAACP]] and the birthdays of [[Frederick Douglass]], a prominent African-American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], the [[United States president]] who signed the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=\"student\" />\n\nOn June 7, 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] decreed that June would be the month of black music. For the past 28 years, presidents have announced to Americans that [[Black Music Month]] (also called African-American Music Month) should be recognized as a critical part of American heritage. Black Music Month is highlighted with various events urging citizens to revel in the many forms of music from gospel to hip-hop.  African-American musicians, singers, and composers are also highlighted for their contributions to the nation's history and culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classbrain.com/artholiday/publish/article_141.shtml|title=Black Music Month|website=www.classbrain.com|accessdate= October 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLess-widely observed outside of the African-American community is [[Emancipation Day]] popularly known as [[Juneteenth]] or Freedom Day, in recognition of the official reading of the Emancipation Proclamation on June 19, 1865, in [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=juneteenth.com |year=2005 |url=http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm |title=History of Juneteenth |accessdate=March 15, 2007}}</ref> Juneteenth is a day when African Americans reflect on their unique history and heritage. It is one of the fastest growing African-American holidays with observances in the United States. Another holiday not widely observed outside of the African-American community is the birthday of Malcolm&nbsp;X. The day is observed on May 19 in American cities with a significant African-American population, including Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=University of Kansas Medical Center |year=2003 |url=http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/malcolm.html |title=Malcolm X's Birthday |accessdate=May 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601172051/http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/malcolm.html |archivedate=June 1, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAnother noted African-American holiday is [[Kwanzaa]]. Like Emancipation Day, it is not widely observed outside of the African-American community, although it is growing in popularity with both African-American and African communities. African-American scholar and activist [[Ron Karenga|\"Maulana\" Ron Karenga]] invented the festival of Kwanzaa in 1966, as an alternative to the increasing commercialization of [[Christmas]]. Derived from the harvest rituals of Africans, Kwanzaa is observed each year from December 26 through January 1. Participants in Kwanzaa celebrations affirm their African heritage and the importance of family and community by drinking from a unity cup; lighting red, black, and green candles; exchanging heritage symbols, such as African art; and recounting the lives of people who struggled for African and African-American freedom.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=OfficialKwanzaaWebsite.org |url=http://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/faq.shtml |title=Fundamental Questions About Kwanzaa |accessdate=May 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Negro Election Day]] is also another festival derived from rituals of African culture specifically West Africa and revolves around the voting of a black official in New England colonies during the 18th century.\n\n==Names==\n{{Main|African-American names}}\n{{See also|Slave name}}\n\nAlthough many African-American names are common among the larger population of the United States, distinct naming trends have emerged within African-American culture. Prior to the 1950s and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture.<ref name=\"Baby Name Wizard\"/> A dramatic shift in naming traditions began to take shape in the 1960s and 1970s in America. With the rise of the mid-century Civil Rights Movement, there was a dramatic rise in names of various origins.<ref name=\"individuality\">{{cite news|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Baby Names Reveal More About Parents Than Ever Before|url=http://www.livescience.com/9027-baby-names-reveal-parents.html|newspaper=Live Science|date=November 30, 2010}}</ref> The practice of adopting neo-African or [[Islamic]] names gained popularity during that era. Efforts to recover African heritage inspired selection of names with deeper cultural significance. Before this, using African names was uncommon because African Americans were several generations removed from the last ancestor to have an African name, as [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] were often given European names and most surnames are of Anglo origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://life.familyeducation.com/baby/baby-names/45480.html |title=Finding Our History: African-American Names |publisher=Family Education |accessdate=June 5, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAfrican-American names have origins in many languages including [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and African languages. One very notable influence on African-American names is the [[Muslim]] religion. [[Islamic names]] entered the popular culture with the rise of The [[Nation of Islam]] among Black Americans with its focus on civil rights. The popular name \"[[Aisha (given name)|Aisha]]\" has origins in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. Despite the origins of these names in the Muslim religion and the place of the Nation of Islam in the civil rights movement, many Muslim names such as [[Jamal]] and [[Malik]] entered popular usage among Black Americans simply because they were fashionable, and many Islamic names are now commonly used by African Americans regardless of their religion. Names of [[Africa]]n origin began to crop up as well. Names like Ashanti, [[Tanisha (name)|Tanisha]], Aaliyah, Malaika have origins in the continent of Africa.<ref name=\"Baby Name Wizard\">{{cite book|last=Wattenberg|first=Laura|title=The Baby Name Wizard, Revised 3rd Edition: A Magical Method for Finding the Perfect Name for Your Baby|date=May 7, 2013|publisher=Harmony|isbn=978-0770436476|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/babynamewizardma0000watt}}</ref><ref name=salon>{{cite news|last=Zax|first=David|title=What's up with black names, anyway?|url=http://www.salon.com/2008/08/25/creative_black_names/|newspaper=Salon.com|date=August 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common within the culture to invent new names, although many of the invented names took elements from popular existing names.

Even during slavery, however, many African-American families managed to maintain strong familial bonds. Free African men and women, who managed to buy their own freedom by being hired out, who were emancipated, or who had escaped their masters, often worked long and hard to buy the members of their families who remained in bondage and send for them.\n\nOthers, separated from blood kin, formed close bonds based on fictive kin; ''play'' relations, ''play'' aunts, cousins, and the like. This practice, a holdover from African oral traditions such as ''[[sanankouya]]'', survived Emancipation, with non-blood family friends commonly accorded the status and titles of blood relations. This broader, more African concept of what constitutes family and community, and the deeply rooted respect for elders that is part of African traditional societies, may be the genesis of the common use of the terms like \"cousin\" (or \"cuz\"), \"aunt\", \"uncle\", \"brother\", \"sister\", \"Mother\", and \"Mama\" when addressing other African-American people, some of whom may be complete strangers.\n\n===African-American family structure===\n\n{{Main|African-American family structure}}\n\nImmediately after slavery, African-American families struggled to reunite and rebuild what had been taken. As late as 1960, when most African Americans lived under some form of segregation, 78 percent of African-American families were headed by married couples. This number steadily declined during the latter half of the 20th century.<ref>Thomas Sowell, ''Affirmative Action around the World'', 2004. Basic Books. pp. 115\u2013156.</ref> For the first time since slavery, a majority of African-American children live in a household with only one parent, typically the mother.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackagenda.com/conferences/2002nbfc/wilderhamilton.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407000815/http://www.blackagenda.com/conferences/2002nbfc/wilderhamilton.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2008 |title=Uncovering the Truth: Understanding the Impact of American Culture on the Black Male Black Female Relationship |first=Elonda R. |last=Wilder-Hamilton |year=2002 |accessdate=June 3, 2007 |publisher=The Black Agenda}}</ref>\n\nThis apparent weakness is balanced by mutual-aid systems established by [[extended family]] members to provide emotional and economic support. Older family members pass on social and cultural traditions such as [[religion]] and [[manners]] to younger family members. In turn, the older family members are cared for by younger family members when they cannot care for themselves. These relationships exist at all economic levels in the African-American community, providing strength and support both to the African-American family and the community.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8xSQEZejTk4C |title=The Black Extended Family |last=Martin |first=Elmer P. |year=1980 |isbn=0-226-50797-1 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}</ref>\n\n==Politics and social issues==\nSince the passing of the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, African Americans are voting and being elected to public office in increasing numbers. {{as of|2008}} the United States had approximately 10,000 African-American elected officials.<ref>{{cite news |work= [[The New York Times]] |last= Scott |first= Janny |date= March 23, 2008 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/weekinreview/23scott.html |title= What Politicians Say When They Talk About Race |accessdate= June 24, 2008 }}</ref>\nAfrican Americans overwhelmingly associate with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].
