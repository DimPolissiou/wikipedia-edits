The headquarters were the former Benedictine monastery Millstatt, the second headquarters was Wiener Neustadt. [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor |Emperor Maximilian of Habsburg]] was a particular patron of the order. It is believed that the Order of St. George by Emperor Friedrich III was connected to another previous order, the \"Austrian Dragon Society\" founded in 1409 in \u00d6denburg, which in turn was directly connected to the Order of the Dragon by the [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Hungarian King and Emperor Sigismund]].\n\nThe sovereignty of the Order of St. George or the St. George Knights Brotherhood, which was also founded by Emperor Maximilian I, has remained with the House of Habsburg-Lorraine to this day. Emperor Maximilian I tried to promote his St. George's associations and use them politically. On November 15, 1494, for example, he made an appeal to all Christian kings and princes, as well as to all Christianity, to join the Brotherhood and to support a Turkish campaign planned by the emperor for the following year, but without finding much interest. He gave the knights who would take part in this campaign the privilege of wearing a crown in their coat of arms and thus created the status of the \"crowned knight\".<ref>Manfred Hollegger \"Maximilian I.\" (2005), p 150.</ref>\n\nEmpress [[Maria Theresa]] is said to have issued new statutes of the order in 1765.\n\n[[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph I]] confirmed the priory of the Order of St. George in Austria in 1848.\n\nIn 1917 [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor Charles I]] confirmed the order as a purely secular order of knights in the future.<ref>Roman Proch\u00e1zka \"\u00d6sterreichisches Ordenshandbuch\" (1979), p 274.</ref>  \n\nBetween 1919 and 1920 the order structures were modernized by persons approved by the emperor. Due to the situation in exile of the imperial family, the leadership of the order then went to [[Prince Johannes of Liechtenstein (1873\u20131959)|Prince Johannes of Liechtenstein]], although the title of protector and holder of the order remained with the House of Habsburg.\n\nThen there was a need to adapt the statutes of the order to modern conditions. On February 7, 1926, a constitutional reorganization council in Hanover issued a new order, whereby the nobility was no longer required for admission and the order was given the name \"Old St. George Knightly Order, also known as the Order of the Four Roman Emperors\". The order continued to claim that the unity and interests of the Central European peoples and nations were guaranteed for centuries by the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg monarchy.[[File:Oliver Mark - Otto Habsburg-Lothringen, P\u00f6cking 2006.jpg|thumb|Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]]]]\n\nIn 1935, due to the political situation in the German Reich, the seat of the order was moved to Salzburg, from where he stood up against National Socialism, for [[Central Europe]] independent of Nazi Germany and for the re-establishment of the House of Habsburg.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref>), and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R. G.|year=1997|title=Protocols for monitoring New Zealand robins: Petroica australis|series=Department of Conservation Technical Series|volume=13|publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation}}</ref> However, male North Island robins are almost black with a white spot just above the beak, as well as the greyish-white lower breast. Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.<ref name=\"ref13\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref>Gill, F. and D. Donsker, eds. (2020). IOC World Bird List (v 10.1). Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=\"ref4\">{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=\"ref9\"/> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]].

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref>), and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R.

Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats.

Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.<ref name=\"ref13\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref>Gill, F. and D.

''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era.

When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=\"ref4\">{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=\"ref9\"/> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=\"ref8\"/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=\"ref16\">{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

It features [[Float (parade)|floats]] and live performers covered in over 600,000 electronically controlled LED lights and a synchronized soundtrack triggered by radio control along key areas of the parade route.\n\nVersions of the parade existed in five Disney parks worldwide. The version at [[Disneyland Park]] in California's [[Disneyland Resort]] ran from 1972-1996, and again in limited engagements in 2017 and 2019.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Strodder |first1=Chris |title=The Disneyland Encyclopedia |date=2017 |publisher=Santa Monica Press |isbn=978-1595800909 |edition=3rd |pages=297-298}}</ref> The neighboring [[Disney California Adventure]] park hosted the parade between 2001 and 2010. Another version, at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in Florida's [[Walt Disney World Resort]], ran between 1977 and 2016, with two major gaps during 1991\u20131999 and 2001\u20132010.\n\nThe parade has also spun off several other versions that ran or continue to run at Disney parks around the world. An updated version runs at [[Tokyo Disneyland]] as the ''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights''. In 2014, [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] premiered a spiritual successor to the Main Street Electrical Parade, the ''[[Paint the Night|Paint the Night Parade]]''.

Disney arranged for the parade's original floats to be constructed by Silvestri, the Chicago-based company responsible for those holiday displays.<ref name=\"MacDonald\" />\n\nTwo months to deadline, Disney discovered the float contractor was far behind schedule and decided to finish the floats themselves in a backstage area at Disneyland. Disney brought on welders, electricians and other temporary workers to assemble the floats and hand-tint and install 500,000 bulbs.<ref name=\"MacDonald\" /> The engineers who helped create the parade also created the first automated parade show-control program. This allowed the {{convert|2000|ft|m|adj=on}} long parade route to contain multiple radio-activated \"trigger zones\". Using radio-activated triggers as each float entered a zone, the audience would hear float-specific music through the park's audio system. Each zone was between {{convert|70|to|100|ft|m}} long, and the zoned system meant that every person watching the parade would experience the same show, no matter where they stood along the parade route.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://soundandcommunications.com/audio/2006_03_audio.htm\n| title =Article describing the creation of MSEP audio technology | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623092228/http://soundandcommunications.com/audio/2006_03_audio.htm| archive-date=June 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Early years===\nThe first rehearsal was a disaster<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/travel/themeparks/la-tr-disneyland-main-street-electrical-parade-20161212-story.html|title=How the returning Disneyland Electrical Parade went from 'absolute disaster' to beloved attraction|last=MacDonald|first=Brady|website=latimes.com|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref>; a float crashed into a building on [[Main Street, U.S.A.]], and some performers' costumes emitted sparks. Despite these obstacles, the parade successfully debuted on schedule on June 17, 1972.<ref name=\"MacDonald\" /> The original parade floats featured the Blue Fairy, a large drum pulled by the [[Dumbo|Casey Jr.]] Engine, [[Cinderella (Disney franchise)|Cinderella]], a [[Chinese dragon]], and a [[Calliope (music)|circus calliope]]. Until 1977, some of the floats, such as the elephant train and the American flag finale, were flat screens on manually-pushed rolling platforms similar to the Electrical Water Pageant.\n\nThe Main Street Electrical Parade had counterparts of the same name and layout at [[Magic Kingdom]] in the [[Walt Disney World Resort]], which ran from June 11, 1977 to September 14, 1991. It was replaced by a similar parade called ''[[SpectroMagic]]'', which ran from October 1, 1991 to May 20, 1999, reopened on April 2, 2001, and ended on June 4, 2010. On April 12, 1992, the version from [[Magic Kingdom]] went to Disneyland Park at [[Disneyland Paris]] and ran there until March 23, 2003. It was then replaced by [[Fantillusion]], a nighttime parade from [[Tokyo Disneyland]] that had earlier replaced the Tokyo version of the Main Street Electrical Parade, which ran from March 9, 1985 to June 21, 1995.\n\nOn June 14, 1997, a presentation of the Electrical Parade called the \"Hercules Electrical Parade\", ran on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] for the opening of Disney's [[New Amsterdam Theater]] and the film ''[[Hercules (Disney film)|Hercules]]''. Disney arranged for the lights to be all turned off on about eight blocks of Broadway up to the theater. All businesses complied, with the exception of Disney rival [[Warner Brothers]]. It was led by a custom Hercules title unit made for this one time only use. It was shown on national television on a one-hour promotional program featuring the music and making of Hercules.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gest |first=Emily |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/06/10/1997-06-10_disney_s_ready_to_roll_with_.html |title=Disney's ready to roll with Herculean labor |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date=June 10, 1997 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510213158/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/06/10/1997-06-10_disney_s_ready_to_roll_with_.html |archivedate=May 10, 2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Later years===\nThe Main Street Electrical Parade closed at Disneyland on November 25, 1996, after a 24-year run.

These plans changed after Anaheim management saw the poor attendance figures for the spring break season at Disney California Adventure and feared that the park would fail to attract large crowds during the crucial summer season unless they had a big draw. So Disney announced that the popular Main Street Electrical Parade would be coming to [[Disney California Adventure Park]] on July 2, 2001, in honor of the park's first summer. The name of the show was changed from the Main Street Electrical Parade to Disney's Electrical Parade, as Disney California Adventure has no Main Street.

These include The Casey Jr. train from ''[[Dumbo]]'' carrying [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]] and [[Goofy]], and subsequent floats based on ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'', and a patriotic American float titled \"To Honor America\". Previous units included the Blue Fairy from ''Pinocchio'', a circus float connected to ''Dumbo'', an [[It's a Small World]] unit, and a promotional float for ''[[Return to Oz]]'' in 1985, but it was destroyed by a fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waltdisneysreturntooz.com/Float.htm|title=Disney's Return to Oz Electrical Parade|accessdate=April 14, 2017|location=Walt Disney's Return to Oz.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012031548/http://www.waltdisneysreturntooz.com/Float.htm|archivedate=October 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights'' features a number of floats featured in the western incarnation, though they are upgraded or alternate models. As of the 2017 renewal, the floats are ''Blue Fairy'', ''Knights of Light'', ''Mickey's Dreamlights Train'', ''Alice in Wonderland'', ''Disney Fairies'', ''Pete's Dragon'', ''Peter Pan'', ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Tangled]]'',  ''Cinderella'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' and ''[[It's a Small World]]'',\n\n==Versions==\nThere were 3 versions of the parade. As of June 28, 2019 two versions are known to exist\n \nVersion A (Disneyland version) was built in 1972. This version ran at Disneyland Park (in Anaheim) from 1972 until 1996, with two major breaks during 1974-1977 and 1983-1985. It then ran through Times Square in New York as the \"Hercules Electrical Parade\" for one night only in 1997. After this, both Pinocchio floats and the Seven Dwarfs Diamond Mine float were sent to Paris. The parade then went on hiatus for two years before being moved to Magic Kingdom (in Orlando), where it lasted from 1999 until 2001. After that, it moved to the struggling Disney's California Adventure Park (in Anaheim), where it ran from 2001 until 2010. In 2009, the parade\u2019s soundtrack was updated to match Tokyo\u2019s, while the Dumbo\u2019s Circus unit was removed from the parade and the Blue Fairy was replaced with a new TinkerBell float. When it ended there, it moved back to the Magic Kingdom (in Orlando), where it lasted from 2010 until 2016<ref name=\"Heading to Disneyland for a Limited Time\" /><ref name=\"August 11, 2016\"/>  It then left Magic Kingdom (in Orlando) to move back to its home park, Disneyland (in Anaheim), where it ran from January 19, 2017<ref name=\"January 19, 2017\"/> until August 20, of the same year. Disney later announced on June 28, 2019 that it will be returning to Disneyland for a third run on August 2, 2019 and will end on September 30, 2019. The final fate of this version is unknown after the 2019 run.\n \nVersion B (Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris version) was built in 1977 and premiered in Magic Kingdom (in Orlando). It was a clone of the one that was running in Anaheim, with slightly wider floats due to Magic Kingdom\u2019s wider parade route. It lasted there until 1991, where it moved across the Atlantic to Disneyland Park (Paris). Several floats from Tokyo and Anaheim were also sent to Paris in 1997. It lasted from 1992 up until 2003, where it was sent to Hong Kong Disneyland, but never appeared there. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n \nVersion C (Tokyo Disneyland version) was built in 1985 and has not left Tokyo Disneyland Park. It premiered in 1985, and closed in 1995. When it closed, it was refurbished into \"Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 1997, the Swan Lake Unit was sent to Disneyland Paris. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Music==\nThe Main Street Electrical Parade's underlying theme song is entitled \"[[Baroque Hoedown]].\" The original version was created in 1967 by early [[synthesizer]] pioneers [[Jean-Jacques Perrey]] and [[Gershon Kingsley]] and appeared first on the album [[Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Electronic Pop Music from Way Out]]. Originally, the parade's soundtrack had the same themes as the current recording, but was a different arrangement by Jim Christensen and [[Paul Beaver]]. In 1977, it was updated and arranged by electronic music artist Don Dorsey and [[Jack Wagner (announcer)|Jack Wagner]] at Jack Wagner Studio, which was used until January 2009 in Disney's Electrical Parade.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nWhen the parade returned to Disney California Adventure on June 12, 2009, it began using the updated, orchestrated DreamLights soundtrack from Tokyo,<ref>{{cite web\n| url        =http://www.laughingplace.com/Lotion-View-877.asp\n| title        =Summer Nightastic! at the Disneyland Resort\n| date        =April 27, 2009\n| website        =Laughing Place\n| accessdate        =June 28, 2014\n| url-status=live\n| archiveurl        =https://web.archive.org/web/20151007014900/http://www.laughingplace.com/Lotion-View-877.asp\n| archivedate        =October 7, 2015\n| df        =mdy-all\n}}</ref> but with changes made as certain floats in the California parade are not included in the Tokyo parade. The soundtrack for the current version, the 2009 version of Disney's Electrical Parade, The Main Street Electrical Parade (the last run ending in 2016 at Magic Kingdom), and the 2017 and upcoming 2019 runs of the Main Street Electrical Parade at Disneyland, as well as Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade DreamLights version were arranged, programmed and performed by Gregory Smith. Smith also arranged the music for [[Disneyland]]'s ''[[Remember... Dreams Come True]]'' show (which also contains a snippet of the original Don Dorsey arrangement, which then concludes in a grand orchestral finale arranged by Smith) as well as ''[[Magical: Disney's New Nighttime Spectacular of Magical Celebrations]]'' fireworks shows.\n\nThe soundtrack to the parade has been released numerous times:\n*''Main Street Electrical Parade'' (1973 soundtrack) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''Main Street Electrical Parade'' (1977 soundtrack) (Disneyland and Magic Kingdom)\n*''The Music of Disney: A Legacy in Song'' (1992) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''[[Fantasmic!]]: Good Clashes with Evil in a Nighttime Spectacular'' (1992) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''[[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic|Classic Disney Volume II: 60 Years of Musical Magic]]'' (1995) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''The Main Street Electrical Parade'' (1999 CD) (Magic Kingdom, Walt Disney World)\n*''Les Parades En Musique'' (2000 CD) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort Paris)\n*''Disney's Electrical Parade'' (2001 CD)\n*''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights'' (2001 CD)\n*''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights''- Show Mix Edition (2001)\n*''[[Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights ~Christmas~]]''\n*''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights'' (2011 Renewal Version)\n*''A Musical History of Disneyland'' (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''[[Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection|Walt Disney Records The Legacy Collection: Disneyland]]'' (2015)\n*''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights ~2017 Renewal Version~'' (2017)\n\nDorsey used 11 synthesizers to create the soundtrack: [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] Model III, [[Minimoog|Mini-Moog]], [[Steiner-Parker Synthacon]], [[Oberheim]] 8-voice, [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5]], [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes Piano]], [[New England Digital]] [[Synclavier]] II, [[Bode Sound Company|Bode]] 7702 [[Vocoder]], [[Roland]] [[Roland MKS-80|MKS-80 Super Jupiter]], [[Yamaha DX7]] and [[Yamaha DX7#Rack mount and desktop|Yamaha TX7]].\n\nWagner provides the synthesized vocoder voice for the intro and outro to the parade. Bill Rogers provided the synthesized vocoder announcement when the Disneyland version of the parade made its first visit to Magic Kingdom in 1999.  When the parade went to Disney California Adventure Park in 2001, the original Jack Wagner announcements for the Disneyland version of the parade were used as the basis for the announcements at the new park.  Since the park does not have a Main Street U.S.A., the announcements had to be updated with minor changes.  These included the insertion of the words \"Disney\" and \"Disney's\" to reflect that the show's name had changed to Disney's Electrical Parade.  When the soundtrack was updated, the announcements were rerecorded, but were still based off of the original Jack Wagner announcements from Disneyland.\n\nWhile the original soundtrack is played solely on [[synthesizers]], the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] version uses an [[orchestra]] with adult and youth choirs in addition to [[harmonies]] and [[synthesizers]]. This version also includes Character voices in both [[English language|English]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. This version was also orchestrated, programmed, conducted and performed by Gregory Smith. During the [[Christmas]] season at [[Tokyo Disneyland]], the Electrical Parade gets a new soundtrack; it is mostly the same soundtrack with added [[Christmas]] songs, mixed in with the theme music. For Tokyo Disneyland's 30th anniversary, a show stop was added to the parade, it includes a 2-minute Christmas medley; fireworks from Cinderella Castle are synced during the show stop as well. The showstop is only performed once a year as part of a private event for Disney/JCB Card holders.\n\nThe 2009 version of [[Disney's Electrical Parade]] at [[Disney California Adventure|Disney's California Adventure]], its 2010 run at Magic Kingdom and its 2017  run at Disneyland utilize much of the soundtrack created for DreamLights, with new loops created for the Cinderella, Pinocchio, and To Honor America units. However, the new soundtrack retains a more electronic sound than that of Tokyo's in that many of the orchestral parts of the DreamLights soundtrack have been replaced by synthesizers in this version. Whereas the Magic Kingdom used a newly recorded vocoder introduction for its 2010 version of the parade, the original 1977 Jack Wagner introduction was pitch-corrected to match the updated soundtrack and integrated into Disneyland's 2017 version of the parade.\n\nDisney has still yet to release the updated soundtrack used from 2001-2018 which is still in use at Tokyo Disneyland today.\n\n===Remixes, samples and parodies===\n\n*A remix of the Electrical Parade (called the Retro Future Remix) was released on ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]] [[Dance Dance Revolution (Disney versions)|Disney Mix]]'', and contains audio resamplings from the [[Apollo 8]] reading of Genesis.\n*In Japan, [[Walt Disney Records]] released a CD called ''DJ Digs Main Street Electrical Parade'' which featured the theme music remixed by Japanese DJs.\n*The Japan only ''House\u2606Disney'' album, also released by [[Walt Disney Records]], contains a remix of the song by famous Japanese DJ [[Shinichi Osawa]]. The remix subsequently appeared on the 2014 Disney remix album, ''[[Dconstructed]].''\n*The album ''Eurobeat Disney 3'', also only released in Japan, was done by the group A-Beat Power and features a remix of the song in Eurobeat style.\n*In 1998, a Disney Tribute Album entitled ''We Love Mickey ~Happy 70th Anniversary'' ([[Walt Disney Records]]), featuring covers of Disney songs by Japanese artists, included a remake by The Eccentric Opera. The track uses samples from Dorsey's arrangement and [[Snow White]]. Lyrics appear to be in German and are from an unknown source.\n*A \"Celtic\"-inspired version was heard in the Main Street Electrical Parade's replacement [[Light Magic]]. Light Magic ran for one summer, never to return again.\n* In ''The Simpsons'' episode \"[[Selma's Choice]]\" Lisa could be seen dancing in a dazed state in front of the Duff Gardens Light Parade with a musical take off of Main Street Electrical Parade Theme & Background music.\n*A cover version by [[They Might Be Giants]] was released on the ''[[Disneymania 2]]'' album. The same version was also featured on the [[Moog (film)#Soundtrack|soundtrack of the film ''Moog'']] and in [[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]] episode \"Orlando\".\n*A parody of the parade can be found during the ending credits of ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' and ''[[Paper Mario]]''. In Super Mario RPG, the music heard during the credits is very close to the main melody of parade.\n*A cover version of [[Baroque Hoedown]] by ska band [[Reel Big Fish]] was included on the Japanese album ''[[Dive into Disney]]''.\n*The [[vocaloid]] producer DaniwellP created a remix of the Electrical Parade using [[Hatsune Miku]].\n*The parade is parodied in the 2002 film ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' as a spooky themed parade called The Electrical Torture Parade.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Magic Kingdom attractions|Magic Kingdom attraction and entertainment history]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{show by date|2016|10|10|\n*[https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/entertainment/magic-kingdom/main-street-electrical-parade/ Main Street Electrical Parade at Walt Disney World]\n{{Commons-inline}}|{{Commons-inline}}|hour=-2}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/user/MSEPProject The Main Street Electrical Parade Project] YouTube channel which attempts to show every unit in parade history presented as a single parade.\n*[http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz002ddgbc \"Cameo of Jewels\" float at the Electrical Parade in the Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles, 1932] at [[Los Angeles Times]] Photographic Archive (Collection 1429).

It features [[Float (parade)|floats]] and live performers covered in over 600,000 electronically controlled LED lights and a synchronized soundtrack triggered by radio control along key areas of the parade route.\n\nVersions of the parade existed in five Disney parks worldwide. The version at [[Disneyland Park]] in California's [[Disneyland Resort]] ran from 1972-1996, and again in limited engagements in 2017 and 2019.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Strodder |first1=Chris |title=The Disneyland Encyclopedia |date=2017 |publisher=Santa Monica Press |isbn=978-1595800909 |edition=3rd |pages=297-298}}</ref> The neighboring [[Disney California Adventure]] park hosted the parade between 2001 and 2010. Another version, at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in Florida's [[Walt Disney World Resort]], ran between 1977 and 2016, with two major gaps during 1991\u20131999 and 2001\u20132010.\n\nThe parade has also spun off several other versions that ran or continue to run at Disney parks around the world. An updated version runs at [[Tokyo Disneyland]] as the ''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights''. In 2014, [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] premiered a spiritual successor to the Main Street Electrical Parade, the ''[[Paint the Night|Paint the Night Parade]]''.

Disney arranged for the parade's original floats to be constructed by Silvestri, the Chicago-based company responsible for those holiday displays.<ref name=\"MacDonald\" />\n\nTwo months to deadline, Disney discovered the float contractor was far behind schedule and decided to finish the floats themselves in a backstage area at Disneyland. Disney brought on welders, electricians and other temporary workers to assemble the floats and hand-tint and install 500,000 bulbs.<ref name=\"MacDonald\" /> The engineers who helped create the parade also created the first automated parade show-control program. This allowed the {{convert|2000|ft|m|adj=on}} long parade route to contain multiple radio-activated \"trigger zones\". Using radio-activated triggers as each float entered a zone, the audience would hear float-specific music through the park's audio system.

Despite these obstacles, the parade successfully debuted on schedule on June 17, 1972.<ref name=\"MacDonald\" /> The original parade floats featured the Blue Fairy, a large drum pulled by the [[Dumbo|Casey Jr.]] Engine, [[Cinderella (Disney franchise)|Cinderella]], a [[Chinese dragon]], and a [[Calliope (music)|circus calliope]]. Until 1977, some of the floats, such as the elephant train and the American flag finale, were flat screens on manually-pushed rolling platforms similar to the Electrical Water Pageant.\n\nThe Main Street Electrical Parade had counterparts of the same name and layout at [[Magic Kingdom]] in the [[Walt Disney World Resort]], which ran from June 11, 1977 to September 14, 1991. It was replaced by a similar parade called ''[[SpectroMagic]]'', which ran from October 1, 1991 to May 20, 1999, reopened on April 2, 2001, and ended on June 4, 2010. On April 12, 1992, the version from [[Magic Kingdom]] went to Disneyland Park at [[Disneyland Paris]] and ran there until March 23, 2003. It was then replaced by [[Fantillusion]], a nighttime parade from [[Tokyo Disneyland]] that had earlier replaced the Tokyo version of the Main Street Electrical Parade, which ran from March 9, 1985 to June 21, 1995.\n\nOn June 14, 1997, a presentation of the Electrical Parade called the \"Hercules Electrical Parade\", ran on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] for the opening of Disney's [[New Amsterdam Theater]] and the film ''[[Hercules (Disney film)|Hercules]]''. Disney arranged for the lights to be all turned off on about eight blocks of Broadway up to the theater. All businesses complied, with the exception of Disney rival [[Warner Brothers]]. It was led by a custom Hercules title unit made for this one time only use. It was shown on national television on a one-hour promotional program featuring the music and making of Hercules.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gest |first=Emily |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/06/10/1997-06-10_disney_s_ready_to_roll_with_.html |title=Disney's ready to roll with Herculean labor |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date=June 10, 1997 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510213158/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/06/10/1997-06-10_disney_s_ready_to_roll_with_.html |archivedate=May 10, 2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Later years===\nThe Main Street Electrical Parade closed at Disneyland on November 25, 1996, after a 24-year run.

However, the parade was refurbished and appeared at [[Magic Kingdom]] on May 21, 1999, for a limited engagement, just in time for [[Walt Disney World Millennium Celebration]]. The parade ended its run at Magic Kingdom on April 1, 2001, and [[SpectroMagic]] was brought back the following day.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nThe Main Street Electrical Parade floats were then sent back to California for the parade's return to Disneyland. These plans changed after Anaheim management saw the poor attendance figures for the spring break season at Disney California Adventure and feared that the park would fail to attract large crowds during the crucial summer season unless they had a big draw. So Disney announced that the popular Main Street Electrical Parade would be coming to [[Disney California Adventure Park]] on July 2, 2001, in honor of the park's first summer. The name of the show was changed from the Main Street Electrical Parade to Disney's Electrical Parade, as Disney California Adventure has no Main Street. Most of the 1996 parade floats returned.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOn the 2008 ''[[Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade]]'' special, Disney announced that the first new float in 20 years would be added to the classic parade.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It was announced in 2009 that two units would be returning as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lighting Up The Night With New Shows And A New Glow!

In February 2017, the pixie dust swooshes added to the floats in 2009 were removed, except on Tinker Bell's float, since Tinker Bell was no longer the parade's leader. The Main Street Electrical Parade had its final performance of its most recent run at Disneyland Park on August 20, 2017.

The version of the parade that has appeared in Disneyland, the Magic Kingdom, and Disneyland Paris has maintained a continuous set of units. These include The Casey Jr. train from ''[[Dumbo]]'' carrying [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]] and [[Goofy]], and subsequent floats based on ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'', and a patriotic American float titled \"To Honor America\".

As of the 2017 renewal, the floats are ''Blue Fairy'', ''Knights of Light'', ''Mickey's Dreamlights Train'', ''Alice in Wonderland'', ''Disney Fairies'', ''Pete's Dragon'', ''Peter Pan'', ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Tangled]]'',  ''Cinderella'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' and ''[[It's a Small World]]'',\n\n==Versions==\nThere were 3 versions of the parade. As of June 28, 2019 two versions are known to exist\n \nVersion A (Disneyland version) was built in 1972. This version ran at Disneyland Park (in Anaheim) from 1972 until 1996, with two major breaks during 1974-1977 and 1983-1985. It then ran through Times Square in New York as the \"Hercules Electrical Parade\" for one night only in 1997. After this, both Pinocchio floats and the Seven Dwarfs Diamond Mine float were sent to Paris. The parade then went on hiatus for two years before being moved to Magic Kingdom (in Orlando), where it lasted from 1999 until 2001. After that, it moved to the struggling Disney's California Adventure Park (in Anaheim), where it ran from 2001 until 2010. In 2009, the parade\u2019s soundtrack was updated to match Tokyo\u2019s, while the Dumbo\u2019s Circus unit was removed from the parade and the Blue Fairy was replaced with a new TinkerBell float. When it ended there, it moved back to the Magic Kingdom (in Orlando), where it lasted from 2010 until 2016<ref name=\"Heading to Disneyland for a Limited Time\" /><ref name=\"August 11, 2016\"/>  It then left Magic Kingdom (in Orlando) to move back to its home park, Disneyland (in Anaheim), where it ran from January 19, 2017<ref name=\"January 19, 2017\"/> until August 20, of the same year. Disney later announced on June 28, 2019 that it will be returning to Disneyland for a third run on August 2, 2019 and will end on September 30, 2019. The final fate of this version is unknown after the 2019 run.\n \nVersion B (Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris version) was built in 1977 and premiered in Magic Kingdom (in Orlando). It was a clone of the one that was running in Anaheim, with slightly wider floats due to Magic Kingdom\u2019s wider parade route. It lasted there until 1991, where it moved across the Atlantic to Disneyland Park (Paris). Several floats from Tokyo and Anaheim were also sent to Paris in 1997. It lasted from 1992 up until 2003, where it was sent to Hong Kong Disneyland, but never appeared there. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n \nVersion C (Tokyo Disneyland version) was built in 1985 and has not left Tokyo Disneyland Park. It premiered in 1985, and closed in 1995. When it closed, it was refurbished into \"Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 1997, the Swan Lake Unit was sent to Disneyland Paris. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Music==\nThe Main Street Electrical Parade's underlying theme song is entitled \"[[Baroque Hoedown]].\" The original version was created in 1967 by early [[synthesizer]] pioneers [[Jean-Jacques Perrey]] and [[Gershon Kingsley]] and appeared first on the album [[Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Electronic Pop Music from Way Out]]. Originally, the parade's soundtrack had the same themes as the current recording, but was a different arrangement by Jim Christensen and [[Paul Beaver]]. In 1977, it was updated and arranged by electronic music artist Don Dorsey and [[Jack Wagner (announcer)|Jack Wagner]] at Jack Wagner Studio, which was used until January 2009 in Disney's Electrical Parade.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nWhen the parade returned to Disney California Adventure on June 12, 2009, it began using the updated, orchestrated DreamLights soundtrack from Tokyo,<ref>{{cite web\n| url        =http://www.laughingplace.com/Lotion-View-877.asp\n| title        =Summer Nightastic! at the Disneyland Resort\n| date        =April 27, 2009\n| website        =Laughing Place\n| accessdate        =June 28, 2014\n| url-status=live\n| archiveurl        =https://web.archive.org/web/20151007014900/http://www.laughingplace.com/Lotion-View-877.asp\n| archivedate        =October 7, 2015\n| df        =mdy-all\n}}</ref> but with changes made as certain floats in the California parade are not included in the Tokyo parade. The soundtrack for the current version, the 2009 version of Disney's Electrical Parade, The Main Street Electrical Parade (the last run ending in 2016 at Magic Kingdom), and the 2017 and upcoming 2019 runs of the Main Street Electrical Parade at Disneyland, as well as Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade DreamLights version were arranged, programmed and performed by Gregory Smith. Smith also arranged the music for [[Disneyland]]'s ''[[Remember... Dreams Come True]]'' show (which also contains a snippet of the original Don Dorsey arrangement, which then concludes in a grand orchestral finale arranged by Smith) as well as ''[[Magical: Disney's New Nighttime Spectacular of Magical Celebrations]]'' fireworks shows.\n\nThe soundtrack to the parade has been released numerous times:\n*''Main Street Electrical Parade'' (1973 soundtrack) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''Main Street Electrical Parade'' (1977 soundtrack) (Disneyland and Magic Kingdom)\n*''The Music of Disney: A Legacy in Song'' (1992) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''[[Fantasmic!]]: Good Clashes with Evil in a Nighttime Spectacular'' (1992) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''[[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic|Classic Disney Volume II: 60 Years of Musical Magic]]'' (1995) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''The Main Street Electrical Parade'' (1999 CD) (Magic Kingdom, Walt Disney World)\n*''Les Parades En Musique'' (2000 CD) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort Paris)\n*''Disney's Electrical Parade'' (2001 CD)\n*''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights'' (2001 CD)\n*''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights''- Show Mix Edition (2001)\n*''[[Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights ~Christmas~]]''\n*''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights'' (2011 Renewal Version)\n*''A Musical History of Disneyland'' (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)\n*''[[Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection|Walt Disney Records The Legacy Collection: Disneyland]]'' (2015)\n*''Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights ~2017 Renewal Version~'' (2017)\n\nDorsey used 11 synthesizers to create the soundtrack: [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] Model III, [[Minimoog|Mini-Moog]], [[Steiner-Parker Synthacon]], [[Oberheim]] 8-voice, [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5]], [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes Piano]], [[New England Digital]] [[Synclavier]] II, [[Bode Sound Company|Bode]] 7702 [[Vocoder]], [[Roland]] [[Roland MKS-80|MKS-80 Super Jupiter]], [[Yamaha DX7]] and [[Yamaha DX7#Rack mount and desktop|Yamaha TX7]].\n\nWagner provides the synthesized vocoder voice for the intro and outro to the parade. Bill Rogers provided the synthesized vocoder announcement when the Disneyland version of the parade made its first visit to Magic Kingdom in 1999.  When the parade went to Disney California Adventure Park in 2001, the original Jack Wagner announcements for the Disneyland version of the parade were used as the basis for the announcements at the new park.  Since the park does not have a Main Street U.S.A., the announcements had to be updated with minor changes.  These included the insertion of the words \"Disney\" and \"Disney's\" to reflect that the show's name had changed to Disney's Electrical Parade.  When the soundtrack was updated, the announcements were rerecorded, but were still based off of the original Jack Wagner announcements from Disneyland.\n\nWhile the original soundtrack is played solely on [[synthesizers]], the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] version uses an [[orchestra]] with adult and youth choirs in addition to [[harmonies]] and [[synthesizers]]. This version also includes Character voices in both [[English language|English]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. This version was also orchestrated, programmed, conducted and performed by Gregory Smith. During the [[Christmas]] season at [[Tokyo Disneyland]], the Electrical Parade gets a new soundtrack; it is mostly the same soundtrack with added [[Christmas]] songs, mixed in with the theme music. For Tokyo Disneyland's 30th anniversary, a show stop was added to the parade, it includes a 2-minute Christmas medley; fireworks from Cinderella Castle are synced during the show stop as well. The showstop is only performed once a year as part of a private event for Disney/JCB Card holders.\n\nThe 2009 version of [[Disney's Electrical Parade]] at [[Disney California Adventure|Disney's California Adventure]], its 2010 run at Magic Kingdom and its 2017  run at Disneyland utilize much of the soundtrack created for DreamLights, with new loops created for the Cinderella, Pinocchio, and To Honor America units. However, the new soundtrack retains a more electronic sound than that of Tokyo's in that many of the orchestral parts of the DreamLights soundtrack have been replaced by synthesizers in this version. Whereas the Magic Kingdom used a newly recorded vocoder introduction for its 2010 version of the parade, the original 1977 Jack Wagner introduction was pitch-corrected to match the updated soundtrack and integrated into Disneyland's 2017 version of the parade.\n\nDisney has still yet to release the updated soundtrack used from 2001-2018 which is still in use at Tokyo Disneyland today.\n\n===Remixes, samples and parodies===\n\n*A remix of the Electrical Parade (called the Retro Future Remix) was released on ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]] [[Dance Dance Revolution (Disney versions)|Disney Mix]]'', and contains audio resamplings from the [[Apollo 8]] reading of Genesis.\n*In Japan, [[Walt Disney Records]] released a CD called ''DJ Digs Main Street Electrical Parade'' which featured the theme music remixed by Japanese DJs.\n*The Japan only ''House\u2606Disney'' album, also released by [[Walt Disney Records]], contains a remix of the song by famous Japanese DJ [[Shinichi Osawa]]. The remix subsequently appeared on the 2014 Disney remix album, ''[[Dconstructed]].''\n*The album ''Eurobeat Disney 3'', also only released in Japan, was done by the group A-Beat Power and features a remix of the song in Eurobeat style.\n*In 1998, a Disney Tribute Album entitled ''We Love Mickey ~Happy 70th Anniversary'' ([[Walt Disney Records]]), featuring covers of Disney songs by Japanese artists, included a remake by The Eccentric Opera. The track uses samples from Dorsey's arrangement and [[Snow White]]. Lyrics appear to be in German and are from an unknown source.\n*A \"Celtic\"-inspired version was heard in the Main Street Electrical Parade's replacement [[Light Magic]]. Light Magic ran for one summer, never to return again.\n* In ''The Simpsons'' episode \"[[Selma's Choice]]\" Lisa could be seen dancing in a dazed state in front of the Duff Gardens Light Parade with a musical take off of Main Street Electrical Parade Theme & Background music.\n*A cover version by [[They Might Be Giants]] was released on the ''[[Disneymania 2]]'' album. The same version was also featured on the [[Moog (film)#Soundtrack|soundtrack of the film ''Moog'']] and in the [[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]] episode \"Orlando\".\n*A parody of the parade can be found during the ending credits of ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' and ''[[Paper Mario]]''. In Super Mario RPG, the music heard during the credits is very close to the main melody of parade.\n*A cover version of [[Baroque Hoedown]] by ska band [[Reel Big Fish]] was included on the Japanese album ''[[Dive into Disney]]''.\n*The [[vocaloid]] producer DaniwellP created a remix of the Electrical Parade using [[Hatsune Miku]].\n*The parade is parodied in the 2002 film ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' as a spooky themed parade called The Electrical Torture Parade.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Magic Kingdom attractions|Magic Kingdom attraction and entertainment history]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{show by date|2016|10|10|\n*[https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/entertainment/magic-kingdom/main-street-electrical-parade/ Main Street Electrical Parade at Walt Disney World]\n{{Commons-inline}}|{{Commons-inline}}|hour=-2}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/user/MSEPProject The Main Street Electrical Parade Project] YouTube channel which attempts to show every unit in parade history presented as a single parade.\n*[http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz002ddgbc \"Cameo of Jewels\" float at the Electrical Parade in the Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles, 1932] at [[Los Angeles Times]] Photographic Archive (Collection 1429).

Bell was ten years old at the time of one of the killings, and eleven at the time of the other. She was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] and sent to a special approved school, being released from custody in 1980.\n|-\n| 1973 || The [[David McGreavy]] case || 3 || [[Worcester]], England ||   | David McGreavy was a lodger in the home of his friends, Clive and Elsie Ralph. While minding the Ralphs' three small children, Paul (age 4), Dawn (age 2) and Samantha (age 8 months), McGreavy murdered the children. He then mutilated their bodies with a pickaxe and impaled them outside on the spikes of a wrought-iron fence. McGreavy, called the \"Monster of Worcester\" in the press, later pleaded guilty to all three murders and was sentenced to multiple [[life imprisonment|life terms]] with a minimum term of 20 years.\n|-\n| 1978 || The [[Carl Bridgewater]] Case || 1 || [[Wordsley]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England ||   | The body of 13-year-old paperboy Carl Bridgewater was found in the house of a local elderly couple who had been out for the day. It was presumed by police that Bridgewater had disturbed a burglar while delivering a newspaper to their home and was dragged into their living room where he was killed with a shotgun blast to the head. The following year, a group of men - widely referred to in the press as the ''[[Bridgewater Four]]'' - were convicted of the crime, three for murder and a fourth for manslaughter. The defendant convicted of manslaughter subsequently died in prison but the three convicted of murder were released in 1997 when their convictions were quashed on appeal. Nobody else has ever been charged.\n|-\n|1981 || The [[Murder of Karen Price]]<br/>(Little Miss Nobody) || 1 || [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] ||   | Karen Price was a 15-year-old Welsh murder victim who disappeared in 1981. After the discovery of her body in 1989, British facial reconstruction artist [[Richard Neave]] used her skull to create a model of her physical appearance. The reconstruction and the matching of DNA in the body to that of Price's parents allowed her body to be identified. The case was cited as one of the first instances in which DNA technology was used in this way. The police later concluded that Price had run away from home and turned to prostitution. In 1991, Idris Ali and Alan Charlton, who were alleged to have managed her solicitation as a prostitute, were charged with her murder. Ali's charge was eventually reduced to manslaughter, and he was released in 1994. Charlton is still serving a life sentence.\n|-\n| 1983 || The [[murder of Colette Aram]] || 1 || [[Keyworth]], [[Nottinghamshire]] England ||   | Colette Aram, a 16-year-old trainee hairdresser, was abducted, raped and strangled as she walked from her home to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983.

After the discovery of Bulger's body two days later, Venables and Thompson were found guilty of murder in November that year and sentenced to be detained indefinitely. They spent eight years in custody before being released on life licence in 2001. Venables was recalled to prison in early 2010 for breaching his licence conditions, having been caught possessing [[child pornography]].\n|-\n| 1994 || The [[murder of Richard Everitt]] || 1 || London, England ||   | On 13 August 1994, 15-year-old Richard Everitt was stabbed to death in [[London]] in a racially motivated attack. Everitt's neighbourhood, [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]], had been the site of ethnic tensions, and although he was not involved in gangs, he was murdered by a gang of [[British Bangladeshi]]s who were seeking revenge on another [[White British]] boy. The murderer was not apprehended, as members of the gang fled to Bangladesh. Badrul Miah and Showat Akbar were tried in 1995 as the ringleaders of the gang and were given life sentences, with minimum terms of 12 years and three years in custody respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/fear-and-loathing-after-racial-murder-gangs-of-teenagers-have-vowed-to-avenge-the-death-of-a-white-1383793.html|title=Fear and loathing after 'racial' murder: Gangs of teenagers have vowed|date=16 August 1994|publisher=}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1994 || The [[murder of Daniel Handley]] || 1 || London, England ||   | Nine-year-old [[Daniel Handley]] was lured away from his [[East London]] home in October 1994 and murdered by Timothy Morss and his partner Brett Tyler. They were sentenced to life imprisonment in May 1996 after admitting the murder. They had sexually abused Handley before murdering him and abandoning his body near [[Bristol]], where it was found five months later. The trial judge described the pair as \"vultures\" and recommended they should never be set free. After their trial, it was revealed that both had convictions for sexual offences against children. In 2002 the then-Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]] sought to impose 50-year tariffs on Morss and Tyler, but they were overturned within 24 hours by both the [[High Court of Justice|High Court for England and Wales]] and the European Court of Human Rights.\n|-\n| 1996 || The [[Michael Stone (murderer)|Michael Stone]] Killings || 2 || [[Kent]], England ||   | Michael Stone was convicted in October 1998 of the July 1996 murders of Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter Megan, who were killed in a hammer attack. He was also convicted of attempting to murder Mrs Russell's nine-year-old daughter Josie, who suffered serious head injuries. He has continued to assert his innocence since his conviction. His original conviction was overturned on appeal but a second trial in 2002 resulted in another guilty verdict after another prisoner claimed that Stone had confessed to the killings while on remand in jail. His most recent appeal, in 2004, also failed.\n|-\n| 1997 || The [[murder of Billie-Jo Jenkins]] || 1 || [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]], England ||   | 13-year-old Billie-Jo Jenkins  was murdered on 15 February 1997 at the home where she lived with her foster parents. Her foster father, Si\u00f4n Jenkins, was charged with the murder and later convicted, but maintained his innocence. An appeal in 1999 against his conviction failed, but after a second appeal in August 2004 it was quashed by a court as unsafe and he was released on bail pending a retrial. The juries in two subsequent retrials were unable to reach verdicts, and a not guilty verdict was recorded in 2006. Nobody else has been arrested since his acquittal and the case remains unsolved.\n|}\n\n===2000s\u2013present===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!width=30pt|Date\n!width=150pt|Name\n!width=30pt|No. of<br>Deaths\n!width=150pt|Location\n!Details\n|-\n| 2000 || [[Murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9]] || 1 || London ||   | 8-year-old [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] girl, Victoria Adjo Climbi\u00e9 (2 November 1991&nbsp;\u2013 25 February 2000), was tortured and murdered by her guardians (including her aunt), who were found guilty of murder and jailed for life the following year. Her death led to a public inquiry and produced major changes in child protection policies in England.\n|-\n| 2000 || Murder of [[Murder of Sarah Payne|Sarah Payne]] || 1 || [[East Preston, West Sussex|East Preston]], [[West Sussex]], England ||   | Sarah Payne, a seven-year-old girl from [[Surrey]], was abducted and murdered by convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child sex offender]] Roy Whiting in [[Littlehampton]], [[West Sussex]], in July 2000. Her body was found 15 miles away just over two weeks later. Whiting was found guilty of her murder in December 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment, with the judge saying that it was a rare case in which a life sentence should mean life. The trial judge's recommendation was later replaced by a 50-year minimum term by the [[Home Office]], just before politicians were stripped of their powers to decide when or if a life sentence prisoner could apply for parole. Whiting's sentence has since been set at a 40-year minimum term by the High Court, which means that Whiting cannot be considered for parole until the age of 82. At the end of the trial, it was revealed that he already had a previous conviction for abduction and indecent assault on an eight-year-old girl in 1995, and that he was on the sex offenders register.\n|-\n| 2000 || Murder of [[Damilola Taylor]] || 1 || [[Peckham]], London ||   | While on his way from Peckham Library, 10-year-old [[Nigeria|Nigerian-born]] Damilola Taylor was found with a cut to his left thigh and bled to death within a half hour before arriving at a local hospital. Four teenagers were tried for murder in 2002 but cleared. A second trial in 2006 saw two other suspects - brothers Ricky and Gavin Preedie - found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to eight years in prison, but both were released within four years.\n|-\n| 2001 || [[Torso in the Thames]] case || 1 || [[River Thames]], London ||   | A human [[torso]] discovered floating in the [[River Thames]] on 21 September 2001 was eventually revealed to be the remains of a recently arrived Nigerian boy, between the ages of four and seven. Although the child is thought to be a victim of a ritual killing, the London Metropolitan Police Service have yet to apprehend those responsible. The identity of the torso has never been established.\n|-\n| 2001 || [[Murder of Danielle Jones]] || 1 || [[East Tilbury]], [[Essex]], England ||   | The conviction of 15-year-old Jones' uncle Stuart Campbell primarily relied upon forensic authorship analysis of text messages sent on the victim's mobile phone. Jones was last seen alive on 18 June 2001. Her body has never been found. Five months after her disappearance, police charged Campbell with murder. He was found guilty in December 2002 and sentenced to life imprisonment as well as 10 years for abduction. After the trial, controversy arose when it was revealed Campbell had prior convictions for indecent assault on other girls of similar ages. The use of forensic authorship analysis of text messages in the case provoked research into its use in other cases. Police also found bloodstained stockings, which had traces of DNA belonging to Campbell and his niece, in the loft of Campbell's house in [[Essex]].\n|-\n| 2002 || [[Murder of Amanda Dowler]] || 1 || [[Walton-on-Thames]], [[Surrey]], England ||   | 13-year-old Amanda Dowler went missing on her journey home from school. Her body was discovered six months later in [[Yateley]], [[Hampshire]]. The investigation gained national media coverage and was the largest investigation undertaken by Surrey police. [[Levi Bellfield]], who had been convicted of two other murders and an attempted murder (all committed after Amanda's disappearance) in February 2008, was found guilty of the murder in June 2011 and received an additional life sentence. Shortly after Bellfield's trial, it was revealed that her mobile phone had been hacked by ''[[News of the World]]'' reporters a while after she went missing, and they had deleted text messages from her inbox, giving her parents false hope that she was still alive (it is believed that she died the same afternoon or evening that she went missing). These revelations, along with numerous other phone-hacking allegations, contributed to the newspaper's closure. [[Rupert Murdoch]], owner of the ''News of the World'', later awarded the Dowler family \u00a33 million in compensation.\n|-\n| 2002 || [[Soham murders]] || 2 || [[Soham]], [[Cambridgeshire]], England ||   | Two ten-year-old girls, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, were murdered by local school caretaker Ian Huntley after luring them into his home on 4 August 2002. The search for the two girls was one of the longest undertaken by British authorities. Their bodies were found two weeks after their disappearance and Huntley was jailed for life for the murders in December 2003. In September 2005, his minimum term was set at 40 years by the [[High Court]], meaning that he cannot be considered for parole until at least 2042 at the age of 68. His partner, [[Maxine Carr (criminal)|Maxine Carr]], had been found guilty of perverting the course of justice and received a prison sentence of three-and-a-half years. She was released under a new identity in May 2004.\n|-\n| 2003 || [[Murder of Jodi Jones]] || 1 || [[Dalkeith]], [[Midlothian]], Scotland ||   | Jodi Jones was a 14-year-old girl who was murdered by her teenage boyfriend, Luke Mitchell. She was brutally attacked and stabbed. He was subsequently jailed for life.\n|-\n| 2004 || [[Murder of Kriss Donald]] || 1 || [[Glasgow]], Scotland ||   | Kriss Donald was a white 15-year-old boy abducted, tortured and murdered by an Asian gang in a racist attack. Daanish Zahid became the first person in Scotland to be convicted of racially motivated murder in relation to the attack. Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid, and Mohammed Faisal Mushtaq were also given life sentences. Zahid Mohammed received a 5-year sentence for abduction.\n|-\n| 2007 || [[Death of Baby P]] || 1 || [[London Borough of Haringey]], [[North London]] ||   | Peter Connelly (also known as \"Baby P\", \"Child A\" and \"Baby Peter\") was a 17-month-old boy who died in London after suffering more than 50 injuries over an eight-month period, during which he was repeatedly seen by Haringey Children's Services and NHS health professionals. His real first name was revealed as \"Peter\" on the conclusion of a subsequent trial of the child's mother's boyfriend on a charge of raping a two-year-old. His full identity was revealed when his killers were named after the expiry of a court anonymity order on 10 August 2009. His mother has since been released from prison. The case caused shock and concern among the public and in Parliament, partly because of the magnitude of Peter's injuries, and because he lived in the [[London Borough of Haringey]], under the same child care authorities that had already failed ten years earlier in the case of [[murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9|Victoria Climbi\u00e9]]. This had led to a public enquiry which resulted in measures being put in place in an effort to prevent similar cases happening.\n|-\n| 2007 || [[Murder of Rhys Jones]] || 1 || [[Liverpool]], England ||   | 11-year-old Rhys Milford Jones was murdered on 22 August 2007 in Liverpool, England, when he was fatally shot in the neck. A local 18-year-old, Sean Mercer, received a life sentence for the murder in December 2008 and the trial judge recommended he should not be considered for parole for at least 22 years.\n|-\n| 2008 || [[Murder of Ben Kinsella]] || 1 || [[Islington]], London ||   | Ben Michael Kinsella, aged 16, was murdered by a gang of black teenagers in [[Islington]] after an argument in which he was described as \"blameless\". The significant media attention around his murder (the 17th stabbing death of a teenager in London during 2008) led to a series of anti-knife crime demonstrations, a raised profile for the government's anti-knife crime maxim \"Operation Blunt 2\", and a review and change of UK knife crime sentencing laws. The members of the gang were later jailed for life. His sister, [[Brooke Kinsella]], an actress whose credits include a role in [[EastEnders]], has since been at the centre of a media campaign against knife crime.\n|-\n| 2010 || [[Murder of Tia Rigg]] || 1 || [[Manchester]], England ||   | Tia Rigg was a 12-year-old girl who was murdered by her uncle, [[John Maden (murderer)|John Maden]], who had an 'obsessive interest' in pornography depicting paedophilia, rape and torture. On 3 April 2010, Maden called Tia's mother on the pretext of having Tia come over to his house and babysit his 10-year-old daughter. When Tia arrived at Maden's home, he drugged her with [[Olanzapine]], a powerful antipsychotic tranquilliser. He then inflicted a 'horrific catalogue of sexual injuries' on Tia before stabbing her in the stomach and strangling her with a ligature made from a guitar string. Maden then dialled 999 to admit the killing; when asked why, he said \"because I felt like it\". Arrested and charged with rape and murder, he pleaded guilty on 4 October 2010 and was sentenced to life; and was told that, due to the sheer depravity of his crime and the agony and terror Tia must have suffered, he should never be released.\n|-\n|2012 || [[Murder of Daniel Pelka|Murder of Daniel Pe\u0142ka]] || 1 || [[Coventry]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England ||   | Pe\u0142ka, aged 4, died of a head injury on 3 March 2012. His mother, Magdalena \u0141uczak and her partner, Mariusz Kr\u0119\u017co\u0142ek, both [[Poland|Polish]] nationals, were found guilty of his murder in 2013 and jailed for life, with a minimum term of 30 years. \u0141uczak and Kr\u0119\u017co\u0142ek starved the child, beat him, locked him in a room, force-fed him salt and waterboarded him. He weighed only 1st 3lbs (7.7 kg) - a similar weight to a baby less than a year old - when he died. A [[serious case review]] was held, as [[Social Services]] failed to act sufficiently on complaints from individuals, including staff at Daniel's school, who were concerned that he was being deprived of food. Both \u0141uczak and Kr\u0119\u017co\u0142ek died in prison within three years of their conviction.\n|-\n| 2012 || [[Allenton house fire]] || 6 || [[Allenton, Derby|Allenton]], [[Derby]], [[Derbyshire]], England ||   | The Allenton house fire occurred on 11 May 2012 in 18 Victory Road, a residential street in [[Allenton, Derby|Allenton]]. Six siblings were killed in the fire. The children's parents, [[Mick Philpott|Mick]] and Mairead Philpott, were later arrested and charged with murder, along with their friend Paul Mosley. In December 2012 their charges were downgraded to manslaughter. On 2 April 2013, Mick Philpott and Paul Mosley were found guilty by [[unanimous verdict]]s, while Mairead Philpott was found guilty by a majority verdict. Mosley was jailed for 11 years and the Philpotts both received life sentences.\n|-\n| 2012 || [[Murder of Tia Sharp]] || 1 || [[New Addington]], [[London Borough of Croydon]] ||   | Tia Sharp was a 12-year-old girl who was reported missing from the home of her grandmother, Christine Sharp, in [[New Addington]], on 3 August 2012. When police discovered her body in the loft of the house seven days later, they arrested Christine Sharp and Stuart Hazell on suspicion of murder. Hazell was Christine Sharp's partner and a former boyfriend of Tia's mother, Natalie. Sharp was quickly eliminated from inquiries but Hazell was then charged with Tia's murder and five days into his trial at the [[Old Bailey]] the following year, changed his plea to guilty. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 38-year minimum term. It is believed that Hazell had become 'sexually fixated' with Tia, and that he smothered or strangled her when she said she was going to tell her mother after he tried to make sexual advances towards her.\n|-\n| 2012 || [[Murder of April Jones]] || 1 || [[Machynlleth]], [[Powys]], Wales ||   | April Jones, a five-year-old girl from Machynlleth, disappeared on the evening of 1 October 2012, after being sighted willingly getting into a vehicle near her home. Her disappearance generated a large amount of press coverage, both nationally and internationally. Five days after she was last seen, a local man, Mark Bridger, was charged with April's abduction and murder. He was found guilty of all charges on 30 May 2013. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should never be released. April's body has never been found, but police found skull fragments and blood in Bridger's home, which was matched to April Jones and indicated that she had suffered \"unsurvivable injuries\" at the hands of 47-year-old Bridger.\n|-\n|2014 || [[Murder of Breck Bednar]] || 1 || [[Grays, Essex|Grays]], [[Essex]], England ||   | Breck Bednar was a 14-year-old boy who was murdered on 17 February 2014 in a flat at Rosebery Road in Grays, Essex. Lewis Daynes, 19, was due to stand trial at Chelmsford Crown Court on a charge of murder but admitted the offence before the jury was sworn. Daynes, a computer engineer, was believed to have met Bednar while playing online video games. In January 2015, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25 years.\n|-\n| 2014 ||[[Murder of Alice Gross]]|| 1 || [[Hanwell]], London ||   | Alice Gross was a 14-year-old girl from [[Hanwell]], west London, who went missing on 28 August 2014. The search for her was the largest deployment of Metropolitan Police officers in a search operation since the 7 July 2005 London bombings, involving 600 officers from eight forces. Police subsequently identified Latvian immigrant Arnis Za\u013ckalns as the prime suspect. He went missing from Ealing, London, on 3 September. Gross' body was found in the River Brent on 30 September. Four days later, Zalkalns' body was found in dense woodland in Boston Manor Park. The cause of his death was hanging. It was revealed that he had a previous conviction for murder in Latvia.\n|-\n|2015 || [[Murder of Becky Watts]] || 1 || [[Bristol]], England ||   | Rebecca 'Becky' Watts was a 16-year-old student from Crown Hill in the St. George area of Bristol, who went missing on 19 February 2015 and whose [[dismemberment|dismembered]] body was found on 2 March in Barton Court.\n|-\n| 2016 || [[Murder of Paige Doherty]] || 1 || [[Clydebank]], West Dumbartonshire, Scotland ||   | Paige Doherty was a 15-year-old student from Clydebank who went missing on 19 March 2016. The search for Paige began after she failed to arrive at her weekend hairdressing job in [[Kirkintilloch]], 12 miles away. Her body was found on the roadside near Glasgow's Great Western Road two days later. She had been stabbed 43 times in the head and neck and suffered more than 150 wounds. The last sighting of Paige was on CCTV at a deli shop in Clydebank, owned by John Leathem, who later admitted to murdering the teenager. Paige's mother, Pamela Munro, set up a charity in Paige's name to teach children self-defence.\n|-\n| 2018 || [[Murder of Alesha MacPhail]] || 1 || [[Rothesay, Bute]], Scotland ||   | Alesha MacPhail was a 6-year-old schoolgirl from [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire]], Scotland who was reported missing from her grandparents' home on the [[Isle of Bute]] at 6:25am on 2 July 2018. She was staying with her father, Robert, and her grandparents, Calum and Angela MacPhail. It is claimed that Alesha's mother, Georgina Lochrane, 23, who could not be contacted immediately after Alesha went missing, found out about her daughter's disappearance and later death on the social media platform [[Facebook]]. Alesha's body was found in woodland on the site of an abandoned hotel, around 20 minutes walk from her grandparents' home. 16-year-old Aaron Campbell was eventually arrested and charged with Alesha's abduction, rape and murder and sentenced to a minimum of 27 years in jail.<ref name=\"guilty\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-47322658|title=Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder|date=21 February 2019|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-47644414|title=Alesha MacPhail murder: Life sentence for Aaron Campbell after he admits guilt|date=21 March 2019|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Individual murders==\n\n===19th century===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!width=30pt|Date\n!width=150pt|Name\n!width=30pt|No. of<br>Deaths\n!width=150pt|Location\n!Details\n|-\n| 1823 || The [[Radlett murder]] || 1 || [[Radlett]], England ||   | William Weare was shot and his throat cut by John Thurtell, the son of the mayor of [[Norwich]].

Bell was ten years old at the time of one of the killings, and eleven at the time of the other. She was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] and sent to a special approved school, being released from custody in 1980.\n|-\n| 1973 || The [[David McGreavy]] case || 3 || [[Worcester]], England ||   | David McGreavy was a lodger in the home of his friends, Clive and Elsie Ralph. While minding the Ralphs' three small children, Paul (age 4), Dawn (age 2) and Samantha (age 8 months), McGreavy murdered the children. He then mutilated their bodies with a pickaxe and impaled them outside on the spikes of a wrought-iron fence. McGreavy, called the \"Monster of Worcester\" in the press, later pleaded guilty to all three murders and was sentenced to multiple [[life imprisonment|life terms]] with a minimum term of 20 years.\n|-\n| 1978 || The [[Carl Bridgewater]] Case || 1 || [[Wordsley]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England ||   | The body of 13-year-old paperboy Carl Bridgewater was found in the house of a local elderly couple who had been out for the day. It was presumed by police that Bridgewater had disturbed a burglar while delivering a newspaper to their home and was dragged into their living room where he was killed with a shotgun blast to the head. The following year, a group of men - widely referred to in the press as the ''[[Bridgewater Four]]'' - were convicted of the crime, three for murder and a fourth for manslaughter. The defendant convicted of manslaughter subsequently died in prison but the three convicted of murder were released in 1997 when their convictions were quashed on appeal. Nobody else has ever been charged.\n|-\n|1981 || The [[Murder of Karen Price]]<br/>(Little Miss Nobody) || 1 || [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] ||   | Karen Price was a 15-year-old Welsh murder victim who disappeared in 1981. After the discovery of her body in 1989, British facial reconstruction artist [[Richard Neave]] used her skull to create a model of her physical appearance. The reconstruction and the matching of DNA in the body to that of Price's parents allowed her body to be identified. The case was cited as one of the first instances in which DNA technology was used in this way. The police later concluded that Price had run away from home and turned to prostitution. In 1991, Idris Ali and Alan Charlton, who were alleged to have managed her solicitation as a prostitute, were charged with her murder. Ali's charge was eventually reduced to manslaughter, and he was released in 1994. Charlton is still serving a life sentence.\n|-\n| 1983 || The [[murder of Colette Aram]] || 1 || [[Keyworth]], [[Nottinghamshire]] England ||   | Colette Aram, a 16-year-old trainee hairdresser, was abducted, raped and strangled as she walked from her home to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983.

After the discovery of Bulger's body two days later, Venables and Thompson were found guilty of murder in November that year and sentenced to be detained indefinitely. They spent eight years in custody before being released on life licence in 2001. Venables was recalled to prison in early 2010 for breaching his licence conditions, having been caught possessing [[child pornography]].\n|-\n| 1994 || The [[murder of Richard Everitt]] || 1 || London, England ||   | On 13 August 1994, 15-year-old Richard Everitt was stabbed to death in [[London]] in a racially motivated attack.

They were sentenced to life imprisonment in May 1996 after admitting the murder. They had sexually abused Handley before murdering him and abandoning his body near [[Bristol]], where it was found five months later. The trial judge described the pair as \"vultures\" and recommended they should never be set free. After their trial, it was revealed that both had convictions for sexual offences against children. In 2002 the then-Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]] sought to impose 50-year tariffs on Morss and Tyler, but they were overturned within 24 hours by both the [[High Court of Justice|High Court for England and Wales]] and the European Court of Human Rights.\n|-\n| 1996 || The [[Michael Stone (murderer)|Michael Stone]] Killings || 2 || [[Kent]], England ||   | Michael Stone was convicted in October 1998 of the July 1996 murders of Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter Megan, who were killed in a hammer attack. He was also convicted of attempting to murder Mrs Russell's nine-year-old daughter Josie, who suffered serious head injuries. He has continued to assert his innocence since his conviction. His original conviction was overturned on appeal but a second trial in 2002 resulted in another guilty verdict after another prisoner claimed that Stone had confessed to the killings while on remand in jail. His most recent appeal, in 2004, also failed.\n|-\n| 1997 || The [[murder of Billie-Jo Jenkins]] || 1 || [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]], England ||   | 13-year-old Billie-Jo Jenkins  was murdered on 15 February 1997 at the home where she lived with her foster parents. Her foster father, Si\u00f4n Jenkins, was charged with the murder and later convicted, but maintained his innocence. An appeal in 1999 against his conviction failed, but after a second appeal in August 2004 it was quashed by a court as unsafe and he was released on bail pending a retrial. The juries in two subsequent retrials were unable to reach verdicts, and a not guilty verdict was recorded in 2006. Nobody else has been arrested since his acquittal and the case remains unsolved.\n|}\n\n===2000s\u2013present===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!width=30pt|Date\n!width=150pt|Name\n!width=30pt|No. of<br>Deaths\n!width=150pt|Location\n!Details\n|-\n| 2000 || [[Murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9]] || 1 || London ||   | 8-year-old [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] girl, Victoria Adjo Climbi\u00e9 (2 November 1991&nbsp;\u2013 25 February 2000), was tortured and murdered by her guardians (including her aunt), who were found guilty of murder and jailed for life the following year. Her death led to a public inquiry and produced major changes in child protection policies in England.\n|-\n| 2000 || Murder of [[Murder of Sarah Payne|Sarah Payne]] || 1 || [[East Preston, West Sussex|East Preston]], [[West Sussex]], England ||   | Sarah Payne, a seven-year-old girl from [[Surrey]], was abducted and murdered by convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child sex offender]] Roy Whiting in [[Littlehampton]], [[West Sussex]], in July 2000. Her body was found 15 miles away just over two weeks later. Whiting was found guilty of her murder in December 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment, with the judge saying that it was a rare case in which a life sentence should mean life. The trial judge's recommendation was later replaced by a 50-year minimum term by the [[Home Office]], just before politicians were stripped of their powers to decide when or if a life sentence prisoner could apply for parole. Whiting's sentence has since been set at a 40-year minimum term by the High Court, which means that Whiting cannot be considered for parole until the age of 82. At the end of the trial, it was revealed that he already had a previous conviction for abduction and indecent assault on an eight-year-old girl in 1995, and that he was on the sex offenders register.\n|-\n| 2000 || Murder of [[Damilola Taylor]] || 1 || [[Peckham]], London ||   | While on his way from Peckham Library, 10-year-old [[Nigeria|Nigerian-born]] Damilola Taylor was found with a cut to his left thigh and bled to death within a half hour before arriving at a local hospital.

Although the child is thought to be a victim of a ritual killing, the London Metropolitan Police Service have yet to apprehend those responsible. The identity of the torso has never been established.\n|-\n| 2001 || [[Murder of Danielle Jones]] || 1 || [[East Tilbury]], [[Essex]], England ||   | The conviction of 15-year-old Jones' uncle Stuart Campbell primarily relied upon forensic authorship analysis of text messages sent on the victim's mobile phone. Jones was last seen alive on 18 June 2001. Her body has never been found. Five months after her disappearance, police charged Campbell with murder. He was found guilty in December 2002 and sentenced to life imprisonment as well as 10 years for abduction. After the trial, controversy arose when it was revealed Campbell had prior convictions for indecent assault on other girls of similar ages. The use of forensic authorship analysis of text messages in the case provoked research into its use in other cases. Police also found bloodstained stockings, which had traces of DNA belonging to Campbell and his niece, in the loft of Campbell's house in [[Essex]].\n|-\n| 2002 || [[Murder of Amanda Dowler]] || 1 || [[Walton-on-Thames]], [[Surrey]], England ||   | 13-year-old Amanda Dowler went missing on her journey home from school. Her body was discovered six months later in [[Yateley]], [[Hampshire]]. The investigation gained national media coverage and was the largest investigation undertaken by Surrey police. [[Levi Bellfield]], who had been convicted of two other murders and an attempted murder (all committed after Amanda's disappearance) in February 2008, was found guilty of the murder in June 2011 and received an additional life sentence. Shortly after Bellfield's trial, it was revealed that her mobile phone had been hacked by ''[[News of the World]]'' reporters a while after she went missing, and they had deleted text messages from her inbox, giving her parents false hope that she was still alive (it is believed that she died the same afternoon or evening that she went missing). These revelations, along with numerous other phone-hacking allegations, contributed to the newspaper's closure. [[Rupert Murdoch]], owner of the ''News of the World'', later awarded the Dowler family \u00a33 million in compensation.\n|-\n| 2002 || [[Soham murders]] || 2 || [[Soham]], [[Cambridgeshire]], England ||   | Two ten-year-old girls, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, were murdered by local school caretaker Ian Huntley after luring them into his home on 4 August 2002. The search for the two girls was one of the longest undertaken by British authorities. Their bodies were found two weeks after their disappearance and Huntley was jailed for life for the murders in December 2003. In September 2005, his minimum term was set at 40 years by the [[High Court]], meaning that he cannot be considered for parole until at least 2042 at the age of 68. His partner, [[Maxine Carr (criminal)|Maxine Carr]], had been found guilty of perverting the course of justice and received a prison sentence of three-and-a-half years. She was released under a new identity in May 2004.\n|-\n| 2003 || [[Murder of Jodi Jones]] || 1 || [[Dalkeith]], [[Midlothian]], Scotland ||   | Jodi Jones was a 14-year-old girl who was murdered by her teenage boyfriend, Luke Mitchell. She was brutally attacked and stabbed. He was subsequently jailed for life.\n|-\n| 2004 || [[Murder of Kriss Donald]] || 1 || [[Glasgow]], Scotland ||   | Kriss Donald was a white 15-year-old boy abducted, tortured and murdered by an Asian gang in a racist attack. Daanish Zahid became the first person in Scotland to be convicted of racially motivated murder in relation to the attack. Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid, and Mohammed Faisal Mushtaq were also given life sentences. Zahid Mohammed received a 5-year sentence for abduction.\n|-\n| 2007 || [[Death of Baby P]] || 1 || [[London Borough of Haringey]], [[North London]] ||   | Peter Connelly (also known as \"Baby P\", \"Child A\" and \"Baby Peter\") was a 17-month-old boy who died in London after suffering more than 50 injuries over an eight-month period, during which he was repeatedly seen by Haringey Children's Services and NHS health professionals. His real first name was revealed as \"Peter\" on the conclusion of a subsequent trial of the child's mother's boyfriend on a charge of raping a two-year-old. His full identity was revealed when his killers were named after the expiry of a court anonymity order on 10 August 2009. His mother has since been released from prison. The case caused shock and concern among the public and in Parliament, partly because of the magnitude of Peter's injuries, and because he lived in the [[London Borough of Haringey]], under the same child care authorities that had already failed ten years earlier in the case of [[murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9|Victoria Climbi\u00e9]]. This had led to a public enquiry which resulted in measures being put in place in an effort to prevent similar cases happening.\n|-\n| 2007 || [[Murder of Rhys Jones]] || 1 || [[Liverpool]], England ||   | 11-year-old Rhys Milford Jones was murdered on 22 August 2007 in Liverpool, England, when he was fatally shot in the neck. A local 18-year-old, Sean Mercer, received a life sentence for the murder in December 2008 and the trial judge recommended he should not be considered for parole for at least 22 years.\n|-\n| 2008 || [[Murder of Ben Kinsella]] || 1 || [[Islington]], London ||   | Ben Michael Kinsella, aged 16, was murdered by a gang of black teenagers in [[Islington]] after an argument in which he was described as \"blameless\". The significant media attention around his murder (the 17th stabbing death of a teenager in London during 2008) led to a series of anti-knife crime demonstrations, a raised profile for the government's anti-knife crime maxim \"Operation Blunt 2\", and a review and change of UK knife crime sentencing laws. The members of the gang were later jailed for life. His sister, [[Brooke Kinsella]], an actress whose credits include a role in [[EastEnders]], has since been at the centre of a media campaign against knife crime.\n|-\n| 2010 || [[Murder of Tia Rigg]] || 1 || [[Manchester]], England ||   | Tia Rigg was a 12-year-old girl who was murdered by her uncle, [[John Maden (murderer)|John Maden]], who had an 'obsessive interest' in pornography depicting paedophilia, rape and torture. On 3 April 2010, Maden called Tia's mother on the pretext of having Tia come over to his house and babysit his 10-year-old daughter. When Tia arrived at Maden's home, he drugged her with [[Olanzapine]], a powerful antipsychotic tranquilliser. He then inflicted a 'horrific catalogue of sexual injuries' on Tia before stabbing her in the stomach and strangling her with a ligature made from a guitar string. Maden then dialled 999 to admit the killing; when asked why, he said \"because I felt like it\". Arrested and charged with rape and murder, he pleaded guilty on 4 October 2010 and was sentenced to life; and was told that, due to the sheer depravity of his crime and the agony and terror Tia must have suffered, he should never be released.\n|-\n|2012 || [[Murder of Daniel Pelka|Murder of Daniel Pe\u0142ka]] || 1 || [[Coventry]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England ||   | Pe\u0142ka, aged 4, died of a head injury on 3 March 2012. His mother, Magdalena \u0141uczak and her partner, Mariusz Kr\u0119\u017co\u0142ek, both [[Poland|Polish]] nationals, were found guilty of his murder in 2013 and jailed for life, with a minimum term of 30 years. \u0141uczak and Kr\u0119\u017co\u0142ek starved the child, beat him, locked him in a room, force-fed him salt and waterboarded him. He weighed only 1st 3lbs (7.7 kg) - a similar weight to a baby less than a year old - when he died. A [[serious case review]] was held, as [[Social Services]] failed to act sufficiently on complaints from individuals, including staff at Daniel's school, who were concerned that he was being deprived of food. Both \u0141uczak and Kr\u0119\u017co\u0142ek died in prison within three years of their conviction.\n|-\n| 2012 || [[Allenton house fire]] || 6 || [[Allenton, Derby|Allenton]], [[Derby]], [[Derbyshire]], England ||   | The Allenton house fire occurred on 11 May 2012 in 18 Victory Road, a residential street in [[Allenton, Derby|Allenton]]. Six siblings were killed in the fire. The children's parents, [[Mick Philpott|Mick]] and Mairead Philpott, were later arrested and charged with murder, along with their friend Paul Mosley. In December 2012 their charges were downgraded to manslaughter. On 2 April 2013, Mick Philpott and Paul Mosley were found guilty by [[unanimous verdict]]s, while Mairead Philpott was found guilty by a majority verdict. Mosley was jailed for 11 years and the Philpotts both received life sentences.\n|-\n| 2012 || [[Murder of Tia Sharp]] || 1 || [[New Addington]], [[London Borough of Croydon]] ||   | Tia Sharp was a 12-year-old girl who was reported missing from the home of her grandmother, Christine Sharp, in [[New Addington]], on 3 August 2012. When police discovered her body in the loft of the house seven days later, they arrested Christine Sharp and Stuart Hazell on suspicion of murder. Hazell was Christine Sharp's partner and a former boyfriend of Tia's mother, Natalie. Sharp was quickly eliminated from inquiries but Hazell was then charged with Tia's murder and five days into his trial at the [[Old Bailey]] the following year, changed his plea to guilty. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 38-year minimum term. It is believed that Hazell had become 'sexually fixated' with Tia, and that he smothered or strangled her when she said she was going to tell her mother after he tried to make sexual advances towards her.\n|-\n| 2012 || [[Murder of April Jones]] || 1 || [[Machynlleth]], [[Powys]], Wales ||   | April Jones, a five-year-old girl from Machynlleth, disappeared on the evening of 1 October 2012, after being sighted willingly getting into a vehicle near her home. Her disappearance generated a large amount of press coverage, both nationally and internationally. Five days after she was last seen, a local man, Mark Bridger, was charged with April's abduction and murder. He was found guilty of all charges on 30 May 2013. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should never be released. April's body has never been found, but police found skull fragments and blood in Bridger's home, which was matched to April Jones and indicated that she had suffered \"unsurvivable injuries\" at the hands of 47-year-old Bridger.\n|-\n|2014 || [[Murder of Breck Bednar]] || 1 || [[Grays]], [[Essex]], England ||   | Breck Bednar was a 14-year-old boy who was murdered on 17 February 2014 in a flat at Rosebery Road in Grays, Essex.

Daynes, a computer engineer, was believed to have met Bednar while playing online video games. In January 2015, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25 years.\n|-\n| 2014 ||[[Murder of Alice Gross]]|| 1 || [[Hanwell]], London ||   | Alice Gross was a 14-year-old girl from [[Hanwell]], west London, who went missing on 28 August 2014. The search for her was the largest deployment of Metropolitan Police officers in a search operation since the 7 July 2005 London bombings, involving 600 officers from eight forces. Police subsequently identified Latvian immigrant Arnis Za\u013ckalns as the prime suspect. He went missing from Ealing, London, on 3 September. Gross' body was found in the River Brent on 30 September. Four days later, Zalkalns' body was found in dense woodland in Boston Manor Park. The cause of his death was hanging. It was revealed that he had a previous conviction for murder in Latvia.\n|-\n|2015 || [[Murder of Becky Watts]] || 1 || [[Bristol]], England ||   | Rebecca 'Becky' Watts was a 16-year-old student from Crown Hill in the St. George area of Bristol, who went missing on 19 February 2015 and whose [[dismemberment|dismembered]] body was found on 2 March in Barton Court.\n|-\n| 2016 || [[Murder of Paige Doherty]] || 1 || [[Clydebank]], West Dumbartonshire, Scotland ||   | Paige Doherty was a 15-year-old student from Clydebank who went missing on 19 March 2016.

Before Rackliff could flee the scene, Carr withdrew a blade and stabbed Rackliff approximately 32 times and abandoning her body.
