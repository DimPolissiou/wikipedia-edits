The 2017 election also saw the first party under MMP in New Zealand to lead a government without commanding the plurality of the party vote.\n\n===Current standings===\n{{52nd New Zealand Parliament}}\n*{{note|Coalition|Coa}} [[New Zealand First]] announced a coalition agreement with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] on 19 October 2017.\n*{{note|Confidence|CS}} The [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] entered into a [[confidence and supply]] agreement with the Labour Party on the same day as the coalition was announced.\n{{notelist}}\n*{{note|Ross|Ind1}} National MP [[Jami-Lee Ross]] resigned from the party in October 2018 after an alleged leak of party documents and a public spat with party leader [[Simon Bridges]]. He has continued to represent his electorate as an independent MP.\n\n== Electoral system ==\n{{main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}\n\nNew Zealand uses the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the House of Representatives. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties which meet the threshold (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 72 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 48 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]]. If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang.\n\nThe political party or party bloc with the majority of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party has won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats. As a result, parties must negotiate with other parties to form a [[coalition government]] or a [[minority government]].\n\n===Electorate boundaries===\n[[File:New Zealand electorate popualtion change, 2018 census.svg|thumb|300x300px|The 2014 electoral boundaries showing electorates out of tolerance following the 2018 census and M\u0101ori electoral option.

For the 2019/20 fiscal year, every registered party contending the party vote is permitted to spend [[NZD|$]]1,169,000 on election campaigning during the regulated period, excluding radio and television campaigning (broadcasting funding is allocated separately).

Only money from the broadcasting allocation can be used to purchase airtime; the actual production costs of advertisements can come from the general election expenses budget.

He has continued to represent his electorate as an independent MP.\n\n== Electoral system ==\n{{main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}\n\nNew Zealand uses the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the House of Representatives. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties which meet the threshold (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 72 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 48 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]]. If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang.\n\nThe political party or party bloc with the majority of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party has won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats. As a result, parties must negotiate with other parties to form a [[coalition government]] or a [[minority government]].\n\n===Electorate boundaries===\n[[File:New Zealand electorate popualtion change, 2018 census.svg|thumb|300x300px|The 2014 electoral boundaries showing electorates out of tolerance following the 2018 census and M\u0101ori electoral option.

The writs must be returned within 50 days of their issuance (save for any judicial recount or death of a candidate), which would be 7 December 2020.<ref name=legislation1>{{cite web |url= http://legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html |title=Electoral Act 1993, Sec. 139 |date=17 August 2011 |website=Legislation.co.nz |accessdate=22 October 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160629065145/http://legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html#DLM309482 |archivedate=29 June 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Because polling day must be on a Saturday,<ref name=legislation1/> and two weeks is generally required for the counting of special votes, the last possible date for the next general election is 21 November 2020.\n\nOn 28 January 2020, Ardern announced that the election will be held on 19 September,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/118983011/jacinda-ardern-announces-2020-election-will-be-held-on-september-19 |title=Jacinda Ardern announces 2020 election will be held on September 19 |first1=Luke |last1=Malpass |first2=Henry |last2=Cooke |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=28 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128021549/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/118983011/jacinda-ardern-announces-2020-election-will-be-held-on-september-19 |archive-date=28 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> with the {{show by date|2020|9|19|current|52nd}} parliament holding its last sitting day on 6 August and dissolving on 12 August.<ref name=\"election date\"/>\n\nThe date of 19 September was announced before the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand|COVID-19 pandemic had reached New Zealand]].

For the 2019/20 fiscal year, every registered party contending the party vote is permitted to spend [[NZD|$]]1,169,000 on election campaigning during the regulated period, excluding radio and television campaigning (broadcasting funding is allocated separately). Additionally, all electorate candidates are permitted to spend $27,500 each on campaigning over and above their party's allocation.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 205(c).</ref> A party contesting all 72 electorates is therefore permitted to spend $3,149,000 on election campaigning.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 206(c).</ref>\n\nRegistered parties are allocated a separate broadcasting budget for radio and television campaigning. Only money from the broadcasting allocation can be used to purchase airtime; the actual production costs of advertisements can come from the general election expenses budget.
