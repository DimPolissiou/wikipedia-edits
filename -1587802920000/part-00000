Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with [[Amnesty International]] and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.<ref

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

European interest in the study of the [[languages of India]] led to the first efforts at documenting the Santali language. [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]], [[Odia script|Odia]] and Roman scripts were first used to write Santali before the 1860s by European anthropologists, folklorists and missionaries including A. R. Campbell, [[Lars Olsen Skrefsrud|Lars Skrefsrud]] and [[Paul Olaf Bodding|Paul Bodding]]. Their efforts resulted in Santali dictionaries, versions of folk tales, and the study of the morphology, syntax and phonetic structure of the language.\n\nThe [[Ol Chiki script]] was created for Santali by [[Mayurbhanj State|Mayurbhanj]] poet [[Raghunath Murmu]] in 1925 and first publicised in 1939.<ref name=\"Hembram\">{{cite book|last1=Hembram|first1=Phatik Chandra|title=Santhali, a Natural Language|date=2002|publisher=U.

In modern Indian languages like Western Hindi the steps of evolution from Midland Prakrit Sauraseni could be traced clearly. In the case of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] such steps of evolution are not always clear and distinct, and one has to look at other influences that moulded Bengali's essential characteristics.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nA notable work in this field was initiated by linguist [[Byomkes Chakrabarti]] in the 1960s. Chakrabarti investigated the complex process of assimilation of Austroasiatic family, particularly Santali elements, into Bengali. He showed the overwhelming influence of Bengali on Santali. His formulations are based on the detailed study of two-way influences on all aspects of both languages and tried to bring out the unique features of the languages.

Ol Chiki is alphabetic, sharing none of the syllabic properties of the other Indic scripts, and is now widely used to write Santali in India.\n\n==History==\nAccording to linguist [[Paul Sidwell]], [[Munda languages]] probably arrived on the coast of [[Odisha]] from [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochina]] about 4000\u20133500 years ago, after [[Indo-Aryan migration]] to Odisha.<ref>Sidwell, Paul. 2018.

European interest in the study of the [[languages of India]] led to the first efforts at documenting the Santali language. [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]], [[Odia script|Odia]] and Roman scripts were first used to write Santali before the 1860s by European anthropologists, folklorists and missionaries including A. R. Campbell, [[Lars Olsen Skrefsrud|Lars Skrefsrud]] and [[Paul Olaf Bodding|Paul Bodding]]. Their efforts resulted in Santali dictionaries, versions of folk tales, and the study of the morphology, syntax and phonetic structure of the language.\n\nThe [[Ol Chiki script]] was created for Santali by [[Mayurbhanj State|Mayurbhanj]] poet [[Raghunath Murmu]] in 1925 and first publicised in 1939.<ref name=\"Hembram\">{{cite book|last1=Hembram|first1=Phatik Chandra|title=Santhali, a Natural Language|date=2002|publisher=U.

This affiliation is generally accepted, but there are many cross-questions and puzzles.{{clarify |date=April 2019}}\n\nBorrowing between Santali and other Indian languages has not yet been studied fully. In modern Indian languages like Western Hindi the steps of evolution from Midland Prakrit Sauraseni could be traced clearly. In the case of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] such steps of evolution are not always clear and distinct, and one has to look at other influences that moulded Bengali's essential characteristics.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nA notable work in this field was initiated by linguist [[Byomkes Chakrabarti]] in the 1960s. Chakrabarti investigated the complex process of assimilation of Austroasiatic family, particularly Santali elements, into Bengali. He showed the overwhelming influence of Bengali on Santali. His formulations are based on the detailed study of two-way influences on all aspects of both languages and tried to bring out the unique features of the languages. More research is awaited in this area.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nNotable linguist [[Khudiram Das]] authored the '<nowiki/>''Santali Bangla Samasabda Abhidhan''' ({{Lang|bn|\u09b8\u09be\u0981\u0993\u09a4\u09be\u09b2\u09bf \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be \u09b8\u09ae\u09b6\u09ac\u09cd\u09a6 \u0985\u09ad\u09bf\u09a7\u09be\u09a8}}), a book focusing on the influence of the Santali language on Bengali and providing a basis for further research on this subject.

The Arch package repositories and User Repository (AUR) contain 58,000 binary and source packages, which comes close to [[Debian]] Linux's 68,000 packages; however, the two distributions' approaches to packaging differ, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, six out of Arch's 58,000 packages comprise the software Abiword, of which three in the user repository replace the canonical Abiword package with an alternative build type or version (such as sourcing from the latest commit to Abiword's source control repository), whereas Debian installs a single version of Abiword across seven packages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=abiword|title=Debian -- Package Search Results -- abiword|website=packages.debian.org|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> The Arch User Repository also contains a writerperfect package which installs several document format converters, while Debian provides each of the more than 20 converters in its own subpackage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=writerperfect|title=Debian -- Package Search Results -- writerperfect|website=packages.debian.org|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Pacman{{anchor|Pacman}}===\nTo facilitate regular package changes, Pacman (a contraction of \"package manager\") was developed by Judd Vinet to provide Arch with its own package manager to track dependencies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.osnews.com/story/10047 |title=Arch Linux: Why It Rocks |author=Eugenia Loli |publisher=OSNews |date=21 March 2005 |accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref> It is written in [[C (programming language)|C]].<ref name=\"Pacman-Arch-Wiki\">{{cite web|url=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman |title=pacman |website=ArchWiki |date=6 August 2017 |accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nAll packages are managed using the Pacman [[package manager]].

Reasons include:\n*Licensing issues: software that cannot be redistributed, but is free to use, can be included in the Arch User Repository since all that is hosted by the Arch Linux website is a shell script that downloads the actual software from elsewhere. Examples include proprietary [[freeware]] such as [[Google Earth]] and [[RealPlayer]].\n*Modified official packages: the Arch User Repository also contains many variations on the official packaging as well as beta versions of software that is contained within the repositories as stable releases.\n*Rarity of the software: rarely used programs have not been added to the official repositories (yet).\n*Betas or \"nightly\" versions of software which are very new and thus unstable. Examples include the \"firefox-nightly\" package, which gives new daily builds of the [[Firefox]] web browser.\n\nPKGBUILDs for any software can be contributed by ordinary users and any PKGBUILD that is not confined to the Arch User Repository for policy reasons can be voted into the community repositories.\n\n== Derivatives ==\n{{See also|List of Linux distributions#Pacman-based}}\n\nThere are several projects working on porting the Arch Linux ideas and tools to other kernels, including [[PacBSD]] (formerly ArchBSD) and [[Arch Hurd]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archhurd.org |title=Arch Hurd |publisher=Arch Hurd |date= |accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref> which are based on the [[FreeBSD]] and [[GNU Hurd]] kernels respectively.

In water rescue applications, they are referred to as 'rescue water craft' (RWC). This began in the late 1970s through the efforts of Kawasaki Motors Corporation U.S.A. The origin of water rescue using PWC's is attributed to these founding fathers:  Brad Southworth and Ronny Kling.  Former Vietnam Veterans and racers whom were asked by Chuck Koontz to provide a rescue application using stand up Jet Skis for the United States Jet Ski Association, which later became the International Jet Sports Boating Association. In 1985 Brad and Ronny began using the 'Fun Tech Wedge' on stand ups, a plastic form that fit around the circumference of the craft making it a more stable rescue platform.  From the Fun Tech Wedge, backboards, litters, modified paddle, body boards, and lines taken to victims and survivors were utilized as transport devices. In the late 1980s [[rescue]] board designs adapted to the changing hull designs when two to three-seater craft became available. This became common use for extrication of patients.\n\nThe first agencies to receive [[Jet Skis]] were [[Long Beach]] and [[Huntington Beach]] City Lifeguard departments in [[California]].  Brad Southworth and Steve Strickland were hired by Kawasaki on a 'Tropical Tan Tour' to go to lifeguard agencies on the East and West coasts for the purpose of using them on their beaches.  Few agencies during this time applied the stands ups to actual rescue safety applications, but the product was given exposure at local beaches to the public.\n\nThe pioneering agencies who have the longest standing tradition of PWC in the United States are Kill Devil Hills Lifeguard Beach Service from [[North Carolina]] on the Outer Banks and Taft-Nelson-Delake (TND) Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad out of Lincoln City, [[Oregon]], USA. Both began in the late 1970s and have the distinction of the origins of our PWC rescue heritage.  TND incorporated into 'North Lincoln Fire and Rescue' and both agencies are still using Personal Water Craft in 2010 for operations, over 30 years. In the late 1980s the feasibility of using Jet Skis for rescues began to take on interest from [[lifeguards]] and law enforcement.  In 1989 Shawn Alladio began teaching under the name 'Watercraft Awareness Safety Program', after a 10-year development of training concepts and to preserve local riding areas in Southern California. Due to the rapid growth of PWC, her professional development was launched as the product sales increased. This program was eventually named K38 Water Safety. In 1990, the Personal Watercraft Industry Association created the 'Wave Rangers' program to expose law enforcement to these boats in the United States, this lasted a few seasons.\n\nIn 2008 Shawn Alladio was invited onto the [http://www.PWCoffshore.com PWCoffshore.com] point-to-point personal water craft endurance race team competing on long distance races called [[offshore powerboat racing]] under [[American Power Boat Association]] sanctioning.

In water rescue applications, they are referred to as 'rescue water craft' (RWC). This began in the late 1970s through the efforts of Kawasaki Motors Corporation U.S.A. The origin of water rescue using PWC's is attributed to these founding fathers:  Brad Southworth and Ronny Kling.  Former Vietnam Veterans and racers whom were asked by Chuck Koontz to provide a rescue application using stand up Jet Skis for the United States Jet Ski Association, which later became the International Jet Sports Boating Association. In 1985 Brad and Ronny began using the 'Fun Tech Wedge' on stand ups, a plastic form that fit around the circumference of the craft making it a more stable rescue platform.  From the Fun Tech Wedge, backboards, litters, modified paddle, body boards, and lines taken to victims and survivors were utilized as transport devices. In the late 1980s [[rescue]] board designs adapted to the changing hull designs when two to three-seater craft became available. This became common use for extrication of patients.\n\nThe first agencies to receive [[Jet Skis]] were [[Long Beach]] and [[Huntington Beach]] City Lifeguard departments in [[California]].  Brad Southworth and Steve Strickland were hired by Kawasaki on a 'Tropical Tan Tour' to go to lifeguard agencies on the East and West coasts for the purpose of using them on their beaches.  Few agencies during this time applied the stands ups to actual rescue safety applications, but the product was given exposure at local beaches to the public.\n\nThe pioneering agencies who have the longest standing tradition of PWC in the United States are Kill Devil Hills Lifeguard Beach Service from [[North Carolina]] on the Outer Banks and Taft-Nelson-Delake (TND) Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad out of Lincoln City, [[Oregon]], USA. Both began in the late 1970s and have the distinction of the origins of our PWC rescue heritage.  TND incorporated into 'North Lincoln Fire and Rescue' and both agencies are still using Personal Water Craft in 2010 for operations, over 30 years. In the late 1980s the feasibility of using Jet Skis for rescues began to take on interest from [[lifeguards]] and law enforcement.  In 1989 Shawn Alladio began teaching under the name 'Watercraft Awareness Safety Program', after a 10-year development of training concepts and to preserve local riding areas in Southern California. Due to the rapid growth of PWC, her professional development was launched as the product sales increased. This program was eventually named K38 Water Safety. In 1990, the Personal Watercraft Industry Association created the 'Wave Rangers' program to expose law enforcement to these boats in the United States, this lasted a few seasons.\n\nIn 2008 Shawn Alladio was invited onto the [http://www.PWCoffshore.com PWCoffshore.com] point-to-point personal water craft endurance race team competing on long distance races called [[offshore powerboat racing]] under [[American Power Boat Association]] sanctioning.

The game is based on a series of [[Road racing|road races]] throughout the [[United States]] that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. It is the second installment in the ''[[Road Rash]]'' series, and introduces a split-screen two-player mode for competing human players, [[nitrous oxide]] charges on certain bikes, and [[chain]]s as offensive weapons.\n\nThe development of ''Road Rash II'' was initiated before the end of the 1991 Christmas season, and the game was released within its deadline of the following season. ''Road Rash II'' was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers appreciating the visuals and addition of the multiplayer mode while pointing out the lack of innovation in the fundamental gameplay. A conversion for the [[Game Boy Color]] was developed by [[3d6 Games]] and released under the title ''Road Rash'' in 2000. The game saw additional releases on the [[PlayStation Portable]] compilation title ''[[EA Replay]]'' in 2006 and on the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] in 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Road_Rash_II_Split_Screen.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An example of two-player gameplay in the Genesis version of ''Road Rash II''. The game's larger cartridge size compared to its predecessor allowed the feature to be introduced in this installment of the series.]]\n''Road Rash II'' puts the player in control of a [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racer]] who must finish in third-place or higher in a series of five road races to advance through the game's five [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].<ref name=\"GenManual3\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3</ref> The game's races take place in a number of locales across the [[United States]], including [[Hawaii]], [[Arizona]], [[Tennessee]], [[Alaska]], and [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"GenManual1718\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 17\u201318</ref> During a race, the player can brake, accelerate, and attack neighboring racers. The player character will punch at the nearest racer with a default input, while holding a directional button during the input will result in either a backhand or a kick. Some opponents wield weapons such as [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[chain]]s, which can be taken and used by the player if the enemy racer is attacked as they are holding the weapon out to strike.<ref name=\"GenManual2\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 2</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1014\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 10\u201314</ref> The player racer can be ejected from their bike if they crash into an obstacle (such as boulders, cars, [[deer]] and [[Cattle|cows]]<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>) or if they run out of [[Health (gaming)|stamina]] (shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen) due to fights with other racers. In this event, the racer will automatically run back toward their bike, though the player can alter their course and avoid incoming traffic with the directional buttons, or stand still by holding the brake input button. Opponents will likewise be ejected from their bike if their own stamina is depleted. The stamina of the nearest racer is visible within the bottom-right corner of the screen, and the color of both stamina meters change from green to red as they deplete.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\nThe player character begins the game with $1,000.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> When the player wins a race, a cash prize is added to the player's balance.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> The player can access a bike shop from the game's main menu to view bikes for sale and potentially purchase a new bike with the money they have accumulated.<ref name=\"GenManual49\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1517\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Certain bikes are equipped with a series of [[nitrous oxide]] charges, which can provide a burst of speed if the player quickly taps the acceleration input button twice.<ref name=\"GenManual2\"/><ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> The player will receive a password at the end of a successful race, which can be entered at a password entry screen in a subsequent session to maintain the player's progress.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> When the player wins a race on all five of the game's tracks, they will advance to the next level. With each subsequent level, the cash prizes become higher, the courses become longer, and the opponent racers become more aggressive. The player wins the game if they win a race on each track in all five levels.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>\n\nThe player's bike has its own \"condition meter\" between the player's and opponents' stamina meters, which decreases every time the player suffers a crash. If the meter fully depletes, the bike will be wrecked, the player's participation in the current race will end, and a repair bill must be paid. Motorcycle cops also make sporadic appearances throughout the game's tracks. If the player crashes within the vicinity of a cop, the cop will end their participation in the current race by apprehending them and charging them a fine.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> With each subsequent level, repair bills and fines become more expensive, and cops appear more frequently.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> If the player lacks the funds to cover either a repair bill or a fine, the game will [[Game over|end prematurely]].<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\n''Road Rash II'' features a two-player mode that can either be [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|played intermittently between players]] or simultaneously with the use of a split-screen display. Two players can either race against each other along with other computer-controlled racers or engage in the \"Mano a Mano\" mode, in which the two human players are the only competing racers on the track. In this mode, the players can select a weapon to wield prior to the start of the race, and no money is won or lost, though cops still appear as an obstacle and can end the race if they apprehend one of the players.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> The Game Boy Color version also features a two-player mode via use of the [[Game Link Cable]].<ref name=\"EGMGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/21/EGM_US_135.pdf |title=Preview Gallery: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=October 2000 |page=122}}</ref><ref name=\"GameProGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |title=ProNews: Boy Scout \u2013 What's New in Handheld |magazine=[[GamePro]] |date=October 2000 |page=38 |access-date=2019-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512161054/https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |archive-date=2019-05-12 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Development and release==\nBefore the conclusion of the 1991 Christmas season, EA made the decision to create a sequel to ''Road Rash'', and set a deadline for the following Christmas. Although the development team considered the deadline tight given the length of the previous game's development, the established framework given by the preceding title allowed the team to focus on enhancing the gameplay and visuals for the sequel.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\">{{cite magazine |title=The Making of: The ''Road Rash'' Trilogy |last=Wallace |first=Mitch |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=166 |date=April 2017 |pages=20\u201327}}</ref> The total development team of ''Road Rash II'' consisted of three programmers, five graphic artists, and four track builders.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Behind the Screens: The Making of ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |pages=126\u2013127 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Returning crew members from the previous game include producer and designer Randy Breen, designer and programmer Dan Geisler, programmer Walt Stein, and artists Arthur Koch and Peggy Brennan.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, inner cover</ref> Carl Mey, the technical director of the original ''Road Rash'', was promoted to Director of Technology at EA following the first game's development, and thus had limited involvement with the sequel.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\">{{cite magazine |title=Behind the Scenes: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[GamesTM]] |issue=99 |date=August 2010 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |pages=138\u2013139}}</ref> Mey's game director position was inherited by Kevin McGrath,<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> and Mey would leave EA to work for [[Sega]] before the conclusion of ''Road Rash II'''s development.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\"/>\n\nBreen expanded the sequel's setting to explore the United States outside of the Californian locales of the previous game. Breen explained that \"I was trying to maintain a certain progression through the fantasy of the product, which was that the first ''Road Rash'' was a roots-oriented thing. It happened locally, and people would run these races surreptitiously and do them in back roads where nobody knew about them \u2013 kind of a ''[[Fight Club]]'' thing. And they gradually expanded outward.\" For the game's locations, some of the artists incorporated photos by reducing their colors, while others used the photos as reference and drew the locations from scratch. ''Road Rash II'' introduced the chain as an offensive weapon. To create reference material for the body mechanics of swinging a chain, Koch filmed himself performing the action.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> The expansion to an 8-megabit format from the original game's 5-megabits allowed the team to implement a split-screen two-player mode that they were unable to incorporate into the preceding title.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The two-player split screen took Geisler approximately three months to create. ''Road Rash II'' includes [[cutscene]]s that play at the end of a race, which were conceptualized as a reward based on the player's performance. The cutscenes were roughly [[storyboard]]ed and created by Koch in low resolution to fit within the console's memory. The characters in the cutscenes were ten pixels tall and informally referred to by the development team as \"little dudes\".<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/>\n\nThe artificial intelligence of the opponent racers was improved to be less predictable and more individualistic; certain racers would be more focused on the road than on the human racer, while others would be more aggressive.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The cops were also enhanced with the ability to take damage and fight back against the player, after previously being immune to player attacks and restricted to bumping against racers in the first game; Koch claimed that \"''Road Rash II'' was the first game in which you could beat, and get beaten, by a cop.\" Controversy surrounded this feature due to the recent [[Police brutality|beating]] of [[Rodney King]], which made the development team uncertain on its incorporation.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> Some potential new features that were omitted due to hardware limitations include weather conditions and a [[Harley-Davidson]]-style bike.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The game's audio was created by [[Rob Hubbard]], Don Veca and Tony Berkeley. The game's character banter and instruction booklet were written by Jamie Poolos.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> The yellow [[Yamaha FZR1000]] featured on the cover was Breen's own bike, and would later be featured in the full-motion videos of the 32-bit versions of ''Road Rash''.<ref name=\"RetroGamer88\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |title=Grazing Saddles: The Complete History of ''Road Rash'' |last=Hunt |first=Stuart |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=88 |date=April 2011 |page=47 |access-date=2019-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114210141/https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |archive-date=2020-01-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''Road Rash II'' was released in North America and Europe in December 1992.<ref name=\"GameFan\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/0/0c/GameFan_US_0102.pdf |title=Viewpoint: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[GameFan|Diehard GameFan]] |date=December 1992 |page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"MeanMachines\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/mean-machines-sega-magazine-02/page/n19 |title=MegaDrive Review: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mean Machines|Mean Machines Sega]] |last1=Leadbetter |first=Richard |last2=Automatic |first2=Radion |date=November 1992 |pages=20\u201323}}</ref><ref name=\"GamePro\">{{cite web |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |title=Genesis Pro Review: ''Road Rash II'' |author=Gideon |date=January 1993 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |pp=52\u201353 |access-date=2019-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171344/https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-12-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"EGMGEN\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |page=30 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Versions for the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] were announced in December 1994, but were not released.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/megazoneau46/page/n7/mode/2up |title=Game Spy: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mega Zone]] |date=December 1994 |page=9}}</ref> The Game Boy Color version was developed by [[3d6 Games]],<ref name=\"EGMGBC\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/62/EGM_US_137.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash'' (Game Boy Color) |last=Smith |first=Shawn |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=December 2000 |page=240}}</ref> with graphics created by [[Stoo Cambridge]].

The game is based on a series of [[Road racing|road races]] throughout the [[United States]] that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. It is the second installment in the ''[[Road Rash]]'' series, and introduces a split-screen two-player mode for competing human players, [[nitrous oxide]] charges on certain bikes, and [[chain]]s as offensive weapons.\n\nThe development of ''Road Rash II'' was initiated before the end of the 1991 Christmas season, and the game was released within its deadline of the following season. ''Road Rash II'' was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers appreciating the visuals and addition of the multiplayer mode while pointing out the lack of innovation in the fundamental gameplay. A conversion for the [[Game Boy Color]] was developed by [[3d6 Games]] and released under the title ''Road Rash'' in 2000. The game saw additional releases on the [[PlayStation Portable]] compilation title ''[[EA Replay]]'' in 2006 and on the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] in 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Road_Rash_II_Split_Screen.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An example of two-player gameplay in the Genesis version of ''Road Rash II''. The game's larger cartridge size compared to its predecessor allowed the feature to be introduced in this installment of the series.]]\n''Road Rash II'' puts the player in control of a [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racer]] who must finish in third-place or higher in a series of five road races to advance through the game's five [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].<ref name=\"GenManual3\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3</ref> The game's races take place in a number of locales across the [[United States]], including [[Hawaii]], [[Arizona]], [[Tennessee]], [[Alaska]], and [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"GenManual1718\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 17\u201318</ref> During a race, the player can brake, accelerate, and attack neighboring racers. The player character will punch at the nearest racer with a default input, while holding a directional button during the input will result in either a backhand or a kick. Some opponents wield weapons such as [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[chain]]s, which can be taken and used by the player if the enemy racer is attacked as they are holding the weapon out to strike.<ref name=\"GenManual2\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 2</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1014\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 10\u201314</ref> The player racer can be ejected from their bike if they crash into an obstacle (such as boulders, cars, [[deer]] and [[Cattle|cows]]<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>) or if they run out of [[Health (gaming)|stamina]] (shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen) due to fights with other racers. In this event, the racer will automatically run back toward their bike, though the player can alter their course and avoid incoming traffic with the directional buttons, or stand still by holding the brake input button. Opponents will likewise be ejected from their bike if their own stamina is depleted. The stamina of the nearest racer is visible within the bottom-right corner of the screen, and the color of both stamina meters change from green to red as they deplete.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\nThe player character begins the game with $1,000.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> When the player wins a race, a cash prize is added to the player's balance.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> From the main menu, the player can access a bike shop to view bikes for sale and potentially purchase a new bike with the money they have accumulated.<ref name=\"GenManual49\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1517\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Certain bikes are equipped with a series of [[nitrous oxide]] charges, which can provide a burst of speed if the player quickly taps the acceleration input button twice.<ref name=\"GenManual2\"/><ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> The player will receive a password at the end of a successful race, which can be entered at a password entry screen in a subsequent session to maintain the player's progress.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> When the player wins a race on all five of the game's tracks, they will advance to the next level. With each subsequent level, the cash prizes become higher, the courses become longer, and the opponent racers become more aggressive. The player wins the game if they win a race on each track in all five levels.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>\n\nThe player's bike has its own \"condition meter\" between the player's and opponents' stamina meters, which decreases every time the player suffers a crash. If the meter fully depletes, the bike will be wrecked, the player's participation in the current race will end, and a repair bill must be paid. Motorcycle cops also make sporadic appearances throughout the game's tracks. If the player crashes within the vicinity of a cop, the cop will end their participation in the current race by apprehending them and charging them a fine.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> With each subsequent level, repair bills and fines become more expensive, and cops appear more frequently.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> If the player lacks the funds to cover either a repair bill or a fine, the game will [[Game over|end prematurely]].<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\n''Road Rash II'' features a two-player mode that can either be [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|played intermittently between players]] or simultaneously with the use of a split-screen display. Two players can either race against each other along with other computer-controlled racers or engage in the \"Mano a Mano\" mode, in which the two human players are the only competing racers on the track. In this mode, the players can select a weapon to wield prior to the start of the race, and no money is won or lost, though cops still appear as an obstacle and can end the race if they apprehend one of the players.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> The Game Boy Color version also features a two-player mode via use of the [[Game Link Cable]].<ref name=\"EGMGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/21/EGM_US_135.pdf |title=Preview Gallery: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=October 2000 |page=122}}</ref><ref name=\"GameProGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |title=ProNews: Boy Scout \u2013 What's New in Handheld |magazine=[[GamePro]] |date=October 2000 |page=38 |access-date=2019-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512161054/https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |archive-date=2019-05-12 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Development and release==\nBefore the conclusion of the 1991 Christmas season, EA made the decision to create a sequel to ''Road Rash'', and set a deadline for the following Christmas. Although the development team considered the deadline tight given the length of the previous game's development, the established framework given by the preceding title allowed the team to focus on enhancing the gameplay and visuals for the sequel.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\">{{cite magazine |title=The Making of: The ''Road Rash'' Trilogy |last=Wallace |first=Mitch |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=166 |date=April 2017 |pages=20\u201327}}</ref> The total development team of ''Road Rash II'' consisted of three programmers, five graphic artists, and four track builders.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Behind the Screens: The Making of ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |pages=126\u2013127 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Returning crew members from the previous game include producer and designer Randy Breen, designer and programmer Dan Geisler, programmer Walt Stein, and artists Arthur Koch and Peggy Brennan.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, inner cover</ref> Carl Mey, the technical director of the original ''Road Rash'', was promoted to Director of Technology at EA following the first game's development, and thus had limited involvement with the sequel.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\">{{cite magazine |title=Behind the Scenes: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[GamesTM]] |issue=99 |date=August 2010 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |pages=138\u2013139}}</ref> Mey's game director position was inherited by Kevin McGrath,<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> and Mey would leave EA to work for [[Sega]] before the conclusion of ''Road Rash II'''s development.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\"/>\n\nBreen expanded the sequel's setting to explore the United States outside of the Californian locales of the previous game. Breen explained that \"I was trying to maintain a certain progression through the fantasy of the product, which was that the first ''Road Rash'' was a roots-oriented thing. It happened locally, and people would run these races surreptitiously and do them in back roads where nobody knew about them \u2013 kind of a ''[[Fight Club]]'' thing. And they gradually expanded outward.\" For the game's locations, some of the artists incorporated photos by reducing their colors, while others used the photos as reference and drew the locations from scratch. ''Road Rash II'' introduced the chain as an offensive weapon. To create reference material for the body mechanics of swinging a chain, Koch filmed himself performing the action.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> The expansion to an 8-megabit format from the original game's 5-megabits allowed the team to implement a split-screen two-player mode that they were unable to incorporate into the preceding title.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The two-player split screen took Geisler approximately three months to create. ''Road Rash II'' includes [[cutscene]]s that play at the end of a race, which were conceptualized as a reward based on the player's performance. The cutscenes were roughly [[storyboard]]ed and created by Koch in low resolution to fit within the console's memory. The characters in the cutscenes were ten pixels tall and informally referred to by the development team as \"little dudes\".<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/>\n\nThe artificial intelligence of the opponent racers was improved to be less predictable and more individualistic; certain racers would be more focused on the road than on the human racer, while others would be more aggressive.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The cops were also enhanced with the ability to take damage and fight back against the player, after previously being immune to player attacks and restricted to bumping against racers in the first game; Koch claimed that \"''Road Rash II'' was the first game in which you could beat, and get beaten, by a cop.\" Controversy surrounded this feature due to the recent [[Police brutality|beating]] of [[Rodney King]], which made the development team uncertain on its incorporation.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> Some potential new features that were omitted due to hardware limitations include weather conditions and a [[Harley-Davidson]]-style bike.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The game's audio was created by [[Rob Hubbard]], Don Veca and Tony Berkeley. The game's character banter and instruction booklet were written by Jamie Poolos.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> The yellow [[Yamaha FZR1000]] featured on the cover was Breen's own bike, and would later be featured in the full-motion videos of the 32-bit versions of ''Road Rash''.<ref name=\"RetroGamer88\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |title=Grazing Saddles: The Complete History of ''Road Rash'' |last=Hunt |first=Stuart |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=88 |date=April 2011 |page=47 |access-date=2019-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114210141/https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |archive-date=2020-01-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''Road Rash II'' was released in North America and Europe in December 1992.<ref name=\"GameFan\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/0/0c/GameFan_US_0102.pdf |title=Viewpoint: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[GameFan|Diehard GameFan]] |date=December 1992 |page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"MeanMachines\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/mean-machines-sega-magazine-02/page/n19 |title=MegaDrive Review: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mean Machines|Mean Machines Sega]] |last1=Leadbetter |first=Richard |last2=Automatic |first2=Radion |date=November 1992 |pages=20\u201323}}</ref><ref name=\"GamePro\">{{cite web |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |title=Genesis Pro Review: ''Road Rash II'' |author=Gideon |date=January 1993 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |pp=52\u201353 |access-date=2019-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171344/https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-12-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"EGMGEN\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |page=30 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Versions for the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] were announced in December 1994, but were not released.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/megazoneau46/page/n7/mode/2up |title=Game Spy: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mega Zone]] |date=December 1994 |page=9}}</ref> The Game Boy Color version was developed by [[3d6 Games]],<ref name=\"EGMGBC\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/62/EGM_US_137.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash'' (Game Boy Color) |last=Smith |first=Shawn |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=December 2000 |page=240}}</ref> with graphics created by [[Stoo Cambridge]].

The violent nature of the series, one of the earliest of its kind, has led to the creation and continued presence of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] and other ratings boards for video games. Various ''Mortal Kombat'' games have been [[censorship|censored]] or banned in several countries, and the franchise was the subject of several court cases.\n\nIn [[Germany]], every Mortal Kombat game was banned for ten years from its release until 2015. Mortal Kombat (2011) is also banned in [[Brazil]] and [[South Korea]], and has been banned in [[Australia]] until February 2013.

The violent nature of the series, one of the earliest of its kind, has led to the creation and continued presence of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] and other ratings boards for video games.

Previously, the nameplate [[Nash Ambassador|Ambassador]] applied to [[Nash Motors|Nash's]] full-size cars. The nameplate referred to a trim level between 1927 and 1931.\n\nAmbassadors were manufactured in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] as well as at AMC's [[Brampton Assembly]] in Brampton, Ontario from 1963 to 1966. [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) assembled Ambassadors from [[knock-down kit]]s with [[right-hand drive]] from 1961 to 1963. The U.S. fifth generation Ambassadors were manufactured by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]] (IKA) in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1965 to 1972, as well as assembled by ECASA in [[Costa Rica]] from 1965 to 1970. Planta REO assembled first-generation Ambassadors in Mexico at its Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n plant. Fifth and seventh generation Ambassadors were modified into custom stretch [[limousine]]s in Argentina and the U.S.\n\n== Development ==\nFollowing [[George W. Mason]]'s unexpected death in the fall of 1954, [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] (whom Mason had been grooming as his eventual successor), succeeded him as president and CEO of the newly formed American Motors. Romney recognized that to be successful in the postwar marketplace, an automobile manufacturer would have to be able to produce and sell cars in sufficient volume to [[Amortization (business)|amortize]] the high cost of tooling. Toward that end, he set out to increase AMC's market share with its Rambler models that were selling in [[market segment]] in which the domestic Big Three ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[Chrysler]]) automakers did not yet compete. While development of a redesigned 1958 Nash Ambassador, based on a stretched and reskinned 1956 Rambler [[Coachwork|body]] was almost complete, AMC's [[Automotive design|designers]] were also working on a retrimmed [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] equivalent, called '''Rebel''', to offer Hudson [[Car dealership|dealers]].\n\nHowever, as sales of the large-sized [[Nash Ambassador]] and [[Hudson Hornet]] models slowed, it became clear to Romney that consumer confidence in the historic Nash and Hudson nameplates had collapsed. Reluctantly, he decided that 1957 would be the end of both nameplates, and the company would concentrate on the new Rambler line, which was registered as a separate [[marque]] for 1957.\n\nThe market positioning meant that \"the AMC Ambassador was a car with no real competitors throughout most of the sixties\" because it was viewed as a luxury-type car and could be put against the higher end large-sized models from the domestic Big Three automakers, but the Ambassador was more of a midsized car.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |date=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786456369 |page=2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1DiNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=the+AMC+Ambassador+was+a+car+with+no+real+competitors+throughout+most+of+the+sixtie |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== First generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Rambler Ambassador (3893707660).jpg\n| caption      = 1958 Ambassador V8, Custom sedan\n| model_years  = 1958\u20131959\n| aka          = Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| name         = First generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1958 ===\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop.jpg|thumb|right|1958 Ambassador Custom hardtop sedan with [[continental tire]] ]]\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop wagon 2.JPG|thumb|right|Ambassador hardtop (pillarless) Cross Country station wagon]]\n\nAmerican Motors planned to produce a stretched a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] version of the Rambler platform for Nash dealers to be the new Nash Ambassador, and another for Hudson dealers. Shortly before committing to production of the new long-wheelbase versions of the Hudson and the Nash, CEO Romney decided to abandon the Nash and Hudson marques.\n\nDespite the fact that the Nash and Hudson names were canceled, work on the car itself continued, and American Motors introduced debuted in the fall of 1957, the 1958 \"Ambassador V-8 by Rambler\" on a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Its features included a {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] (equipped with a 4-barrel [[carburetor]] and dual exhausts and rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m}} of torque) mated to a [[BorgWarner]] supplied 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] with push button gear selection.\n\nIn 1956, AMC first produced its own V8, a modern overhead valve V8 displacing {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, with a forged steel crank shaft, which when equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor was rated at {{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1957, AMC bored and stroked the 250 CID V8 to {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement which when offered in the [[Rambler Rebel]] used solid lifters and Bendix electronic fuel injection was rated at {{convert|288|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1958, the Ambassador was equipped with a hydraulic lifter version of AMC's 327 CID V8 rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Although AMC's 327 CID V8 shares its displacement with the Chevrolet small-block, AMC's 327 came out six years before Chevrolet first offered its 327 in 1962.\n\nThe Ambassador was available in a body style exclusive to its line, a pillarless [[hardtop]] '''Cross Country''' [[station wagon]]. The 1958 Ambassador was offered in a single high level trim level and came equipped with such luxury items as electric clock, twin front and rear ashtrays, Nash tradition \"deep coil\" spring suspension front and rear, split back reclining front seats that fold down into a bed, as well as upscale fabrics for the interior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816085955/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nManagement had found that the public associated the Rambler name with small economy cars, and did not want the upscale nature of the new Ambassador to be so closely associated with Rambler's favorable, but economical image. Therefore, a decision was made that the larger Ambassador would be marketed as the '''Ambassador V-8 by Rambler''' in order to identify it with the Rambler name's burgeoning success, but to indicate an air of exclusivity by showing it to be a different kind of vehicle. However, the car wore \"Rambler Ambassador\" badges on its front fenders.\n\nThe 1958 Ambassador is a substantially longer car than the {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel V8]], although both lines shared the same basic body, styling, and visual cues. However, all of the Ambassador's extra {{convert|9|in|mm|spell=in}} of wheelbase (and, therefore, overall length) were added ahead of the cowl, meaning that the passenger compartment had the same volume as the smaller Ramblers. The Ambassadors came with plusher interior and exterior trims while the front end incorporated the Rebel \"V-Line\" grille from the prototype Hudson model. Through effective [[market segment]]ation, the Ambassador was [[Positioning (marketing)|positioned]] to compete with the larger models offered by other automakers.\n\nModel identification was located on the car's front fenders and deck lid. '''Super''' trim level Ambassadors featured painted side trim in a color that complemented the body color; '''Custom''' models featured a silver [[anodized aluminum]] panel on sedans and vinyl woodgrain decals on station wagons. Ambassador body styles included a four-door sedan and a [[hardtop]] sedan, a four-door pillared station wagon, and the aforementioned hardtop station wagon, a body style that first saw duty as an industry first in the 1956 [[Nash Rambler|Nash and Hudson Rambler]] line, on which all of the 1958 Ramblers were based.\n\nThe Ambassador had an excellent power-to-weight ratio for its time and provided spirited performance with [[0 to 60 mph]] (0 to 97&nbsp;km/h) times of less than 10-seconds, and low 17-second times through a quarter-mile (402&nbsp;m) [[dragstrip]]. It could be equipped with a [[limited slip differential]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816065829/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as well as power brakes, power steering, power windows, and [[air conditioning]]. Numerous safety features (such as deep-dished steering wheels and padded dash boards) came standard, while lap [[seat belt]]s were optional.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-10-11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816065347/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-10-11 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== 1959 ===\nFor 1959, the Ambassador received a revised grille, side trim, and redesigned rear door skins that swept into the [[Car tailfin|tailfin]]s instead of terminating at the C-pillar. [[Scotchlite]] reflectors were also added to the rear of the tailfins to increase visibility at night. Front and rear bumpers were over 20% thicker, and featured recessed center sections to protect [[license plates]]. Adjustable headrests were now available as an option for the front seats, an industry first. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] touted the added comfort the headrests provided, as well as their potential for reducing [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. Other changes included the activation of the starter through the neutral pushbutton (on automatic transmission equipped cars), and the addition of an optional \"Powr-Saver\" engine fan, which featured a [[Fan clutch|fluid-filled clutch]] for quieter high-speed operation.\n\nThe 1959 model year also saw the addition of an optional \"Air-Coil Ride\" [[air suspension]] system, utilizing air bags installed within the rear coil springs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |title=1959 Rambler Wagons brochure |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522175749/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |archivedate=May 22, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> An engine-driven [[Gas compressor|compressor]], reservoir, and ride-height control valve comprised the rest of the system, but as other automakers discovered, the troublesome nature of air-suspension outweighed its benefits. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] discontinued the unpopular option at the end of the model year.\n\nAmbassador sales improved considerably over 1958, reaching an output of 23,769; nearly half of which were '''Custom''' four-door sedans. Much rarer was the hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were built.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = 1960 AMC Rambler Ambassador sedan green NJ.jpg\n| caption      = 1960 Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| model_years  = 1960\u20131961\n| aka          = Rambler Ambassador\n| name         = Second generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1960 ===\n1960 saw the Ambassador lineup totally reskinned, wearing new fenders, hood, deck lid, door skins, roofline, grille, taillights, bumpers, windshield, and backlight. Significant were the lower hood line, lower windshield cowl, simplified side trim, egg crate grill, while the tailfins were reduced in height and were canted to either side making for a modern and integrated appearance. The overall effect was rather fresh, as the new roof had a lower, lighter look, to complement the lower fins and grille.\n\nAll Ambassadors came equipped with the American Motors {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]], but for the first time it was available in two versions. First was the original {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, performance version equipped with the 4-barrel carburetor and a 9.7:1 compression ratio, which required premium fuel, and a second economy version running on regular gasoline making {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor and an 8.7:1 compression ratio.\n\nAmbassadors now came with a unique compound curved windshield that cut into the roof. This improved visibility, did away with the \u201cknee knocker\u201d dogleg design of AMC's first generation wrap-around windshield, and resulted in an even stiffer unitized structure. The 1960 Ambassador had a low cowl which with the compound windshield afforded excellent visibility. The Ambassador was offered in higher end Custom or entry level Super trim levels. All 1960 Ambassadors came with a new instrument cluster under a padded cowl, as well as illuminated controls for lights, wipers, fan, and defrost functions. The 1960 Ambassadors continued with an enclosed drive shaft (torque tube) and coil springs at all four corners, although the suspension was revised resulting in better handling. The top-of-the-line Ambassador models came standard with individual \"airliner\" reclining front seats that now had even more luxurious fabrics than in previous years.\n\nThe Ambassador was the only American midsize, luxury high-performance car offered in 1960. The 1960 Ambassador came in 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], 4-door pillarless hardtop, 4-door [[station wagon]], and a 4-door pillarless ([[hardtop]]) station wagon. Equipped with the 270&nbsp;horsepower 327&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in V8, and the Borg Warner pushbutton-operated 3-speed planetary gear and torque converter automatic transmission, the Ambassadors reached {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0}} in just over 9 seconds and passed the quarter-mile in 17 seconds.\n\n=== 1961 ===\n[[File:1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom blue-fl.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom]]\n[[File:1961 AMC Rambler Ambassador 4-door pink rear.JPG|thumb|right|1961 Rambler Ambassador sedan]]\n\nThe 1961 Ambassador continued the previous year's {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} basic [[Unit body|unitized platform]], but received an unusual new front-end styling that was overseen by AMC's in-house design department headed by [[Edmund E. Anderson|Edmund Anderson]]. The new face consisted of a trapezoid grille and headlights that floated in a body-colored panel, while the front fenders arched downward and forward of the leading edge of the hood. Different from anything else on the market, AMC's marketing department promoted the look as \"European.\" While the new look was meant to distinguish the Ambassador from the lower-priced Ramblers, it was neither a consumer success nor well received in the automotive press.

And while Rambler sales had been good enough for third place in industry sales (behind [[Chevrolet]] and [[Ford]]), AMC's management was working on a revolutionary and somewhat costly design set to debut for the 1963 model year. In the meantime, American Motors needed to save money, and since the Ambassador's sales had fallen in 1961, it was decided that the car would be downsized for 1962 to share its body, windshield and {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase with its [[Rambler Classic|Classic]] line mate. Accordingly, the car was marketed as a '''Rambler Ambassador'''.\n\nThe 1962 Ambassador received a new front end that was very similar to the 1961\u201362 Classic's, but with a crosshatch design, recessed center section, and '''Ambassador''' lettering. New, rectangular taillights were seen at the ends of restyled rear fenders, which lost their fins entirely. Exterior trim was reshuffled, and a new 2-door pillared sedan debuted. A new '400' trim line was added at the top of the line, with Super and Custom models remaining. The Ambassador offered even more luxurious interiors, perhaps to make up for the fact that it now shared its wheelbase with the Rambler Classic. The 400 could be had with vinyl [[bucket seat]]s, headrests, and color coordinated shag carpets.\n\nThe only available engine was AMC's {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV V8, in either the regular fuel, 2-barrel carburetor and 8.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version or the premium gasoline, 4-barrel version with 9.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version. The 1962 Ambassador came with a dual chamber [[master brake cylinder]] that separated the front and rear brakes so that in the event of the failure of one chamber some braking function would remain. This design was offered by only a few cars at that time. The 1962 models were equipped with \"Walker\" (brand) flow-through mufflers. The {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase 1962 Ambassador was lighter than its {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase predecessors and when equipped with the {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, it was a spirited performer.\n\nThe 1962, {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 Ambassador for the first time used the same {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase structure as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel which was also equipped with an earlier solid lifter version of the AMC 327. The 1957 Rambler Rebel equipped with a 3-speed column mounted manual transmission, was the quickest 4-door sedan made in the United States, achieving {{convert|0|to|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[acceleration]] in just over 7 seconds, making it faster than the Hemi [[Chrysler 300 letter series|Chrysler 300C]], the [[DeSoto Adventurer]], the Dodge D500, the Plymouth Fury, and the Chevrolet fuel-injected 283.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|title=1957-1960 Rambler Rebel |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel1.htm |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> The 1962 Ambassador was available with a 3-speed manual transmission and being basically the same vehicle, should also reach 60&nbsp;mph about as quickly as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1963\u20131964\n| image        = File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 sedan gold-white K-f.jpg\n| caption      = 1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 Sedan\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coupe]] (1963) | 4-door sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] (1964) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|112|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|188.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|71.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|55.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n| name         = Fourth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1963 ===\n[[File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan]]\nIn 1962 Romney left AMC to run for [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] of [[Michigan]], a position that he won.

AMC Ambassador and Classics used outerpanels stamped from single sheet metal panels which included both door frames and outer rocker panels. This resulted in an extremely rigid and rattle-free structure, better fit of doors into frames, production cost savings and reduced noise, vibration and harshness. The \"uniside\" structure was superior to the conventional production methods in which multiple smaller pieces were welded together.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://amcrc.com/aug05feature.html |last=Isbrandt |first=Ralph H. |title=Rambler Engineering |journal=Motor Trend |date=February 1963 |publisher=AMCRC |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> There were 30% fewer parts and the result was greater structural rigidity, quieter car operation, and an overall weight reduction of about {{convert|150|lb|kg|0|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nCurved side glass and [[push-button]] door handles were new and costly upgrades, but contributed to the new Rambler's handsome, elegant, and modern Mercedes-like bodyside styling, by adding greater elegance in detail. At the time, curved side glass was used only in much more expensive luxury cars, but increased interior room and visibility, as well as reducing wind noise and improved proportions and styling of the cars.<ref name=\"DrivingGeorgeRomney\"/> The Ambassador also featured a squared-off [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]-type roofline.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/> The front end featured a forward-thrusting upper and lower ends with a vertical bar \"electric shaver\" chrome grille insert. The Ambassador's grille was differentiated from the Classic's grille by its use of the Ambassador name in script in the small horizontal bar between the upper and lower grille sections. Round quad headlights were slightly recessed in chrome bezels mounted side-by-side within the grille at its outermost edges. Overall, the new Ambassadors were described by the staff of ''Automotive Fleet'' magazine as \"probably the finest looking cars ever produced by American Motors.\"<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nAmbassadors once again came in 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door sedan, and 4-door wagon body styles, but new trim lines debuted. A \"Mercedes-like three-number model designation was developed\" with the '''800''' as the Ambassador's base line (replacing the previous year's Super model) for the police, taxi, and fleet market, a '''880''' model (in place of the Custom), and the up level '''990''' trim (replacing the previous 400 models).<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/>\n\nThe 1963 Ambassadors were offered only with the {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, in either {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel or {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 4-barrel versions. AMC's smaller {{convert|287|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was only offered in the Classic line. The automatic transmission was controlled by a steering column mounted lever, replacing the previous pushbutton system. Maintenance was reduced with service intervals of the front wheel bearings increased from {{convert|12000|-|25000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, the recommended engine oil change was at {{convert|4000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, and all Ambassador models included an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]] and an [[Voltage regulator|electronic voltage regulator]] as standard equipment.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nSales were brisk, and the redesign was billed a success, with ''[[Motor Trend]]'' Magazine bestowing '''[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]]''' status on the entire 1963 Rambler line, including the Ambassador. The marketing formula for the Ambassador generated record sales for the model with buyers favoring more luxury and features as evidenced by the Ambassador 990 models outselling the 880 versions by nearly 2-to-1, while the base 800 model had a total of only 43 two-door sedans built.<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/> The automaker did not have the resources of GM, Ford, and Chrysler, nor the sales volume to spread out its new model tooling and advertising costs over large production volumes; however, Richard Teague \"turned these economical cars into smooth, streamlined beauties with tons of options and V-8 pep.\"<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1964 AMC/Rambler Ambassador & Classic Specifications |date=21 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-amc-rambler-ambassador-classic2.htm |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1964 ===\nThe 1964 model year introduced minor trim changes and new options. The \"electric-shaver\" grille on the 1963 model was replaced with a flush-mounted design, and the engine and transmission options were widened. A two-door [[hardtop]] body style called '''990-H''' was added for the first time since 1957. Base 880 and the 880 models were dropped from the line.\n\nThe 1964 Ambassadors featured the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as standard, with the 4-barrel {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version as optional. The automaker did not offer a 4-speed manual transmission to compete with the sporty mid-size V8 offerings from Ford or GM. Instead, AMC offered its innovative \u201cTwin-Stick\u201d manual transmission. The \"Twin stick\" option consisted a three-speed manual transmission, operated by one of the two console mounted \"sticks\" in conjunction with an overdrive unit that was controlled by the second \"stick\" in both 2nd and 3rd gears. This gave the driver the option of using five forward gears. One magazine noted the Twin-Stick, {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Ambassador was heading for a sub 16-second quarter-mile when they blew up the clutch.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:1964 Ambassador 2-d white f.jpg|1964 Rambler Ambassador\nFile:1964 Ambassador 2-d white r.jpg|1964 Rambler Ambassador\nFile:1964 Ambassador 2-d white i.jpg|1964 Rambler Ambassador interior with \"Twin-Stick\" transmission\n</gallery>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fifth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1965\u20131966\n| image        = 1965 AMC Ambassador black 2door-HT in NJ.JPG\n| caption      = 1965 Rambler Ambassador 990 2-door hardtop\n| aka          = Rambler Ambassador<br/>AMC Ambassador\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] | 2-door [[convertible]] }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|200|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|I6]] | {{convert|287|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| name         = Fifth generation\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed with [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] | \"Twin-Stick\" on console (1965) | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] (1966) | 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] | 3-speed \u201cShift-Command\u201d on console }}\n}}\n\n=== 1965 ===\n\nNo matter how much success the new Ramblers achieved in the marketplace, Roy Abernethy was not completely satisfied. Using the experience he gained as an outstanding salesman as a guide, Abernethy closely looked at the direction that American Motors' competition was going and decided that the company would be much more successful if its products competed more directly with the Big Three. He would achieve this by pushing all AMC vehicles further upmarket among the various [[market segment]]s, shaking off the company's economy car image, and offering vehicles once again in all three major American car size classes: compact, intermediate, and full-size. The American and Classic were strong competitors in the former two segments, so for the 1965 model year, he set his sights on turning the Ambassador into a proper full-size car by stretching the Classic's wheelbase and giving it much different styling. The general sizes of automobiles at that time were based on industry standard wheelbase lengths, rather than on the vehicle's interior and cargo space. The 1965 Ambassador represented a fundamental shift in corporate ideology, a shift away from primarily fuel-efficient vehicles, to bigger, faster, and potentially more profitable cars.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\">{{cite web |last=Gunn |first=Malcolm |title=Fine Lines: 1965\u20131966 AMC Ambassador |publisher=auto123 |url= http://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/used/fine-lines-1965-1966-amc-ambassador?model=AMBASSADOR&artid=66071&pg=1 |date=23 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Ambassador rode the same platform as its 1963\u201364 forebears, the 1965 models looked all-new.

At the front, the Ambassador again sparked minor controversy with its new vertically stacked quad headlights, which were slightly recessed in their bezels, as they flanked an all-new horizontal bar grille. This new wall-to-wall grille projected forward, horizontally, in the center, to create an effect somewhat opposite to 1963's grille treatment. The front end design provided a bold, rugged appearance.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/>\n\nOnce again, the Ambassador\u2019s entire extra wheelbase was ahead of the cowl, meaning that interior volume was the same as the intermediate-sized Classic. Another new body style debuted in the Ambassador lineup for 1965: an attractive new convertible offered as part of the 990 series. This was the first time a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was offered in the Ambassador line since 1948. All Ambassador body styles (except the 990-H coupe) offered seating for six passengers, with coupes and convertibles having the option of buckets seats with center console and floor shifter. The Ambassador 990-H was an up-scale two-door hardtop model, available only in 5-passenger form.\n[[File:1965 Ambassador 990 convertible yellow pb-rr.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Ambassador 990 convertible]]\nAmbassadors also saw an expanded list of trim lines, convenience options, and engine choices. The 990 and 990-H models were back, while 880 models were the new economy leaders in the 1965 Ambassador line, but even the $2,512 price for the two-door sedan was not attractive compared to the models with better trim, buckets seats, and special interiors.<ref>{{cite web |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1965\u20131966 Rambler Ambassador: Creating the early Rambler Ambassador |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Ambassadors came standard with AMC's new {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|Inline-6 engine]], which was the first time since 1956 that an Ambassador was available with six cylinders.

[[Chevrolet|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], Ford Custom 500 and [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]], as well as [[Plymouth Fury]]) came with six-cylinder engines as standard equipment. They therefore appealed to a wider range of customers than the Ambassador was getting. Also, since the Classic was now smaller and styled differently, the Ambassador [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] would not threaten to cannibalize Classic 6 sales, which were the company's sales volume leaders. The changes were on target as sales of the repositioned Ambassador more than tripled.\n\n''Motor Trend'' magazine tested an Ambassador convertible with a Twin-Stick overdrive transmission and found it commendably economical, averaging {{convert|16.4|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} over {{convert|1000|mi}} run, and noting that ... \"Traveling comfort was the Ambassador's biggest selling point, along with its exceptionally powerful [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] duo-servo drum brakes ...With the thin bucket seats that recline, driver and passengers can enjoy a high degree of riding comfort...

The V-shaped horizontal louver spanned unbroken between the headlamps and the effect was continued with twin rectangular trim pieces attached to the side of the front fenders at their leading edges by the headlamps. The effect was repeated in the new vertical wraparound taillamps with the top-line models receiving a twin set of horizontal ribbed moldings across the back of the trunk lid that simulated the look of the front grille. Hardtop coupes received a redesigned roofline that was angular in appearance with an angle cut rear side windows and rectangular rear window. The backlight no longer curved and wrapped slightly around the C-pillars. The changes made for a more \"formal\" [[notchback]] look that was popular at the time.\n\nStation wagons also received a new roof (that did not have as pronounced dip over the rear cargo area) as well as a redesigned tailgate and optional [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior side panels.

As before, the interior's the outstanding feature of the Ambassador. Its quality is such that other luxury cars, even higher priced ones, could well imitate it...\"<ref name=page4/>\n\nPerhaps the biggest change, however, was that the Ambassador lost its historic Rambler nameplate, as the car was now marketed as the \"American Motors Ambassador\" or \"AMC Ambassador\". Abernethy was again responsible for this marketing move, as he attempted to move the stylish new Ambassador even further upmarket. To him, that meant that the Rambler name, and its economy car image would be eschewed to give the car a clean slate in a market that was turning away from economy and toward V8 performance. The evidence suggests that Abernethy was on the right track with moving the Ambassador upscale to compete with other manufacturers' luxury models as sales of the AMC's flagship jumped from 18,647 in 1964 to over 64,000 in 1965, and then in 1966 they went to more than 71,000.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/> Although the Ambassador accounted for a mere fraction of total passenger car sales in the U.S., it was an important step in bringing the AMC's products in line with what the consumer of the day wanted.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1967\u20131968\n| image        = 1967 Ambassador DPL conv top-up-winter-WV.jpg\n| caption      = 1967 AMC Ambassador DPL convertible\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[sedan (automobile)]] (1967 only) | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coup\u00e9|coupe]] | 2-door [[convertible]] (1967 only) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|118|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|202.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|I6]] | {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 | {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed with [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed [[BorgWarner]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] | 3-speed \u201cShift-Command\u201d on center floor console }}\n| name         = Sixth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1967 ===\nAmerican Motors introduced a completely restyled longer, lower, and wider Ambassador for the 1967 model year, now riding on a {{convert|118|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase, or {{convert|2|in|mm|spell=in}} longer than before.

On hardtop coupes, this restyling resulted in a sloping roofline that saw upswept reverse-angle quarter windows. The belt line kicked up at the point the hardtop's rear windows swept upward, and tapered back to the fender end, meeting a new loop-type rear bumper.\n\nOn sedans, the roof line showed a slimmer C-pillar, squared-off rear door windows, and met a belt line that kicked up beneath the trailing edge of each rear door window. The belt line tapered back to the same rear fascia as the hardtop coupe's. This rear fascia contained a new ribbed taillight lens that stretched wall-to-wall and included twin square white reverse light lenses in its center.\n\nStation wagons received no change to their rooflines, doors, and rear fascias. However, all Ambassadors received a new extruded aluminum grille at the front, featuring several widely spaced bright horizontal bars with one wide, body colored horizontal grille bar extending to each headlight cluster. The {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced for 1970 by a new {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine. This {{convert|210|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm and {{convert|305|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 2800 rpm was the standard engine on all DPL and SST models. The {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was also supplanted by a {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine available in either 2-barrel, regular gasoline, or high-output, 4-barrel, premium fuel versions. The 4-barrel \"AMX\" {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was optional, producing {{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3200 rpm and {{convert|420|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 3200 rpm.\n\n=== 1971 ===\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador 2-door hardtop coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador hardtop with TurboCast II wheels from 1979\u201383]]\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador station wagon red with woodgrain side panels.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador station wagon]]\n\nFollowing the previous year's redesign, the 1971 Ambassadors received only minor changes and improvements. The marketing tag line for the year was the [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] asking, \"If you had to compete with GM, Ford and Chrysler, what would you do?\"\u2014that was answered by AMC including more features, advantages, and benefits for buyers of its cars compared to the models from its much larger competitors. This was reflected by shuffling the Ambassador models for 1971 and by including more equipment in the standard feature list. The previously nameless base models were dropped, as the sedan-only DPL trim line was relegated to base model status, and a new top-line '''Brougham''' trim line was added above mid-line SST models. Both SST and Brougham models came as hardtop coupes, sedans, and wagons.\n\nThe DPL came with AMC's new {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Inline-6 with seven main bearings. All the SSTs and Broughams featured the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as standard. BorgWarner's \"Shift-Command\" automatic transmissions were standard equipment across the line. Two of AMC's {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} were optional; an 8.5:1 compression version with a two-barrel carburetor or a high-compression four-barrel V8 that required premium-fuel. The previous \"AMX 390\" V8 gave way to a new {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 as the top engine option.\n\nStyling changes consisted of a new fascia up front. It featured headlights contained in their own chrome pods separate from, but flanking the new grille with a bright rectangular surround, with rounded edges. The \"natural\" cast [[pot metal]] grille insert was recessed and featured a bright vertical bar pattern. A second set of parking lights was added outboard of the headlight clusters, and they were integrated into the fender extension to eliminate the need for separate front marker lights.\n\nTaillights on hardtop coupes and sedans still ran wall-to-wall, but the twin backup lights were moved from the center to further outboard\u2014approximately eight inches in from either fender side. Once again, the wagon received few changes at the rear, but added a new design for its optional woodgrain side trim, which filled in its upper bodysides. Its lower edge flowed downward aft of its peak at the leading edge above each front wheelhouse, in similar fashion to the [[Buick Skylark]]'s side \"sweepspear\" styling cue.\n\nAmbassador base models were offered to fleet buyers with various police, [[taxicab]], and other heavy-duty packages. Governments and police departments in the U.S. historically used standard-size, low-price line four-door sedans.

This backing also included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, such as the standardization of electric windshield wipers on all model lines, replacing AMC's vacuum-powered units, as well as better interior trims. By focusing on quality, the smallest domestic automaker was profitable for 1972, earning US$30.2 million (the highest net profit achieved by AMC since 1964) on $4 billion in sales.\n\nThe base Ambassador DPL model was canceled, with three body styles now available in SST and Brougham trim. Fleet purchasers could order plain Ambassadors in Police Pursuit Vehicle (PPV) or Special Service Package (SSP) versions. A six-cylinder engine was no longer available; thus, Ambassador became a V8-only car for the first time since 1964. This made the Ambassador the only volume-produced American car that included air conditioning, power brakes, automatic transmission, and a V8 engine as standard equipment; all while being priced less than the Big Three's full-sized cars.<ref name=\"1972AMCphotos\">{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/AMC/1972_AMC/1972_Ambassador_Promo/1972%20Ambassador%20Promo-01.html |title=1972 AMC Ambassador press photos |date=1 September 1971 |work=The Old Car Manual Project |accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref> The base engine was the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with two {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} or a {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} versions optional.

The hardtop's cancellation was due in part to low sales volume of the Ambassador 2-door versions, as well as the introduction of an all-new 1974 [[AMC Matador|Matador coupe]] that featured a long hood and short rear deck. The coupe received the \"Best Styled Car of 1974\" by the editors of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine and did not feature typical period styling hallmarks, e.g., upright grille, [[notchback]] roof, and imitation \"landau bars\" or opera lights.<ref>{{cite journal |title=none|journal=Car and Driver |date=November 1973 }}</ref>\n\nStyling changes for the sedan and wagon included revised front fender caps on the same fenders used since 1969, and hood, grille, bumpers, rear fascia, instrument panel, interior trim, hood ornament, and a new font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille showed off a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights, and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille's crosshatch trim. Headlamp bezels were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new hood and front bumper followed the grille's central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight \"coffin nose\" look. The revised [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedan saw a similar frontal treatment in 1974, but with a much more pronounced effect and with different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille insert.\n\nAs with the new Matador sedan, the new rear bumper was much larger and backed by shock absorbers, as it was beefed up to comply with new [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] regulations for standardized front and rear bumpers on passenger cars that could sustain a {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}} impact with no damage. Fiberglass end caps were added to the ends of each rear fender on sedans. They wrapped inward to create a recessed space that met a carryover [[decklid]]. In this space was mounted the new rectangular taillight housings, which featured taller white backup lights mounted inboard of the new taillights. The license plate moved from the rear bumper to the area between the new taillight assemblies, and the whole taillight and license plate system on the sedans was surrounded its own loop of chrome trim. Both Ambassador and Matador sedans shared the same rear end style. \n\nThe cargo area and the rear design of station wagons remained similar to previous Ambassadors, save for a massive new bumper and revised taillamps. The wagon was available with two-row bench seats for six passengers or with a rear-facing third row for a total eight seat-belted passengers. All came with numerous practical, appearance, and comfort items as standard. These included a two-way opening tail gate: (1) hinged at the bottom for convenient loading or hauling long cargo and (2) hinged at the side to open as door for ease of entry and exit for passengers or cargo; wood grained [[Transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]] vinyl side and rear trim, a full-length [[roof rack]]; as well as a chrome and wood grain roof air deflector to help keep the tailgate window clean.\n\nPowertrain selections remained the same as in 1973, with only [[AMC V8 engine|V8 engines]] and automatic transmissions available. When ordered with a trailer package (special wiring harness with heavy-duty flasher and heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar), the Ambassador was rated for up to {{convert|5000|lb|0|adj=on}} towing capacity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schultz |first=Mort |title=Cars to take your rig in tow |journal=Popular Mechanics |pages=156\u2013157 |date=March 1974 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ddQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=1974+AMC+Ambassador |volume=141 |issue=3 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Other increases for 1974 included a larger capacity fuel tank, {{convert|24.9|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}}, and an alternator producing 62 [[ampere]]s. New sound insulation made the Ambassador even quieter. All came with a very lengthy list of standard equipment that was typically optional on competing makes. These included comfort items such as air conditioning, an AM radio, and vanity mirror to appearance enhancements such as [[pin striping]] and [[whitewall tire]]s.\n\nSales of all full-size vehicles, regardless of the automaker, fell significantly in 1974 as America's focus shifted to smaller cars. Ambassador sales were no different, and in June 1974, the final AMC Ambassador rolled off the [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] assembly line, ending a nameplate that had been in continuous production in some form for 48 years.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==International markets==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:AutoantiguodesfileMDP5-9jul2016.jpg|thumb|right|Fifth U.S. generation Ambassador 990 built by IKA from 1965 to 1972]] \n'''Industrias Kaiser Argentina''' [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina|(IKA)]] produced the U.S. third, fourth, and fifth generation Ambassadors in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1962 to 1972, and later available by special order through 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/r/rambler.htm |title=IKA - Caracter\u00edsticas Classic Custom - Classic Custom De Luxe - Ambassador 440 |date=18 May 2009 |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAssembly of IKA Ramblers began in 1962, with the Argentinean cars being the 1961 U.S. versions, but equipped with {{convert|226|cuin|L|2|abbr=on}} [[Continental Motors Company|Continental]] I6 engines producing {{convert|119|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm, along with a steering column mounted manual three-speed transmission.

Registrations of the 1963 model continued into 1964 for a total of 21 Ambassadors registered for 1964.\n\nAlthough not documented in any AMI records, according to Australian Rambler afficionados 20 right-hand drive 1970 Ambassadors were fully imported from Canada, apparently 16 two-door hardtops and 4 four-door sedans. One possible reason for this was that it may have been a holding action while AMI was preparing for assembly of the new 1970 Rebel. AMC had assembled over 3,700 RHD Rambler Ambassadors for the U.S Postal Service in 1967, so they were well experienced in making completed right-hand drive vehicles. All Australian factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors came with automatic transmission with floor shift.<ref>https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/benaraby/cars-vans-utes/rambler-ambassador/1242484069</ref>\n\nThe dash and instrument pack of the 1967 Ambassador which had been converted and used in the RHD Ambassadors assembled for the U.S Postal Service was thereafter used in all Australian and New Zealand-assembled Rambler Rebel and Matador models, and all RHD, U.S-built Rebel and Matadors for the United Kingdom.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:1970 AMC Ambassador SST (14379718872).jpg|thumb|right|One of 12 factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors for the New Zealand market ]]\n\nAmerican Motors motor vehicles were assembled in New Zealand by '''VW Motors''' at their Volkswagen plant in Otahuhu, Auckland from 1958 until 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/107503496/the-empty-halls-of-new-zealands-car-assembly-industry |title=The empty halls of New Zealand's car assembly industry |first=Todd |last=Niall |website=Stuff |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> From 1964, AMC vehicles were assembled by '''Campbell Motor Industries''' (CMI) in Thames, [[North Island]].

The model was virtually restricted to the four-door hardtop sedan only. It was powered by the four-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine producing {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} coupled to a three-speed automatic transmission. The model became the marque's top-of-the-line product alongside the three versions of the midsize Rambler and Rambler American models. \n\nHowever, low sales figures alongside a deteriorating relationship between AMC and Planta REO lead to the cancellation of the contract in the second half of 1959. <ref>{{cite book|first=Douglas C. |last=Bennett |first2=Kenneth E. |last2=Sharpe |title=Transnational Corporations versus the State: The Political Economy of the Mexican Auto Industry |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2014 |isbn=9780691022376}}</ref> American Motors once again exported its products into Mexico and a new local partner, Willys Mexicana that eventually would become '''Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos''' [[Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos|(VAM)]]. The agreement was signed in March 1960 and production began in Mexico City. \n\nThis meant the discontinuation of the Ambassador line in Mexico as the new operation had several priorities above offering a top-end luxury full-size car line. Aside from offering the already existing Jeep line, Willys Mexicana focused efforts on the compact Rambler American, which obtained a generation change just the next year, meaning a complete retooling of the Vallejo plant. In 1962, legal and industrial requirements in the country became stronger with the auto industry integration decree issued by president [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]] in 1962. Among its mandates, it fully banned the importation of automobile engines. Willys Mexicana began building its own engine plant, which was achieved in November 1964. Once the Rambler American was consolidated in the Mexican market, Willys Mexicana opted to expand the product line by introducing the brand-new second generation Rambler Classic midsize model as a larger luxury counterpart to the economy compact American. Also in 1963, due to problems with WM's parent company (the SOMEX bank) as well as further requirements of the government auto industry decree, Willys Mexicana was reorganized into an entirely new company with expanded capital and direct investment from the Mexican government, Kaiser Willys, and American Motors. This resulted in the formation of Veh\u00edculos Automotores Mexicanos S.A. \n\nAfter the corporate transition process between 1960 and 1964 concluded, in which the Rambler marque under VAM surpassed the commercial results of its local predecessors Armadora Mexicana and Planta REO combined between 1950 and 1959, the company opted not to offer the Ambassador model. The Mexican market of the era was still relatively small and since the Ambassador shared mostly the same styling as the contemporary midsize model of the company, it was considered that internal competition would affect the sales of a simultaneous Rambler Classic/Ambassador line-up. Unlike the United States, which had a much larger and diverse market for two different car lines with the same styling, AMC could offer a strong difference between both models with the exclusive V8 engine for the Ambassador and the Classic being restricted to six cylinders only. This advantage did not exist in Mexico since VAM could only produce six cylinder engines in its Lerma plant and V8 engines could not be imported from AMC due to the ban of the 1962 decree. Instead, VAM opted to use the Rambler Classic as its most luxurious and flagship model, giving it the same treatment AMC put in the Ambassador model in the US and Canada. This would be passed on to the subsequent equivalent Rebel and Matador models produced under VAM. \n\nThe 1958\u20131959 Ambassador models represent the only chapter in this model's history to be present in Mexico. These were the only full-size American Motors products sold in the country alongside the second generation VAM Classic (Matador) models. Even more unique was the fact that it was a factory V8 model, the only one of its kind to ever be sold in Mexico belonging to American Motors.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nRambler Ambassadors were exported in limited numbers to the United Kingdom in factory right-hand-drive direct from AMC during the 1960s and up to its final year of 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/File:Im196610MotSC-RamblerMots.jpg |title=Image of Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd. advertisement |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |date=1967 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> They were imported by '''Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Ltd''' of Chiswick in West London which became a subsidiary of AMC in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Rambler_Motors |title=Rambler Motors |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> The location had previously been used since 1926 for British assembly of Hudson, Essex, and Terraplane vehicles<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1968/44/us-car-concessionaires-great-britain|title=U.S. Car Concessionaires in Great Britain |date=April 1968 |website=Motor Sport Magazine (Archive) |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> and later AMC's post-1954 Hudson, Nash and Rambler models. Ambassador models marketed in the UK were the Ambassador saloon (sedan), SST coupe, and station wagon. AMC vehicles were distributed by London distributors Clarke and Simpson Limited and were marketed as \"the only American car built with RHD.\"<ref>http://www.classiccarcatalogue.com/RAMBLER%201968.html</ref> As with all export markets UK models were marketed as \"Rambler\" even after the Rambler marque was dropped in the USA.\n\n== Epilogue ==\nBecause AMC was focusing its attentions on their newly acquired [[Jeep]] line, the redesigned 1974 Matador coupe, and the [[AMC Pacer]], which would debut in 1975, the company would not put forth the investment to continue the full-size Ambassador line after its 1974 redesign. Instead, the automaker upgraded the Matador sedan and wagon counterparts starting with the 1975 model year. The basic [[automobile platform]] was used by AMC since the 1967 model year, and the full-size automobile market segment was declining. American Motors strategy now aimed at smaller cars and sport-utility vehicles.\n\nHowever, the Ambassador basically continued as the similarly sized and styled [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedans and wagons. From 1975 they became available in uplevel \"Brougham\" trim and assumed the model numbers of the previously equivalent Ambassadors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d

Rambler''', '''Rambler Ambassador''', and finally '''AMC Ambassador.''' Previously, the nameplate [[Nash Ambassador|Ambassador]] applied to [[Nash Motors|Nash's]] full-size cars. The nameplate referred to a trim level between 1927 and 1931.\n\nAmbassadors were manufactured in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] as well as at AMC's [[Brampton Assembly]] in Brampton, Ontario from 1963 to 1966. [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) assembled Ambassadors from [[knock-down kit]]s with [[right-hand drive]] from 1961 to 1963. The U.S. fifth generation Ambassadors were manufactured by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]] (IKA) in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1965 to 1972, as well as assembled by ECASA in [[Costa Rica]] from 1965 to 1970. Planta REO assembled first-generation Ambassadors in Mexico at its Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n plant. Fifth and seventh generation Ambassadors were modified into custom stretch [[limousine]]s in Argentina and the U.S.\n\n== Development ==\nFollowing [[George W. Mason]]'s unexpected death in the fall of 1954, [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] (whom Mason had been grooming as his eventual successor), succeeded him as president and CEO of the newly formed American Motors. Romney recognized that to be successful in the postwar marketplace, an automobile manufacturer would have to be able to produce and sell cars in sufficient volume to [[Amortization (business)|amortize]] the high cost of tooling. Toward that end, he set out to increase AMC's market share with its Rambler models that were selling in [[market segment]] in which the domestic Big Three ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[Chrysler]]) automakers did not yet compete. While development of a redesigned 1958 Nash Ambassador, based on a stretched and reskinned 1956 Rambler [[Coachwork|body]] was almost complete, AMC's [[Automotive design|designers]] were also working on a retrimmed [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] equivalent, called '''Rebel''', to offer Hudson [[Car dealership|dealers]].\n\nHowever, as sales of the large-sized [[Nash Ambassador]] and [[Hudson Hornet]] models slowed, it became clear to Romney that consumer confidence in the historic Nash and Hudson nameplates had collapsed. Reluctantly, he decided that 1957 would be the end of both nameplates, and the company would concentrate on the new Rambler line, which was registered as a separate [[marque]] for 1957.\n\nThe market positioning meant that \"the AMC Ambassador was a car with no real competitors throughout most of the sixties\" because it was viewed as a luxury-type car and could be put against the higher end large-sized models from the domestic Big Three automakers, but the Ambassador was more of a midsized car.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |date=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786456369 |page=2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1DiNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=the+AMC+Ambassador+was+a+car+with+no+real+competitors+throughout+most+of+the+sixtie |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== First generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Rambler Ambassador (3893707660).jpg\n| caption      = 1958 Ambassador V8, Custom sedan\n| model_years  = 1958\u20131959\n| aka          = Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| name         = First generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1958 ===\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop.jpg|thumb|right|1958 Ambassador Custom hardtop sedan with [[continental tire]] ]]\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop wagon 2.JPG|thumb|right|Ambassador hardtop (pillarless) Cross Country station wagon]]\n\nAmerican Motors planned to produce a stretched a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] version of the Rambler platform for Nash dealers to be the new Nash Ambassador, and another for Hudson dealers. Shortly before committing to production of the new long-wheelbase versions of the Hudson and the Nash, CEO Romney decided to abandon the Nash and Hudson marques.\n\nDespite the fact that the Nash and Hudson names were canceled, work on the car itself continued, and American Motors introduced debuted in the fall of 1957, the 1958 \"Ambassador V-8 by Rambler\" on a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Its features included a {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] (equipped with a 4-barrel [[carburetor]] and dual exhausts and rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m}} of torque) mated to a [[BorgWarner]] supplied 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] with push button gear selection.\n\nIn 1956, AMC first produced its own V8, a modern overhead valve V8 displacing {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, with a forged steel crank shaft, which when equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor was rated at {{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1957, AMC bored and stroked the 250 CID V8 to {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement which when offered in the [[Rambler Rebel]] used solid lifters and Bendix electronic fuel injection was rated at {{convert|288|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1958, the Ambassador was equipped with a hydraulic lifter version of AMC's 327 CID V8 rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Although AMC's 327 CID V8 shares its displacement with the Chevrolet small-block, AMC's 327 came out six years before Chevrolet first offered its 327 in 1962.\n\nThe Ambassador was available in a body style exclusive to its line, a pillarless [[hardtop]] '''Cross Country''' [[station wagon]]. The 1958 Ambassador was offered in a single high level trim level and came equipped with such luxury items as electric clock, twin front and rear ashtrays, Nash tradition \"deep coil\" spring suspension front and rear, split back reclining front seats that fold down into a bed, as well as upscale fabrics for the interior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816085955/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nManagement had found that the public associated the Rambler name with small economy cars, and did not want the upscale nature of the new Ambassador to be so closely associated with Rambler's favorable, but economical image. Therefore, a decision was made that the larger Ambassador would be marketed as the '''Ambassador V-8 by Rambler''' in order to identify it with the Rambler name's burgeoning success, but to indicate an air of exclusivity by showing it to be a different kind of vehicle. However, the car wore \"Rambler Ambassador\" badges on its front fenders.\n\nThe 1958 Ambassador is a substantially longer car than the {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel V8]], although both lines shared the same basic body, styling, and visual cues. However, all of the Ambassador's extra {{convert|9|in|mm|spell=in}} of wheelbase (and, therefore, overall length) were added ahead of the cowl, meaning that the passenger compartment had the same volume as the smaller Ramblers. The Ambassadors came with plusher interior and exterior trims while the front end incorporated the Rebel \"V-Line\" grille from the prototype Hudson model. Through effective [[market segment]]ation, the Ambassador was [[Positioning (marketing)|positioned]] to compete with the larger models offered by other automakers.\n\nModel identification was located on the car's front fenders and deck lid. '''Super''' trim level Ambassadors featured painted side trim in a color that complemented the body color; '''Custom''' models featured a silver [[anodized aluminum]] panel on sedans and vinyl woodgrain decals on station wagons. Ambassador body styles included a four-door sedan and a [[hardtop]] sedan, a four-door pillared station wagon, and the aforementioned hardtop station wagon, a body style that first saw duty as an industry first in the 1956 [[Nash Rambler|Nash and Hudson Rambler]] line, on which all of the 1958 Ramblers were based.\n\nThe Ambassador had an excellent power-to-weight ratio for its time and provided spirited performance with [[0 to 60 mph]] (0 to 97&nbsp;km/h) times of less than 10-seconds, and low 17-second times through a quarter-mile (402&nbsp;m) [[dragstrip]].

[[Scotchlite]] reflectors were also added to the rear of the tailfins to increase visibility at night. Front and rear bumpers were over 20% thicker, and featured recessed center sections to protect [[license plates]]. Adjustable headrests were now available as an option for the front seats, an industry first. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] touted the added comfort the headrests provided, as well as their potential for reducing [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. Other changes included the activation of the starter through the neutral pushbutton (on automatic transmission equipped cars), and the addition of an optional \"Powr-Saver\" engine fan, which featured a [[Fan clutch|fluid-filled clutch]] for quieter high-speed operation.\n\nThe 1959 model year also saw the addition of an optional \"Air-Coil Ride\" [[air suspension]] system, utilizing air bags installed within the rear coil springs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |title=1959 Rambler Wagons brochure |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522175749/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |archivedate=May 22, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> An engine-driven [[Gas compressor|compressor]], reservoir, and ride-height control valve comprised the rest of the system, but as other automakers discovered, the troublesome nature of air-suspension outweighed its benefits. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] discontinued the unpopular option at the end of the model year.\n\nAmbassador sales improved considerably over 1958, reaching an output of 23,769; nearly half of which were '''Custom''' four-door sedans. Much rarer was the hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were built.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = 1960 AMC Rambler Ambassador sedan green NJ.jpg\n| caption      = 1960 Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| model_years  = 1960\u20131961\n| aka          = Rambler Ambassador\n| name         = Second generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1960 ===\n1960 saw the Ambassador lineup totally reskinned, wearing new fenders, hood, deck lid, door skins, roofline, grille, taillights, bumpers, windshield, and backlight. Significant were the lower hood line, lower windshield cowl, simplified side trim, egg crate grill, while the tailfins were reduced in height and were canted to either side making for a modern and integrated appearance. The overall effect was rather fresh, as the new roof had a lower, lighter look, to complement the lower fins and grille.\n\nAll Ambassadors came equipped with the American Motors {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]], but for the first time it was available in two versions. First was the original {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, performance version equipped with the 4-barrel carburetor and a 9.7:1 compression ratio, which required premium fuel, and a second economy version running on regular gasoline making {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor and an 8.7:1 compression ratio.\n\nAmbassadors now came with a unique compound curved windshield that cut into the roof. This improved visibility, did away with the \u201cknee knocker\u201d dogleg design of AMC's first generation wrap-around windshield, and resulted in an even stiffer unitized structure. The 1960 Ambassador had a low cowl which with the compound windshield afforded excellent visibility. The Ambassador was offered in higher end Custom or entry level Super trim levels. All 1960 Ambassadors came with a new instrument cluster under a padded cowl, as well as illuminated controls for lights, wipers, fan, and defrost functions. The 1960 Ambassadors continued with an enclosed drive shaft (torque tube) and coil springs at all four corners, although the suspension was revised resulting in better handling. The top-of-the-line Ambassador models came standard with individual \"airliner\" reclining front seats that now had even more luxurious fabrics than in previous years.\n\nThe Ambassador was the only American midsize, luxury high-performance car offered in 1960. The 1960 Ambassador came in 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], 4-door pillarless hardtop, 4-door [[station wagon]], and a 4-door pillarless ([[hardtop]]) station wagon. Equipped with the 270&nbsp;horsepower 327&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in V8, and the Borg Warner pushbutton-operated 3-speed planetary gear and torque converter automatic transmission, the Ambassadors reached {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0}} in just over 9 seconds and passed the quarter-mile in 17 seconds.\n\n=== 1961 ===\n[[File:1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom blue-fl.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom]]\n[[File:1961 AMC Rambler Ambassador 4-door pink rear.JPG|thumb|right|1961 Rambler Ambassador sedan]]\n\nThe 1961 Ambassador continued the previous year's {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} basic [[Unit body|unitized platform]], but received an unusual new front-end styling that was overseen by AMC's in-house design department headed by [[Edmund E. Anderson|Edmund Anderson]]. The new face consisted of a trapezoid grille and headlights that floated in a body-colored panel, while the front fenders arched downward and forward of the leading edge of the hood. Different from anything else on the market, AMC's marketing department promoted the look as \"European.\" While the new look was meant to distinguish the Ambassador from the lower-priced Ramblers, it was neither a consumer success nor well received in the automotive press. Overall sales fell as the entire industry was experiencing a [[recession]]. The hardtop sedan and wagon models did not return for 1961.\n\nStandard was the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with a [[Manual transmission#Synchronized transmission|synchromesh manual transmission]].

And while Rambler sales had been good enough for third place in industry sales (behind [[Chevrolet]] and [[Ford]]), AMC's management was working on a revolutionary and somewhat costly design set to debut for the 1963 model year. In the meantime, American Motors needed to save money, and since the Ambassador's sales had fallen in 1961, it was decided that the car would be downsized for 1962 to share its body, windshield and {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase with its [[Rambler Classic|Classic]] line mate. Accordingly, the car was marketed as a '''Rambler Ambassador'''.\n\nThe 1962 Ambassador received a new front end that was very similar to the 1961\u201362 Classic's, but with a crosshatch design, recessed center section, and '''Ambassador''' lettering. New, rectangular taillights were seen at the ends of restyled rear fenders, which lost their fins entirely. Exterior trim was reshuffled, and a new 2-door pillared sedan debuted. A new '400' trim line was added at the top of the line, with Super and Custom models remaining. The Ambassador offered even more luxurious interiors, perhaps to make up for the fact that it now shared its wheelbase with the Rambler Classic. The 400 could be had with vinyl [[bucket seat]]s, headrests, and color coordinated shag carpets.\n\nThe only available engine was AMC's {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV V8, in either the regular fuel, 2-barrel carburetor and 8.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version or the premium gasoline, 4-barrel version with 9.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version. The 1962 Ambassador came with a dual chamber [[master brake cylinder]] that separated the front and rear brakes so that in the event of the failure of one chamber some braking function would remain. This design was offered by only a few cars at that time. The 1962 models were equipped with \"Walker\" (brand) flow-through mufflers. The {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase 1962 Ambassador was lighter than its {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase predecessors and when equipped with the {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, it was a spirited performer.\n\nThe 1962, {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 Ambassador for the first time used the same {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase structure as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel which was also equipped with an earlier solid lifter version of the AMC 327. The 1957 Rambler Rebel equipped with a 3-speed column mounted manual transmission, was the quickest 4-door sedan made in the United States, achieving {{convert|0|to|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[acceleration]] in just over 7 seconds, making it faster than the Hemi [[Chrysler 300 letter series|Chrysler 300C]], the [[DeSoto Adventurer]], the Dodge D500, the Plymouth Fury, and the Chevrolet fuel-injected 283.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|title=1957-1960 Rambler Rebel |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel1.htm |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> The 1962 Ambassador was available with a 3-speed manual transmission and being basically the same vehicle, should also reach 60&nbsp;mph about as quickly as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1963\u20131964\n| image        = File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 sedan gold-white K-f.jpg\n| caption      = 1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 Sedan\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coupe]] (1963) | 4-door sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] (1964) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|112|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|188.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|71.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|55.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n| name         = Fourth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1963 ===\n[[File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan]]\nIn 1962 Romney left AMC to run for [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] of [[Michigan]], a position that he won.

AMC Ambassador and Classics used outerpanels stamped from single sheet metal panels which included both door frames and outer rocker panels. This resulted in an extremely rigid and rattle-free structure, better fit of doors into frames, production cost savings and reduced noise, vibration and harshness. The \"uniside\" structure was superior to the conventional production methods in which multiple smaller pieces were welded together.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://amcrc.com/aug05feature.html |last=Isbrandt |first=Ralph H. |title=Rambler Engineering |journal=Motor Trend |date=February 1963 |publisher=AMCRC |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> There were 30% fewer parts and the result was greater structural rigidity, quieter car operation, and an overall weight reduction of about {{convert|150|lb|kg|0|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nCurved side glass and [[push-button]] door handles were new and costly upgrades, but contributed to the new Rambler's handsome, elegant, and modern Mercedes-like bodyside styling, by adding greater elegance in detail. At the time, curved side glass was used only in much more expensive luxury cars, but increased interior room and visibility, as well as reducing wind noise and improved proportions and styling of the cars.<ref name=\"DrivingGeorgeRomney\"/> The Ambassador also featured a squared-off [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]-type roofline.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/> The front end featured a forward-thrusting upper and lower ends with a vertical bar \"electric shaver\" chrome grille insert. The Ambassador's grille was differentiated from the Classic's grille by its use of the Ambassador name in script in the small horizontal bar between the upper and lower grille sections. Round quad headlights were slightly recessed in chrome bezels mounted side-by-side within the grille at its outermost edges. Overall, the new Ambassadors were described by the staff of ''Automotive Fleet'' magazine as \"probably the finest looking cars ever produced by American Motors.\"<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nAmbassadors once again came in 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door sedan, and 4-door wagon body styles, but new trim lines debuted. A \"Mercedes-like three-number model designation was developed\" with the '''800''' as the Ambassador's base line (replacing the previous year's Super model) for the police, taxi, and fleet market, a '''880''' model (in place of the Custom), and the up level '''990''' trim (replacing the previous 400 models).<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/>\n\nThe 1963 Ambassadors were offered only with the {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, in either {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel or {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 4-barrel versions. AMC's smaller {{convert|287|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was only offered in the Classic line. The automatic transmission was controlled by a steering column mounted lever, replacing the previous pushbutton system. Maintenance was reduced with service intervals of the front wheel bearings increased from {{convert|12000|-|25000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, the recommended engine oil change was at {{convert|4000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, and all Ambassador models included an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]] and an [[Voltage regulator|electronic voltage regulator]] as standard equipment.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nSales were brisk, and the redesign was billed a success, with ''[[Motor Trend]]'' Magazine bestowing '''[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]]''' status on the entire 1963 Rambler line, including the Ambassador. The marketing formula for the Ambassador generated record sales for the model with buyers favoring more luxury and features as evidenced by the Ambassador 990 models outselling the 880 versions by nearly 2-to-1, while the base 800 model had a total of only 43 two-door sedans built.<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/> The automaker did not have the resources of GM, Ford, and Chrysler, nor the sales volume to spread out its new model tooling and advertising costs over large production volumes; however, Richard Teague \"turned these economical cars into smooth, streamlined beauties with tons of options and V-8 pep.\"<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1964 AMC/Rambler Ambassador & Classic Specifications |date=21 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-amc-rambler-ambassador-classic2.htm |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1964 ===\nThe 1964 model year introduced minor trim changes and new options. The \"electric-shaver\" grille on the 1963 model was replaced with a flush-mounted design, and the engine and transmission options were widened. A two-door [[hardtop]] body style called '''990-H''' was added for the first time since 1957. Base 880 and the 880 models were dropped from the line.\n\nThe 1964 Ambassadors featured the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as standard, with the 4-barrel {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version as optional. The automaker did not offer a 4-speed manual transmission to compete with the sporty mid-size V8 offerings from Ford or GM. Instead, AMC offered its innovative \u201cTwin-Stick\u201d manual transmission. The \"Twin stick\" option consisted a three-speed manual transmission, operated by one of the two console mounted \"sticks\" in conjunction with an overdrive unit that was controlled by the second \"stick\" in both 2nd and 3rd gears. This gave the driver the option of using five forward gears.

Using the experience he gained as an outstanding salesman as a guide, Abernethy closely looked at the direction that American Motors' competition was going and decided that the company would be much more successful if its products competed more directly with the Big Three. He would achieve this by pushing all AMC vehicles further upmarket among the various [[market segment]]s, shaking off the company's economy car image, and offering vehicles once again in all three major American car size classes: compact, intermediate, and full-size. The American and Classic were strong competitors in the former two segments, so for the 1965 model year, he set his sights on turning the Ambassador into a proper full-size car by stretching the Classic's wheelbase and giving it much different styling. The general sizes of automobiles at that time were based on industry standard wheelbase lengths, rather than on the vehicle's interior and cargo space. The 1965 Ambassador represented a fundamental shift in corporate ideology, a shift away from primarily fuel-efficient vehicles, to bigger, faster, and potentially more profitable cars.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\">{{cite web |last=Gunn |first=Malcolm |title=Fine Lines: 1965\u20131966 AMC Ambassador |publisher=auto123 |url= http://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/used/fine-lines-1965-1966-amc-ambassador?model=AMBASSADOR&artid=66071&pg=1 |date=23 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Ambassador rode the same platform as its 1963\u201364 forebears, the 1965 models looked all-new.

At the front, the Ambassador again sparked minor controversy with its new vertically stacked quad headlights, which were slightly recessed in their bezels, as they flanked an all-new horizontal bar grille. This new wall-to-wall grille projected forward, horizontally, in the center, to create an effect somewhat opposite to 1963's grille treatment. The front end design provided a bold, rugged appearance.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/>\n\nOnce again, the Ambassador\u2019s entire extra wheelbase was ahead of the cowl, meaning that interior volume was the same as the intermediate-sized Classic. Another new body style debuted in the Ambassador lineup for 1965: an attractive new convertible offered as part of the 990 series. This was the first time a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was offered in the Ambassador line since 1948. All Ambassador body styles (except the 990-H coupe) offered seating for six passengers, with coupes and convertibles having the option of buckets seats with center console and floor shifter. The Ambassador 990-H was an up-scale two-door hardtop model, available only in 5-passenger form.\n[[File:1965 Ambassador 990 convertible yellow pb-rr.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Ambassador 990 convertible]]\nAmbassadors also saw an expanded list of trim lines, convenience options, and engine choices. The 990 and 990-H models were back, while 880 models were the new economy leaders in the 1965 Ambassador line, but even the $2,512 price for the two-door sedan was not attractive compared to the models with better trim, buckets seats, and special interiors.<ref>{{cite web |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1965\u20131966 Rambler Ambassador: Creating the early Rambler Ambassador |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Ambassadors came standard with AMC's new {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|Inline-6 engine]], which was the first time since 1956 that an Ambassador was available with six cylinders.

[[Chevrolet|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], Ford Custom 500 and [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]], as well as [[Plymouth Fury]]) came with six-cylinder engines as standard equipment. They therefore appealed to a wider range of customers than the Ambassador was getting. Also, since the Classic was now smaller and styled differently, the Ambassador [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] would not threaten to cannibalize Classic 6 sales, which were the company's sales volume leaders. The changes were on target as sales of the repositioned Ambassador more than tripled.\n\n''Motor Trend'' magazine tested an Ambassador convertible with a Twin-Stick overdrive transmission and found it commendably economical, averaging {{convert|16.4|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} over {{convert|1000|mi}} run, and noting that ... \"Traveling comfort was the Ambassador's biggest selling point, along with its exceptionally powerful [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] duo-servo drum brakes ...With the thin bucket seats that recline, driver and passengers can enjoy a high degree of riding comfort...

The V-shaped horizontal louver spanned unbroken between the headlamps and the effect was continued with twin rectangular trim pieces attached to the side of the front fenders at their leading edges by the headlamps. The effect was repeated in the new vertical wraparound taillamps with the top-line models receiving a twin set of horizontal ribbed moldings across the back of the trunk lid that simulated the look of the front grille. Hardtop coupes received a redesigned roofline that was angular in appearance with an angle cut rear side windows and rectangular rear window. The backlight no longer curved and wrapped slightly around the C-pillars. The changes made for a more \"formal\" [[notchback]] look that was popular at the time.\n\nStation wagons also received a new roof (that did not have as pronounced dip over the rear cargo area) as well as a redesigned tailgate and optional [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior side panels.

Abernethy was again responsible for this marketing move, as he attempted to move the stylish new Ambassador even further upmarket. To him, that meant that the Rambler name, and its economy car image would be eschewed to give the car a clean slate in a market that was turning away from economy and toward V8 performance. The evidence suggests that Abernethy was on the right track with moving the Ambassador upscale to compete with other manufacturers' luxury models as sales of the AMC's flagship jumped from 18,647 in 1964 to over 64,000 in 1965, and then in 1966 they went to more than 71,000.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/> Although the Ambassador accounted for a mere fraction of total passenger car sales in the U.S., it was an important step in bringing the AMC's products in line with what the consumer of the day wanted.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1967\u20131968\n| image        = 1967 Ambassador DPL conv top-up-winter-WV.jpg\n| caption      = 1967 AMC Ambassador DPL convertible\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[sedan (automobile)]] (1967 only) | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coup\u00e9|coupe]] | 2-door [[convertible]] (1967 only) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|118|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|202.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|I6]] | {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 | {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed with [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed [[BorgWarner]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] | 3-speed \u201cShift-Command\u201d on center floor console }}\n| name         = Sixth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1967 ===\nAmerican Motors introduced a completely restyled longer, lower, and wider Ambassador for the 1967 model year, now riding on a {{convert|118|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase, or {{convert|2|in|mm|spell=in}} longer than before.

The grille itself was blackout with a chrome horizontal bar that connected the headlight clusters. The hood was redesigned to accommodate the grille's raised center portion, and it faintly recalled [[Packard|Packard's]] classic grille/hood combination. [[Richard A. Teague]], AMC's Vice President of Styling, had worked at the luxury car manufacturer before joining AMC. Parking lights were rectangular and mounted horizontally in recessed wells in the front bumper, just beneath each set of headlights. The entire front fascia leaned forward slightly to lend an air of forward motion to the car's appearance.\n\nAt the rear, ribbed rectangular taillights were mounted inboard the Ambassadors rearward-thrusting rear fenders. Square ribbed marker lights of similar height were mounted at the trailing edge of each fender side. The deck lid had a slightly higher lift over. The base and DPL models had no decorative panel connecting the taillights while the top-line SST versions featured a panel painted red to match the taillights. Station wagons saw vertical wraparound taillights replacing the previous \"hooded\" units, which were not visible from the side. The 1969 AMC Ambassador was a smooth, powerful, well-proportioned sedan that did not look like anything else on the road.<ref>{{cite web |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1967, 1968, 1969 AMC Ambassador Specifications \u2013 page 2 |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1967-1969-amc-ambassador2.htm |date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe interiors were upgraded and a new deeply hooded dashboard clustered instruments and controls in front of the driver. There was an increased emphasis on luxury-type trim and features. The base model two-door hardtop was dropped for 1969.\n\nThe 1969 Ambassador stressed luxury, with the marketing tagline developed by [[Mary Wells Lawrence]] at the Wells Rich Greene agency, tying the car's value, \"It will remind you of the days when money really bought something.\"<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CyBFAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA102&dq=1969+Ambassador+It+will+remind+you+of+the+days+when+money+really+bought+something |page=102 |title=American Motors Corporation: The Rise and Fall of America's Last Independent |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2013 |isbn=9780760344255 |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> The combination of rich velour upholstery, individually adjustable reclining seats, standard air conditioning, and the longer wheelbase were highlighted in advertisements with Ambassador's posh\"[[limousine]]\" ride at an economical price. One aspect of this new advertising theme included many AMC dealers inviting prospective customers to call and request a \"demonstration ride\", in which a uniformed chauffeur would arrive at the prospect's home and drive them around in an Ambassador SST sedan. AMC's efforts worked, and Ambassador sales shot up again.\n\n[[File:1969 AMC Ambassador limousine in Wisconsin sideR.JPG|thumb|left|1969 Ambassador Royale Stretch Limo by Armbruster/Stageway.

The conversions were unusual in that they did not keep the stock rear doors\u2014as is typical in most limos.

On hardtop coupes, this restyling resulted in a sloping roofline that saw upswept reverse-angle quarter windows. The belt line kicked up at the point the hardtop's rear windows swept upward, and tapered back to the fender end, meeting a new loop-type rear bumper.\n\nOn sedans, the roof line showed a slimmer C-pillar, squared-off rear door windows, and met a belt line that kicked up beneath the trailing edge of each rear door window. The belt line tapered back to the same rear fascia as the hardtop coupe's. This rear fascia contained a new ribbed taillight lens that stretched wall-to-wall and included twin square white reverse light lenses in its center.\n\nStation wagons received no change to their rooflines, doors, and rear fascias. However, all Ambassadors received a new extruded aluminum grille at the front, featuring several widely spaced bright horizontal bars with one wide, body colored horizontal grille bar extending to each headlight cluster. The {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced for 1970 by a new {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine. This {{convert|210|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm and {{convert|305|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 2800 rpm was the standard engine on all DPL and SST models. The {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was also supplanted by a {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine available in either 2-barrel, regular gasoline, or high-output, 4-barrel, premium fuel versions. The 4-barrel \"AMX\" {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was optional, producing {{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3200 rpm and {{convert|420|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 3200 rpm.\n\n=== 1971 ===\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador 2-door hardtop coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador hardtop with TurboCast II wheels from 1979\u201383]]\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador station wagon red with woodgrain side panels.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador station wagon]]\n\nFollowing the previous year's redesign, the 1971 Ambassadors received only minor changes and improvements. The marketing tag line for the year was the [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] asking, \"If you had to compete with GM, Ford and Chrysler, what would you do?\"\u2014that was answered by AMC including more features, advantages, and benefits for buyers of its cars compared to the models from its much larger competitors. This was reflected by shuffling the Ambassador models for 1971 and by including more equipment in the standard feature list. The previously nameless base models were dropped, as the sedan-only DPL trim line was relegated to base model status, and a new top-line '''Brougham''' trim line was added above mid-line SST models. Both SST and Brougham models came as hardtop coupes, sedans, and wagons.\n\nThe DPL came with AMC's new {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Inline-6 with seven main bearings. All the SSTs and Broughams featured the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as standard. BorgWarner's \"Shift-Command\" automatic transmissions were standard equipment across the line. Two of AMC's {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} were optional; an 8.5:1 compression version with a two-barrel carburetor or a high-compression four-barrel V8 that required premium-fuel. The previous \"AMX 390\" V8 gave way to a new {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 as the top engine option.\n\nStyling changes consisted of a new fascia up front. It featured headlights contained in their own chrome pods separate from, but flanking the new grille with a bright rectangular surround, with rounded edges. The \"natural\" cast [[pot metal]] grille insert was recessed and featured a bright vertical bar pattern. A second set of parking lights was added outboard of the headlight clusters, and they were integrated into the fender extension to eliminate the need for separate front marker lights.\n\nTaillights on hardtop coupes and sedans still ran wall-to-wall, but the twin backup lights were moved from the center to further outboard\u2014approximately eight inches in from either fender side. Once again, the wagon received few changes at the rear, but added a new design for its optional woodgrain side trim, which filled in its upper bodysides. Its lower edge flowed downward aft of its peak at the leading edge above each front wheelhouse, in similar fashion to the [[Buick Skylark]]'s side \"sweepspear\" styling cue.\n\nAmbassador base models were offered to fleet buyers with various police, [[taxicab]], and other heavy-duty packages. Governments and police departments in the U.S. historically used standard-size, low-price line four-door sedans.

This backing also included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, such as the standardization of electric windshield wipers on all model lines, replacing AMC's vacuum-powered units, as well as better interior trims. By focusing on quality, the smallest domestic automaker was profitable for 1972, earning US$30.2 million (the highest net profit achieved by AMC since 1964) on $4 billion in sales.\n\nThe base Ambassador DPL model was canceled, with three body styles now available in SST and Brougham trim. Fleet purchasers could order plain Ambassadors in Police Pursuit Vehicle (PPV) or Special Service Package (SSP) versions. A six-cylinder engine was no longer available; thus, Ambassador became a V8-only car for the first time since 1964. This made the Ambassador the only volume-produced American car that included air conditioning, power brakes, automatic transmission, and a V8 engine as standard equipment; all while being priced less than the Big Three's full-sized cars.<ref name=\"1972AMCphotos\">{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/AMC/1972_AMC/1972_Ambassador_Promo/1972%20Ambassador%20Promo-01.html |title=1972 AMC Ambassador press photos |date=1 September 1971 |work=The Old Car Manual Project |accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref> The base engine was the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with two {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} or a {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} versions optional.

The grille gained heavier horizontal bars and headlight bezels took on blackout trim in their recessed portions.\n\n== Eighth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1974\n| image        = 1974 AMC Ambassador Brougham 4-door sedan beige.JPG\n| caption      = 1974 Ambassador Brougham sedan\n| class        = [[Full-size car|Full-size]]\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[station wagon]] }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|122|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|217.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 | {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| transmission = 3-speed ''[[Torqueflite|Torque Command]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| name         = Eighth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1974 ===\n[[File:1974 AMC Ambassador sedan blue-white Kenosha-r.jpg|thumb|left|1974 AMC Ambassador sedan]]\n[[File:1974 AMC Ambassador sedan blue-white Kenosha-a.jpg|thumb|left|1974 AMC Ambassador sedan]]\n\nAmbassador sales had remained steady since 1970, despite the lack of major changes to the vehicle. However, the 1974 model year would bring out the biggest Ambassador\u2014just as the 1973 [[1973 oil crisis|Arab Oil Embargo]] sparked gasoline rationing across the nation. The Ambassador sedan was stretched {{convert|7|in|mm|spell=in}} compared with the 1973 versions. This additional length was due to a new front end design and stronger energy absorbing bumpers with hydraulic backup.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Norbye |first=Jan P. |title=New bumpers have uniform height, take angle impacts |journal=Popular Science |pages=90\u201391 |date=October 1973 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=New+bumpers+have+uniform+Ambassador |volume=203 |issue=4 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 1974 Ambassador Brougham was no longer available as a 2-door (pillar-less) [[hardtop]], leaving the 4-door sedan and station wagon body styles in the line. The hardtop's cancellation was due in part to low sales volume of the Ambassador 2-door versions, as well as the introduction of an all-new 1974 [[AMC Matador|Matador coupe]] that featured a very long hood and a short rear deck. The new coupe was selected as the \"Best Styled Car of 1974\" by the editors of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine and did not have the requisite share the typical mid- to late-1970s styling hallmarks that included an upright grille, a [[notchback]] roof, and imitation \"landau bars\" or opera lights.<ref>{{cite journal |title=none|journal=Car and Driver |date=November 1973 }}</ref>\n\nStyling changes for the sedan and wagon included new front fender caps on the same fenders as used since 1969, and hood, grille, bumpers, rear fascia, instrument panel, interior trim, hood ornament, and a new font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille showed off a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights, and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille's crosshatch trim. Headlamp bezels were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new hood and front bumper followed the grille's central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight \"coffin nose\" look. The revised [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedan saw a similar frontal treatment in 1974, but with a much more pronounced effect and with different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille insert.\n\nAs with the new Matador sedan, the new rear bumper was much larger and backed by shock absorbers, as it was beefed up to comply with new [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] regulations for standardized front and rear bumpers on passenger cars that could sustain a {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}} impact with no damage. Fiberglass end caps were added to the ends of each rear fender on sedans. They wrapped inward to create a recessed space that met a carryover [[decklid]]. In this space was mounted the new rectangular taillight housings, which featured taller white backup lights mounted inboard of the new taillights. The license plate moved from the rear bumper to the area between the new taillight assemblies, and the whole taillight and license plate system on the sedans was surrounded its own loop of chrome trim. Both Ambassador and Matador sedans shared the same rear end style. \n\nThe cargo area and the rear design of station wagons remained similar to previous Ambassadors, save for a massive new bumper and revised taillamps. The wagon was available with two-row bench seats for six passengers or with a rear-facing third row for a total eight seat-belted passengers. All came with numerous practical, appearance, and comfort items as standard. These included a two-way opening tail gate: (1) hinged at the bottom for convenient loading or hauling long cargo and (2) hinged at the side to open as door for ease of entry and exit for passengers or cargo; wood grained [[Transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]] vinyl side and rear trim, a full-length [[roof rack]]; as well as a chrome and wood grain roof air deflector to help keep the tailgate window clean.\n\nPowertrain selections remained the same as in 1973, with only [[AMC V8 engine|V8 engines]] and automatic transmissions available. When ordered with a trailer package (special wiring harness with heavy-duty flasher and heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar), the Ambassador was rated for up to {{convert|5000|lb|0|adj=on}} towing capacity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schultz |first=Mort |title=Cars to take your rig in tow |journal=Popular Mechanics |pages=156\u2013157 |date=March 1974 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ddQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=1974+AMC+Ambassador |volume=141 |issue=3 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Other increases for 1974 included a larger capacity fuel tank, {{convert|24.9|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}}, and an alternator producing 62 [[ampere]]s. New sound insulation made the Ambassador even quieter. All came with a very lengthy list of standard equipment that was typically optional on competing makes. These included comfort items such as air conditioning, an AM radio, and vanity mirror to appearance enhancements such as [[pin striping]] and [[whitewall tire]]s.\n\nSales of all full-size vehicles, regardless of the automaker, fell significantly in 1974 as America's focus shifted to smaller cars. Ambassador sales were no different, and in June 1974, the final AMC Ambassador rolled off the [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] assembly line, ending a nameplate that had been in continuous production in some form for 48 years.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==International markets==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:AutoantiguodesfileMDP5-9jul2016.jpg|thumb|right|Fifth U.S. generation Ambassador 990 built by IKA from 1965 to 1972]] \n'''Industrias Kaiser Argentina''' [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina|(IKA)]] produced the U.S. third, fourth, and fifth generation Ambassadors in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1962 to 1972, and later available by special order through 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/r/rambler.htm |title=IKA - Caracter\u00edsticas Classic Custom - Classic Custom De Luxe - Ambassador 440 |date=18 May 2009 |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAssembly of IKA Ramblers began in 1962, with the Argentinean cars being the 1961 U.S. versions, but equipped with {{convert|226|cuin|L|2|abbr=on}} [[Continental Motors Company|Continental]] I6 engines producing {{convert|119|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm, along with a steering column mounted manual three-speed transmission.

The Australian-built Ambassadors included a significant percentage of \"local content\" to gain import [[tariff]] (tax) concessions by using parts and components (such as interiors and upholstery) that were sourced from Australian manufacturers. AMI's first year of production resulted in 65 registrations for 1961. Registrations of the 1963 model continued into 1964 for a total of 21 Ambassadors registered for 1964.\n\nAlthough not documented in any AMI records, according to Australian Rambler afficionados 20 right-hand drive 1970 Ambassadors were fully imported from Canada, apparently 16 two-door hardtops and 4 four-door sedans. One possible reason for this was that it may have been a holding action while AMI was preparing for assembly of the new 1970 Rebel. AMC had assembled over 3,700 RHD Rambler Ambassadors for the U.S Postal Service in 1967, so they were well experienced in making completed right-hand drive vehicles. All Australian factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors came with automatic transmission with floor shift.<ref>https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/benaraby/cars-vans-utes/rambler-ambassador/1242484069</ref>\n\nThe dash and instrument pack of the 1967 Ambassador which had been converted and used in the RHD Ambassadors assembled for the U.S Postal Service was thereafter used in all Australian and New Zealand-assembled Rambler Rebel and Matador models, and all RHD, U.S-built Rebel and Matadors for the United Kingdom.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:1970 AMC Ambassador SST (14379718872).jpg|thumb|right|One of 12 factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors for the New Zealand market ]]\n\nAmerican Motors motor vehicles were assembled in New Zealand by '''VW Motors''' at their Volkswagen plant in Otahuhu, Auckland from 1958 until 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/107503496/the-empty-halls-of-new-zealands-car-assembly-industry |title=The empty halls of New Zealand's car assembly industry |first=Todd |last=Niall |website=Stuff |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> From 1964, AMC vehicles were assembled by '''Campbell Motor Industries''' (CMI) in Thames, [[North Island]].

The model was virtually restricted to the four-door hardtop sedan only. It was powered by the four-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine producing {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} coupled to a three-speed automatic transmission. The model became the marque's top-of-the-line product alongside the three versions of the midsize Rambler and Rambler American models. \n\nHowever, low sales figures alongside a deteriorating relationship between AMC and Planta REO lead to the cancellation of the contract in the second half of 1959. <ref>{{cite book|first=Douglas C. |last=Bennett |first2=Kenneth E. |last2=Sharpe |title=Transnational Corporations versus the State: The Political Economy of the Mexican Auto Industry |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2014 |isbn=9780691022376}}</ref> American Motors once again exported its products into Mexico and a new local partner, Willys Mexicana that eventually would become '''Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos''' [[Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos|(VAM)]]. The agreement was signed in March 1960 and production began in Mexico City. \n\nThis meant the discontinuation of the Ambassador line in Mexico as the new operation had several priorities above offering a top-end luxury full-size car line. Aside from offering the already existing Jeep line, Willys Mexicana focused efforts on the compact Rambler American, which obtained a generation change just the next year, meaning a complete retooling of the Vallejo plant. In 1962, legal and industrial requirements in the country became stronger with the auto industry integration decree issued by president [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]] in 1962. Among its mandates, it fully banned the importation of automobile engines. Willys Mexicana began building its own engine plant, which was achieved in November 1964. Once the Rambler American was consolidated in the Mexican market, Willys Mexicana opted to expand the product line by introducing the brand-new second generation Rambler Classic midsize model as a larger luxury counterpart to the economy compact American. Also in 1963, due to problems with WM's parent company (the SOMEX bank) as well as further requirements of the government auto industry decree, Willys Mexicana was reorganized into an entirely new company with expanded capital and direct investment from the Mexican government, Kaiser Willys, and American Motors. This resulted in the formation of Veh\u00edculos Automotores Mexicanos S.A. \n\nAfter the corporate transition process between 1960 and 1964 concluded, in which the Rambler marque under VAM surpassed the commercial results of its local predecessors Armadora Mexicana and Planta REO combined between 1950 and 1959, the company opted not to offer the Ambassador model. The Mexican market of the era was still relatively small and since the Ambassador shared mostly the same styling as the contemporary midsize model of the company, it was considered that internal competition would affect the sales of a simultaneous Rambler Classic/Ambassador line-up. Unlike the United States, which had a much larger and diverse market for two different car lines with the same styling, AMC could offer a strong difference between both models with the exclusive V8 engine for the Ambassador and the Classic being restricted to six cylinders only. This advantage did not exist in Mexico since VAM could only produce six cylinder engines in its Lerma plant and V8 engines could not be imported from AMC due to the ban of the 1962 decree. Instead, VAM opted to use the Rambler Classic as its most luxurious and flagship model, giving it the same treatment AMC put in the Ambassador model in the US and Canada. This would be passed on to the subsequent equivalent Rebel and Matador models produced under VAM. \n\nThe 1958\u20131959 Ambassador models represent the only chapter in this model's history to be present in Mexico. These were the only full-size American Motors products sold in the country alongside the second generation VAM Classic (Matador) models. Even more unique was the fact that it was a factory V8 model, the only one of its kind to ever be sold in Mexico belonging to American Motors.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nRambler Ambassadors were exported in limited numbers to the United Kingdom in factory right-hand-drive direct from AMC during the 1960s and up to its final year of 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/File:Im196610MotSC-RamblerMots.jpg |title=Image of Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd. advertisement |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |date=1967 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> They were imported by '''Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Ltd''' of Chiswick in West London which became a subsidiary of AMC in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Rambler_Motors |title=Rambler Motors |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> The location had previously been used since 1926 for British assembly of Hudson, Essex, and Terraplane vehicles<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1968/44/us-car-concessionaires-great-britain|title=U.S. Car Concessionaires in Great Britain |date=April 1968 |website=Motor Sport Magazine (Archive) |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> and later AMC's post-1954 Hudson, Nash and Rambler models. Ambassador models marketed in the UK were the Ambassador saloon (sedan), SST coupe, and station wagon. AMC vehicles were distributed by London distributors Clarke and Simpson Limited and were marketed as \"the only American car built with RHD.\"<ref>http://www.classiccarcatalogue.com/RAMBLER%201968.html</ref> As with all export markets UK models were marketed as \"Rambler\" even after the Rambler marque was dropped in the USA.\n\n== Epilogue ==\nBecause AMC was focusing its attentions on their newly acquired [[Jeep]] line, the redesigned 1974 Matador coupe, and the [[AMC Pacer]], which would debut in 1975, the company would not put forth the investment to continue the full-size Ambassador line after its 1974 redesign. Instead, the automaker upgraded the Matador sedan and wagon counterparts starting with the 1975 model year. The basic [[automobile platform]] was used by AMC since the 1967 model year, and the full-size automobile market segment was declining. American Motors strategy now aimed at smaller cars and sport-utility vehicles.\n\nHowever, the Ambassador basically continued as the similarly sized and styled [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedans and wagons. From 1975 they became available in uplevel \"Brougham\" trim and assumed the model numbers of the previously equivalent Ambassadors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |date=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786456369 |page=223 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yPwcDJ10TtAC&pg=PA223&dq=AMC+discontinued+the+Ambassador+line |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> The Matador was also offered in a unique top-of-the-line '''Barcelona''' four-door in its final year of production, 1978.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lamm |first1=Michael |title=Driving the '78 cars from American Motors |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=October 1977 |volume=148 |issue=4 |page=106, 178 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6uEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA106&dq=Matador+Barcelona+sedan |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=1978 AMC Full Line Brochure |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/United%20States/AMC/1978_AMC/1978_AMC_Brochure/slides/1978_AMC-28.html |website=Old Car Brochures Project |pages=28\u201329, 32 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=AMC Cars: 1954\u20131987 An Illustrated History |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58388-112-5 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=AMC Performance Cars: 1951\u20131983 Photo Archive |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58388-127-9 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=American Motors \u2013 The Last Independent |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-87341-240-7}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=1958\u20131962 Ambassador: A Rambler By Any Other Name |journal=Collectible Automobile |date=December 1992 |volume=9 |issue=6 }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Gunnell |editor-first=John |title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946\u20131975 |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1987 | isbn=978-0-87341-096-0 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Larry G. |title=Illustrated AMC Buyer's Guide |publisher=Motorbooks |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-87938-891-1 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|AMC Ambassador}}\n* [http://www.AMCRC.com/ AMC Rambler Club]\n* [http://www.amonational.com/ American Motors Owners Association]\n* [http://www.nashcarclub.org/ Nash Car Club]\n* [http://www.americansportscars.com/healey.html Nash Healey History]\n* [http://www.nash-gb.com/ Nash in the UK]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101106220820/http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/67-Amb-1.html 1967 Ambassador information]\n* {{imcdb vehicle|make=Rambler|model=Ambassador|Rambler Ambassador}}\n* {{imcdb vehicle|make=AMC|model=Ambassador|AMC Ambassador}}\n\n{{American Motors}}\n{{amc Timeline}}\n\n[[Category:AMC vehicles|Ambassador]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Mid-size cars]]\n[[Category:Full-size vehicles]]\n[[Category:Limousines]]\n[[Category:Police vehicles]]\n[[Category:Taxicab vehicles]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1958]]\n", "name_user": "842U", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEighth generation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Ambassador"}

Traditionally, craftsmen created Baandhas with images of flora or fauna or with geometrical patterns. More recently,{{When|date=February 2011}} new types of Baandha depicting portrait, landscape and flower pods are being designed.\nBaandha fabric is created using a [[tie-dye]] technique. The yarns are tied according to the desired patterns to prevent absorption of dyes, and then dyed. The yarns or set of yarns so produced is called 'Baandha'. The unique feature of this form of designing is that the designs are reflected almost identically on both side of the fabric.Once the frabic is dyed it can never be belached in to other colour.<ref>https://nidhishekhawat.hatenablog.com/entry/2020/02/13/170702</ref> This versatile technique enables a craftsman to weave colourful designs, patterns and images into a fabric capable of inspiring a thought or conveying a message. Thus Baandha can be defined as \"A length of systematically arranged yarn, dyed according to a preconceived design in such a manner so as to enable a weaver to portray the design when the yarn is converted to a fabric through the process of weaving\". It is believed that this art migrated to Western Odisha along with the Bhulia community who fled Northern India in the year 1192 AD after the fall of the [[Chouhan]] empire at the hands of the [[Mughals]]. Since then and up to the year 1925 it flourished in Western Odisha in a limited number of designs and in vegetable colours and consisted mostly of saris used by the womenfolk of the [[Odisha]]. These saris were known as 'Bhulia-Kapta'. The demand was limited, distress sale was common and the craftsmen lived in penury.\n[[File:Sambalpuri sari DSC 0496.JPG|thumb|left|Sambalpuri sari]]\n\n== Development ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sambalpuri women.jpg|thumb|120px|right|A Sambalpuri urban woman wearing a traditional Sambalpuri Bapta Pata sari]] -->\n\nToday the Baandha fabric is popularly known by its geographical and cultural name ''Sambalpuri'' owing to the pioneering efforts of Sri Radhashyam Meher, who brought about a radical improvement in the skills of the craftsmen and the quality of the products. Other master craftsmen who contributed to the development of Sambalpuri textiles were [[Padma Shri|Padmashree]] [[Kailash Chandra Meher]], Padmashree [[Kunja Bihari Meher]], ''Padmashree Chatrubhuja Meher'' and ''Padmashree Krutharth Acharya''. Sambalpuri textiles today include furnishing materials, dress materials and saris in [[silk]], [[cotton]] and [[mercerised cotton]] in a variety of colours and many different designs.  Baandha craftsmen are also masters of the 'extra warp' and 'extra weft' style of designing which can be seen in almost all forms of Baandha textiles. Radhashyam Meher also produced Khadi textiles using the Baandha art.<ref>[[Bomkai Sari]]</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Radhashyam designed the first handloom to weave textiles of ninety inches width.  This achievement made him the 'Parda agent' of the Government of Bihar for the production of furnishing materials.  Later, after the formation of the state of [[Odisha]], he became the 'Parda agent' of the government of [[Odisha]].  His dexterity in the Baandha art and his ability to motivate the weaving community in the region to improve their skills by providing the necessary training and incentives enabled the creation of new designs that received international fame and recognition.\n\nRadhashyam Meher established his proprietary concern, named 'Utkal Parda Agency', at [[Sambalpur]] for the research, production and marketing of Sambalpuri textiles. Acknowledging Radhashyam Meher's unparalleled contribution to the growth and popularity of 'Baandha art', the [[Ministry of Textiles (India)|Ministry of Textiles]] of the [[Government of India]] has sponsored textile exhibitions coinciding with his birth anniversary on 20 November and organised by the Director of Textiles of the [[Government of Odisha]].\n\nHe also played an active role in the cooperative movement and organised the Meher Art Fabrics cooperative society Ltd and the Sambalpur Regional Cooperative Marketing Society Ltd.
