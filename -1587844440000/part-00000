Curitiba.]]\n[[File:Estufa-Jardim-Botanico-Curitiba-out.JPG|thumb|Botanical gardens greenhouse in Curitiba]]\nCuritiba is located in the area of the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (also known as [[Araucaria moist forests]]), a sub-type of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. In Curitiba it is possible to find steppes, forests and other formations. The local vegetation consists of remnants of the Paran\u00e1 (or Brazilian) pine (''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]''), which resisted the efforts of settlers. The Paran\u00e1 pines are in private and public areas and are protected from logging. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a [[botanical garden]] and three [[greenhouse]]s that produce 150,000 native and exotic seedlings: 16,000 fruit trees, 260,000 flowers, foliage and underbrush specimens and the maintenance of another 350,000 seedlings.<ref name=\"casecwb\">{{cite web |title= City of Curitiba, Brazil|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity |accessdate=23 May 2008 |url=http://www.cbd.int/authorities/casestudy/curitiba.}} {{Dead link|date=May 2018}}</ref>\n\nCuritiba's green area itself matches the size of other large Brazilian cities. The vegetation of Curitiba encompasses a large population of purple and yellow ''ip\u00eas'' ([[tabebuia]]s), making a beautiful sight during flowering at winter's end. The yellow ip\u00ea is the city's most common tree.<ref name=\"arvct\">{{cite web |title=Livro mostra roteiros das \u00e1rvores de Curitiba/Pr |publisher=Ambiente Brasil |language=Portuguese |accessdate=25 May 2005 |url=http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/noticias/index.php3?action=ler&id=18883 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019045953/http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/noticias/index.php3?action=ler&id=18883 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Barigui Panorama.JPG|1200px|Panoramic view of Barigui Park.}}\n\n===Hydrography===\n[[File:Rio igua\u00e7u curitiba.jpg|thumb|Igua\u00e7u River, running by the south region of the city.]]\nThe [[drainage basin|catchment area]] of Curitiba consists of rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the city's [[Drainage basin|watershed]] are: Atuba River, Bel\u00e9m River, Barig\u00fci River, Passa\u00fana River, Ribeir\u00e3o dos Padilhas and the [[Igua\u00e7u River]], all with characteristics of [[dendritic drainage]]. Curitiba has been working since the 1970s on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of [[wikt:urbanization|urbanization]] on rivers. An example is the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which absorb and retain water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods.<ref name=\"casecwb\"/>\nAfter many studies of local water flows, most rivers were found to be subject to a [[Canalized|canalization]] process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the negative effects of urbanization are the implementation of programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works.<ref name=\"casecwb\"/>\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Curitiba vista serra do mar.jpg|thumb|left|The Mountain Range of the Sea, ''\"Serra do Mar.\"'']]\n\nThe city covers {{convert|432.17|km2|2|abbr=out}} on the First Plateau of Paran\u00e1. Curitiba has a [[topography]] of smooth, rounded hills, giving it a relatively regular shape. The city has an average altitude of {{convert|934.6|m|ft}} above sea level. The highest point is to the north at {{convert|1021|m|ft}}, and with lower altitudes at {{convert|864|m|ft}} to the south. Mountain ranges and sets of rocky hills surround parts of the city, including the ''[[Serra do Mar]]'', a hill range between the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and the First Plateau in Paran\u00e1.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Pal\u00e1cio 29 de Mar\u00e7o Curitiba Paran\u00e1 Brasil.jpg|thumb|right|The Curitiba City Hall]]\n{{As of|2017}}, the mayor is Rafael Greca, who replaced Gustavo Fruet. The [[City Council]] of Curitiba has 38 councillors elected since 2004. Curitiba is divided into nine regional governments (equivalent to [[subprefecture]]), who manage the municipality's 75 districts. The ''Rua da Cidadania'' (\"Street of Citizenship\") is the symbol of administrative decentralization; it is a reference point and a meeting place. Several units are annexed to public transport terminals. Their nuclei offer services in the local, [[States of Brazil|state]] and [[Federal republic|federal]] areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoohara.com/travel-guide-curitiba-parana-state-vacations-government|title=Curitiba, Brazil Travel Guide \u2013 Government \u2013 Zoohara|website=Zoohara.com|accessdate=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203011834/http://www.zoohara.com/travel-guide-curitiba-parana-state-vacations-government|archive-date=3 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Jaime Lerner]] is perhaps Curitiba's best-known mayor. He has been mayor three times, the first time in the early 1970s. His leadership was crucial to some major changes in the city. Curitiba has built parks instead of canals to reduce flooding; used parks to make the city more liveable; pedestrianised the downtown area; invented and built Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a bus system that works like a light rail system but is 10 times cheaper; and started a massive recycling scheme that included giving people bus tokens in return for waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citiesforpeople.net/cities/curitiba.html|title=Sitemap \u2013 \u30c0\u30dd\u30ad\u30bb\u30c1\u30f3\u3067\u65e9\u6f0f\u6539\u5584\uff01|website=Citiesforpeople.net|accessdate=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312113008/http://citiesforpeople.net/cities/curitiba.html|archive-date=12 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Time magazine]] listed this former [[mayor]] among the world's most influential thinkers of 2010. In the days before free direct elections, mayors were political appointees who were no more than pawns in the game of power politics and were subject to replacement at any time. For an idealistic young architect like Lerner, retaining the mayor's office was particularly precarious. Those holding the reins of power at the time were under the mistaken impression that Lerner's youth would make him easy to control. As it turned out, he was no [[wikt:milquetoast|milquetoast]], and subsequently set about enthusiastically pursuing reform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&id=13718&offset=0|title=Former Curitiba Mayor Jaime Lerner|website=English.cw.com.tw|accessdate=9 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055505/http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&id=13718&offset=0|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Cerimonia de bencao dos alimentos.jpg|thumb|left|Brazilians of [[Ukrainian Brazilian|Ukrainian]] descent celebrating Easter in Curitiba.]]\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align  = right\n | width = 220\n | footer = \n | image1 = Curitiba - Bosque do Papa - Casa de Colono Polones.jpg\n | caption1 = Old [[Polish Brazilian|Polish]] house at Jo\u00e3o Paulo II park (\"Pope's Park\").\n | image2 = Curitiba Parque Tingui.jpg\n | caption2 = Ukrainian memorial at [[Tingui Park]].\n | image3 = CuritibaPracaDoJapaoCerejeira.JPG\n | caption3 = Memorial of Japanese immigrants at Japan's Square.\n}}\nAccording to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|2010 IBGE Census]], 1,678,965 people resided in the city of Curitiba.<ref>[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br:80/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=41 2010 IGBE Census]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502213333/http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=41 |date=2 May 2012 }} {{in lang|pt}}</ref> The census revealed 1,381,938 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (78.9%), 294,127 [[Pardo]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (16.8%), 49,978 [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] people (2.9%), 23,138 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] people (1.4%), 2,693 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.2%).<ref name=\"ibge\">[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/painel/?nivel=mn 2010 IGBE Census] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514145708/http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/painel/?nivel=mn |date=14 May 2012 }} {{in lang|pt}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Curitiba was Brazil's 8th most populous city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/04/maiores-cidades-do-brasil-crescem-menos-do-que-resto-do-pais-aponta-censo.jhtm|title=Maiores cidades do Brasil crescem menos do que m\u00e9dia nacional, aponta Censo \u2013 Not\u00edcias \u2013 Cotidiano|website=Noticias.uol.com.br|accessdate=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106193624/http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/04/maiores-cidades-do-brasil-crescem-menos-do-que-resto-do-pais-aponta-censo.jhtm|archive-date=6 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the city had 359,201 opposite-sex couples and 974 [[same-sex couple]]s.

Lerner closed [[Rua XV de Novembro|XV de Novembro St.]] to vehicles, because it had high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This used two one-way streets moving in opposite directions that surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have an exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges on the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density development, to pull traffic away from the main roads.

The centro (downtown or central business district), where the city was founded, is the most bustling area, housing most of the financial institutions of Curitiba.\n\n''Bairros'' (neighborhoods) of Curitiba define the city's geographical divisions. Administrative powers are not delegated to neighborhoods, although neighborhood associations work to improve their communities.\nCuritiba is divided into 9 regional governments (boroughs) covering the 75 neighborhoods.\n\nCivic Center (In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Centro C\u00edvico)'' is where the main government buildings are located. It was the first neighborhood in the municipality of Curitiba, capital of the state of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]]. The name means 'Center of the Citizen', or with a more direct interpretation, 'center where the subjects related to the citizen are solved'. It was conceived in 1953, with the greater independence which came with the creation of a new state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/portugues/linhaturismo/centrocivico|title=Centro C\u00edvico \u2013 Prefeitura de Curitiba|last=Curitiba|first=Prefeitura de|website=www.curitiba.pr.gov.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225225049/http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/portugues/linhaturismo/centrocivico|archive-date=25 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://partiucuritiba.com/conheca-a-historia-do-centro-civico-de-curitiba/|title=Conhe\u00e7a a Hist\u00f3ria do Centro C\u00edvico de Curitiba|last=Curitiba|first=Partiu|date=2017-05-26|website=Partiu Curitiba|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226035235/http://partiucuritiba.com/conheca-a-historia-do-centro-civico-de-curitiba/|archive-date=26 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In August 2011, the Civic Center was listed as an urban and architectural ensemble.

Curitiba.]]\n[[File:Estufa-Jardim-Botanico-Curitiba-out.JPG|thumb|Botanical gardens greenhouse in Curitiba]]\nCuritiba is located in the area of the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (also known as [[Araucaria moist forests]]), a sub-type of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. In Curitiba it is possible to find steppes, forests and other formations. The local vegetation consists of remnants of the Paran\u00e1 (or Brazilian) pine (''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]''), which resisted the efforts of settlers. The Paran\u00e1 pines are in private and public areas and are protected from logging. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a [[botanical garden]] and three [[greenhouse]]s that produce 150,000 native and exotic seedlings: 16,000 fruit trees, 260,000 flowers, foliage and underbrush specimens and the maintenance of another 350,000 seedlings.<ref name=\"casecwb\">{{cite web |title= City of Curitiba, Brazil|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity |accessdate=23 May 2008 |url=http://www.cbd.int/authorities/casestudy/curitiba.}} {{Dead link|date=May 2018}}</ref>\n\nCuritiba's green area itself matches the size of other large Brazilian cities. The vegetation of Curitiba encompasses a large population of purple and yellow ''ip\u00eas'' ([[tabebuia]]s), making a beautiful sight during flowering at winter's end. The yellow ip\u00ea is the city's most common tree.<ref name=\"arvct\">{{cite web |title=Livro mostra roteiros das \u00e1rvores de Curitiba/Pr |publisher=Ambiente Brasil |language=Portuguese |accessdate=25 May 2005 |url=http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/noticias/index.php3?action=ler&id=18883 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019045953/http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/noticias/index.php3?action=ler&id=18883 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Barigui Panorama.JPG|1200px|Panoramic view of Barigui Park.}}\n\n===Hydrography===\n[[File:Rio igua\u00e7u curitiba.jpg|thumb|Igua\u00e7u River, running by the south region of the city.]]\nThe [[drainage basin|catchment area]] of Curitiba consists of rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the city's [[Drainage basin|watershed]] are: Atuba River, Bel\u00e9m River, Barig\u00fci River, Passa\u00fana River, Ribeir\u00e3o dos Padilhas and the [[Igua\u00e7u River]], all with characteristics of [[dendritic drainage]]. Curitiba has been working since the 1970s on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of [[wikt:urbanization|urbanization]] on rivers. An example is the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which absorb and retain water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods.<ref name=\"casecwb\"/>\nAfter many studies of local water flows, most rivers were found to be subject to a [[Canalized|canalization]] process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the negative effects of urbanization are the implementation of programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works.<ref name=\"casecwb\"/>\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Curitiba vista serra do mar.jpg|thumb|left|The Mountain Range of the Sea, ''\"Serra do Mar.\"'']]\n\nThe city covers {{convert|432.17|km2|2|abbr=out}} on the First Plateau of Paran\u00e1. Curitiba has a [[topography]] of smooth, rounded hills, giving it a relatively regular shape. The city has an average altitude of {{convert|934.6|m|ft}} above sea level. The highest point is to the north at {{convert|1021|m|ft}}, and with lower altitudes at {{convert|864|m|ft}} to the south. Mountain ranges and sets of rocky hills surround parts of the city, including the ''[[Serra do Mar]]'', a hill range between the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and the First Plateau in Paran\u00e1.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Pal\u00e1cio 29 de Mar\u00e7o Curitiba Paran\u00e1 Brasil.jpg|thumb|right|The Curitiba City Hall]]\n{{As of|2017}}, the mayor is Rafael Greca, who replaced Gustavo Fruet. The [[City Council]] of Curitiba has 38 councillors elected since 2004. Curitiba is divided into nine regional governments (equivalent to [[subprefecture]]), who manage the municipality's 75 districts. The ''Rua da Cidadania'' (\"Street of Citizenship\") is the symbol of administrative decentralization; it is a reference point and a meeting place. Several units are annexed to public transport terminals. Their nuclei offer services in the local, [[States of Brazil|state]] and [[Federal republic|federal]] areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoohara.com/travel-guide-curitiba-parana-state-vacations-government|title=Curitiba, Brazil Travel Guide \u2013 Government \u2013 Zoohara|website=Zoohara.com|accessdate=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203011834/http://www.zoohara.com/travel-guide-curitiba-parana-state-vacations-government|archive-date=3 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Jaime Lerner]] is perhaps Curitiba's best-known mayor. He has been mayor three times, the first time in the early 1970s. His leadership was crucial to some major changes in the city. Curitiba has built parks instead of canals to reduce flooding; used parks to make the city more liveable; pedestrianised the downtown area; invented and built Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a bus system that works like a light rail system but is 10 times cheaper; and started a massive recycling scheme that included giving people bus tokens in return for waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citiesforpeople.net/cities/curitiba.html|title=Sitemap \u2013 \u30c0\u30dd\u30ad\u30bb\u30c1\u30f3\u3067\u65e9\u6f0f\u6539\u5584\uff01|website=Citiesforpeople.net|accessdate=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312113008/http://citiesforpeople.net/cities/curitiba.html|archive-date=12 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Time magazine]] listed this former [[mayor]] among the world's most influential thinkers of 2010. In the days before free direct elections, mayors were political appointees who were no more than pawns in the game of power politics and were subject to replacement at any time. For an idealistic young architect like Lerner, retaining the mayor's office was particularly precarious. Those holding the reins of power at the time were under the mistaken impression that Lerner's youth would make him easy to control. As it turned out, he was no [[wikt:milquetoast|milquetoast]], and subsequently set about enthusiastically pursuing reform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&id=13718&offset=0|title=Former Curitiba Mayor Jaime Lerner|website=English.cw.com.tw|accessdate=9 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055505/http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&id=13718&offset=0|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Cerimonia de bencao dos alimentos.jpg|thumb|left|Brazilians of [[Ukrainian Brazilian|Ukrainian]] descent celebrating Easter in Curitiba.]]\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align  = right\n | width = 220\n | footer = \n | image1 = Curitiba - Bosque do Papa - Casa de Colono Polones.jpg\n | caption1 = Old [[Polish Brazilian|Polish]] house at Jo\u00e3o Paulo II park (\"Pope's Park\").\n | image2 = Curitiba Parque Tingui.jpg\n | caption2 = Ukrainian memorial at [[Tingui Park]].\n | image3 = CuritibaPracaDoJapaoCerejeira.JPG\n | caption3 = Memorial of Japanese immigrants at Japan's Square.\n}}\nAccording to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|2010 IBGE Census]], 1,678,965 people resided in the city of Curitiba.<ref>[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br:80/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=41 2010 IGBE Census]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502213333/http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=41 |date=2 May 2012 }} {{in lang|pt}}</ref> The census revealed 1,381,938 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (78.9%), 294,127 [[Pardo]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (16.8%), 49,978 [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] people (2.9%), 23,138 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] people (1.4%), 2,693 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.2%).<ref name=\"ibge\">[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/painel/?nivel=mn 2010 IGBE Census] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514145708/http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/painel/?nivel=mn |date=14 May 2012 }} {{in lang|pt}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Curitiba was Brazil's 8th most populous city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/04/maiores-cidades-do-brasil-crescem-menos-do-que-resto-do-pais-aponta-censo.jhtm|title=Maiores cidades do Brasil crescem menos do que m\u00e9dia nacional, aponta Censo \u2013 Not\u00edcias \u2013 Cotidiano|website=Noticias.uol.com.br|accessdate=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106193624/http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/04/maiores-cidades-do-brasil-crescem-menos-do-que-resto-do-pais-aponta-censo.jhtm|archive-date=6 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the city had 359,201 opposite-sex couples and 974 [[same-sex couple]]s.

Buses charge one price regardless of distance.<ref>Jonas Rabinovitch and Josef Leitman, \"Urban Planning in Curitiba\", ''Scientific American'', vol. 274, no. 3 (March 1996), pp. 46\u201353</ref>\n\nThe city preserves and cares for its green areas, boasting {{convert|51.5|m2|sqft}} of green space per inhabitant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI1926962-EI299,00.html|title=Curitiba busca recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiversidade local Terra \u2013 Ambiente|publisher=Noticias.terra.com.br|accessdate=22 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606025238/http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI1926962-EI299,00.html|archive-date=6 June 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, [[Alfred Agache (architect)|Alfred Agache]], cofounder of the [[French Society for Urban Studies]], was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a star of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. The plan was too expensive to complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/Paginas/ENG/Default.aspx?idf=532&servico=40 |title=Prefeitura ENG |publisher=Curitiba.pr.gov.br |accessdate=22 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s, Curitiba's population had reached 430,000. Some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to damage the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect [[Jaime Lerner]], who later became mayor, led a team from the [[Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1]] that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, reduced traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector and a convenient and affordable public transit system.<ref>[http://www.mcachicago.org/massivechange/timelines/urban.pdf About Curitiba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125170008/http://mcachicago.org/massivechange/timelines/urban.pdf |date=25 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThis plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed [[Rua XV de Novembro|XV de Novembro St.]] to vehicles, because it had high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This used two one-way streets moving in opposite directions that surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have an exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges on the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density development, to pull traffic away from the main roads. In a number of areas subject to floods, buildings were condemned and the land became parks.<ref>[http://www.pescacommosca.com.br/noticia/lernoticia.php?IdtNoticia=869 Parks of Curitiba and floods]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012061522/http://www.pescacommosca.com.br/noticia/lernoticia.php?IdtNoticia=869 |date=12 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nToday, Curitiba is considered one of the world's best examples of urban planning.<ref>Iraz\u00e1bal, Clara Elena (2002) ''Curitiba and Portland: Architecture, City Making, and Urban Governance in the Era of Globalization'', PhD Dissertation in Architecture, University of California, Berkeley, p.112</ref> In June 1996, the chairman of the [[Habitat II]] summit of mayors and urban planners in [[Istanbul]] praised Curitiba as \"the most innovative city in the country.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-44782001000100007&script=sci_arttext |title=Curitiba \u2013 urban plannig |doi=10.1590/S0104-44782001000100007 |publisher=Scielo.br |date=31 March 1993 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104201952/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-44782001000100007&script=sci_arttext |archive-date=4 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n[[File:Rua xv curitiba.jpg|thumb|right|180px|15 November Street.]]\nCuritiba was recently recommended by [[UNESCO]] as a model for the reconstruction of the cities of [[Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"afghjp\">{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u30af\u30ea\u30c1\u30d0\u3082\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\uff1d\u30ab\u30d6\u30fc\u30eb\u5fa9\u8208\u8a08\u753b\u306b\u53c2\u52a0 |publisher=Nikkey Shimbun|language=Japanese |accessdate=21 October 2008 |url=http://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/020615-24brasil.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103064150/http://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/020615-24brasil.html |archivedate=3 November 2004}}</ref> In the 1980s, the RIT ([[Rede Integrada de Transporte]], ''Integrated Transport Network'') was created.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.urbs.curitiba.pr.gov.br/PORTAL/historiadotransportecoletivo.php |title=RIT Curitiba \u2013 Trajetory |publisher=Urbs.curitiba.pr.gov.br |accessdate=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706155916/http://www.urbs.curitiba.pr.gov.br/PORTAL/historiadotransportecoletivo.php |archive-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the same time, the city began building the \"Far\u00f3is de Saber\" (''Lighthouses of Knowledge'') educational centres.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmc.pr.gov.br/ass_det.php?not=7004 |title=Social programs in the city |publisher=Cmc.pr.gov.br |date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522092748/http://www.cmc.pr.gov.br/ass_det.php?not=7004 |archive-date=22 May 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city has more than {{convert|400|km2|0|abbr=out}} of public parks and forests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenplanetmonitor.net/news/2012/12/curitiba-sustainable-city/|title=Curitiba \u2013 Sustainable City|last=Anil Mundra|date=27 December 2012|publisher=Green Planet Monitor|accessdate=19 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423054904/http://www.greenplanetmonitor.net/news/2012/12/curitiba-sustainable-city/|archive-date=23 April 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the city placed third in a list of \"15 Green Cities\" in the world, according to ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]'' magazine, after [[Reykjav\u00edk]] in Iceland and [[Portland, Oregon]] in the United States.

Based on 1991 traveler survey results, it was estimated that the introduction of the BRT had caused a reduction of about 27&nbsp;million auto trips per year, annually saving about 27&nbsp;million liters of fuel. In particular, 28 percent of BRT riders previously traveled by car. Compared to eight other Brazilian cities of its size, Curitiba uses about 30 percent less fuel per capita, resulting in one of the country's lowest rates of ambient air pollution. Some 1,100 buses make 12,500 trips every day, serving more than 1.3&nbsp;million passengers, 50 times the number from 20 years ago. Eighty percent of travelers use the express or direct bus services.

The centro (downtown or central business district), where the city was founded, is the most bustling area, housing most of the financial institutions of Curitiba.\n\n''Bairros'' (neighborhoods) of Curitiba define the city's geographical divisions. Administrative powers are not delegated to neighborhoods, although neighborhood associations work to improve their communities.\nCuritiba is divided into 9 regional governments (boroughs) covering the 75 neighborhoods.\n\nCivic Center (In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Centro C\u00edvico)'' is where the main government buildings are located. It was the first neighborhood in the municipality of Curitiba, capital of the state of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]]. The name means 'Center of the Citizen', or with a more direct interpretation, 'center where the subjects related to the citizen are solved'.

New equipment was brought into the country from overseas. Two additional laboratories began testing for the virus in mid-April: the [[Enfer]] facility in [[Sallins]], [[County Kildare]], and the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine]]'s laboratory in [[Backweston]].

After achieving independence from the [[Iberians|Iberian]] crowns in the early nineteenth century, the Argentine Republic and the [[Brazilian Empire]] inherited a series of unresolved territorial disputes from their colonial powers, involving [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]], the other two nations of the R\u00edo de la Plata basin.\n[[File:Juncal MuratureJose 1865.png|thumb|left|250px|The battle of Juncal, during the [[Cisplatine War]].]]\n\nIt was during this time that the [[Cisplatine War]], the first armed conflict between both countries, started. From 1825 to 1828 the forces of the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] outfought those of the Brazilian Empire, until the signing of the [[1828 Treaty of Montevideo|Treaty of Montevideo]] that gave independence to Uruguay from both countries. Given the high cost of the war for both sides and the burdens it imposed on trade between the United Provinces and the United Kingdom, the latter pressed the two belligerent parties to engage in peace negotiations in Rio de Janeiro. Under British and French mediation, the United Provinces of River Plate and the Empire of Brazil signed the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo, which acknowledged the independence of the Cisplatine Province under the name Eastern Republic of Uruguay. Troops of both countries would face each other once again later, during the [[Platine War]], when a coalition of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentine rebels managed to defeat Rosas (helped in turn by Uruguayan rebels led by [[Manuel Oribe]]). Another war almost happened during the 1870s when Brazil refused to accept Argentina's desire to take all the Chaco region for itself after the end of the [[Paraguayan War]] (also known as the War of the Triple Alliance) when both countries were allies against Paraguay.\n\nBrazil did not settle disputes with Argentina over its precise national boundaries until the early twentieth century. It had settled with Uruguay in 1851, with Peru in 1851 and 1874, with Colombia in 1853, with Venezuela in 1859, with Bolivia in 1867 and with Paraguay in 1872,<ref>Vainfas, Ronaldo. Dicion\u00e1rio do Brasil Imperial. Rio de Janeiro: Objetiva, 2002, p. 302</ref> but not with Argentina, Guyana, French Guyana and Suriname. However, it had consolidated most of its vast territory under a single authority by the middle of the nineteenth century, achieved as the result of the work of the empire's political [[elite]].\nIn contrast, the Argentine Republic's nineteenth century experience was marked by infighting between contending factions\u2014those favoring a [[Federales (Argentina)|federalist]] republic\u2014struggling against the strong centralist tendencies of the city of [[Buenos Aires]] ([[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]]). Argentina's unification and territorial consolidation under a single authority was completed by the 1880s.\n\n===Consolidated states===\n[[Image:Alegor\u00eda Brasil y Argentina.jpg|thumb|200px|This 1890 allegoric drawing depicts the friendship between the Argentine Republic and the newly formed Brazilian Republic.]]\nDespite this inheritance of unresolved territorial disputes and numerous periods of muted hostility, the Argentine\u2013Brazilian relationship was not defined by open hostility for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There was competition on many levels, and their respective defense policies reflected mutual suspicion, but their [[bilateralism|bilateral relationship]] was not adversarial. After the mid-1850s, neither country resorted to coercion or the use of force to resolve territorial disputes, and during the only general war that took place in the Plata region\u2013 the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864\u20131870)\u2013 Argentina and Brazil were allied against Paraguay.\n\nNonetheless, at later part of 19th century, concerns from Argentina over Brazil's possible imperialistic ambition remained, as well as Brazil's close commercial tie with [[Chile]], the rival of Argentina. Fear from possible Brazilian intervention in support for Chile amidst the [[War of the Pacific]] had led to Argentina maintaining status quo with Brazil.\n\n===Twentieth Century===\n{{see also|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[Image:Campos Salles, General Julio Roca e o Bar\u00e3o do Rio Branco em viagem \u00e0 Petr\u00f3polis, 1907.jpg|thumb|200px|Visit of the President of Argentina, General [[Julio Argentino Roca]], Brazil, March, 1907.]]\n\nIn Brazil, the liberal revolution of 1930 overthrew the oligarchic coffee plantation owners and brought to power an urban middle class that and business interests that promoted industrialization and modernization.  Aggressive promotion of new industry turned around the economy by 1933.  Brazil's leaders in the 1920s and 1930s decided that Argentina's implicit foreign policy goal was to isolate Portuguese-speaking Brazil from Spanish-speaking neighbors, thus facilitating the expansion of Argentine economic and political influence in South America.  Even worse, was the fear that a more powerful Argentine Army would launch a surprise attack on the weaker Brazilian Army. To counter this threat, President [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] forged closer links with the United States. Meanwhile, Argentina moved in the opposite direction. During World War II, Brazil was a staunch ally of the United States and sent its military to Europe. The United States provided over $100 million in [[Lend-Lease]] grants, in return for free rent on air bases used to transport American soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic, and naval bases for anti-submarine operations.  In sharp contrast, Argentina was officially neutral and at times favored Germany.<ref>Stanley E. Hilton, \"The Argentine Factor in Twentieth-Century Brazilian Foreign Policy Strategy.\" ''Political Science Quarterly'' 100.1 (1985): 27-51.</ref><ref>Stanley E. Hilton, \"Brazilian Diplomacy and the Washington-Rio de Janeiro 'Axis' during the World War II Era,\" ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' (1979) 59#2 pp. 201-231 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2514412 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCommunication and physical integration between the two neighbors was limited. The benefits of developing closer economic, political, and cultural relations were not considered until late in the 20th century.\n \nSince 1945, the most acrimonious bilateral dispute concerned the control of water resources along the [[Paran\u00e1 River|Alto Paran\u00e1]] basin. In 1966, Brazil and Paraguay concluded the ''Igua\u00e7u Act'', announcing their intention to build a Brazilian\u2013Paraguayan [[hydroelectric plant]], [[Itaip\u00fa dam]], on the Paran\u00e1 River, on the Argentina\u2013Brazil\u2013Paraguay border. The [[Treaty of Itaip\u00fa]] was signed in [[Bras\u00edlia]] in 1973. However, Buenos Aires feared that Brazil's project would hinder its own plans for the water resources development in the area. For almost a decade, the dispute soured bilateral relations and hampered efforts to forge closer economic and political links.\n<!-- missing military governments, [[Operation Condor]] -->\n\nThe dispute over water resources was finally resolved by intense diplomatic negotiations. In October 1979, the Itaip\u00fa\u2013Corpus Multilateral Treaty on Technical Cooperation was concluded, ending the dispute to the satisfaction of all three neighbors and opening the way for a dramatic improvement in relations. After the conclusion of the Itaipu\u2013Corpus Treaty, Brazilian president [[Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo]] visited Argentina, the first Brazilian leader to do so in more than four decades.\n\nFigueiredo, the last president of the military rulers who had governed Brazil for 21 years, visited Buenos Aires in May 1980 and signed, among other agreements, a series of accords to collaborate on [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] issues. Reflecting their shared opposition to the [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear non-proliferation]] regime, Argentina and Brazil agreed to co-operate and exchange technical information, materials, and products on all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle.\n\nFollowing the resolution of the water resources dispute and the Brazilian president's successful visit, an unexpected and traumatic event took place in Argentina that further improved bilateral relations: the 1982 [[Falklands War]].\n\n====Falklands War====\n\nThree years after calling off the [[Operation Soberania]] in order to invade the [[Beagle Channel cartography since 1881|Picton, Nueva and Lennox]] islands, Argentina invaded the [[Falkland Islands]] ({{lang-es|Islas Malvinas|links=no}}) in April 1982, starting a brief but important war with the United Kingdom. Brazil supported the Argentine claim over the Falkland Islands:\n{{quote|After reviewing the issue regarding the Falkland Islands, His Excellency the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil expressed the support of his Government to the Argentine Republic, reaffirming his belief that the negotiations in progress will yield satisfactory results within a brief amount of time.|[[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of External Relations of Brazil]]<ref>[[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of External Relations]].

The crew sent a \"Mayday\" signal, jettisoned classified documents, and attempted to ditch its missile armament, but all bar one malfunctioned and remained on the pylons.

However, the remaining [[Sidewinder missile|Sidewinder]] and [[AGM-45 Shrike]] missiles on board the aircraft were confiscated by the Brazilian authorities.\nAfter hostilities ended in June 1982, Buenos Aires chose Brazil to [[protecting power|represent its interests]] in London until full [[diplomatic relations]] with United Kingdom were restored in 1990. Thus, despite rivalry and historical suspicions, Brazil's actions and policies during the most traumatic period of Argentina's recent history\u2014objectionable military rule, near-conflict with Chile and the Falklands War\u2014were fundamental to build trust between the two countries.\n\n[[File:Argentina-Brazil border.jpg|thumb|200px|International border between Argentina (Puerto Iguaz\u00fa) and Brazil (Foz do Igua\u00e7\u00fa)]]\nArgentina's defeat in the war against Britain hastened the end of its domestic military rule. General elections were held in October 1983, and President [[Raul Alfons\u00edn]] was elected with a mandate to ensure that Argentina's recent past was not repeated. Among his main achievements, President Alfons\u00edn started to resolve the enduring territorial conflict with Chile during his six-year term, and significantly improved relations with Brazil.\n\nArgentina's intention to forge a closer relationship with Brazil was matched by Brazil's intention to do the same. While still under [[dictatorship|military rule]], Brazil initiated a policy of improving relations with its South American neighbors, and Argentina was considered the key country in this effort. The initiative was accelerated after 1985 when [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney]], became the first civilian president of Brazil since 1964. Soon after taking power, President Sarney met with President Alfons\u00edn, and thereafter a series of diplomatic initiatives and presidential visits took place. The aim of these exchanges was to deepen the process of cultural, political, and economic rapprochement between Argentina and Brazil.\n\n====Democratization (1985)====\n\nAfter democratization, a strong integration and partnership began between the two countries. In 1985 they signed the basis for the [[Mercosur]], a regional [[trade pact|trade agreement]].\n\nIn the field of science, the two regional giants had been rivals since the 1950s when both governments launched parallel nuclear and space programs, however, several agreements were signed since then such as the creation of the [[Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials]] (ABACC) to verify both countries' pledges to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes.\n\nAlso on the military side there has been greater rapprochement. In accordance with the friendship policy, both armies dissolved or moved major units previously located at their common border  (e.g. [[Argentine Army|Argentine]]'s 7th Jungle and 3rd Motorized Infantry Brigades). Brazilian soldiers are embedded in the Argentine [[peacekeeping]] contingent at [[UNFICYP]] in [[Cyprus]] and they are working together at [[MINUSTAH]] in [[Haiti]] and, as another example of collaboration, [[Argentine Navy]] aircraft routinely operates from the [[Brazilian Navy]] carrier [[NAe S\u00e3o Paulo]].\n\n===Recent years===\n[[File:Dilma Rousseff e Cristina Kirchner em 2015.jpg|left|thumb|295x295px|Former [[President of Brazil]], [[Dilma Rousseff|Dilma Rouseff]], and former [[President of Argentina|Argentine president]] [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner|Cristina Kirchner]], in 2015]]\nThe [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] administration placed Brazil as a foreign policy priority and relations with Brazil were considered strategic.<ref name=\"Vadell\">[https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/358/35849111.pdf A Pol\u00edtica Internacional, a Conjuntura Econ\u00f4mica e a Argentina de N\u00e9stor Kirchner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923061406/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/358/35849111.pdf |date=2012-09-23 }} Vadell, Javier Alberto.

After achieving independence from the [[Iberians|Iberian]] crowns in the early nineteenth century, the Argentine Republic and the [[Brazilian Empire]] inherited a series of unresolved territorial disputes from their colonial powers, involving [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]], the other two nations of the R\u00edo de la Plata basin.\n[[File:Juncal MuratureJose 1865.png|thumb|left|250px|The battle of Juncal, during the [[Cisplatine War]].]]\n\nIt was during this time that the [[Cisplatine War]], the first armed conflict between both countries, started. From 1825 to 1828 the forces of the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] outfought those of the Brazilian Empire, until the signing of the [[1828 Treaty of Montevideo|Treaty of Montevideo]] that gave independence to Uruguay from both countries. Given the high cost of the war for both sides and the burdens it imposed on trade between the United Provinces and the United Kingdom, the latter pressed the two belligerent parties to engage in peace negotiations in Rio de Janeiro. Under British and French mediation, the United Provinces of River Plate and the Empire of Brazil signed the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo, which acknowledged the independence of the Cisplatine Province under the name Eastern Republic of Uruguay. Troops of both countries would face each other once again later, during the [[Platine War]], when a coalition of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentine rebels managed to defeat Rosas (helped in turn by Uruguayan rebels led by [[Manuel Oribe]]). Another war almost happened during the 1870s when Brazil refused to accept Argentina's desire to take all the Chaco region for itself after the end of the [[Paraguayan War]] (also known as the War of the Triple Alliance) when both countries were allies against Paraguay.\n\nBrazil did not settle disputes with Argentina over its precise national boundaries until the early twentieth century. It had settled with Uruguay in 1851, with Peru in 1851 and 1874, with Colombia in 1853, with Venezuela in 1859, with Bolivia in 1867 and with Paraguay in 1872,<ref>Vainfas, Ronaldo. Dicion\u00e1rio do Brasil Imperial. Rio de Janeiro: Objetiva, 2002, p. 302</ref> but not with Argentina, Guyana, French Guyana and Suriname. However, it had consolidated most of its vast territory under a single authority by the middle of the nineteenth century, achieved as the result of the work of the empire's political [[elite]].\nIn contrast, the Argentine Republic's nineteenth century experience was marked by infighting between contending factions\u2014those favoring a [[Federales (Argentina)|federalist]] republic\u2014struggling against the strong centralist tendencies of the city of [[Buenos Aires]] ([[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]]). Argentina's unification and territorial consolidation under a single authority was completed by the 1880s.\n\n===Consolidated states===\n[[Image:Alegor\u00eda Brasil y Argentina.jpg|thumb|200px|This 1890 allegoric drawing depicts the friendship between the Argentine Republic and the newly formed Brazilian Republic.]]\nDespite this inheritance of unresolved territorial disputes and numerous periods of muted hostility, the Argentine\u2013Brazilian relationship was not defined by open hostility for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There was competition on many levels, and their respective defense policies reflected mutual suspicion, but their [[bilateralism|bilateral relationship]] was not adversarial. After the mid-1850s, neither country resorted to coercion or the use of force to resolve territorial disputes, and during the only general war that took place in the Plata region\u2013 the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864\u20131870)\u2013 Argentina and Brazil were allied against Paraguay.\n\nNonetheless, at later part of 19th century, concerns from Argentina over Brazil's possible imperialistic ambition remained, as well as Brazil's close commercial tie with [[Chile]], the rival of Argentina. Fear from possible Brazilian intervention in support for Chile amidst the [[War of the Pacific]] had led to Argentina maintaining status quo with Brazil.\n\n===Twentieth Century===\n{{see also|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[Image:Campos Salles, General Julio Roca e o Bar\u00e3o do Rio Branco em viagem \u00e0 Petr\u00f3polis, 1907.jpg|thumb|200px|Visit of the President of Argentina, General [[Julio Argentino Roca]], Brazil, March, 1907.]]\n\nIn Brazil, the liberal revolution of 1930 overthrew the oligarchic coffee plantation owners and brought to power an urban middle class that and business interests that promoted industrialization and modernization.  Aggressive promotion of new industry turned around the economy by 1933.  Brazil's leaders in the 1920s and 1930s decided that Argentina's implicit foreign policy goal was to isolate Portuguese-speaking Brazil from Spanish-speaking neighbors, thus facilitating the expansion of Argentine economic and political influence in South America.  Even worse, was the fear that a more powerful Argentine Army would launch a surprise attack on the weaker Brazilian Army. To counter this threat, President [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] forged closer links with the United States. Meanwhile, Argentina moved in the opposite direction. During World War II, Brazil was a staunch ally of the United States and sent its military to Europe. The United States provided over $100 million in [[Lend-Lease]] grants, in return for free rent on air bases used to transport American soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic, and naval bases for anti-submarine operations.  In sharp contrast, Argentina was officially neutral and at times favored Germany.<ref>Stanley E. Hilton, \"The Argentine Factor in Twentieth-Century Brazilian Foreign Policy Strategy.\" ''Political Science Quarterly'' 100.1 (1985): 27-51.</ref><ref>Stanley E. Hilton, \"Brazilian Diplomacy and the Washington-Rio de Janeiro 'Axis' during the World War II Era,\" ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' (1979) 59#2 pp. 201-231 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2514412 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCommunication and physical integration between the two neighbors was limited. The benefits of developing closer economic, political, and cultural relations were not considered until late in the 20th century.\n \nSince 1945, the most acrimonious bilateral dispute concerned the control of water resources along the [[Paran\u00e1 River|Alto Paran\u00e1]] basin. In 1966, Brazil and Paraguay concluded the ''Igua\u00e7u Act'', announcing their intention to build a Brazilian\u2013Paraguayan [[hydroelectric plant]], [[Itaip\u00fa dam]], on the Paran\u00e1 River, on the Argentina\u2013Brazil\u2013Paraguay border. The [[Treaty of Itaip\u00fa]] was signed in [[Bras\u00edlia]] in 1973. However, Buenos Aires feared that Brazil's project would hinder its own plans for the water resources development in the area. For almost a decade, the dispute soured bilateral relations and hampered efforts to forge closer economic and political links.\n<!-- missing military governments, [[Operation Condor]] -->\n\nThe dispute over water resources was finally resolved by intense diplomatic negotiations. In October 1979, the Itaip\u00fa\u2013Corpus Multilateral Treaty on Technical Cooperation was concluded, ending the dispute to the satisfaction of all three neighbors and opening the way for a dramatic improvement in relations. After the conclusion of the Itaipu\u2013Corpus Treaty, Brazilian president [[Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo]] visited Argentina, the first Brazilian leader to do so in more than four decades.\n\nFigueiredo, the last president of the military rulers who had governed Brazil for 21 years, visited Buenos Aires in May 1980 and signed, among other agreements, a series of accords to collaborate on [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] issues. Reflecting their shared opposition to the [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear non-proliferation]] regime, Argentina and Brazil agreed to co-operate and exchange technical information, materials, and products on all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle.\n\nFollowing the resolution of the water resources dispute and the Brazilian president's successful visit, an unexpected and traumatic event took place in Argentina that further improved bilateral relations: the 1982 [[Falklands War]].\n\n====Falklands War====\n\nThree years after calling off the [[Operation Soberania]] in order to invade the [[Beagle Channel cartography since 1881|Picton, Nueva and Lennox]] islands, Argentina invaded the [[Falkland Islands]] ({{lang-es|Islas Malvinas|links=no}}) in April 1982, starting a brief but important war with the United Kingdom. Brazil supported the Argentine claim over the Falkland Islands:\n{{quote|After reviewing the issue regarding the Falkland Islands, His Excellency the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil expressed the support of his Government to the Argentine Republic, reaffirming his belief that the negotiations in progress will yield satisfactory results within a brief amount of time.|[[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of External Relations of Brazil]]<ref>[[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of External Relations]].

The Vulcan was intercepted by Brazilian [[Northrop F-5|F-5 Tiger II]] jets and escorted to the [[Gale\u00e3o Air Force Base]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where the crew and aircraft were interned.<ref>[http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/mongsoft/black_buck_page.htm Operation Black Buck]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/datas/fab/aeronaves.html F-5 Tiger II] IBGE.gov.br.

However, the remaining [[Sidewinder missile|Sidewinder]] and [[AGM-45 Shrike]] missiles on board the aircraft were confiscated by the Brazilian authorities.\nAfter hostilities ended in June 1982, Buenos Aires chose Brazil to [[protecting power|represent its interests]] in London until full [[diplomatic relations]] with United Kingdom were restored in 1990. Thus, despite rivalry and historical suspicions, Brazil's actions and policies during the most traumatic period of Argentina's recent history\u2014objectionable military rule, near-conflict with Chile and the Falklands War\u2014were fundamental to build trust between the two countries.\n\n[[File:Argentina-Brazil border.jpg|thumb|200px|International border between Argentina (Puerto Iguaz\u00fa) and Brazil (Foz do Igua\u00e7\u00fa)]]\nArgentina's defeat in the war against Britain hastened the end of its domestic military rule. General elections were held in October 1983, and President [[Raul Alfons\u00edn]] was elected with a mandate to ensure that Argentina's recent past was not repeated. Among his main achievements, President Alfons\u00edn started to resolve the enduring territorial conflict with Chile during his six-year term, and significantly improved relations with Brazil.\n\nArgentina's intention to forge a closer relationship with Brazil was matched by Brazil's intention to do the same. While still under [[dictatorship|military rule]], Brazil initiated a policy of improving relations with its South American neighbors, and Argentina was considered the key country in this effort. The initiative was accelerated after 1985 when [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney]], became the first civilian president of Brazil since 1964. Soon after taking power, President Sarney met with President Alfons\u00edn, and thereafter a series of diplomatic initiatives and presidential visits took place. The aim of these exchanges was to deepen the process of cultural, political, and economic rapprochement between Argentina and Brazil.\n\n====Democratization (1985)====\n\nAfter democratization, a strong integration and partnership began between the two countries. In 1985 they signed the basis for the [[Mercosur]], a regional [[trade pact|trade agreement]].\n\nIn the field of science, the two regional giants had been rivals since the 1950s when both governments launched parallel nuclear and space programs, however, several agreements were signed since then such as the creation of the [[Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials]] (ABACC) to verify both countries' pledges to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes.\n\nAlso on the military side there has been greater rapprochement. In accordance with the friendship policy, both armies dissolved or moved major units previously located at their common border  (e.g. [[Argentine Army|Argentine]]'s 7th Jungle and 3rd Motorized Infantry Brigades). Brazilian soldiers are embedded in the Argentine [[peacekeeping]] contingent at [[UNFICYP]] in [[Cyprus]] and they are working together at [[MINUSTAH]] in [[Haiti]] and, as another example of collaboration, [[Argentine Navy]] aircraft routinely operates from the [[Brazilian Navy]] carrier [[NAe S\u00e3o Paulo]].\n\n===Recent years===\n[[File:Dilma Rousseff e Cristina Kirchner em 2015.jpg|left|thumb|295x295px|Former [[President of Brazil]], [[Dilma Rousseff|Dilma Rouseff]], and former [[President of Argentina|Argentine president]] [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner|Cristina Kirchner]], in 2015]]\nThe [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] administration placed Brazil as a foreign policy priority and relations with Brazil were considered strategic.<ref name=\"Vadell\">[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/358/35849111.pdf A Pol\u00edtica Internacional, a Conjuntura Econ\u00f4mica e a Argentina de N\u00e9stor Kirchner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923061406/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/358/35849111.pdf |date=2012-09-23 }} Vadell, Javier Alberto.

The artist has, for example, used a pre-existing drawing or art work which he has magnified, while often focussing on amplifying a specific detail<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=H\u00fcgli|first=Pierre|date=October and November 2018|title=Quand Florian Froehlich d\u00e9poussi\u00e8re la Renaissance|url=http://www.pharts.ch/index.php/sommaire/47-pharts-136/557-delemont|journal=ph+arts|volume=136|pages=7|via=}}</ref> .

The spirit of the Renaissance pervades his work: the intellectual excursion into [[humanism]], a perfect mastery of the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and the magic that is beauty. Froehlich rejuvenates this era with an artistic vision which is both new and contemporary.\n[[File:Sign up with heaven.jpg|thumb|'''Sign up with heaven'''.

[[Peter Paul Rubens|Peter-Paul Rubens]] took up the subject of this sketch during the following century, reworking it in his manner. What liberty this inter-inspiration between artists permits!

The artist has for example used a pre-existing drawing or art work which he has magnified, while often focussing on amplifying a specific detail<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=H\u00fcgli|first=Pierre|date=October and November 2018|title=Quand Florian Froehlich d\u00e9poussi\u00e8re la Renaissance|url=http://www.pharts.ch/index.php/sommaire/47-pharts-136/557-delemont|journal=ph+arts|volume=136|pages=7|via=}}</ref> . This has given his compositions an amplitude and a liberty which bring them into line with the spirit of our times<ref name=\":0\" /> , using a multitude of techniques: pencil, charcoal, water colour, collage, acrylics and even [[encaustic painting]], &nbsp;a very ancient technique using beeswax. The spirit of the Renaissance pervades his work: the intellectual excursion into [[humanism]], a perfect mastery of the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and the magic that is beauty. Froehlich rejuvenates this era with an artistic vision which is both new and contemporary.\n[[File:Sign up with heaven.jpg|thumb|'''Sign up with heaven'''.

[[Peter Paul Rubens|Peter-Paul Rubens]] took up the subject of this sketch during the following century, reworking it in his manner. What liberty this inter-inspiration between artists permits!

''[[Gadaria]]'' is another word that may have the same origin. In the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]] of western Gujarat they exist as two [[endogamy|endogamous]] groups, known as the Mota Bhai (Motabhai) and the Nana Bhai (Nanabhai). According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]]'s ''People of India'' series, Bharwads in the Saurashtra region often append ''[[Ahir]]'' to their names, while in south Gujarat it is common to see ''[[Patel]]'' appended.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Bharwads consider themselves to be descended from the mythological [[Nandvanshi]] line that began with [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], the foster-father of [[Krishna]]. Legend has it that Nanda came from [[Gokul]], in [[Mathura district]], and passed through Saurashtra on his way to [[Dwarka]].{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}} According to their traditions, the Bharwads were at some time based around [[Mathura]] and migrated to [[Mewar]] before later spreading out in Gujarat.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Sudipta Mitra considers their move to Gujarat to have been predicated by a desire to keep away from the [[Muslim]] invasion of [[Sind]]. They arrived in the northern town of [[Banaskantha]] in 961 CE and later spread out to Saurashtra and other areas.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}\n\nThere are other theories of origin. These include that they are an offshoot of the [[Bharude]] cattle-herders of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and that they are descendants of Anavil Bharwad, who helped a [[Chavda]] prince regain his kingdom. It is also possible that they are related to the Ahirs of Gujarat, with whom they share a common traditional occupation.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Divisions ==\nOf the various reasons given for the division between Motabhai and Nanabhai, the most popular is that two shepherd brothers were ordered by [[Krishna]] to take their flocks to different places. The older of the brothers went on to marry a Bharwad woman while the other married a [[Koli people|Koli]]. Since the latter was a marriage outside the community, the offspring were deemed to be [[untouchability|ritually polluted]]. Thus the Motabhai (literally, \"big brother\") descend from the first and the Nanabhai (\"little brother\") from the latter.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=147|ps=}}\n\nThe Bharwads have numerous subgroups known as ''ataks'' or ''guls'' (clans) whose main purpose is to determine eligibility for marriage. A constrained [[exogamy]] is practised between clans{{efn|For example, the Rathadia, Jadav and Yadav clans of the Mota Bhai consider that they are socially superior to the other clans and will only marry between themselves.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}}} but endogamy exists between the two Saurashtrian divisions despite there being no other social constraints on mixing.

Motabhai clothing was made from thicker wool than that of the Nanabhai, leading to the two groups referring to themselves as \"thick cloth\" and \"thin cloth\". The veil was dyed black and bore red dots if the woman was a Motabhai and yellow if she was Nanabhai. While the styles and colours remain similar, modern Bharwad women use [[man-made fibre]]s, such as [[polyester]], and cotton. This change may be in part because the modern materials are of finer texture but it is more likely than it came about because of their relative cheapness.

''[[Gadaria]]'' is another word that may have the same origin. In the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]] of western Gujarat they exist as two [[endogamy|endogamous]] groups, known as the Mota Bhai (Motabhai) and the Nana Bhai (Nanabhai). According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]]'s ''People of India'' series, Bharwads in the Saurashtra region often append ''[[Ahir]]'' to their names, while in south Gujarat it is common to see ''[[Patel]]'' appended.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Bharwads consider themselves to be descended from the mythological [[Nandvanshi]] line that began with [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], the foster-father of [[Krishna]]. Legend has it that Nanda came from [[Gokul]], in [[Mathura district]], and passed through Saurashtra on his way to [[Dwarka]].{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}} According to their traditions, the Bharwads were at some time based around [[Mathura]] and migrated to [[Mewar]] before later spreading out in Gujarat.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Sudipta Mitra considers their move to Gujarat to have been predicated by a desire to keep away from the [[Muslim]] invasion of [[Sind]]. They arrived in the northern town of [[Banaskantha]] in 961 CE and later spread out to Saurashtra and other areas.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}\n\nThere are other theories of origin. These include that they are an offshoot of the [[Bharude]] cattle-herders of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and that they are descendants of Anavil Bharwad, who helped a [[Chavda]] prince regain his kingdom. It is also possible that they are related to the Ahirs of Gujarat, with whom they share a common traditional occupation.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Divisions ==\nOf the various reasons given for the division between Motabhai and Nanabhai, the most popular is that two shepherd brothers were ordered by [[Krishna]] to take their flocks to different places. The older of the brothers went on to marry a Bharwad woman while the other married a [[Koli people|Koli]]. Since the latter was a marriage outside the community, the offspring were deemed to be [[untouchability|ritually polluted]]. Thus the Motabhai (literally, \"big brother\") descend from the first and the Nanabhai (\"little brother\") from the latter.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=147|ps=}}\n\nThe Bharwads have numerous subgroups known as ''ataks'' or ''guls'' (clans) whose main purpose is to determine eligibility for marriage. A constrained [[exogamy]] is practised between clans{{efn|For example, the Rathadia, Jadav and Yadav clans of the Mota Bhai consider that they are socially superior to the other clans and will only marry between themselves.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}}} but endogamy exists between the two Saurashtrian divisions despite there being no other social constraints on mixing. The Saurashtra Bharwads also hold a higher status than those in the south and thus marriage between the two regional groups operates in one direction only: daughters of southern Bharwads can marry into the family of those from Saurashtra.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\nClans of the Mota Bhai Bharwads include the Babha, Bathela, Colthar, Dabi, Dhangia, Dharangia, Garia, Gomara, Jadav, Kathodi, Ker, Lambari, Matia, Mundhva, Pancha, Rathadia, Sania, Sasda, Tota and Yadav.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nAmong the Bharwad of south Gujarat, their main clans are the Chandulka, Dahika, Gundarya, Jodika, Kalwamia, Khohadya, Kuhadiya and Rokadka.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\n\n== Varna and socio-economic status ==\nThe [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system of Hinduism is a traditional ritual ranking system based on levels of purported religious purity.
