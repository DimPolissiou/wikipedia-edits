It consists of both the {{convert|20|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Mid-County Expressway''', locally referred to as the \"'''Blue Route'''\" (although no signs exist with that designation), through the suburban [[Philadelphia]]-area counties of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and the [[Toll road|tolled]], {{convert|110.6|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia metropolitan area]] with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Wyoming Valley]]. The Blue Route passes through suburban areas, while the Northeast Extension predominantly runs through rural areas of mountains, forest and farmland, with development closer to Philadelphia and in the Lehigh Valley and the Wyoming Valley. I-476 intersects many major roads including [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] (the [[Schuylkill Expressway]]) in [[West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|West Conshohocken]], Interstate 276 (the Pennsylvania Turnpike) in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]], [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]] near [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], and [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] near [[Hickory Run State Park]].\n\nAt its opening in the early 1970s, I-476 was a 4 mile long, 4-lane spur expressway connecting the Schuylkill Expressway with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. It significantly helped reduce congestion through King of Prussia and the Schuylkill Expressway as it provided a more direct link from the Main Line suburbs to the Northern suburbs and New Jersey. The highway was initially planned to connect down to I-95 in Delaware County, but due to environmental and local opposition, this portion did not open until 1990.\n\nIn 1996, the I-476 designation was affixed to the pre-existing Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, replacing '''Pennsylvania Route 9'''.  This was an older four lane pre Interstate limited access highway. Of earlier design, its cross section was very narrow, with only 10 feet between opposing lanes of traffic in places.  This extended I-476 north of Plymouth Meeting to Clarks Summit (near Scranton) as a part of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system.  The crown jewel of this expressway was a state-of-the-art three-level interchange, to connect the new I-476 with the older Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension. This provided direct access to both I-276 east and I-476 north, now on the Northeast Extension. The Northeast Extension served the Lehigh Valley at [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]], with connection to I-78, the southern bypass of Allentown/Bethlehem.  With the completion of the Northeast Extension, I-476 surpassed [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in Massachusetts as the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway, a record it will hold until the completion of [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|I-369]] in Texas.\n\nI-476 was widened to 6 lanes between I-76 and I-276 in 1990-1992. It was later widened to 6 lanes up to Lansdale between 2011-2017.\n\n<!--\nWhile proposed as early as 1929, the construction of the Mid-County Expressway did not begin until 1967 and was not completed until 1992 due to massive community and environmental opposition during the [[freeway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s, leading ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' to dub it \"the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history.\" In order to get the route through Delaware County, it was built with many environmental compromises such as a [[parkway]] design and four lanes south of the [[Pennsylvania Route 3]] interchange. The Mid-County Expressway received its \"Blue Route\" nickname from the chosen route through Delaware County on planning maps on which it was differentiated from the other proposed routes by its color.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] in [[Massachusetts]]), but it may someday be surpassed in length by [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|Interstate 369]] in [[Texas]]. In fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as [[Interstate 83]] in [[Maryland]] and Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 99]] in Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 12]] in [[Louisiana]], [[Interstate 19]] in [[Arizona]], [[Interstate 97]] in Maryland, and [[Interstate 2]] in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs. -->\n==Route description==\n\n===Blue Route===\n[[File:I-476 north of US 1.JPG|thumb|left|The Blue Route north of US 1.]]\nThe portion of Interstate 476 between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Pennsylvania Turnpike|Interstate 276]] runs north\u2013south through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] Counties and is officially known as the Mid-County Expressway and the Veterans Memorial Highway, as well as by the nickname the \"Blue Route\".

It consists of both the {{convert|20|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Mid-County Expressway''', locally referred to as the \"'''Blue Route'''\" (although no signs exist with that designation), through the suburban [[Philadelphia]]-area counties of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and the [[Toll road|tolled]], {{convert|110.6|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia metropolitan area]] with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Wyoming Valley]]. The Blue Route passes through suburban areas, while the Northeast Extension predominantly runs through rural areas of mountains, forest and farmland, with development closer to Philadelphia and in the Lehigh Valley and the Wyoming Valley. I-476 intersects many major roads including [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] (the [[Schuylkill Expressway]]) in [[West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|West Conshohocken]], Interstate 276 (the Pennsylvania Turnpike) in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]], [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]] near [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], and [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] near [[Hickory Run State Park]].\n\nAt its opening in the early 1970s, I-476 was a 4 mile long, 4-lane spur expressway connecting the Schuylkill Expressway with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. It significantly helped reduce congestion through King of Prussia and the Schuylkill Expressway as it provided a more direct link from the Main Line suburbs to the Northern suburbs and New Jersey. The highway was initially planned to connect down to I-95 in Delaware County, but due to environmental and local opposition, this portion did not open until 1990.\n\nIn 1996, the I-476 designation was affixed to the pre-existing Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, replacing '''Pennsylvania Route 9'''.  This was an older four lane pre Interstate limited access highway. Of earlier design, its cross section was very narrow, with only 10 feet between opposing lanes of traffic in places.  This extended I-476 north of Plymouth Meeting to Clarks Summit (near Scranton) as a part of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system.  The crown jewel of this expressway was a state-of-the-art three-level interchange, to connect the new I-476 with the older Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension. This provided direct access to both I-276 east and I-476 north, now on the Northeast Extension. The Northeast Extension served the Lehigh Valley at [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]], with connection to I-78, the southern bypass of Allentown/Bethlehem.  With the completion of the Northeast Extension, I-476 surpassed [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in Massachusetts as the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway, a record it will hold until the completion of [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|I-369]] in Texas.\n\nI-476 was widened to 6 lanes between I-76 and I-276 in 1990-1992. It was later widened to 6 lanes up to Lansdale between 2011-2017.\n\n<!--\nWhile proposed as early as 1929, the construction of the Mid-County Expressway did not begin until 1967 and was not completed until 1992 due to massive community and environmental opposition during the [[freeway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s, leading ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' to dub it \"the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history.\" In order to get the route through Delaware County, it was built with many environmental compromises such as a [[parkway]] design and four lanes south of the [[Pennsylvania Route 3]] interchange. The Mid-County Expressway received its \"Blue Route\" nickname from the chosen route through Delaware County on planning maps on which it was differentiated from the other proposed routes by its color.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] in [[Massachusetts]]), but it may someday be surpassed in length by [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|Interstate 369]] in [[Texas]]. In fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as [[Interstate 83]] in [[Maryland]] and Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 99]] in Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 12]] in [[Louisiana]], [[Interstate 19]] in [[Arizona]], [[Interstate 97]] in Maryland, and [[Interstate 2]] in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs. -->\n==Route description==\n\n===Blue Route===\n[[File:I-476 north of US 1.JPG|thumb|left|The Blue Route north of US 1.]]\nThe portion of Interstate 476 between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Pennsylvania Turnpike|Interstate 276]] runs north\u2013south through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] Counties and is officially known as the Mid-County Expressway and the Veterans Memorial Highway, as well as by the nickname the \"Blue Route\".

Wilson's early efforts to help others become sober were ineffective, prompting Silkworth to suggest that Wilson place less stress on religion and more on \"the science\" of treating alcoholism. Wilson's first success came during a business trip to Akron, Ohio, where he was introduced to Robert Smith, a surgeon and Oxford Group member who was unable to stay sober.

Rudy and Arthur L. Greil found that for an AA member to remain sober a high level of commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's [[world view|worldview]]. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension is an integral part of AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a ''quasi-religious organization''.<ref name=\"RUDY1989\">{{cite journal |last1=Rudy |first1=David R. |last2=Greil |first2=Arthur L. |title=Is Alcoholics Anonymous a Religious Organization?: Meditations on Marginality |volume=50 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=41\u201351 |doi=10.2307/3710917 |jstor=3710917 |journal=Sociological Analysis}}</ref>\n\n===Meetings===\nAA meetings are \"quasi-ritualized therapeutic sessions run by and for, alcoholics\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Dimensions of Alcoholics Anonymous: 1935\u20131965|journal=Substance Use & Misuse |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=509 |year=1969 |doi=10.3109/10826086909062033 |last1=Leach |first1=Barry |last2=Norris |first2=John L. |last3=Dancey |first3=Travis |last4=Bissell |first4=Leclair}}</ref> They are usually informal and often feature discussions with voluntary donations collected during meetings.

Wilson's early efforts to help others become sober were ineffective, prompting Silkworth to suggest that Wilson place less stress on religion and more on \"the science\" of treating alcoholism. Wilson's first success came during a business trip to Akron, Ohio, where he was introduced to Robert Smith, a surgeon and Oxford Group member who was unable to stay sober. After thirty days of working with Wilson, Smith drank his last drink on 10 June 1935, the date marked by AA for its anniversaries.{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=33}}\n\nThe first female member Florence Rankin joined AA in March 1937,<ref>{{cite book|author=Anonymous|title=Alcoholics Anonymous|year=1939|publisher=Works Publishing Company|location=New York|page=Original Manuscript p. 217}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bamuhigire|first=Oscar Bamwebaze|title=Healing power of self love: enhance your chances of recovery from addiction through the..|year=2009|publisher=Iuniverse Inc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-44010-137-3|page=x|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F1oJ4v82nx8C&pg=PR10&dq=A+Feminine+Victory+florence+rankin#v=onepage&q=A%20Feminine%20Victory%20florence%20rankin&f=false}}</ref> and the first non-Protestant member, a [[Roman Catholic]], joined in 1939.{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=47}} The first Black AA group was established in 1945 in Washington DC by Jim S., an African-American physician from Virginia.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Alcoholics Anonymous|publisher=AA World Services|year=1976|location=3rd. ed., New York|pages=483}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1233131|title=First black AA group to celebrate 70th anniversary today in Washington DC|last=Mustikhan|first=Ahmar|date=13 April 2015|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2020 global coronavirus pandemic]], many AA meetings moved to online meetings using platforms such as [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]], [[Google Hangouts]], and  conference calls.

Rudy and Arthur L. Greil found that for an AA member to remain sober a high level of commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's [[world view|worldview]]. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal.
