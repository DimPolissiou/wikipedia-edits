A woman named Xiangfei was sent to the prestigious Ling-Sheng Su Temple to learn the swordplay with the [[jian]]. Following her father's passing, Xiangfei forged a forbidden romance with Kong Xiuqiang, a monk who was to inherit of the holy [[Bo (weapon)|bo staff]], the Kali-Yuga. After their illegitimate oldest daughter, Xianglian, was taken from her parents on her second birthday, Xiangfei became too wrought with grief to remain at the temple. Han Dongxiu, their sworn brother, helped Xiuqiang sneak the holy Krita-Yuga sword to his lover, to serve as a promise the two would one day meet again. Xiangfei, pregnant with another girl, secretly left the temple to become a member of the [[Ming Dynasty]] secret Imperial Guard, the [[Jinyiwei]]. Months later, she gave birth to her youngest daughter, Xianghua, but never revealed anything about the girl's father or his lineage to her. By this time, the temple had found that Xiuqiang had stolen the Krita-Yuga and he was exiled, but Xianglian was to remain there to be trained as an orphan. Xiuqiang eventually discovered Xiangfei's whereabouts, but the Chai family asked him to leave her alone. As time passed, Xianghua had learned to use the Krita-Yuga just as well as her mother, and Xiangfei died after her 11th birthday. Five years afterward, Xianghua herself became a member of the Imperial Guard.\n\nPrior to the events of ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'', the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] became displeased with the search for the legendary \"Hero's Sword\" (really Soul Edge), so he sent members of his Guard to help the quest advance. The guards would travel undercover under the guise of a traveling [[Chinese opera|opera]] troupe, with Xianghua to be the main attraction. As Xianghua prepares for her journey, she recalls her mother's dying words that she was born to complete an important task and cut a path through an uncertain future. With her mother's keepsake jian, Xianghua left on her own after cutting her hair short. On her journey, she encounters a Ling-Sheng Su member [[list of Soulcalibur characters#Kilik|Kilik]] and a [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom|Ry\u016bky\u016b]] pirate [[list of Soulcalibur characters#Maxi|Maxi]]. Told of the sword's true evil nature by Kilik, she agrees to aid both of them in their quest to destroy it, not knowing that her long-lost older sister Xianglian had been accidentally killed by Kilik when he was consumed by a berserker-style rage. Together, they storm the evil-infested Ostrheinsburg Castle in Europe as Maxi stays behind and defeats [[Astaroth (Soulcalibur)|Astaroth]], disappearing soon after, while Kilik and Xianghua slay the demon hordes and reach Soul Edge. Kilik uses his Kali-Yuga to defeat [[Nightmare (Soulcalibur)|Nightmare]], but immediately afterward, Xianghua is pulled into an ethereal void to face [[Siegfried and Nightmare#Inferno|Inferno]]. Her weapon unveils herself as the holy sword and Xianghua defeats Inferno after a fierce struggle. As the void started to collapse, she carries Kilik out of it, though her sword is left behind. A mysterious man awards her with an unnamed jian in return for the great deed she has done. Xianghua keeps her role in Soul Edge's destruction secret and never reports it, but is stripped of her rank and reassigned to a menial position for her failure to retrieve the \"Hero's Sword\".\n\nFour years later (the timeline of ''[[Soulcalibur II]]'', ''[[Soulcalibur III]]'' and ''[[Soulcalibur IV]]''), news reach her that the Emperor destroyed and massacred [[Xi'an|Xiwei]], the center of government in the Empire's western territory under the public justification of a revolt, believing that the fortress had been withholding Soul Edge from him. He asks Xianghua to investigate the ruins as her experience could be useful in locating the sword. Though she believed that she had destroyed Soul Edge, pieces of it are rumored to exist in this place and so Xianghua decides to find every fragment and destroy them. She left on a second journey alone, convinced that this was a burden she has to bear after she failed to destroy Soul Edge completely the first time. During her adventure, Xianghua is reunited with Kilik, who is attacked and gravely injured by [[list of Soulcalibur characters#Zasalamel|Zasalamel]]. Xianghua takes him back to his home and, after leaving a letter for him, she departs seeking an old general whom [[list of Soulcalibur characters#Edge Master|Edge Master]] has arranged for her to meet. Training with the general, Xianghua's skills improve significantly but she is unable to shake off an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy due to her failure to help Kilik. On the general's sage advice, she then begins to train her mind to become more fluid and allow her heart to filter in both the good and the bad. After months of training, she feels that she was ready and bid farewell to the general, beginning her journey anew to fight by herself. While traveling west on the [[Silk Road]], she reunites with Kilik. Together they travel to India to find Maxi, but he does not join them. Xianghua swears to destroy the Soul Edge properly and once and for all.\n\nA few years later, Xianghua again reunites and connects with Kilik, but he considers this the result of an unfortunate destiny, and eventually disappears. Returning to her homeland with a broken heart, Xianghua realizes she is pregnant. However, her grandfather and patriarch of the Chai house is furious at this, as Xianghua is the second generation of women from such a distinguished family to bear the child of an unknown man, and she is ordered to kill the child and marry into another family. Xianghua is rescued by the heir of the Yan family, Yan Wujin, who issues a condition for marrying Xianghua and not revealing the scandal, to allow the child, a boy named [[List of Soulcalibur characters#Xiba|Xiba]], to live (Xiba was then raised by Kong Xiuqiang). She later gave Wujin a daughter named [[List of Soulcalibur characters#Leixia|Leixia]] (a ''[[Soulcalibur V]]'' character).\n\nA young Xianghua returns in the reboot game ''[[Soulcalibur VI]]''.\n\n=== Other ===\nIn the ''Soulcalibur'' manga adaptation, Xianghua meets Edge Master in the middle of her journey.<ref>''Soulcalibur Manga Comic'' Volume 2 (Act 10).</ref> Later, Xianghua and [[Li Long]]'s sister Meimei are forced to fight through a Lizardmen invasion of an Indian town and Meimei is killed in battle.

A woman named Xiangfei was sent to the prestigious Ling-Sheng Su Temple to learn the swordplay with the [[jian]]. Following her father's passing, Xiangfei forged a forbidden romance with Kong Xiuqiang, a monk who was to inherit of the holy [[Bo (weapon)|bo staff]], the Kali-Yuga. After their illegitimate oldest daughter, Xianglian, was taken from her parents on her second birthday, Xiangfei became too wrought with grief to remain at the temple. Han Dongxiu, their sworn brother, helped Xiuqiang sneak the holy Krita-Yuga sword to his lover, to serve as a promise the two would one day meet again. Xiangfei, pregnant with another girl, secretly left the temple to become a member of the [[Ming Dynasty]] secret Imperial Guard, the [[Jinyiwei]]. Months later, she gave birth to her youngest daughter, Xianghua, but never revealed anything about the girl's father or his lineage to her. By this time, the temple had found that Xiuqiang had stolen the Krita-Yuga and he was exiled, but Xianglian was to remain there to be trained as an orphan. Xiuqiang eventually discovered Xiangfei's whereabouts, but the Chai family asked him to leave her alone. As time passed, Xianghua had learned to use the Krita-Yuga just as well as her mother, and Xiangfei died after her 11th birthday. Five years afterward, Xianghua herself became a member of the Imperial Guard.\n\nPrior to the events of ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'', the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] became displeased with the search for the legendary \"Hero's Sword\" (really Soul Edge), so he sent members of his Guard to help the quest advance. The guards would travel undercover under the guise of a traveling [[Chinese opera|opera]] troupe, with Xianghua to be the main attraction. As Xianghua prepares for her journey, she recalls her mother's dying words that she was born to complete an important task and cut a path through an uncertain future. With her mother's keepsake jian, Xianghua left on her own after cutting her hair short. On her journey, she encounters a Ling-Sheng Su member [[list of Soulcalibur characters#Kilik|Kilik]] and a [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom|Ry\u016bky\u016b]] pirate [[list of Soulcalibur characters#Maxi|Maxi]]. Told of the sword's true evil nature by Kilik, she agrees to aid both of them in their quest to destroy it, not knowing that her long-lost older sister Xianglian had been accidentally killed by Kilik when he was consumed by a berserker-style rage. Together, they storm the evil-infested Ostrheinsburg Castle in Europe as Maxi stays behind and defeats [[Astaroth (Soulcalibur)|Astaroth]], disappearing soon after, while Kilik and Xianghua slay the demon hordes and reach Soul Edge. Kilik uses his Kali-Yuga to defeat [[Nightmare (Soulcalibur)|Nightmare]], but immediately afterward, Xianghua is pulled into an ethereal void to face [[Siegfried and Nightmare#Inferno|Inferno]]. Her weapon unveils herself as the holy sword and Xianghua defeats Inferno after a fierce struggle. As the void started to collapse, she carries Kilik out of it, though her sword is left behind. A mysterious man awards her with an unnamed jian in return for the great deed she has done. Xianghua keeps her role in Soul Edge's destruction secret and never reports it, but is stripped of her rank and reassigned to a menial position for her failure to retrieve the \"Hero's Sword\".\n\nFour years later (the timeline of ''[[Soulcalibur II]]'', ''[[Soulcalibur III]]'' and ''[[Soulcalibur IV]]''), news reach her that the Emperor destroyed and massacred [[Xi'an|Xiwei]], the center of government in the Empire's western territory under the public justification of a revolt, believing that the fortress had been withholding Soul Edge from him. He asks Xianghua to investigate the ruins as her experience could be useful in locating the sword. Though she believed that she had destroyed Soul Edge, pieces of it are rumored to exist in this place and so Xianghua decides to find every fragment and destroy them. She left on a second journey alone, convinced that this was a burden she has to bear after she failed to destroy Soul Edge completely the first time. During her adventure, Xianghua is reunited with Kilik, who is attacked and gravely injured by [[list of Soulcalibur characters#Zasalamel|Zasalamel]]. Xianghua takes him back to his home and, after leaving a letter for him, she departs seeking an old general whom [[list of Soulcalibur characters#Edge Master|Edge Master]] has arranged for her to meet. Training with the general, Xianghua's skills improve significantly but she is unable to shake off an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy due to her failure to help Kilik. On the general's sage advice, she then begins to train her mind to become more fluid and allow her heart to filter in both the good and the bad. After months of training, she feels that she was ready and bid farewell to the general, beginning her journey anew to fight by herself. While traveling west on the [[Silk Road]], she reunites with Kilik. Together they travel to India to find Maxi, but he does not join them. Xianghua swears to destroy the Soul Edge properly and once and for all.\n\nA few years later, Xianghua again reunites and connects with Kilik, but he considers this the result of an unfortunate destiny, and eventually disappears. Returning to her homeland with a broken heart, Xianghua realizes she is pregnant. However, her grandfather and patriarch of the Chai house is furious at this, as Xianghua is the second generation of women from such a distinguished family to bear the child of an unknown man, and she is ordered to kill the child and marry into another family. Xianghua is rescued by the heir of the Yan family, Yan Wujin, who issues a condition for marrying Xianghua and not revealing the scandal, to allow the child, a boy named [[List of Soulcalibur characters#Xiba|Xiba]], to live (Xiba was then raised by Kong Xiuqiang). She later gave Wujin a daughter named [[List of Soulcalibur characters#Leixia|Leixia]] (a ''[[Soulcalibur V]]'' character).\n\nA young Xianghua returns in the reboot game ''[[Soulcalibur VI]]''.\n\n=== Other ===\nIn the ''Soulcalibur'' manga adaptation, Xianghua meets Edge Master in the middle of her journey.<ref>''Soulcalibur Manga Comic'' Volume 2 (Act 10).</ref> Later, Xianghua and [[Li Long]]'s sister Meimei are forced to fight through a Lizardmen invasion of an Indian town and Meimei is killed in battle.

A study commission for the reform of the Pasteur Institute, made of [[\u00c9lie Wollman|Elie Wollman]], Ren\u00e9 Panthier and Bernard Virat was established. The study commission drafted a reorganization project which was implemented with the arrival of director Pierre Mercier. Panthier was appointed in 1966 as deputy director of the Pasteur Institute by director Pierre Mercier. He died on July 10, 1970 at the Pasteur Hospital in Paris at 55 from cancer.
