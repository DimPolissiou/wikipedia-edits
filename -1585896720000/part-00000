[[Queensland]] [[Separation of Queensland|separated]] from the [[Colony of New South Wales]] in 1859.\n\nThis is an awful website because you can just edit it \n\n==Indigenous people==\n50,000 to 60,000 years ago, Aboriginal people arrived in Australia by boat or by [[land bridge]]. The most likely route was from [[Southeast Asia]] across the [[Torres Strait]]. During the next ten thousand years, the Aboriginal people travelled over most of the continent.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\nAround 25,000 years ago, an [[ice age]] began with a rapid drop in the temperature of the earth of eight degrees. The climate changes lasted over 10,000 years. The land bridges from [[Southeast Asia]] and to [[Tasmania]] became inhospitable. Food was difficult to find and this led to the origin of seed-grinding technology.\n\nAbout 15,000 years ago, global temperatures warmed and rainfall increased along the eastern coast of Australia. The inland of Queensland, also receiving rainfall, again became habitable. Coastal lands decreased due to rising sea levels and tropical [[rain forest]]s spread. The Kalkadoon people of the inland central gulf region, dug wells 10m deep to maintain their supply of freshwater.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\nFrom 10,000 years until European arrival, the favourable warmer climate allowed the development of semi-permanent villages in the northern rainforests, the far western regions and around [[Moreton Bay]]. Along the [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]], and on the islands of Moreton Bay, large huts (djimurru), capable of housing thirty to forty people were built. However, due to recurrent droughts and floods, the dominant hunter-gatherer lifestyle persisted in most areas of Queensland.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\nThe peak Aboriginal population in Queensland prior to European arrival is uncertain. The number may have been between 200,000 and 500,000 people.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/> Numbers may have decreased at times of epidemics like [[smallpox]]. Rough calculations of the population can be made from the knowledge that Queensland supported 34.2 percent of the total number of tribes in Australia and from the knowledge that 35 to 39 percent of Australian aboriginal people lived in Queensland.<ref>\u00d8rsted-Jensen, Robert: ''Frontier History Revisited'', Brisbane 2011, p9-15.</ref> Queensland was the most densely populated region of the continent with two of the six to seven hundred Aboriginal nations and at least ninety language groups.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\n==European exploration==\nIn 1606, the Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] landed near the site of the modern-day town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]] on the western shore of Cape York. His arrival was the first recorded encounter between European and Australian Aboriginal people.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\nIn 1606, [[Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer may have sighted the Queensland coast at the tip of Cape York. In that year, he had sailed the [[Torres Strait]], the body of water now named after him.\n\nIn 1768, the French explorer [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] sailed west from the [[New Hebrides]] islands, getting to within a hundred miles of the Queensland coast. He did not reach the coast because he did not find a passage through the coral reefs, and turned back.\n\n[[Captain James Cook|Lieutenant James Cook]] wrote that he claimed the east coast for [[King George III]] of England on 22 August 1770 when standing on [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]] off the west coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]], naming eastern Australia \"New South Wales\".<ref>European discovery and the colonisation of Australia culture.gov.au {{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/australianhistory/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216230554/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/australianhistory/ |archivedate=16 February 2011}}</ref> This included the present Queensland. Cook charted the Australian east coast in his ship [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Barque ''Endeavour'']], naming [[Stradbroke Island|Stradbroke]] and Morton (now [[Moreton Island]]) islands, the [[Glass House Mountains (Queensland)|Glass House Mountains]], Double Island Point, Wide Bay, [[Hervey Bay]] and the Great Sandy Cape, now called [[Fraser Island]]. His second landfall in Australia was at Round Hill Head, {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Brisbane]]. ''Endeavour'' was grounded on a coral reef near Cape Tribulation, on 11 June 1770 where he was delayed for almost seven weeks while they repaired the ship. This occurred where [[Cooktown]] now lies, on the Endeavour River, both places named after the incident. On 22 August ''Endeavour'' reached the northern tip of Queensland, which Cook named the [[Cape York Peninsula]] after the [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]].\n\nIn 1799, in ''Norfolk'', [[Matthew Flinders]] spent six weeks exploring the Queensland coast as far north as Hervey Bay. In 1802 he explored the coast again. On a later trip to England, his ship HMS ''Porpoise'' and the accompanying ''Cato'' ran aground on a coral reef off the Queensland coast. Flinders set off for Sydney in an open [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]], at a distance of {{convert|750|mi|km}}, where the Governor sent ships back to rescue the crew from Wreck Reef.\n\n==Nineteenth century exploration and settlement==\n{{See also|Queensland borders}}\nIn 1823, [[John Oxley]] sailed north from Sydney to inspect [[Port Curtis]] (now [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] as possible sites for a penal colony. At Moreton Bay, he found the [[Brisbane River]] whose existence Cook had predicted, and proceeded to explore the lower part of it. In September 1824, he returned with soldiers and established a temporary settlement at [[Redcliffe, Queensland|Redcliffe]]. On 2 December, the [[Moreton Bay Penal Settlement|Moreton Bay penal settlement]] was transferred to where the [[Brisbane central business district|Central Business District]] (CBD) of [[Brisbane]] now stands. The settlement was initially called [[Edenglassie, Queensland|Edenglassie]], a [[portmanteau]] of the Scottish towns [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]]. Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] discovered outcrops of coal along the banks of the upper [[Brisbane River]] in 1825.<ref name=\"nhch\" /> In 1839, [[Penal transportation|transportation]] of [[convict]]s ceased, culminating in the closure of the Brisbane penal settlement.

The same study indicates that the casualties Aboriginal people suffered in these battles with settlers and native police (frequently described by contemporary political leaders and newspapers as \"warfare\", \"a kind of warfare\", \"guerrilla-like warfare\", and at times as a \"war of extermination\") is highly likely to have exceeded 30,000.

[[Queensland]] [[Separation of Queensland|separated]] from the [[Colony of New South Wales]] in 1859.\n\n==Indigenous people==\n50,000 to 60,000 years ago, Aboriginal people arrived in Australia by boat or by [[land bridge]]. The most likely route was from [[Southeast Asia]] across the [[Torres Strait]]. During the next ten thousand years, the Aboriginal people travelled over most of the continent.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\nAround 25,000 years ago, an [[ice age]] began with a rapid drop in the temperature of the earth of eight degrees. The climate changes lasted over 10,000 years. The land bridges from [[Southeast Asia]] and to [[Tasmania]] became inhospitable. Food was difficult to find and this led to the origin of seed-grinding technology.\n\nAbout 15,000 years ago, global temperatures warmed and rainfall increased along the eastern coast of Australia. The inland of Queensland, also receiving rainfall, again became habitable. Coastal lands decreased due to rising sea levels and tropical [[rain forest]]s spread. The Kalkadoon people of the inland central gulf region, dug wells 10m deep to maintain their supply of freshwater.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\nFrom 10,000 years until European arrival, the favourable warmer climate allowed the development of semi-permanent villages in the northern rainforests, the far western regions and around [[Moreton Bay]]. Along the [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]], and on the islands of Moreton Bay, large huts (djimurru), capable of housing thirty to forty people were built. However, due to recurrent droughts and floods, the dominant hunter-gatherer lifestyle persisted in most areas of Queensland.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\nThe peak Aboriginal population in Queensland prior to European arrival is uncertain. The number may have been between 200,000 and 500,000 people.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/> Numbers may have decreased at times of epidemics like [[smallpox]]. Rough calculations of the population can be made from the knowledge that Queensland supported 34.2 percent of the total number of tribes in Australia and from the knowledge that 35 to 39 percent of Australian aboriginal people lived in Queensland.<ref>\u00d8rsted-Jensen, Robert: ''Frontier History Revisited'', Brisbane 2011, p9-15.</ref> Queensland was the most densely populated region of the continent with two of the six to seven hundred Aboriginal nations and at least ninety language groups.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\n==European exploration==\nIn 1606, the Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] landed near the site of the modern-day town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]] on the western shore of Cape York. His arrival was the first recorded encounter between European and Australian Aboriginal people.<ref name=\"r-evans-hoq\"/>\n\nIn 1606, [[Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer may have sighted the Queensland coast at the tip of Cape York. In that year, he had sailed the [[Torres Strait]], the body of water now named after him.\n\nIn 1768, the French explorer [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] sailed west from the [[New Hebrides]] islands, getting to within a hundred miles of the Queensland coast. He did not reach the coast because he did not find a passage through the coral reefs, and turned back.\n\n[[Captain James Cook|Lieutenant James Cook]] wrote that he claimed the east coast for [[King George III]] of England on 22 August 1770 when standing on [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]] off the west coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]], naming eastern Australia \"New South Wales\".<ref>European discovery and the colonisation of Australia culture.gov.au {{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/australianhistory/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216230554/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/australianhistory/ |archivedate=16 February 2011}}</ref> This included the present Queensland. Cook charted the Australian east coast in his ship [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Barque ''Endeavour'']], naming [[Stradbroke Island|Stradbroke]] and Morton (now [[Moreton Island]]) islands, the [[Glass House Mountains (Queensland)|Glass House Mountains]], Double Island Point, Wide Bay, [[Hervey Bay]] and the Great Sandy Cape, now called [[Fraser Island]]. His second landfall in Australia was at Round Hill Head, {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Brisbane]]. ''Endeavour'' was grounded on a coral reef near Cape Tribulation, on 11 June 1770 where he was delayed for almost seven weeks while they repaired the ship. This occurred where [[Cooktown]] now lies, on the Endeavour River, both places named after the incident. On 22 August ''Endeavour'' reached the northern tip of Queensland, which Cook named the [[Cape York Peninsula]] after the [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]].\n\nIn 1799, in ''Norfolk'', [[Matthew Flinders]] spent six weeks exploring the Queensland coast as far north as Hervey Bay. In 1802 he explored the coast again. On a later trip to England, his ship HMS ''Porpoise'' and the accompanying ''Cato'' ran aground on a coral reef off the Queensland coast. Flinders set off for Sydney in an open [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]], at a distance of {{convert|750|mi|km}}, where the Governor sent ships back to rescue the crew from Wreck Reef.\n\n==Nineteenth century exploration and settlement==\n{{See also|Queensland borders}}\nIn 1823, [[John Oxley]] sailed north from Sydney to inspect [[Port Curtis]] (now [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] as possible sites for a penal colony. At Moreton Bay, he found the [[Brisbane River]] whose existence Cook had predicted, and proceeded to explore the lower part of it. In September 1824, he returned with soldiers and established a temporary settlement at [[Redcliffe, Queensland|Redcliffe]]. On 2 December, the [[Moreton Bay Penal Settlement|Moreton Bay penal settlement]] was transferred to where the [[Brisbane central business district|Central Business District]] (CBD) of [[Brisbane]] now stands.

The same study indicates that the casualties Aboriginal people suffered in these battles with settlers and native police (frequently described by contemporary political leaders and newspapers as \"warfare\", \"a kind of warfare\", \"guerrilla-like warfare\", and at times as a \"war of extermination\") is highly likely to have exceeded 30,000.
