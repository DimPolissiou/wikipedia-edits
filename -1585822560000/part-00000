It was described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of [[Babylon]], near present-day [[Hillah]], [[Babil Governorate|Babil]] province, in [[Iraq]]. Its name is derived from the Greek word ''kremast\u00f3s'' (\u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, lit. \"overhanging\"), which has a broader meaning than the modern English word \"hanging\" and refers to trees being planted on a raised structure such as a terrace.<ref name=\"Dalley1993\"/><ref name=\"Reade2000\"/><ref name=\"Foster2004\">{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Karen Polinger|title=The Hanging Gardens of Nineveh|journal=Iraq|volume=66|year=2004|pages=207|issn=0021-0889|doi=10.2307/4200575}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as ''The Marvel of Mankind'', by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his [[Medes|Median]] wife [[Amytis of Media|Queen Amytis]], because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest [[Berossus]], writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by [[Josephus]].

Diodorus ascribes the construction to a [[Syrian]] king. He states that the garden was in the shape of a square, with each side approximately four [[plethron|plethra]] long. The garden was tiered, with the uppermost gallery being 50 [[cubit]]s high.  The walls, 22 feet thick, were made of brick.

King [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC) had created a canal, which cut through the mountains. Fruit tree orchards were planted.  Also mentioned were pines, cypresses and junipers;  almond trees, date trees, ebony, rosewood, olive, oak, tamarisk, walnut, terebinth, ash, fir, pomegranate, pear, quince, fig, and grapes. A sculptured wall panel of Assurbanipal shows the garden in its maturity. One original panel<ref>BM124939</ref> and the drawing of another<ref>Original Drawing IV 77</ref> are held by the [[British Museum]], although neither is on public display. Several features mentioned by the classical authors are discernible on these contemporary images.\n\n[[File:Gardens of Ninevah.png|thumb|Photo of Assyrian wall relief showing garden in the ancient city of Nineveh (Mosul Iraq)]] Of Sennacherib's palace, he mentions the massive limestone blocks that reinforce the flood defences. Parts of the palace were excavated by [[Austin Henry Layard]] in the mid-19th century. His citadel plan shows contours which would be consistent with Sennacherib's garden, but its position has not been confirmed. The area has been used as a military base in recent times, making it difficult to investigate further.\n\nThe irrigation of such a garden demanded an upgraded water supply to the city of Nineveh. The canals stretched over 50 km into the mountains. Sennacherib was proud of the technologies he had employed and describes them in some detail on his inscriptions. At the headwater of Bavian (Khinnis)<ref>Layard (1853)</ref> his inscription mentions automatic sluice gates. An enormous aqueduct crossing the valley at [[Jerwan]] was constructed of over 2 million dressed stones. It used stone [[Corbel arch|arches]] and waterproof cement.<ref>Jacobsen (1935)</ref> On it is written:\n<blockquote>Sennacherib king of the world king of Assyria. Over a great distance I had a watercourse directed to the environs of Nineveh, joining together the waters.... Over steep-sided valleys I spanned an aqueduct of white limestone blocks, I made those waters flow over it.</blockquote>\n\nSennacherib claimed that he had built a \"Wonder for all Peoples,\" and said he was the first to deploy a new casting technique in place of the [[Lost-wax casting|\"lost-wax\" process]] for his monumental (30 tonne) bronze castings. He was able to bring the water into his garden at a high level because it was sourced from further up in the mountains, and he then raised the water even higher by deploying his new water screws.

It was described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of [[Babylon]], near present-day [[Hillah]], [[Babil Governorate|Babil]] province, in [[Iraq]].

This was attested to by the Babylonian priest [[Berossus]], writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by [[Josephus]]. The construction of the Hanging Gardens has also been attributed to the legendary queen [[Semiramis]], who supposedly ruled Babylon in the 9th century BC,<ref name=\"UN1998\"/> and they have been called the ''Hanging Gardens of Semiramis'' as an alternative name.<ref name=\"AE2018\">{{Cite web| title = Hanging Gardens of Babylon| author = Cartwright M| work = Ancient History Encyclopedia| date = July 2018| access-date = 15 September 2018| url = https://www.ancient.eu/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon/}}</ref>\n\nThe Hanging Gardens are the only one of the Seven Wonders for which the location has not been definitively established.<ref name=\"autogenerated1988\" /> There are no extant Babylonian texts that mention the gardens, and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon.<ref>Finkel (1988) p. 58.</ref><ref>{{cite book|first1=Irving |last1=Finkel|first2=Michael|last2 =Seymour|title=Babylon: City of Wonders|publisher=London: British Museum Press|year= 2008|page= 52|isbn= 0-7141-1171-6}}</ref> Three theories have been suggested to account for this.

Diodorus ascribes the construction to a [[Syrian]] king. He states that the garden was in the shape of a square, with each side approximately four [[plethron|plethra]] long. The garden was tiered, with the uppermost gallery being 50 [[cubit]]s high.  The walls, 22 feet thick, were made of brick.

King [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC) had created a canal, which cut through the mountains. Fruit tree orchards were planted.  Also mentioned were pines, cypresses and junipers;  almond trees, date trees, ebony, rosewood, olive, oak, tamarisk, walnut, terebinth, ash, fir, pomegranate, pear, quince, fig, and grapes. A sculptured wall panel of Assurbanipal shows the garden in its maturity. One original panel<ref>BM124939</ref> and the drawing of another<ref>Original Drawing IV 77</ref> are held by the [[British Museum]], although neither is on public display. Several features mentioned by the classical authors are discernible on these contemporary images.\n\n[[File:Gardens of Ninevah.png|thumb|Photo of Assyrian wall relief showing garden in the ancient city of Nineveh (Mosul Iraq)]] Of Sennacherib's palace, he mentions the massive limestone blocks that reinforce the flood defences. Parts of the palace were excavated by [[Austin Henry Layard]] in the mid-19th century. His citadel plan shows contours which would be consistent with Sennacherib's garden, but its position has not been confirmed. The area has been used as a military base in recent times, making it difficult to investigate further.\n\nThe irrigation of such a garden demanded an upgraded water supply to the city of Nineveh. The canals stretched over 50 km into the mountains. Sennacherib was proud of the technologies he had employed and describes them in some detail on his inscriptions. At the headwater of Bavian (Khinnis)<ref>Layard (1853)</ref> his inscription mentions automatic sluice gates. An enormous aqueduct crossing the valley at [[Jerwan]] was constructed of over 2 million dressed stones. It used stone [[Corbel arch|arches]] and waterproof cement.<ref>Jacobsen (1935)</ref> On it is written:\n<blockquote>Sennacherib king of the world king of Assyria. Over a great distance I had a watercourse directed to the environs of Nineveh, joining together the waters.... Over steep-sided valleys I spanned an aqueduct of white limestone blocks, I made those waters flow over it.</blockquote>\n\nSennacherib claimed that he had built a \"Wonder for all Peoples,\" and said he was the first to deploy a new casting technique in place of the [[Lost-wax casting|\"lost-wax\" process]] for his monumental (30 tonne) bronze castings. He was able to bring the water into his garden at a high level because it was sourced from further up in the mountains, and he then raised the water even higher by deploying his new water screws. This meant he could build a garden that towered above the landscape with large trees on the top of the terraces \u2013 a stunning artistic effect that surpassed those of his predecessors.\n\n==Plants==\n[[File:Babylon Babil Iraq.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Date palm]]s are a common tree species in Babylon.]]\nThe gardens, as depicted in artworks, featured blossoming flowers, ripe fruit, burbling waterfalls and terraces exuberant with rich foliage.

Given a color name to match the name of amber mutants, [[ochre]] mutant viruses had a similar property in that they recovered infectious ability within certain suppressor strains of bacteria. The set of ochre suppressors was distinct from amber suppressors, so ochre mutants were inferred to correspond to a different nucleotide triplet. Through a series of mutation experiments comparing these mutants with each other and other known amino acid codons, [[Sydney Brenner]] concluded that the amber and ochre mutations corresponded to the nucleotide triplets \"UAG\" and \"UAA\".<ref name=brenner_1965>{{cite journal |pages=994\u20138 |doi=10.1038/206994a0 |pmid=5320272 |title=Genetic Code: The 'Nonsense' Triplets for Chain Termination and their Suppression |year=1965 |last1=Brenner |first1=S. |last2=Stretton |first2=A.

These prematurely terminate translation if the corresponding frame-shift (such as due to a ribosomal RNA slip) occurs before the hidden stop. It is hypothesised that this decreases resource waste on nonfunctional proteins and the production of potential [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxins]]. Researchers at [[Louisiana State University]]  propose the ''[[ambush hypothesis]]'', that hidden stops are selected for. Codons that can form hidden stops are used in genomes more frequently compared to synonymous codons that would otherwise code for the same amino acid. Unstable [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] in an organism correlates with a higher frequency of hidden stops.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=701\u20135 |doi=10.1089/1044549042476910 |title=The Ambush Hypothesis: Hidden Stop Codons Prevent Off-Frame Gene Reading |year=2004 |last1=Seligmann |first1=Herv\u00e9 |last2=Pollock |first2=David D. |journal=DNA and Cell Biology |volume=23 |issue=10 |pmid=15585128}}</ref>\nThis hypothesis however could not be validated with a larger data set.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1\u20138 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-418 |title=Ambushing the ambush hypothesis: predicting and evaluating off-frame codon frequencies in Prokaryotic Genomes |year=2013 |last1=Cavalcanti|first1=Andre|last2=Chang |first2=Charlotte H.|last3=Morgens|first3=David W.|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=14 |issue=418 |pmid=23799949 |pmc=3700767}}</ref>\n\nStop-codons and hidden stops together are collectively referred as stop-signals. Researchers at [[University of Memphis]] found that the ratios of the stop-signals on the three reading frames of a genome (referred to as translation stop-signals ratio or TSSR) of genetically related bacteria, despite their great differences in gene contents, are much alike. This nearly identical Genomic-TSSR value of genetically related bacteria may suggest that bacterial genome expansion is limited by their unique stop-signals bias of that bacterial species.<ref>{{cite journal |pages= 255\u201385| doi=10.1080/10590501.2015.1053461 |title=Protein mis-termination initiates genetic diseases, cancers, and restricts bacterial genome expansion |year=2015 |last1=Wong | first1=Tit-Yee|last2=Schwartzbach |first2=Steve|journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part C |pmid=26087060 |volume=33| issue=3 }}</ref>\n\n==Translational readthrough==\n'''Stop codon suppression'''  or '''translational readthrough''' occurs when in translation a stop codon is interpreted as a sense codon, that is, when a (standard) amino acid is 'encoded' by the stop codon.
