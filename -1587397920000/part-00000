The worship of Mihr was centered in a region named Derjan, a district in [[Upper Armenia]], currently located in eastern Turkish territories. The temple dedicated to Mihr was built in the village of Bagaritch. Despite the fact that the Armenian Mihr was less prominent in Armenia than [[Mithra]] was in [[Persia]], Mihr is the root of many Armenian proper names such as Mihran, Mihrdat and Mehruzhan. The Armenian hetanist temple Mehian also has the same source. The month of February was dedicated to Mihr and it was called Mehekan. In 301 A.D. Christianity became the official religion of Armenia, and the Armenian church adopted many hetanist rites and ceremonies. For example, the Christian fire-festival of [[Trndez]], which has hetanist roots is still celebrated in February, the month dedicated to Mihr.\n\n==Triad in Armenian paganism==\nAccording to Vahan Kurkjian, the ideology behind the hetanism has no Avestan trait, because the notion of the ideal did not exist in Mazdeism. The ideology of the latter was based on the struggle between light and dark. However, the Armenians erected statues to honor the sun and the moon. Furthermore, hetanism is characterized by the worship of a Triad. The [[Urartu|Urartians]] worshipped three great gods: [[\u1e2aaldi|Haldis]], [[Theispas]], and [[Shivini|Artinis]]. The same notion existed in [[Hetanism]], in which the Triad consisted of [[Aramazd]], [[Anahit]], and Mihr.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kurkjian|first=Vahan M.|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/34*.html|title=A History of Armenia|publisher=Armenian General Benevolent Union of America|year=1958|isbn=|location=|pages=301|quote=The ideology greatly developed in the Armenian paganism has no Avestic trait, because the ideal had no place in the Mazdeism, while in the Armenian temples of Armavir statues were erected in honor of the sun and the moon.

In 1987 it was named and described as the [[type species]] ''Tropeognathus mesembrinus'' by [[Peter Wellnhofer]]. The generic name is derived from Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03b9\u03c2, ''tropis'', \"keel\", and \u03b3\u03bd\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, ''gnathos'', \"jaw\".

The band released what would become their biggest selling album, titled ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' (1994). Fueled by the hit singles \"[[Come Out and Play (The Offspring song)|Come Out and Play]]\", \"[[Self Esteem (song)|Self Esteem]]\", and \"[[Gotta Get Away (The Offspring song)|Gotta Get Away]]\", the album set the all-time record for most units sold by an independent label band at 16 million records. ''Smash'' has continued to sell consistently well in the years since its release, and has also been certified 6x platinum in the United States. The album also sold very well outside the U.S., particularly in Australia, where it debuted No.&nbsp;1 on the [[ARIA Charts]], and remained in that position for three weeks in 1995.\n\nAfter the release of ''Smash'', and armed with a newly expanded income, the band decided to buy out the rights to their first album. Holland and Kriesel then created their own record label [[Nitro Records]] and started signing bands. One of their first releases was a re-release of the band's 1989 debut album ''[[The Offspring (album)|The Offspring]]''. The label also signed a number of punk bands including [[the Vandals]], [[Guttermouth]], [[Jughead's Revenge]] and [[AFI (band)|AFI]]. Soon after, [[Nitro Records]] became solely Holland's responsibility.\n\n===''Ixnay on the Hombre'', ''Americana'', and ''Conspiracy of One'' (1997\u20132002)===\n[[File:The offspring.jpg|thumb|left|The Offspring performing in 2001]]\nDespite the success of ''Smash'', the Offspring left [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] and signed with [[Columbia Records]]. Epitaph retained its rights to release the next album in Europe, while Columbia had it for all other territories. The band's attorney, Peter Paterno, had issued a letter to Epitaph stating that the band had \"substantial and fundamental reasons\" for wanting to leave the label and that Epitaph had \"breached its contract.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Borzillo|first1=Carrie|title=Offspring Signs with Columbia: Epitaph Has European Rights for 3rd Set|issue=21|magazine=Billboard|date=May 25, 1996|id={{ProQuest|973451}}}}</ref> The band began writing and recording their fourth album, titled ''[[Ixnay on the Hombre]]'', in 1996. The album was released on February 4, 1997, which was also Noodles' 34th birthday. This album was not as successful as ''Smash'', although it did sell four million units and spawned five singles. The album saw the band move away from the political-punk themes common to many Epitaph bands, and more into mainstream rock with songs like: \"[[Gone Away (song)|Gone Away]]\" and \"[[I Choose]]\". The video for the last track was directed by Holland himself. Dexter commented that ''Ixnay'' was probably not as well-received as ''Smash'' because it was such a departure, and that many fans probably were expecting ''Smash Part Two''.<ref>''Complete Music Video Collection'' (2005).</ref>\n\nIn 1998 the Offspring released ''[[Americana (The Offspring album)|Americana]]''. Three of the album's singles: \"[[Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)]]\", \"[[Why Don't You Get a Job?]]\" and \"[[The Kids Aren't Alright]]\" became the band's biggest hits, making the album the peak of the Offspring's mainstream popularity. The former song topped the charts in nine countries, including Australia, Japan, Norway and the United Kingdom. \"[[She's Got Issues]]\" was also released as a single, and was a minor hit.\n\nIn 1999, the band appeared as themselves in the film ''[[Idle Hands]]''. They played a cover version of \"[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]\" (originally by the [[Ramones]]) and \"Beheaded\" at a school dance before Holland's character is killed. They also appeared at the infamous [[Woodstock 1999]], where their performance was broadcast live on [[pay-per-view]] television.\n\n2000 saw the band release their sixth album called ''[[Conspiracy of One]]''. The band intended to release the entire album online through their official website, to show their support for [[music download|downloading music]] on the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/2000/offspring.html |title=Offspring MP3 |publisher=Mp3newswire.net |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> However, under threat of legal action by Columbia through their parent company Sony, only the first single \"Original Prankster\" was released on their official website (the rest of the record was leaked to fan sites).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/2000/offspring2.html |title=Offspring MP3 |publisher=Mp3newswire.net |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> The band also sold T-shirts on their website with the [[Napster]] logo on it and donated money to Napster creator [[Shawn Fanning]] with the profits.\n\nThe band also released a single \"[[Defy You]]\" exclusively for the film ''[[Orange County (film)|Orange County]]''.\n\n===Ron Welty's departure, ''Splinter'' and ''Greatest Hits'' (2003\u20132005)===\nLongtime drummer [[Ron Welty]] left the group in 2003 to play in [[Steady Ground]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offspring.com/news/224/ron-welty-no-longer-a-member-of-the-offspring |title=Ron Welty No Longer a Member of The Offspring |publisher=Offspring.com |accessdate=August 11, 2013 |date=March 18, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214330/http://www.offspring.com/news/224/ron-welty-no-longer-a-member-of-the-offspring |archive-date=October 4, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/5599/ron-welty-leaves-the-offspring |title=Ron Welty leaves the Offspring |publisher=Punknews.org |accessdate=August 11, 2013 |date=March 19, 2003 |author=Scott}}</ref> a band in which he played drums and co-produced (they broke up in 2007).

The Offspring recruited [[Josh Freese]] to record the drums for ''Splinter'' and later announced that ex-[[Rocket from the Crypt]] drummer [[Atom Willard]] would be the official replacement for Ron Welty. The album's original title was to be ''Chinese Democrazy (You Snooze, You Lose)'', from the name of the [[Chinese Democracy|long-delayed album]] by [[Guns N' Roses]]. As a result, Guns N' Roses frontman [[Axl Rose]] filed a [[cease and desist]] order against the Offspring, but eventually began to calm down when he realized this was announced on [[April Fools' Day|April the first]]. The first single \"Hit That\" enjoyed moderate success on MTV. \"Hit That\" used a variety of electronic samples, different from what the Offspring has done in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=193947 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513171703/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=193947 |archivedate=May 13, 2007 |title=JS Online: Punk's Offspring is aging well |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released a ''[[Greatest Hits (The Offspring album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in both [[DualDisc]] and regular CD editions. ''Greatest Hits'' contains 14 of the band's hits between ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' and ''[[Splinter (The Offspring album)|Splinter]]'', and two previously unreleased songs, \"[[Can't Repeat]]\" and \"[[Next to You (The Police song)|Next to You]]\" (a cover of [[the Police]] available as a hidden track). The compilation does not include any songs from the band's first two albums. The DualDisc contains video of Dexter and Noodles discussing the band's history and a bonus acoustic version of the song \"Dirty Magic.\" About a month later, the band released a video DVD with all of their music videos, and some videos from a live show.\n\nDuring the summer of 2005, the band played the [[Vans Warped Tour]] for the first time, and followed that with a tour of Europe and Japan. After the \"Greatest Hits\" world tour the band took a break from writing, recording and touring. During the hiatus, Willard was recruited by [[Tom DeLonge]] for his band [[Angels & Airwaves]] and released an album, ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper]]'', in 2006.\n\n===''Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace'' (2006\u20132009)===\n[[File:NoodlesParada.jpg|thumb|right|Pete Parada and Noodles performing in 2009]]\nIn November 2006, it was reported that the Offspring were back in the studio recording their eighth studio album, ''[[Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace]]'' with producer [[Bob Rock]] and \"a fistful of demos\".

The band's former labelmates [[NOFX]] poked fun at them for this in their song \"Whoa on the Whoas\". Several tracks also incorporate elements of Eastern music, which can be heard on the likes of \"Tehran,\" \"Me & My Old Lady,\" \"Pay the Man,\" \"Dividing By Zero,\" and the verse hook from \"Come Out and Play\". Their lyrics cover a wide range of topics, like personal relationships, such as in their songs \"She's Got Issues\", \"Self Esteem\" and \"Spare Me the Details\", and the degradation of the United States, politics, and society in general with songs like \"It'll Be a Long Time\", \"Americana\" and \"Stuff Is Messed Up\". The lyrics generally reflect a sarcastic viewpoint, which, along with the language, can be offensive to some. This is acknowledged in the opening track from their album ''[[Ixnay on the Hombre]]'', \"Disclaimer\", which is sarcastic itself. Like \"Disclaimer\", the first track of most of the Offspring's albums are an introduction of some sort; \"Time to Relax\" (from ''Smash''), \"Welcome\" (from ''Americana''), \"Intro\" (from ''Conspiracy of One''), and \"Neocon\" (from ''Splinter'') are also examples of this.

The band released what would become their biggest selling album, titled ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' (1994). Fueled by the hit singles \"[[Come Out and Play (The Offspring song)|Come Out and Play]]\", \"[[Self Esteem (song)|Self Esteem]]\", and \"[[Gotta Get Away (The Offspring song)|Gotta Get Away]]\", the album set the all-time record for most units sold by an independent label band at 16 million records. ''Smash'' has continued to sell consistently well in the years since its release, and has also been certified 6x platinum in the United States. The album also sold very well outside the U.S., particularly in Australia, where it debuted No.&nbsp;1 on the [[ARIA Charts]], and remained in that position for three weeks in 1995.\n\nAfter the release of ''Smash'', and armed with a newly expanded income, the band decided to buy out the rights to their first album. Holland and Kriesel then created their own record label [[Nitro Records]] and started signing bands. One of their first releases was a re-release of the band's 1989 debut album ''[[The Offspring (album)|The Offspring]]''. The label also signed a number of punk bands including [[the Vandals]], [[Guttermouth]], [[Jughead's Revenge]] and [[AFI (band)|AFI]]. Soon after, [[Nitro Records]] became solely Holland's responsibility.\n\n===''Ixnay on the Hombre'', ''Americana'', and ''Conspiracy of One'' (1997\u20132002)===\n[[File:The offspring.jpg|thumb|left|The Offspring performing in 2001]]\nDespite the success of ''Smash'', the Offspring left [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] and signed with [[Columbia Records]]. Epitaph retained its rights to release the next album in Europe, while Columbia had it for all other territories.

The album was released on February 4, 1997, which was also Noodles' 34th birthday. This album was not as successful as ''Smash'', although it did sell four million units and spawned five singles. The album saw the band move away from the political-punk themes common to many Epitaph bands, and more into mainstream rock with songs like: \"[[Gone Away (song)|Gone Away]]\" and \"[[I Choose]]\". The video for the last track was directed by Holland himself. Dexter commented that ''Ixnay'' was probably not as well-received as ''Smash'' because it was such a departure, and that many fans probably were expecting ''Smash Part Two''.<ref>''Complete Music Video Collection'' (2005).</ref>\n\nIn 1998 the Offspring released ''[[Americana (The Offspring album)|Americana]]''. Three of the album's singles: \"[[Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)]]\", \"[[Why Don't You Get a Job?]]\" and \"[[The Kids Aren't Alright]]\" became the band's biggest hits, making the album the peak of the Offspring's mainstream popularity. The former song topped the charts in nine countries, including Australia, Japan, Norway and the United Kingdom. \"[[She's Got Issues]]\" was also released as a single, and was a minor hit.\n\nIn 1999, the band appeared as themselves in the film ''[[Idle Hands]]''. They played a cover version of \"[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]\" (originally by the [[Ramones]]) and \"Beheaded\" at a school dance before Holland's character is killed. They also appeared at the infamous [[Woodstock 1999]], where their performance was broadcast live on [[pay-per-view]] television.\n\n2000 saw the band release their sixth album called ''[[Conspiracy of One]]''.

The Offspring recruited [[Josh Freese]] to record the drums for ''Splinter'' and later announced that ex-[[Rocket from the Crypt]] drummer [[Atom Willard]] would be the official replacement for Ron Welty. The album's original title was to be ''Chinese Democrazy (You Snooze, You Lose)'', from the name of the [[Chinese Democracy|long-delayed album]] by [[Guns N' Roses]]. As a result, Guns N' Roses frontman [[Axl Rose]] filed a [[cease and desist]] order against the Offspring, but eventually began to calm down when he realized this was announced on [[April Fools' Day|April the first]]. The first single \"Hit That\" enjoyed moderate success on MTV. \"Hit That\" used a variety of electronic samples, different from what the Offspring has done in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=193947 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513171703/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=193947 |archivedate=May 13, 2007 |title=JS Online: Punk's Offspring is aging well |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released a ''[[Greatest Hits (The Offspring album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in both [[DualDisc]] and regular CD editions. ''Greatest Hits'' contains 14 of the band's hits between ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' and ''[[Splinter (The Offspring album)|Splinter]]'', and two previously unreleased songs, \"[[Can't Repeat]]\" and \"[[Next to You (The Police song)|Next to You]]\" (a cover of [[the Police]] available as a hidden track). The compilation does not include any songs from the band's first two albums. The DualDisc contains video of Dexter and Noodles discussing the band's history and a bonus acoustic version of the song \"Dirty Magic.\" About a month later, the band released a video DVD with all of their music videos, and some videos from a live show.\n\nDuring the summer of 2005, the band played the [[Vans Warped Tour]] for the first time, and followed that with a tour of Europe and Japan. After the \"Greatest Hits\" world tour the band took a break from writing, recording and touring. During the hiatus, Willard was recruited by [[Tom DeLonge]] for his band [[Angels & Airwaves]] and released an album, ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper]]'', in 2006.\n\n===''Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace'' (2006\u20132009)===\n[[File:NoodlesParada.jpg|thumb|right|Pete Parada and Noodles performing in 2009]]\nIn November 2006, it was reported that the Offspring were back in the studio recording their eighth studio album, ''[[Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace]]'' with producer [[Bob Rock]] and \"a fistful of demos\".

The band's former labelmates [[NOFX]] poked fun at them for this in their song \"Whoa on the Whoas\". Several tracks also incorporate elements of Eastern music, which can be heard on the likes of \"Tehran,\" \"Me & My Old Lady,\" \"Pay the Man,\" \"Dividing By Zero,\" and the verse hook from \"Come Out and Play\". Their lyrics cover a wide range of topics, like personal relationships, such as in their songs \"She's Got Issues\", \"Self Esteem\" and \"Spare Me the Details\", and the degradation of the United States, politics, and society in general with songs like \"It'll Be a Long Time\", \"Americana\" and \"Stuff Is Messed Up\". The lyrics generally reflect a sarcastic viewpoint, which, along with the language, can be offensive to some. This is acknowledged in the opening track from their album ''[[Ixnay on the Hombre]]'', \"Disclaimer\", which is sarcastic itself. Like \"Disclaimer\", the first track of most of the Offspring's albums are an introduction of some sort; \"Time to Relax\" (from ''Smash''), \"Welcome\" (from ''Americana''), \"Intro\" (from ''Conspiracy of One''), and \"Neocon\" (from ''Splinter'') are also examples of this.

Partridge''' (May 7, 1861{{spaced ndash}}March 2, 1943) was an American attorney, diplomat, and business executive from Vermont.  A [[republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served briefly in the [[United States Senate]], appointed to fill the vacancy left by the death of [[Frank L. Greene]].\n\nA native of [[East Middlebury, Vermont]], Partridge was educated in [[Middlebury, Vermont|Middlebury]], attended [[Middlebury College]], and graduated from [[Amherst College]] (1882) and [[Columbia Law School]] (1884).  Proctor practiced law in [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland]] before becoming active in the [[Vermont Marble Museum|Vermont Marble Company]] and associated politically with the company's owners, the [[Redfield Proctor]] family.  Partridge advanced up Vermont Marble's ranks beginning in the mid-1880s, and served successively as Treasurer, Vice President, President, and Chairman of the Board.  In addition, he was affiliated with other Proctor businesses, including the Proctor Trust Company and the Clarendon and Pittsford Railroad.\n\nPartridge held local offices in Proctor, including town clerk and school board member.  When Redfield Proctor served as [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] from 1889 to 1890, Partridge served as his private secretary.  Partridge's connection to a powerful cabinet member who later served in the U.S. Senate led to several appointments, including [[Solicitor]] of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] from 1890 to 1893, [[United States Ambassador to Venezuela]] from 1893 to 1894, and [[Consulate#Consulates and embassies|U.S. Consul]] in [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]] from 1897 to 1898.  From 1898 to 1900, Partridge served in the [[Vermont Senate]].\n\nAs a prominent business leader and former diplomat, Partridge developed \"senior statesman\" status that led to service on various boards and commissions, in the 1910s and 1920s, including the state public safety committee that managed Vermont's participation in [[World War I]] and the public corporation that aided in Vermont's recovery following the Great Flood of 1927.  In December 1930, Governor [[John E. Weeks]] appointed Partridge to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy created by the death of Frank Greene.  Partridge lost the Republican nomination to [[Warren Austin]] in the March 1931 primary, and in overwhelmingly Republican Vermont, Austin easily defeated Democrat Stephen M. Driscoll in the general election.  Partridge retired in 1935, and resided in Proctor.  He died there on March 2, 1943 and was interred at South Street Cemetery in Proctor.\n\n==Early life and start of career==\nFrank Charles Partridge was born in [[East Middlebury, Vermont]] on May 7, 1861, the son of Charles Frank Partridge and Sarah Ann (Rice) Partridge.<ref>U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925, 1923 entry for Frank C.

Partridge''' (May 7, 1861{{spaced ndash}}March 2, 1943) was an American attorney, diplomat, and business executive from Vermont.  A [[republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served briefly in the [[United States Senate]], appointed to fill the vacancy left by the death of [[Frank L. Greene]].\n\nA native of [[East Middlebury, Vermont]], Partridge was educated in [[Middlebury, Vermont|Middlebury]], attended [[Middlebury College]], and graduated from [[Amherst College]] (1882) and [[Columbia Law School]] (1884).  Proctor practiced law in [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland]] before becoming active in the [[Vermont Marble Museum|Vermont Marble Company]] and associated politically with the company's owners, the [[Redfield Proctor]] family.  Partridge advanced up Vermont Marble's ranks beginning in the mid-1880s, and served successively as Treasurer, Vice President, President, and Chairman of the Board.  In addition, he was affiliated with other Proctor businesses, including the Proctor Trust Company and the Clarendon and Pittsford Railroad.\n\nPartridge held local offices in Proctor, including town clerk and school board member.  When Redfield Proctor served as [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] from 1889 to 1890, Partridge served as his private secretary.  Partridge's connection to a powerful cabinet member who later served in the U.S. Senate led to several appointments, including [[Solicitor]] of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] from 1890 to 1893, [[United States Ambassador to Venezuela]] from 1893 to 1894, and [[Consulate#Consulates and embassies|U.S. Consul]] in [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]] from 1897 to 1898.  From 1898 to 1900, Partridge served in the [[Vermont Senate]].\n\nAs a prominent business leader and former diplomat, Partridge developed \"senior statesman\" status that led to service on various boards and commissions, in the 1910s and 1920s, including the state public safety committee that managed Vermont's participation in [[World War I]] and the public corporation that aided in Vermont's recovery following the Great Flood of 1927.  In December 1930, Governor [[John E. Weeks]] appointed Partridge to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy created by the death of Frank Greene.  Partridge lost the Republican nomination to [[Warren Austin]] in the March 1931 primary, and in overwhelmingly Republican Vermont, Austin easily defeated Democrat Stephen M. Driscoll in the general election.  Partridge retired in 1935, and resided in Proctor.  He died there on March 2, 1943 and was interred at South Street Cemetery in Proctor.\n\n==Early life and start of career==\nFrank Charles Partridge was born in [[East Middlebury, Vermont]] on May 7, 1861, and was the son of Charles Frank Partridge and Sarah Ann (Rice) Partridge.<ref>U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925, 1923 entry for Frank C.
