She was a gifted child from an early age and reportedly had her first vision of the [[BVM(RC)|Virgin Mary]] at age 4. During her youth she reported a vision of the Infant [[Jesus]] coming towards her and saying \"''You will always suffer, but I will be with you.''\"{{sfn|Duffer|p=2}}\n\nShe expressed her desire for a religious life on the day of her First Holy Communion.  She said to her teacher, a nun, \"I must suffer a great deal, I must be like Jesus.\" \"Who told you that?\" asked the nun.  \"The little Host which is Jesus,\" was Berthe's reply.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.7dolors.com/biography.htm |title=Biography of Berthe Petit |access-date=2009-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404091307/http://www.7dolors.com/biography.htm |archive-date=2009-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Always in delicate health, at the age of fourteen she suffered a serious bout of [[typhoid]] in 1884.{{sfn|Duffer|p=5}}\n\nOn hearing her confession on September 8, 1888, Father Godefroid O.F.M. Cap told her that \nshe would become a \"crucified spouse\" of Christ, and a [[victim soul]] for many sinners. At Christmas [[Midnight Mass]] in 1893, Berthe made a vow offering her life and health to God in exchange for the gift of a soul being called to the priesthood, and immediately received a mystical experience in which she believed Jesus accepted her vow, confirmed that she would experience great suffering, and that she would one day know the priest who would be the fruit of her prayers.{{sfn|Duffer|p=8}} This priest turned out to be [[Louis Decorsant]], whom she would not meet until 1908.\n\nAfter becoming a Franciscan Tertiary, taking the religious name 'Mary Magdalene of the Cross', Berthe suffered from many illnesses.\nAt one point doctors had given up all hope for her, but she mysteriously recovered.{{sfn|Freze|p=277}}\n\n==Unfolding mystical experiences of the Heart of Mary==\n{{Christian mysticism}}\nAt Christmas Midnight Mass in 1909, Berthe received a deeper understanding of her vocation, in the form of a vision of the hearts of Jesus and Mary closely united together, pierced by a sword, and accompanied by words from Jesus: \"Teach souls to love the Heart of my Mother pierced with the sorrow that transfixed my own heart.\" This message was repeated and amplified on 7 and 8 February 1910: Berthe was invited to \"live in the heart of Mary\" as she lived in that of Christ, and to make known the love of Mary's heart.{{sfn|Duffer|p=22}}\n\nIn 1910, while on a pilgrimage to [[St Anne]]\u2019s shrine in [[Alsace]], Berthe reported a revelation which led her to understand clearly that her specific task was to obtain \"the Consecration of the World to the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary\". Later on the same journey, attending Decorsant's Mass in Rome, Berthe further understood that the entrustment of the world to Mary's sorrowful motherhood flowed from the incident in [[John's Gospel]] where Christ, dying on the cross, entrusts \"the [[beloved disciple]]\" (representing both [[John the Apostle|St John the Evangelist]], and the whole community of church  members) to Mary's maternal care.\n\nOn 8 September 1911, Berthe reported an unusually prolonged encounter with Jesus Christ, in which the Lord explained that while Mary's status as 'Immaculate' was a pure gift of God's grace, the title 'Sorrowful' should be justly applied to Mary's heart - and precede 'Immaculate' - because of her voluntary acceptance of her painful role in accepting the suffering of her Son. The Lord also asked that priests should make an act of devotion to Mary's Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart at the end of every Mass.{{sfn|Duffer|p=26}}\n\nThe messages Berthe reported appear in the book ''[[Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary|The Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary]]''.<ref>''The Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary'',  Published by LuLu.com 2004, {{ISBN|1-4116-0396-6}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} Most of the messages deal with the sorrows of the Virgin Mary, warn of Divine judgment and relate to the tears of the Virgin Mary shed over a world in need of prayer and repentance.\n\n==The First World War and its aftermath==\n\nBerthe attended the 1912 [[Eucharistic Congress]] in [[Vienna]], presided over by the Emperor of [[Austria-Hungary]]. On September 12, immediately following communion, she received a prophecy that the Emperor's heir would be killed, the first of a chain of events \"painful but useful\" to God's purpose; this would become clear when Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] was assassinated on 28 June 1914. After the [[First World War]] broke out, Berthe was able to travel to [[Switzerland]] on 18 July 1914, but being unable to return to Belgium, remained in Switzerland for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Duffer|p=27-28}} Reverend Decorsant was able to pass a message, via [[Cardinal Mercier]], to the newly elected Pope [[Benedict XV]], who in May 1915 ended a letter to the bishops of the world with a recommendation to seek the intercession of the \"Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary\" ('Cuore  addolorato ed immacolato di Maria').{{sfn|Duffer|p=27-28}}<ref>Acta Apostolica Sedis, 1915, <nowiki>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2007%20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305020453/http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2007%20 |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}[1915]%20-%20ocr.pdf</nowiki> page 254</ref> [[Cardinal Bourne]] of Westminster took a particular interest in Berthe's revelations and led four acts of consecration to the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary in [[England]] between 1917 and 1919.{{sfn|Duffer|p=31-37}}\n\nIn 1919, Berthe was able to return to Belgium; in the same year she received a prophecy of future conflict with nations increasingly divided. In 1927, Berthe moved to [[Uccle]] when it became clear that her pre-war residence could not be restored. Between 1919 and 1942, Berthe reported various prophecies of nations being tempted by pride and power; Italy and Germany were mentioned by name. On 24 January 1940, she spoke of Belgium being invaded with surprising rapidity - which came to pass on 10 May of the same year.\n\nIn 1943, Berthe became increasingly frail, and was given the sacrament of [[extreme unction]] on Sunday 21 March. She died at around 6 p.m. on Friday 26 March, and for three days pilgrims flocked to her deathbed to pray close to her body.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The third test was played in Auckland at the Domain with a huge crowd of 24,300 present to see New Zealand go down 23-34<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Third League Test/Australia v New Zealand/Win for the Visitors/Score 34 Points to 23/Fast and Open Game\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17259\n| date = 1919-09-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190908.2.119\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. While Iles 4th and final appearance for New Zealand came at the Auckland Domain once again with New Zealand being trounced 2-32 to lose the series 1-3<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Australia v New Zealand\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17265\n| date = 1919-09-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190915.2.130\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn a 1921 match for Tauranga Iles scored a try against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He also played for Tauranga against Te Puke and despite recently joining the rugby code was named captain\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kusabs' Cup Match Next Saturday\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7710\n| date = 1921-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210602.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga made history of sorts by playing in the first ever rugby league game in Te Puke<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program.

Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]].

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn a 1921 match for Tauranga Iles scored a try against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga made history of sorts by playing in the first ever rugby league game in Te Puke<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. These effort to grow the game in the area ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in Te Puke and then again in the return match in Tauranga.

They belong to the '''[[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin ethnic group]]'''  and live in close relation and association with the [[Nandi people|Nandi]]. They are structurally [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] with an amalgamation of '[[Kipsigis Genealogical Organizations|ortinwek]]' (genealogical organizations analogous to clans) from [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Okiek people|Okieik]], [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Kisii people|Kisii]], [[Luo people|Luo]]  and aboriginal ethnicities of [[Kenya]]. \n\nIn the mid [[19th century AD]], the Kipsigis were eponymized as [[Lumbwa people|'''<u>Lumbwa</u>''']] (''a name derived from [[Meru people|Ameru peoples]] for a community that was associated with [[Sirikwa culture]])''. By the [[20th century]], the term was used to identify the Kipsigis but with also a connotation to identify the [[Kwavi people|Wakuavi Maasai]] of [[Tanzania]]. Other insignificant names include: ''Kipsikis, Ilparakuyo, Baraguyu, Kwavi,'' and ''Iloikop.''\n\nThe Kipsigis people speak the [[Kipsigis language]]. This language falls under the [[Nandi\u2013Markweta languages|Nandi-Marakweta languages]] of [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]. Kipsigis language speakers therefore can or may not be able to communicate with [[P\u00f6koot language|Pokot]], [[Elgon languages|Sebei]] and [[Terik people|Terik]] tribes of Kalenjin but there is diction of words common to all Kalenjin thus a vague message can be depicted from listening closely over a period of time.\n\nThe Kipsigis together with other linguistically and culturally related tribes now identify as '''[[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]''', an identity they have been collectively using since 1950s. The Kipsigis tribe in census and other statistics are the most populous compared to their akin tribes of Kalenjin; conservative estimates point at the Kipsigis being '''31.76%''' against cumulative population of Kalenjin in Kenya, Uganda and South-Sudan while within Kenya, the Kipsigis account for about '''63%''' of Kalenjin and occupy the largest geographic zones..\n\nThe Kipsigis are explicitly and unapologetically the most sophisticated and modernized ethnic tribe among the Kalenjin confederation. Notably, the Kipsigis are the pioneering and leading cultural ambassadors of Kalenjin especially through music i.e. ''[[Emily Chepjumba track]]'' is formulated as the Kalenjin anthem in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Perhaps even among the [[Nilotic peoples]], the Kipsigis succeed or precede the [[Luo people|Luo]] in terms of westernized cultural dynamics and modernity.  One other distinguishing characteristic of the Kipsigis in contrast to other Kalenjin is their pioneering role and a dynamic communal state of being early adopters.\n\nThe Kipsigis people live predominantly in a region politically known as ''South Rift Region'' and includes [[Bomet County|Bomet county]]: ([[Sotik Constituency|Sotik]], [[Chepalungu Constituency|Chepalungu]], [[Bomet East Constituency|Bomet East]], [[Bomet Central Constituency|Bomet Central]] and [[Konoin Constituency|Konoin]] constituencies) and [[Kericho County|Kericho county]]: ([[Kipkelion East Constituency|Kipkelion East]], [[Kipkelion West Constituency|Kipkelion West]], [[Ainamoi Constituency|Ainamoi]], [[Bureti Constituency|Bureti]], [[Belgut Constituency|Belgut]] and [[Sigowet\u2013Soin Constituency|Sigowet-Soin]] constituencies). In [[Nakuru County|Nakuru county]], the Kipsigis live in [[Kuresoi North Constituency|Kuresoi North]], [[Kuresoi South Constituency|Kuresoi South]], [[Njoro Constituency|Njoro]], [[Molo Constituency|Molo]], [[Subukia Constituency|Subukia]] and [[Rongai Constituency|Rongai]] constituencies.In [[Laikipia County|Laikipia county]], a few populations of Kipsigis live in [[Laikipia West Constituency|Laikipia West constituency]]. In [[Narok County|Narok county]], the Kipsigis live in: [[Narok West Constituency|Narok West constituency]], [[Emurua Dikirr Constituency|Emurua Dikirr constituecy]] and [[Narok South Constituency|Narok South constituency]]. In [[Tanzania]], the Kipsigis live in [[Tarime District|Tarime]] and [[Mwanza Region|Mwanza]].\n\nThe traditional occupations of the Kipsigis included: Semi-pastoral herding, military expeditions and farming cereal (millet). Living on the Western Highlands at an altitude of 1500 to 2000m, the Kipsigis now also grow maize, wheat, [[pyrethrum]] and tea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africanlatitude.com/en/info/the-ancestral-peoples/the-kipsigis.html |title=The Kipsigis |website=African Latitude Safari |accessdate=15 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215102243/http://www.africanlatitude.com/en/info/the-ancestral-peoples/the-kipsigis.html |archive-date=15 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe eponymous name '''''<nowiki/>'Kipsigis'<nowiki/>''''' can be translated as <u>'prolific</u>' or <u>'the ones who bear many children</u>' where ''<nowiki/>'Kip''<nowiki/>' is the masculine name prefix and ''<nowiki/>'sigiis''' implying the process of giving birth. An initiated male is referred to as '''''Kipsigisiindet''''', although it can also refer to a woman of Kipsigis ethnicity. A woman of Kipsigis ethnicity is referred to as '''''Chepsigiisiindet'''''. A group of people of Kisigiis ethnicity are referred to as '''''Kipsigisiek'''''.\n\nIn academia, the 'Kipsigis' word or eponym has inspired the nomenclature of an extinct genus of East African antelope from the middle miocene ([[Kipsigicerus]]). Other academic terms associated with the Kipsigis include: [[Acraea sotikensis]] and [[Sotik lion|Sotik Lion]] ([[Panthera leo melanochaita]]).\n\nAccording to the Swahili traders and alien visitors, the Kipsigis would have seemed as part of the Nandi as were all the other Kalenjin tribes and in this accord, Kalenjin was referred to as Nandi-Speaking communities.\n\nLumbwa connotation being used to identify the Kipsigis can be attributed to an encounter by Meru ancestors of a people who spoke a proto-kalenjin language. This community would most probably be the [[Tugen people|Tugen]] community of Kalenjin which used to occupy a region between South of Lake Turkana and Southeast toward mount Kenya. However, after the rise of Maasai and their expeditions that followed, the Lumbwa community was displaced from mount Kenya and as later researchers tried to look for the Lumbwa community, geography and similarities would lead them to believe the Kipsigis were the Lumbwa.\n\nThe Lumbwa term among the elderly Kipsigis as of today is revered and supposed not to be mentioned supposedly because it is associated with the Lumbwa treaty with the British and also perhaps because it doesn't have a literal or historical meaning to the Kipsigis.\n\n== Genetic genealogy ==\nThere are no publicized or extensive documentation on the genetic studies carried on ethnic Kipsigis individuals. Based on their [[Nilotic]] origins from [[South Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]], it is expected that future studies will paint a Kipsigis relationship with [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Datooga people|Datooga]] and [[Okiek people|Ogiek]] as well as several other [[Nilotic]]-speaking people of [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]].\n\n=== Autosomal DNA ===\n\n=== Y-DNA ===\n\n=== Mitochondrial DNA ===\n\n=== Lactose Tolerance/Intolerance ===\n\n== Kipsigis Position and Facet to Kalenjin ==\nThe Kipsigis people are part of a confederation of  Southearstern Nilotic ethnic tribes inhibiting the highlands of [[East Africa|East Afrca]] in [[African Great Lakes|African Great Lakes Region]] known as [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]. The Kalenjin include: '''Kipsigis''', [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Tugen people|Tugen]], [[Okiek people|Okiek]], [[Marakwet people|Marakwet]], [[Sengwer people|Sengwer]], [[Sabaot people|Sabaot]], [[Terik people|Terik]], [[Pokot people|Pokot]] and [[Sebei people|Sebei]]. The confederation come about as Maliri people from Ethiopia and South Sudan migrated into Uganda and Kenya, thus interacting with the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Iraqw people|Iraqw]] (who are examined to be reminiscent to [[Sengwer people|Sengwer]]) and aboriginal inhabitants of the Great Lakes including [[Okiek people|Okiek]] and [[Oropom people|Oropom]].\n\nThe Kalenjin speak archaic languages with each tribe having its own variations but can communicate and understand each other. The Kipsigis use nomencleture similar to all the other tribes except the Marakwet whose names of persons have been inverted gender-wise; this is said to be probably because of a genocide that may have targeted males or females of the Marakwet. Theism is similar across Kalenjin and it is examined to have radiated from the Kibasisek clan originally from Marakwet. The Kibasisek clan found across most or all the Kalenjin spread the worship of the sun (Asiisian Religion). However, further examinations find the Maliri Kalenjin (Pokot and Sebei) to have faceted in former Kalenjin religion (Tororutian Religion).\n\nHeritage is almost uniform across Kalenjin but with circumcision absent in some tribes. Kalenjin can traditionally marry from within Kalenjin as if it were within each individuals tribe. Clans may be found across the various tribes and thus, for instance, the Kipsigis and the Nandi are particularly intricate thus making both seem as a single identity even to date.  Culture is similar and cultural dynamics cut across all Kalenjin. Systems of administration were similar across Kalenjin but Nandi and Kipsigis later borrowed the Laibon kingly post from the Maasai and christened it as Orkoiyot in Nandi and Oorgoiiyoot in Kipsigis.\n\n==Origin and Establishment==\n{{Main|History of the Kalenjin people}}\n\n===Origin===\nThe Kipsigis was initially a single group and identity with the Nandi until 1800 when the Nandi community was separated by a wedge of Uas Nkishu Maasai in Kipchorian River (River Nyando); the resulting community south of Nandi hills (Kipkelion) became Kipsgis.\n\n{{Quote\n|...the Kipsigis and the Nandi moved to Rongai area. The Kipsigs and the Nandi are said to have lived as a united group for about a century, but eventually were forced to separate due to antagonistic environmental. Some of these were droughts and invasion of the Maasai from Uasin Gishu.       \n|C.

Merile reverted to Southern Ethiopia. Pokotozek moved to a region between Mount Cherangany and Mount Moroto and then to Lake Baringo thus disturbing a community called [[Oropom people|Oropom]] (an aboriginal and indigenous community to the region)who thus dispersed in various directions (Turkwel excursion, Uasin Ngishu excursion which was likely adopted to the Maasai and Oropom,- an excursion which shrunk to a region they had already been occupying around Chemorongit hills and South of Mount Moroto hills). Pokotozek went on to defeat Lloikop Maasai at Baringo and thus Pokotozek broke into two, a community called [[Chok people|Chok]] or the Suk who occupied Baringo while another branch moved west and called itself [[Sebei people|Sebei]].

This thus implies a common culture bed for these communities. Thus, while Pokot and Sebei are directly descendants of Maliri, the Kipsigis, Nandi, Elgeiyo and Southern factions of Tugen may have a common ancestry.''\n[[File:Facing kerio valley from anin.jpg|thumb|196x196px|[[Kerio Valley]], where Maliri Kalenjin and Kutiit Kalenjin emerged to defeat and eject [[Maasai people|Maasai]]. Here too, the [[Iraqw people|Iraqw]] interacted intricately with the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] and [[Datooga people|Datooga]].]]\nMore than any of the other sections, the Nandi and Kipsigis, in response to Maasai expansion, borrowed from the Maasai some of the traits that would distinguish them from other Kalenjin: large-scale economic dependence on herding, military organization and aggressive cattle raiding, as well as centralized religious-political leadership. The family that established the office of [[Orkoiyot]] (warlord/diviner) among both the Nandi and Kipsigis were migrants from northern [[Chemwal people|Chemwal]] regions. By the mid-nineteenth century, both the Nandi and Kipsigis [[Kimnyole#Reconquest of Uasin Gishu|were expanding at the expense of the Maasai]]. For instance, [[Kwavi people|Kwavi Maasai]] were fought and driven away from Narok to Sang'alo by three major sub groups of the Maasai (Siria, Moi Tanik and Mburu) assisted by Kipsigis in the late 1600s, thus some found refuge among the [[Luhya people]] under the subtribe of [[Khayo]] were they facet the sub-tribe as the clan of Bakhabi.\n\n=== Sirikwa and Lumbwa Association ===\nSirikwa is a term originally coined by the Sebei people for Oropom who settled in Uganda and Western Kenya. The term is used by Kipsigis to refer to a people whose region they succeeded and were associated with [[Sirikwa culture]]. The Sirikwa to the Kipsigis would be what the Nandi called the [[Chemwal people]]. The Chemwal according to the Nandi are the ancestors of the Sengwer faction of Pokot. All these point at the [[Iraqw people]]s of Tanzania.\n\n=== Parakuyo and Kwavi Association ===\nThe Kipsigis are sometimes referred to as Parakuyo and/or Kwavi in curated articles and records. This points to the inadequate research on the extend and expanse of the Kipsigis community and their influence. The Kipsigis compared to other plain nilotes and highland Nilotes of Kenya are the most progressively advancing and westernizing community. In earlier times, the Kipsigis had attires similar to Maasai and even shared certain dialects but notably, the Kipsigis time to time had to shave their hair. The Kipsigis also did not braid their hair or dye them with ochre. The fact that some Maasai regions have Kipsigis/Kutiit/Kalenjin names thus implies that the Kipsigis community during the Maasai expansion era may have been ejected to Tanzania. It is plausible that the Parakuyo or Kwavi of Tanzania are facets of Kipsigis community or a lost Kalenjin tribe.\n\n=== Establishment of ''EMet ab Kipsigis and Circumcision'' ===\nThe Kipsigis eponym is not understood in terms of origin but the literal meaning can sound derogative although the Kipsigis themselves use it prestigiously and posteriously. The first collective population of the Kipsigis was located in Belgut, Kericho. The first circumcision was observed in Londiani, implying an eastward projection that resulted with a cultural interaction most probably with the Afro-Asiatic Iraqw who were known to the Kipsigis as Sirikwa rather than by other Kalenjin because for instance, the Nandi do not allow in the Kipsigis into their customs unless their clan belong among the Nandi or if a Kipsigis woman is married to Nandi man, she undergoes compartmentalized and secretive custom. Later projections spread south largely to Bureti.\n\nEmet ab Kipsigis was largely established by furious disciplined armies, diviners and leaders. The structures of society and system of governance were similar to those of other Kalenjin as they were copy-pasted from the Nandi.\n\nWhilst academia and archaeology find the Sirikwa as a pastoral neolithic period of the Kalenjin, among the Kipsigis, they mention living with a group of people they refer as [[Sirikwa]]. The Sirkwa are said to have dug up circular parameters where they kept their cattle and made huts on top of the parameters. It is also said that the Sirikwa had a thing about red ants, their appearance made them migrate as it was a bad omen for them. It is also told that the Sirikwa migrated southward toward Tanzania. The [[Iraqw people|Iraqw]] of [[Tanzania]] actually do confirm to be the [[Sirikwa culture|Sirikwa]] who interacted with the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] before migrating to Tanzania. The [[Sirgoik clan]] of the Kipsigis are thought to be adopted group of [[Iraqw people|Iraqw]] families.\n\n==== Statutes on Adoption ====\nThe Kipsigis did not practice or allow for adoption within members of their own tribe. Instead, foreigners, especially prisoners of war, were the only type of individuals to be adopted. Raids were not designed to capture and adopt foreign people but it was a subject of the outcome of raids as to whether the besieged would concede defeat and ask for mercy, thus they would be brought to Kipsigis land and made to undergo immigration procedures and process of customs relating to adoption called '''''Luleet''''' or '''''ko-luleet.'''''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=335|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n\nPatterns derived from cultural history led Kipsigis to adopt [[Kisii people|Kisii]] and [[Maasai people|Maasai]] peoples. This could be because the Maasai were seen as a preferable genetic pool for the Kipsigis as they had many cattle like the Kipsigis and with a heritage similar to [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] while the Kisii were seen as industrious and likely facet the Kipsigis community in terms of agriculture and farming.\n\n==== Male initiations ====\nAs a unified identity, the Kipsigis and the Nandi had not begun circumcising their males; that's until they were separated and the Nandi were introduced to circumcision by [[Sengwer people|Cheragany people]] and thus they called themselves [[Chemwal people|Chemwal]] for a period before they obtained the Nandi eponym. The Kipsigis about the same timeline were introduced to circumcision in [[Kipsigiis Hill|Londiani hill top]] in Londiani (Also called '''''Tulwaap Kipsigis'''''- Mount of the Kipsigis,  '''''Tulwaap Monyiis'''''- Mount of the penis, '''''Tulwaap Lagook'''''- Children's mountain or '''''Tulwaap Ng'etiik'''''- Mount of the uninitiated boys). It is not clearly mentioned who introduced it to the Kipsigis but it is plausible that either [[Lumbwa|Lumbwa people]] or Cherangany people are the ones who did so.\n\n==== Female initiation ====\nFemale initiation seems analogous to male initiation with most features and customs reflecting, being exactly the same or complementing features and customs performed to the males. Females initiation included surgical modification of female genitalia, seclusion and apparent segments like the one for boys. The main aim of female initiation was to turn girls into virile women. Virginity was a treasured aspect and a girl who was still a virgin during circumcision was accorded a special status by being let to 'sit in the ceremonial chair'. The distinct after mart of the female initiation was marriage.\n\nIt is however unclear when the first female circumcision took place and who introduced it to the Kipsigis.\n\n== Theism and religion ==\nThe Kipsigis observed a monotheistic version of Asisian religion where once some Kalenjin can have various deities and a major deity as Asis and/or Tororot, the Kipsigis instead have Asis as the supreme god and the other gods as artributes of Asis. This religion however may have had minor interjections to a former [[Kalenjin mythology#Earlier religion and ancient deities|Tororutian religion]] of the northern sections of Kalenjin. Theism was accompanied with no need for proof.\n\nThe ''Asisian'' religion is based on the sun ''- 'Asista','' and thus 'Asis' is an animated and personified instance of the sun. Previous translations state that ''Asis'' means the 'darlzing one' but 'to darzle' is coined by the term lili. ''Asis'' has nine attributes/names including: Asis - ''Sunny,'' Cheptalel - ''She who can be white;'' Thought of God with human nature. This attribute is coined by a legend which includes the sacrificing of girl which resulted in answer of rain after a severe drought. Cheptalel is the protagonist in the legend; Chepopkooiyo - ''She from halo;'' ''Kooiyo'' is derived from halo usually around the sun on a humid day. A halo around the sun was an important omen among the Kalenjin during war. By observing appearance of a halo before going to war, the Kalenjin would decided whether to go or not go to war. Chepopkooiyo thus implies the God of war; Chepomirchiio - ''she who leads war.'' It literally means the one who leads wars, or the god of hosts. He/she protects and leads armies. Chepkeelyen Sogool - ''she with nine legs;'' Nine is devine to the Kalenjin, it symbolizes infinity. It also has a meaning of nine rays of the sun as it rises which relates to a Maasai attribute of god called 'Isyet' with the same meaning. Chemalus - ''She who never looses/she who is wise.'' It can literally mean she who has a high intelligent quotient, never loses a riddle, always correct, never defeated. He/she is invoked in legal proceeds. Chebokimabai - ''She who dries millet.''This attribute invokes a prayer for warm and sunny climate to dry harvest of millet. Weerit Neoo - ''The eldest son;'' Cheboo - ''She who is big/large.'' Chepkochor - ''She who rises (especially to do with the sun rising)''. Tororot - ''The lifted, the promoted.''\n\n====Places of worship====\n\n*''Kaapkoros'' - Shrine\n\nThis was the common places of worship among the Kipsigis. The currently known and remembered shrines include: Kapkoros in Bomet, Kapkoros in Chepkechei, Tulwab Kipsgis ([[Mau Summit|Londiani Intersection]]) and Tulwab Bureti.\n\n*''Mabwaita'' - family altar\n\nThis was a household family altar positioned to the east of the house as one exited through the main door (the Nandi and Keiyo call it Korosyoot). It was continuously maintained and replenished by the initiated members of the household in a process called ''Kisoop mabwaiita''- ''to heal/ give life to the altar''. It is an erected structure composing of branches and vines of trees of sacred importance and purpose to the Kipsigis.\n\n*''Sach-Ooran''- Crossroads\n\n===Spiritual leaders and spiritual groups===\n\n====Tisiindet/tisiik (priest)====\nThey were men from specific clans who did not partake in war. They prayed for the community and led the processions of the harvest ceremonies.\n\n====Women====\nWomen were seen as acceptable beings to god as they bore no or less sins compared to men and thus, they believed a prayer by a woman would be granted effectively compared to a prayer by a man. This was the reason why women were the ones who prayed for their families in their homestead alter. The Kipsigis women were also rain-makers and rain chasers. they would practice a communal prayer in a river while naked and this would paranormally bring or avert rain.\n\n=== Cow Cult ===\nThe Kipsigis are observed to have explicitly seen the cow as a devine animal. A variety of products from the cow were used as sacrifice to Asis, or would convey gifts to asis. Most importantly were the tail of a cow, used to bless congregations and armies or used in prayer. A cows horn 'Lalet' could be used as a horn to call people to congregate or it could also be used to keep churned fat from milk or from roasting meat.\n\n=== Perception of Evil and Agents of Evil ===\nThe Kipsigis by the turn of 20th century had not mythologized a centralized source of evil i.e. [[Satan]]; it was believed that evil was the premise of individuals who were influenced by jealousy or evil spirits. When the missionaries of [[Africa Inland Mission|AIM]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]] reached Kipsigis, the Christian character, Satan was translated as '''''Ooiindet''''' which originally means <u>ancestors</u> to the Kalenjin; '''''Setaniiaat''''' however, a term used to refer to Satan colloquially is a borrowed word from [[Bible|The Bible]] and not related in any way to the word '''''Seetaanik''''', material implements of the '''''Oorgoiyoot''''' smeared or effected on a knobkerry of military Captains ('''''Kiptaayiiat''''').\n\n== Social and Cultural development ==\nSociety and culture among the Kipsigis was a direct product of its heritage. This thus means the culture of the Kipsigis was stifled and stringent, hardly changing. The Kipsigis have a circular view of life. They were a superstitious as well as a spiritual community. They considered all life as sacred. They believed that the natural world is all connected and that a good deed never goes unnoticed. Similarly bad deeds lead to consequences in various forms. This view ensures that all members of the community act in a morally upright manner.\n\n===Naming===\n{{Main|Kipsigis Naming System}}\nA male was given four set of names. First two after birth: the first based on time, place or weather of the time of birth, usually proceeded by a 'Kip' prefix; and a second being an attribute of a reincarnated ancestor. A third name was a borrowed name from a local hero. A fourth name was given to males after initiation which is based on the first name of the father where if the father was Kiprotich, the son would be called Arap Rotich. Naming of the females followed a similar process.\n\n=== Kipsigis Language ===\n{{Main|Kipsigis language}}\nThe Kipsigis language falls under Kuutiit cluster ([[Nandi\u2013Markweta languages|Nandi-Marakwet languages]]). It however differs from the other languages in the cluster by the following features:\n\n* Slower tempo\n* Usage of double vowels whereas the other Kuutiit languages use single vowels i.e. ''Orkoiyot'' in Nandi is termed ''Oorgoiiyoot'' in Kipsigis.\n* '''''<nowiki/>'K'''''' in Kuutiit languages is interchangeable for '''''<nowiki/>'g'''''' in Kipsigis language.\n* Conjunction '''''<nowiki/>'aap'''''' is used while the other Kuutiit use '''''<nowiki/>'ab''''''.\n\nPhonetically proper spelling as pronounced by the Kipigiis aftect some of the assumed words by the other Kalenjin such as: '''''aap''''' for '''''ab''''', '''''araap''''' for '''''arap''''', '''''Asiis''''' for '''''Asis''''', '''''laagok''''' for '''''lagok''''', '''''poiyoot''''' for '''''boiyo'''''t among others.\n\n==== A Summary of Oral Traditions and Mythologies ====\n[[File:Nandi bear 1961.png|thumb|A 1961 illustration of [[Nandi bear|Chemosi]] being hunted]]Perhaps even up to date, most if not all of the oral traditions, usually narated by a grandmother at her hut to a group of children, usually her grandchildren; are of and about a creature known as Chemosi. It has been adopted in the Western World as the Nandi Bear. It is often but not always potrayed as a canivorous beast with the ability to speak the Kipsigis or Kalenjin language. The stucture of the traditions usually begin with unrully kids who disobey the instruction of their elder siblings, parents or community members, then are lost in a forest where then, the Nandi Bear finds them, takes them to their residence, asks them to perform some musical or performed arts then roast or cook them before they are eaten but usually, the relatives and friends of the abducted arrive just in time to save them before being roasted or cooked. \n\nAmong the [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Nandi bear|Nandi Bear]] is called Chemosit, Kerit, Kododoelo, Ngoloko or Duba.\n\nIn [[Chepsongwor]], there is said to have been a dragon or an enormous reptile named Lulu which shone light at night that could be seen miles away (or at least its eggs). About 1930s, it is reported that the big-game hunters did adventure into the dragon's cave and acquire the dragon or its eggs as bounty.\n\nThere is also local speculation about a creature called [[Dingonek]]. This is a fearsome looking water creature which has features including armadillo-like leopard patterned hippo size back, head looking like a leopard's but with two large protruding fangs among other features. It was reported by the Lumbwa/Kipsigis and the Wadoko/Agiek to be seen in River Maggori. The creature was recorded to have been seen by [[Edgar Beecher Bronson]].\n\nPerhaps also more prevalent is what is called '''''Mur-ngetunyit'''''; this literally meaning ''<nowiki/>'a darkened or blackened lion beast'''. The description are sketchy and perhaps misleading where certain beasts, probably the cheetah, could be mistaken for the beast. The name however implies it could possibly be the [[black panther]]. It is usually also inclined by some elderly men as an accompanying tale that this beast, the ''Mur-ngetuniyit'' or perhaps the Cheetah or leopard have a form of magic; that it usually goes for the phallus by springing at high speeds and clutches at the head, usually of a man and if the victim survives, his recovery will include a symptom of weard if not wizardry insects usually beetles coming out of the inflicted wounds.\n\n=== Arithmetics, Geo-mapping and Calendar constructs ===\n\n====Numbers and counting (''kaitosyek'')====\n1. (One): '''''Agenge''''': It has no significance\n\n2. (Two): '''''Aeng''''': It is a good number. It symbolizes marriage and is a reciprocal/multiple of the masculine number (four).\n\n3. (Three):'''''Somok''''': It is a feminine number and a feminine symbol. It was also the maximum number of acquittal for offences, the fourth resulted in death by execution.\n\n4. (Four): '''''Ang'wan''''': Four is a masculine and military number.\n\n5. (Five): '''''Muut''''': It is associated with biology and physiology i.e., five fingers on hands and feet.\n\n6. (Six): '''''Lo''''': It is a neutral number\n\n7. (Seven): '''''Tisaap''''': It is associated with the seven age sets.\n\n8. (Eight): '''''Sisit''''': It has no significance\n\n9. (Nine): '''''Sogool''':'' It is a divine number. It is also a complete number (it is the largest one's value)\n\n10. (Ten): '''''Taman''''': It is not significant as it is a round off figure i.e. 9+1\n\n'''''Kiptaman ak Sogol''''' literally means ''ten and nine'' but it means ''a thousand and one times (___ * 1001)''; although '''''Bogol''''' means and equals a hundred, '''''Bogolai''''' means or implies ''Thanks a million.''\n\n==== Astronomy ====\nThe [[Milky Way]] is known as Poit'ap kechei (literally sea of stars), the morning star - Tapoiyot, the midnight star - Kokeliet, and [[Orion's Belt|Orion's belt]] - Kakipsomok. The Milky Way was traditionally perceived as a great lake in which children are bathing and playing. However, there are indications that there was an awareness of the movement of the stars. For instance, the [[wikiwikiweb:evening star|Evening star]] is called the Okiek's star - Kipokiot, because it was by its appearance, in times past, that the wives of the [[Okiek people|Okiek]] knew that their husbands were shortly to return home. Further, there are indications that this movement of stars was sometimes linked to earthly concerns. Here, it was by the appearance or non-appearance of the [[Pleiades]] - Koremerik, that the Nandi knew whether or not to expect a good or a bad harvest. Sometimes superstitions were held regarding certain events. A [[22\u00b0 halo|halo]] - ormarichet, was traditionally said to represent a cattle stockade. At least as of the early 20th century, a [[Parhelic circle|break]] occurring on the east side was considered to be unlucky while one on the west side was seen to be lucky. A [[comet]] - cheptapisiet or kipsaruriet was at the same time regarded as the precursor of a great misfortune.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hollis|first=A.C|title=The Nandi - Their language and folklore|date=1909|publisher=The Clarendon Press|isbn=9781444605150|location=Oxford|page=100}}</ref>\n\n==== Navigation and direction ====\nThe Kipsigis would tell their location in respect to the rising place of the sun (east) and plotting the four cardinal points descriptively by their position in relation to the east. The Kipsigis are also said to have been able the navigate at night by plotting the appearance of various constellations of the stars.\n\n# Kong'asiis ak Cherongo (East and West)\n# Murot' Tai ak Murot' Katam (South and North)\n\n====Kalenjin/Kipsigis calendar====\nThe Kipsigis call a month 'Arawet', which is also the term for our satellite, the moon. A year is called 'Kenyit' which can be derived from the phrase 'Ki-nyit' meaning 'to accomplish, to fill in'. A year was marked by the order of months and more importantly by ceremonial and religious celebration of the yearly harvest which was held at the various Kapkoros (Shrines). This event being analogous to a practice observed by most of the other Africans has inspired the [[Kwanzaa|Kwanza festivities]] celebrated by predominantly by people of [[African Americans|African descent]] in the United States. Kenyit started in February. It had two seasons known as olto (pl. oltosiek) and was divided into twelve months, arawet (pl. arawek).<ref name=\"Hollis A.C 1909, p. 94\">Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p. 94</ref>  In place of a decade is the order of 'Ibinda' which is usually between 10 and 17 years. In place of a century is the completion of the age set which takes between 100 and 120 years.\n\n===== Seasons (oltosiek) =====\nThe first season of the year, olt-ap-iwot (iwotet), was the wet season and ran from March to August. The dry season, olt-ap-keme (kemeut), ran from September to February.<ref name=\"Hollis A.C 1909, p. 94\" />\n\nThe kipsunde and kipsunde oieng harvest ceremonies were held in September and October respectively to mark the change in Seasons.<ref>Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore.

For the floor, women make a sludge of cow-dung and clay soil and spread it on the floor evenly.\n\nThe homestead huts included the main hut, a hut for unwed initiated men and boys (bachelors among the Kipsigis are explicitly guys who have passed about 40 and are still single, unwed initiated youth instead are not regarded as bachelors), a makeshift hut for initiated women (occasionally). An enclosure for cattle to stay at during the night called '''''Kaaptich''''' which is/was adjusted to '''''Kaaptuguut''''', a small house for men who guarded the flocks and herds.\n\nThe main hut consisted of two sections: '''''Koima,''''' the left side of the house where women and children stayed and the '''''Injor''''', the right side of the hut where the initiated men stayed and also with the goats and sheep.\n\n=== Food, Food Security and Meal Time ===\nKipsigis people traditionally had the staple food being ''Kipsiongik''- a thick hand blended paste of millet flour (sometimes mixed with sorghum flour) cooked in a pot with water. Kipsiongik was complemented prominently with goat's meat or cow's meat. It was a taboo to eat meat and drink milk in the same meal time. Milk was usually drunk unboiled as it was a taboo to boil milk. Prominently, the Kipsigis alao processed sour milk in a gourd (colloqually : 'Sotet') by first, cleaning the gourd then secondly sooting with charred stick of the 'itet' shrub plant which has an aromatic flavour and reduces the sour taste of sour milk; third, milk is filled into the gourd and left three to ten days to brew. Milk or sour milk would preferably be mixed with bull's blood. A sheep's tail was notably eaten during tilling of land and it was primarily designated for kids. The tongue and the testicles of a cow or a goat was reserved to the most elderly men in the family. The usual and prominent herder was offered the colon of the slaughtered animal and the herder usually roasted and ate it on the slaughter place. The liver was designated to women.\n\nIn the morning, the Kipsigis made and took millet porridge, children would take it with left over Kipsiongik (mokoryet) while the older teens and adults would take it with the snack of 'Morik'. Packed meals were carried by men (notably raw millet and perhaps sometimes, a small gourd with milk).\n\n'''Masagisyeet''' was a societal food inadequacy mitigation/feeding programme targeted at children. A hungry child would go to a cross-road with a 'kissyet'-a woven plate/bowl, undress the hide garment and place on it Sereetyoot (Kikuyu grass, ''Pennisetum clandestinum'') and then would hide in a nearby bush (this saved the respective family of the child from embarrassment). Women passing by the cross-roads often with a basket of food would then naturally recognize the coded message and place some portions of food in the child's bowl. After the child noticed that food had been donated, he/she would pick the food and return to his/her duties.<ref name=\":02\" /> Apparently, if a disadvantaged family had a child who was ready for circumcision and seclusion but could not provide food, the father would take a goat or a sheep and tie it to the homestead of a well-off family, this meant and lead to an unnegotiable plea for provision of food from the later party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=280 & 281|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n\n=== Omen Reading and Interpretation (''Tartook'') ===\nKipsigis people being a superstitious group were always on the look out to identify patterns and abnormalities in various aspects of life and environment and the interpretation of the same subsequently led them to decide on what to do. These various practices were common in [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin cultures]] as it was part of their heritage. They are similar in context and practice to the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman's]] [[Augury]] and [[Haruspex]].\n\n#'''Guts/Entrails:''' Kipsigis considered the gut to be the centre of all feelings and intuitions. To predict the future, much more like the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] did, the Kipsigis would dissect the gut of an animal. It was not allowed to dissect a person so, instead, omen expertise would dissect a goat, a sheep, a cow or a bull as substitute. It was believed that somehow, the entrails and guts of a dissected animal would convey the same message of the person in question. The reading of entrails omens was done by an expert who had apprenticed on the medium and expertise of entrails omens. Entrails interpretation ranged from mundane as saying that good omens were observed from healthy animals which were well fed to more mystical expertise where an expert could tell the weather patterns, the outcome of war and the onset of disasters or prosperity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=227 & 228|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n#'''Snakes:''' The Kipsigis systematically and communally feared snakes; snakes were a source of terror (although some Kipsigis clans adopted from Kisii people keep snakes for cultural reasons). The appearance of a snake was an omen for evil intervention. It was believed that evil spirits (''Masambwaanik'') dwelt in snakes. It was also believed that snakes were a commune system for spirits of the deceased relatives from the spirit realm to the homesteads of the living. A snake which had veered into a homestead was never to be killed but instead, it was offered milk and beer to drink as a way of appeasing the evil spirit and then led out through a punched hole on the wall as it had serious paranormal consequence to let the snake through the door. If a snake crossed path with a person, that person had to cancel his/her duties for the day and embark on them the next day. A snake could be killed in the open but in the process, the person doing so was supposed not to make a mess from the savored snake's body; should a mess occur, the said person had to slaughter a goat lest he/she would fall ill and die.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=228 & 229|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n#'''Birds:'''\n##'''Woodpecker (''Kiptildilyeet''):''' If a woodpecker was heard near a homestead before a warring expedition, it was a good omen; if it were to be heard to the left side of an army during war, it was a bad omen while if it were to be heard on the right, it was a good omen.\n##'''Vulture (''Sangiit/Sanginook''):''' Should there have a sighting of vultures as armies formed procession ranks to war or cattle raids, instantly, the armies would have broken ranks and returned home, it was a very horrid omen.\n##'''''Chepkogosyot'' (Brown Hawk with a white belly):''' The appearance of the belly of this hawk during approach was an omen of abundant luck while the appearance of the brown back during approach was an omen for bad luck.\n##'''Owl (''Zuguruut''):''' Among the Kipsigis, the owl is associated with death.

Religion and magic or witchcraft according to the Kipsigis and perhaps the whole of Kalenjin were separate thematic subject matters seen as unrelated (Asiisian religion being seen as original to Kalenjin and magic or witchcraft being alien).\n\n#'''Pooniindet:''' A witch, usually a woman, although in rare occasions, a man could be identified as a witch. A male witch was usually associated with ill effects on cattle while a female witch was usually associated with illness and death on adults and children. The motives of practice of witchcraft were based on jealousy. When a party was suspected of witchcraft, he/she was warned and rebuked. Should there have been correlated events of illness or death of people or cattle thought to be the cause of the same lady witch, then the community would summon her, have  her divorced, tied by the limbs and suspended in levitation then beaten with stinging nettles. For a man, he would be disowned and ripped off citizenship.\n#'''Chebusuryot/Chebusurenik:''' This was usually a cluster of evil women who practiced black magic. Their magic utilizes material objects such as metals, bones et cetera being placed in people thus causing erratic discomfort, ill health and death. This form of magic was never thought to be practiced by men.\n#'''Witchdoctors (Male -Kipsoogeiyoot/Kipsoogeiinik, Female - Chepsoogeiyoot/Chepsoogeiinik) : T'''hey practiced magic meant to cure people from the effects and ravages of witchcraft and spells. Their practice involved rubbing an oily substance on the gut of the ill person while casting spells. They would not practice their skills for ill purposes, even if they wanted to. The witchdoctors with elevated expertise and status were thought to be at a level to cure infertility.\n#'''Orgoinotet:''' With regard to magic, Orgoinotet is the ability to foresee and rule with paranormal powers. An Oorgoiyoot was usually a male individual who was from the Talaai genealogical organization. One of the paranormal roles was the provision of war-medicine called '''''seetanik''''' which was substance put in the knobkerrie (''kirokto'') of a '''''Kiptaiyaat,''''' an army general then sent to the general through the Oorgoiyoot's messenger, '''''Maotyoot'''.'' Specifically with provision of seetanik by the Oorgoiyoot, they obtained an eponym: '''''kipseetmet''''', because the seetanik served as insignia and the knobkerrie of the general effective or as a believe was a portal or presence of the Oorgoiyot thus <nowiki>''their heads raid in war''</nowiki>.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=241|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n\n===Clothing, ornaments and costumes===\n[[File:Lumbwa woman and girl, showing dress and ear and other ornaments.jpg|thumb|Kipsigis woman and girl in a fashion statement of their culture in 1910]]\nThe Kipsigis had a relaxed attitude to dress codes for children and thus tribal nudism among the uncircumcised youth was common. An initiated Kipsigis, especially a woman had very strict code of dressing that where right from neck down to the knee had to be clothed (usually with a hide garment). Men however were supposed to wear a garment that would conceal their groins and rears. Both men and women would adorn themselves with earrings, necklaces, bangles and bells. [[Kanga (African garment)|Shukas]] for men started becoming a common item of attire for men replacing the hides when the missionaries arrived in Kipsigis' land.\n\n=== Gender and Gender Roles ===\n\n==== Uninitiated boys ====\nBoy children among the Kipsigis were thought of as 'children of Kipsigis' and not part of Kipsigis until they had been initiated. Their roles may have included part of looking after cattle, hunting and gathering but were mainly known to engage in play, adult mock practices and apprenticeship.\n\n==== Uninitiated girls ====\nGirl children among the Kipsigis were thought of as 'children of Kipsigis' and not part of Kipsigis until they had been initiated. Their roles major included assistance with homestead duties. They would also engage in play and apprenticeship.\n\n==== Initiated men ====\nInitiated men had the main role of protecting the community as derived from the word 'Muren' for man meaning 'defender'. They can be divided into two:\n\n===== Militant men =====\nThey were the younger generation of initiated men whose ibinda had just had the latest Saget ab eito custom. Their major task was acquiring catlle from rustling expeditions for bride price and wealth. They also made up a majority of the procession ranks of the Kipsigis military but did not make military decisions.\n\n===== Elders =====\nThey were the older generations whose ibinwek had passed duties in Saget ab eito custom to the younger men. Their major role was defence and their secondary roles included leadership, guidance/counseling and decision making.\n\n==== Initiated women ====\nThey were expected to be married of and become mothers. Some would continue with the careers they had apprenticed for as diviners, healers, seers or witch doctors.\n\n==== Transgender individuals and Binary identities ====\nThe Kipsigis had individuals with binary identity by way of naming where a boy could obtain a name and identity of a female ancestor or a girl, an identity and a name of a male ancestor but at the same time, have respective masculine or feminine names according to their gender and thus their identities, although mixed were normal in both respects. There was also a context of individuals who took up the opposite gender identity especially in the context of initiation (Kamuratanet). A transgender man is known as '''''chemenjo'''''. A transgender woman is called '''''chepkwony''''' or '''''chepotipiik'''''. It is to be noted that transgender individuals were not receive surgical modification associated with gender transition but rather came to take up their identity and roles especially during initiation.\n\n=== Initiation Rites (Tuumwek) ===\nInitiation among the Kipsigis was done from childhood thought adolescences and sometimes into early adulthood. It was an analogue for today's preliminary education. It's ultimate goal was to prepare the community's youth to become hardworking, resilient and responsible adults. It also secondarily served as a means of initiating per se, children into a community of secrecy, respect and behavior of ranks and commitment to non-disclosure agreement and military-like adherence to ideals of the Kipsigis ethnicity. Another major aspect of initiation was the communal tolerance to pain and hardships.\n\nThe rites were faceted at birth, kamuratenet (circumcision & seclusion) and finally, marriage.\n\n====Age group and age set====\n\n===== Age group =====\nAge groups were patriarchal groupings of men according to the groups and time of initiation. A group of male individuals initiated together in the same seclusion home (a makeshift home for young male adults called ''Menjo'') would call themselves ''Baghuleh'' and became closer and bonded than blood brothers. The groups males iniated the same year or a year bofore or after the other called themselves ''Botuum''. Women inherited the age group of their husbands. Girls and boys did not have an age set.\n\n===== Age set =====\nKipsigis have cyclical age setting, each usually offsetting not less than 15 years. It can be viewed as a mechanism of tracking the age expectancy of the community. In order, a new age set can never be called in while an old person of the same age set is still alive; not even one. The sets are:\n\n#''Nyongi''\n#''Maina''\n#''Sawe''\n#''Chumo''\n#''Kerongoro''\n#''Kaplelach''\n#''Kipnyi'gee''\n\n====Marriage and divorce====\n=====Marriage =====\nAs with some other ceremonies, so with marriages, some details and customs varied from clan to clan but the basic customs were uniform and same across the Kipsigis community and among all the clans.<ref name=\":02\" /> At least '''eight separate ceremonies''' entailed marriage including: ''Kaayaeet/ Yaatet-aap Kooito, Kibendii Kooito, Chuutet-aap Njoor, Kekanda/ Dowry & Sueet-aap Tuuga, Rateet, Keeseet/Keipis, keeteitei Koroseek, Katunisyeet/Tororyeet and Tyegeet-aap Seguut.''<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n*'''Marriage by betrothal''': This was the marriage by means of betrothal by the groom's family and upon acceptance of the brides family, marriage would precede.\n*'''Marriage by elopement (''Choret'' - stealing)''': Elopement occurred if the groom or bride suspected that either parental sides would not allow for their marriage or if the groom did not have enough funds and status in the society.\n*'''[[Same-sex marriage#Non-sexual same-sex marriage#Kenya|Lesbian marriage (''Kitunji Toloch'')]]''': This was a marriage between a middle aged barren woman and a young woman (just completed initiation). The young woman would be respected and identified as any other wive and would get children from random men.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=126|oclc=40199906}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Atanga|first=Lilian Lem|title=Gender and language in sub-Saharan Africa|date=2013|pages=1\u201326|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-1874-2|last2=Ellece|first2=Sibonile Edith|last3=Litosseliti|first3=Lia|last4=Sunderland|first4=Jane|doi=10.1075/impact.33.01ata}}</ref>\n*'''Promisal marriage (''Kabwatereret'')''': This was a marriage organized by parents so that when the young boy and they young girl were initiated, then followed the custom of marriage (ratet)\n*'''Marriage by proxy (''Museet'')''': This is where a mother of the groom (who may have traveled or was in war) would actually marry a bride (as proxy).\n*'''Inheritance Marriage ''(Kaandiet)''''': This was the practice of man of close kinship to a deceased man would look after the widow, her children and her welfare.\n\nIn the event that a wife may have engaged in extra-marital sex and subsequently become pregnant out of wedlock, she would have been sent to her parents and bitter words exchanged, sometimes violence ensued. As an outcome, the husband could forgive her. To allow the couple to settle back with their lives, the wife's family would have to pay the husband a heifer under a custom called '''''Keeturum Saandet.'''''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin Heritage : traditional religious and social practices|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|others=Fish, Gerald W.|year= 1996|isbn=0-87808-769-9|location=Kericho, Kenya|pages=129\u2013130|oclc=35228457}}</ref>\n\nThere was an honorary ceremony called '''''Katunisyeet-aap Tororyeet''''' (which translates to marriage for might) held for a couple and their children when they had lived together peacefully and harmoniously for a long time. It involved in-law members of both sides and it was held in the home of the wife if the wife's parents were still alive or at one of the husband's age group men.\n\n=====Divorce=====\nDivorce was practiced primarily if any party was suspected or caught practicing black magic (''banisyeet''). A wife could also be divorced if they were known to have committed adultery (a man would not be accused of adultery, extramarital sex for men was common and were not seen as an offense unless they had had sex with a married woman which was a big No!-No! for the Kipsigis).\n\n====Death====\nAmong the Kipsigis, there is a mixed explanation of what death and funeral entailed. An important event before or after death was 'Kerar-geet' event which involved the delivery of an oral will by the dying individual and the proceeding interpretation of it by the kin of the dead person after his/her death.\n\nAll Kipsigis agree that funerals were not a rite of passage (tuum), but rather just that- death (''me-et'' or ''meet''). Proceeding the death of a person however, there are two explanations:\n\n*'''Laying'''- where the dead were cleaned, adorned and taken with their belongings by a single next of kin to a bush or forest and laid to rest in a very specific manner; after which the body would be left to decay and fed on by hyenas.\n*'''Burying'''- this explanation details a very specific and intricate manner of burial where a dead person would be buried at the dung heap, west of their household and laid in their graves head on to the western side so that they ''would rise to see the rising sun''.\n\nIt is argued by some Kipsigis that Laying was done to individuals who died before marrying or having children or who had a low status in the society while burials were done for rich or well defined and prestigious people.*'''Poore:''' This was a ritual among the Kipsigis where if there had been lack of births over a period of time, the elderly in the affected commune would pray for death as it was believed this would invoke birth of new members of the society.\n\n== Organization ==\n\n=== Geo-Political Organization ===\n\n==== Em/emet ====\nEm or emet, was the highest recognized geographic division among the Kipsigis. It spans a geopolitical region demarcated as being a jurisdiction of the Kipsigis entitled to ultimate sovereignty (but shared and entitled to the Nandi as well). This unit was identifiable as a political institution but the main work of civil control and administration was done by the ''kokwotinwek'' (plural of ''kokwet'').<ref>Snell, G.S, Nandi Customary Law, (Kenya Literature Bureau: 1954), p.9-10.</ref> Linguistic evidence indicates that this form of societal organization dates back to their Southern Nilotic heritage. It is believed that the Southern Nilotes of two thousand years ago cooperated in loose supra-clan groupings, called *e:m.<ref>Ehret, Christopher.

University of Virginia, 1998, p.179</ref> It was a prestigious factor and symbol of unity, peace and prosperity.\n\n===== The Office of the King (Oorgoiiyoot) =====\nOperational in Nandi, the [[Orkoiyot]] institution was communed to Kipsigis in 1890, after the ousting and assassination of [[Kimnyole|Kimnyole Arap Turgat]]. Kimnyole sent his three sons (Kipchomber arap Koilege, Arap Boisyo and Arap Buigut)<ref>{{Citation|last=Lynch|first=Gabrielle|title=African American Studies Center|chapter=Samoei, Koitalel arap|date=2011-12-08|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530173-1|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195301731.013.49880}}</ref> to Kipsigis who immediately began to establish a Kipsigis confederation, each of them establishing kingly homesteads with servants, messengers and reception parlors.\n\nThe office of the '''''Oorgoiiyoot''''' was dissolved after the [[Lumbwa Treaty|Lumbwa treaty]].\n\n==== Kokwet ====\n''Kokwet'' was the most significant political and judicial unit among the Kipsigis. The governing body of each kokwet was its ''kok'' (village council). Kokwet denotes a geographic cluster of settlement similar in concept to a village. It was established once there was a settlement pattern group of families. Such settlements were initiated by a few pioneer groups who usually were derived from men of the same genealogical organization (oret) or age group from the same seclusion home or initiation year (botuumisyek).\n\nK''ok'' elders were the local authority for allocating land for cultivation; they were the body to whom the ordinary member of the tribe would look for a decision in a dispute or problem which defied solution by direct agreement between the parties.<ref>Snell, G.S, Nandi Customary Law, (Kenya Literature Bureau: 1954), p.10</ref>\n\n===== The office of Kook (Village Sittings) =====\nThe office of the village elders was native to the Kipsigis and the elders. It consisted of retired army officers who were usually old, rich and with a reputation of wisdom in passing judgement. Their sittings were usually leisurely in the afternoon over a large pot of Nubian gin. With regard to administration and justice, a plaintiff or messengers would convey their aggrievances or messages to the elders and thus, a congregation was called on a date. Such a congregation depending on the nature could be all inclusive of the immediate community or it could only be attended by men.\n\n<br />\n\n=== Abstract Constitution ===\nThe Kipsigis observed an unwritten constitution enveloped in the Kipsigis/Kalenjin heritage under moral codes. They were narrated and explained from childhood all through life. Significantly though, they were also sang to initiates in the seclusion homes. The implicit constitution made provisions for theism, identity, expectations of various groups, management of resources, environmental provisions and moral standards\n\n==== Laws, Offenses and Penal codes ====\n=== Neighboring Communities ===\n\n===== 1. Nandiek (Nandi) =====\nThe nandi are a closely related community to the Kipsigis as they both once had a single identity. They always work together and communal decisions made in either community affects the other.\n\nBefore annexation of the Kenyan land by British (before 1890's), the Nandi bordered the Kipsigis along River Nyando (''<nowiki/>'Oino-ap Kipchorian' - River Kipchorian'') to the north while the Kipsigis lived south of the River and prominently in Belgut only to expand within a century to what is known today as South Rift  and even more extensions that had earlier on be marked and mapped by Captain ...... ('''''Kipleltiondo''''').\n\n===== 2. Kosobo / Kosobek / Kamama (Abagusii) =====\nKosobo means the land of or 'of appertaining to' the Kosobek, (Abagusii). Kosobek means an instance of a distinctive populus group of people kmown for being medicine men. Kamama means literally 'maternal uncle' or effectively, collective family of maternal uncle's family and household including the uncle.\n\nThese terms are used to implicate the Abagusii people of Western Kenya known to the Kipsigis for the love-hate relationship between the two communities. The Kamama artibute is thought to be a connotation developed by Abagusii adoptees while Kosobo or Kosobek being a friendly but distant eponym could be the original term of Kipsigis for Abagusii.\n\nThe Kipsigis held a mythology that Asis granted them absolute ownership over cattle of all the other communities and thus, conducted cattle rustling expeditions against its neighbours (except the Nandi). Abagusii were the main target of these expeditions alongside Luo and Maasai.\n\nIn the past, the most recalled event is the failed battle of Mogori where warriors of the ageset of Kaplelach were 'wiped out' at River Migori by an alliance of Abagusii, Maa and Abakusu warriors.\n\nDuring various droughts that resulted in absolute food insecurity, young Kipsigis children were barter traded for cereal and other foodstuff to the Abagusii.\n\nThere was also a practice of intermarriages between the two communities.\n\n===== 3. Lim/Liumek (Luo) =====\n\n===== 4. Masaaek (Maasai) =====\n\n===Genealogical Organization===\n{{Main|Kipsigis Genealogical Organizations}}\nKipsigis clans are exclusively a [[Oreet|Nandi system of patriachiarchal kinship]] that the Kipsigis naturally took up.\n\nThe ancestors, notably the patriarch Kakipoch, immigrated the Nandi-Kipsigis population to Uasin Ngishu county. Formulation of clan system is thought to have resulted due to interaction with Lumbwa people or perhaps Tugen people. The purpose of creating clans as it seems was to prevent marriages between individuals who share a patriarchal relationship to the third generation (marriages being mainly heterosexual but with a lesbian marriage in context). Clans also projected various professionalism and probably adopted identities where for instance, certain clans were exclusively priests, others were exclusively smiths, others exclusively hunters and gathers while others had other particular peculiarities. With the breakage of Nandi-Kipsigis unity, the Kipsigis took up the Kipsigis identity, while the Nandi took up the Chemwal identity only later to acquire Nandi eponym from the Swahili traders and the Kipsigis assuming Lumbwa eponym from scholars and British imperialists.\n\nSince, the Kipsigis went on to adopt many clans mostly from Abagusii to the effect that residents of Bomet town and its environs are exclusively Abugusii adoptees.\n\nThe totems are personified and animated identities based on mammals and birds including: lion (Ng'etundo), buffalo (Zoet), snake (Ndaret/Komut-get), hyena (Kimagetiet), baboon (M\u00d6seet), Crested Cranes (Kong'onyot), hare (Kiplekweet), Dik-Dik (Cheptirgikyet) and the dog/coyote/kayote (Ng'okto).\n\n=== Millitary Organization ===\n\n==== Millitary Formation and Organization (Oondo) ====\nThis was the responsibility and role of initiated men. There were various posts delegated to this men by custom including: those who should protect women and children at home, spies (''Yotiik'', ''Seegeik'' and ''Sogooldaiik''), the generals (Kiptayat/Kiptaiinik)and the procession ranks (''Ng'anymetyeet'', ''Pirtiich'', ''Oldimdo/Lumweet'' and ''Kipeelbany''). Each soldier in their various posts had a division among four including ''Ngetunyo, Kebeni/Kebeny'' and some other two. There were yearly mock up practice for warring called ''Kaambageet''.\n\nThe Kipsigis armies were not exclusive but all inclusive. Their response time was instantaneous but each individual assumed regular roles in the community which earned a reputation of being insurmountable.\n\n==== Weaponry and Attire of War ====\nThe arms of the fighting men usually consisted of a spear, shield, sword and club. By the late 19th century, up to four kinds of spears, representing various eras and areas were in use. In Nandi, the '''eren-gatiat''', of the Sirkwa era was still in use though only by old men. It had a short and small leaf-shaped blade with a long socketed shank and a long butt. Two types of the Maasai era spear, known as '''ngotit''', were also in use. Those of the eastern, northern and southern counties had long narrow blades with long iron butt, short socket and short shaft. Those of the central county (emgwen) had short broad blades with short iron butts. In the western counties, a spear that had a particularly small head, a long shaft and no butt was in use, it was known as '''ndirit'''.<ref>Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p. 31</ref> The pastoral Pokot carried two Maasai era spears, known as '''ngotwa''' while the agricultural sections armed themselves with a sword, known as '''chok'''.<ref>Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.1</ref>\n\nArchery was also very much a prominent skill practiced among the Kipsigis for purposes ranging from agriculture to defense and security. There were an array of arrows for various specialties such as for shooting a bull for blood, hunting arrows and defensive arrows meant either as a deterrent by causing mortal wounds or others meant to get stuck in the victim while others were poisoned and thus each of the arrow types were used depending on the occasion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n'''''Soongoolyet,''''' an ostrich feather was a prominent headgear for the Kipsigis.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=140|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n\n==== Discipline of Armies, Customs Associated with War and Age-related Military order ====\n\n===== Sageet-aap Eito =====\nThis was a ceremony performed for the passing out of the old generation of soldiers and the entering in of the incoming generation of soldiers. It was associated with seclusion among the parties taking part in bushes for 24 hours, initiates would sleep in the attic (''tabuut'') or outside in the forest or bushes. The ceremony was completed by sacrificing a white ox and the involved parties would wear rings made from the ox' hide called ''Tamokiet'' (if the omens read from the ox's intestines were good ). This event is likened to the pass out ceremonies of police and the army.\n\n===== Isset-aap Murenik =====\nA night before a military expedition, a prayer was made under a ceremony called '''''Isset-app Murenik''''' where god was explicitly NOT to be referred to as '''Asis''' but exclusively, '''''Chebomirchio'''''. This ceremony would sometimes be skipped especially when the armies were retaliating on an attack.\n\n=== Economic activities and Professional Organization ===\n\n==== Hunting and gathering ====\n\nHunting and gathering (Logeet) seem to also be a prominent part of culture among the Kipsigis although there is an indication that it was the culture of Ogiek Kipsigis. It included hunting various animals and birds and collection of mushrooms (Bobeek), wild honey (Kulumbenik) and honey (Kuumiik). These were the activities of men (especially the hunting part), women and children (especially the gathering part).{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Agriculture ====\n\n===== Pastoralism =====\nThe system of habitation was semi-permanent and the region of settlement was abundant of grazing grass, water and salts. This made the Kipsigis lead a miniaturized version of pastoralism, only moving when there were droughts, or when there were migration for reasons such as adventure or antagonistic reasons as disputes or omens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===== Cultivation and Farming =====\nKipsigis people practiced farming. They used to farm and grow finger millet and sorghum. Black nite shade and spider plant made up the diet of the Kipsigis implying that it was also farmed. Farming was an all gender and age activity; everyone participated in clearing, tilling and land preparation, men were the experts of planting, weeding was more of female work and harvest was all-inclusive, festive and religious event.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Skill-based professions  & Activities ====\n\n===== Medicine & Treatment =====\n\n===== Smithing =====\nBy the early 20th century, there were a number of smiths (kitongik) in Nandi who spoke both Nandi and Maasai. The smiths gave the following account of their arrival. \"After they had lost all their cattle from various causes, the [[Oropom people|Uasin Gishu Maasai]] quitted their homes and split up in different directions. Some of those who wandered into Nandi were hospitably received by Arap Sutek who was the only smith in Nandi at the time.<ref>Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p. 36</ref>\n\n===== Cereal processing/Milling and Breweries =====\nKipsigis people in earliear times used pepple and stone tools to process grain for various uses. The known tools were 'koitap-bai', meaning 'stone of millet' which was simple two stones used to grind grain by hand. Later times, the Kipsigis came to adopt a milling technology that utilized water peddle to motor a contraption of larger milling stones.\n\nNubian gin as a legacy liquor was very popular and reserved for elders only. It was also very important and used in various customs. Production of Nubian gin followed the production of cereal processing.\n\n==== Salts: Munyek/Munyuk, Ng'enda and Muyeywek (roof soot) ====\nThe Kipsigis used to rear their livestock occasionally with salts usually obtained from rocks or by having their livestock water at a stream with hard salty water usually discovered by observing red-brown slimmy slum on rocks around the water body.\n\nPregnant women would occasionally chew Ng'eenda but the Kipsigis did not join the missing link to obtain salts for their meals. In place of salts, the Kipsigis would apply roof soot, especially on preserved meat for a salty aromatic effect.\n\n==== Money ====\nThe Kipsigis did not mint their money but there is context of usage of cowrie shells among other forms of currency. Notably between the Kipsigis and Abagusii was barter trade that mainly included the exchange of agricultural produce for children or cattle.\n\n==== Flora ====\nPlants were prominent in the culture and heritage of the Kipsigis. Most importantly, plants were sacred to the Kipsigis and used some specific plants to construct an alter; explicitly, an alter was exclusively made from plants. Plants were also utilized as medical resources and the knowledge of the various plants was treasured and kept from one generation to the next.\n\n===Sports===\n\n==History (Disasters & Emergencies, Expansion, Prosperity and Orgoik)==\nThe earlier Kipsigis population occupied what would be today's [[Kipkelion East Constituency|Kipkelion East]] and [[Kipkelion West Constituency|Kipkelion West]] constituencies. In oral traditions, the Kipsigis consider [[Belgut Constituency|Belgut]] their first populous settlement. Much of Kericho and southward was occupied by [[Maasai people]], Bureti and portions of Belgut were occupied by [[Kisii people|Abagusii]] and Western portions of Belgut were occupied by the [[Luo people]]. The Kipsigis began as just a small group of Nandi people who settled in an area North of River Chemosit (Itare River) and an area South of Kipchorian River (River Nyando); and expanded within 80 years to a century to an expanse larger than today's Kipsigis' regions.\n\nThe prosperity and exansion of the Kipsigis population and jusrisdixtion was remarkable. They had thwarted Kisii people out of Kericho and driven them South to Southern portions of Bureti. They had also attritioned the Maasai claim to Kericho and drove them towards Chemosit River and then made a treaty to expand their territories South respectively. There was then sudden catastrophes including famine, starvation, rinderpest disease and the dissastrous anhilation of the men of Kaplelach age set in a failed battle, the [[battle of Maagoori]]. For sometimes thus, the Kipsigis community was in the brink of collapse but it is observed that the community swiftly adopted raft measures including the relaxation rules on [[Sociosexual orientation|sociosexuality]] and aggressive adoption of Maasai, Luo and Abagusii.\n\n=== Disastor Spell Period ===\n\n====Kaplelach Age-set and the Halocaust of Maaggoori====\n{{Main Article|Holocaust of Maaggoori}}\nThe Kaplelach ageset of between 1870 and to their anhilation in about 1890 are majorly portrayed as a generation who had issues of systematic indiscipline in war who had grown invincible and believed they would thrash any opponents. They are infamously narrated to have instigated horrid and painful ordeals on the neighboring communities. One such example is found in oral traditions of how the legion of Kaplelach armies raided a community of Maasai people and killed everyone in the affected locality, then went on to cut the ears of Maasai women so that they would get hold of the beautiful ornaments; they also cut their feet and hands to remove bells and other ornaments and left them to be eaten by crocodiles in River Amalo.\n\nTheir next target was the Abagusii community. They banded their armies together and began preparing to raid. The new difeerence from other generations was that the Kaplelach wanted to eject Abagusii and kill anyone in site while the other generations usually would just instead run stealth stock theft that ensured the besiged remained with some cattle to milk. They then defied warning of deviners and the rebuke of the elders and ventured to Abagusii land. In a covert plan and in retaliation, the Maasai had intelligence of the plans of the Kipsigis armies, they martialied an overnight vigilante of Maasai, Kuria and Abagusii guerilla warriors in River Maagoori (River Migori) and here, the stealth vigilanted cornered the Kipsigis legion and slaughtered them one by one; the major element being surprise and confusion. Out of the legion, only a bunch survived the holocaust by survival tricks or the occasional one or two left alive to narrate the ordeal to the Kipsigis people.\n\n* Techjog of Bureti after whom many dormitories of high schools within Emet ab Kipsigis are named.\n\n===Menya Arap Kisiara===\nMenya was a member of the Kapkaon clan. He is the great-grandfather to [[Johanna Ngeno]]. He is a legend among the Kipsigis people. He mitigated a treaty with the Maasai that resulted in peaceful migration of Maasai from Kaplong in Sotik all through to Trans-Mara and Narok.\n\n===Orgoik===\nThe Kipsigis had wizards who would heal and treat or read omens or foresee or bless. Such individuals included ''chepsogeiyot''- a seer and healer; and ''Motirenik''-  Masters of culture and ceremonies and ''Tisiik''- Priests. Orgoik seems to be alien to Kipsigis and with an origin in Nandi. In Kipsigis an Orgoiyot is any member of the Talai clan while in Nandi, it has a meaning of collective or paramount leader with paranormal powers.\n\nTalai clansmen were adopted to the Nandi from [[Laibon|Segelai Maasai]] who actually were also adopted by the Maasai from the [[Marakwet people|Marakwet]] faction known as [[Sengwer people|Sengwer]] who also happen to be adopted from [[Sirikwa culture|Sirikwa]] ([[Iraqw people|Iraqw]]).\n\nThe orgoik have an origin among the Maasai and are known to them as [[Laibon]]. They came to the Nandi and established themselves in Nandi but a predominant family of the Talai in Nandi, the Turgat family had three sons sent to Kipsigis: [[Arap Koilege]], [[Arap Boisyo]] and [[Arap Buiygut]]. These three are the brothers to [[Koitalel arap Samoei]]. Initially, their benefactor was [[Arap Kiroisi]]- the father to [[Mugenik]].\n\nThe three brothers would later on about 1903 be deported to Kikuyuland while their siblings and immediate families consisting of about 700 individuals were banished to [[Gwassi Constituency|Gwassi]] in Homa Bay County and stayed there excommunicated between 1934 and 1962. They were later on resettled in Kablilo, Sigowet-Soin, Kiptere, Ainamoi, Belgut and some few in Emgwen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/amp/article/200010006/the-last-laibon-of-songhor|title=The Standard|last=Digital|first=Standard|website=The Standard|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>[[File:The Nandi, their language and folk-lore (1909) (14781614624).jpg|thumb|263x263px|Kipchomber or Arap Koileke, the Chief Medicine Man of the Kipsigis, with his son, Sonaiet or Arap Kipchomber, his principal advisers, and the headmen of Bureti and Sotik.

He was instrumental for dispersing Luo people from Kiptere to [[Sondu]]. [[File:JOMO KENYATTA.JPG|thumb|Cultural attire worn by Jomo in art statue|alt=|left]]Among the Kipsigis, and perhaps among all the other Kalenjin, Arap Koilege is believed to have blessed [[Jomo Kenyatta|Kenyatta Jomo]] and handed to him his attire which included a hide, a belt colloqually called 'Kenyatet', a head gear among others after which, Koilege asked Kenyatta to visit a leader of the Maasai who was a Laibon. The attire was worn by Jomo very many ceremonial times when he was the president of Kenya.\n\n=====Chebochok Kiptonui arap Boisio=====\nChebochock was the son to [[Kimnyole|Kimyole Arap Turgat]]. After Kimyole was ousted and assainated by the [[Nandi people|Nandi]], Chebochok and his two brothers found refuge among the Kipsigis people while [[Koitalel Arap Samoei]] found refuge among the [[Tugen people]]. Chebochock Kiptonui arap Boisio settled in [[Londiani]]. He established himself a kingly estate. He empowered and commandeered Kipsigis armies to acquire land towards Laikipia.\n\nHe is reported or speculated to have fathered a boy to a widow who used to herd cattle, she was known as [[Jomo Kenyatta#Early life|Wambui]]. The boy is reported to have been named [[Jomo Kenyatta|Johnstone Peter Kamau]]. She then moved to a farm in Nyeri where she married Muigai but who later divorced her because of issues associated with [[cuckold]]ry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1913, Chebochok Kiptonui Arap Boiso and his two brothers were banished to [[Muranga County|Fort Hall]] and [[Nyeri]]. Coincidentally, Wambui was assigned the role to look after the three brothers by the Europeans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://kipsigisdictionary.weebly.com/jomo-kenyatta.html|title=Jomo Kenyatta|website=KIPSIGIS DICTIONARY|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n=====Kibuigut=====\n===Mugenik arab Sitonik===\nHe was the cousin to [[Koitalel arap Samoei]] and lived in village called Sotik to where Sotik town is currently situated.\n\nHe gave prophecies that the Kipsigis still hold in great anticipation and record. These prophecies were even recorded by [[Rafael Kipchambai arap Tabaitui]] and is usually played by [[Kass fm]] on occasion. The prophecies include:\n\n*'''Sotik police officers and station''' - where he referred that they were Kipsigis children who held what appeared to be cooking sticks but their appearance stroke fear among commons.\n*'''Sotik KCC and two bridges under color bar''' - He prophesied of two bridges where one (located at the Kisii-Sotik road, at the west periphery of Sotik town) would be exclusive to the white people while the other at Kimase, would be exclusive to the natives.\n*'''Migration of Kosobek'''- He mentioned that the Abagusii would come to Kipsigis land and live among them like vines of squash but would leave dramatically but peacefully and the Kipsigis would scramble markers on 'very beautiful huts.'\n*'''Profound migrations''' - Kipsigis people would acquire large portions of land and emigrate in two formations and direction; one toward Laikipia, and another, towards Tanzania.\n*'''Decimation of the Kipsigis people''' - That the vast Kipsigis populations of the Kipsigis will be decimated and then only limited to a very few remnants only in Bureti. He said that this would be a cause of \"an uncircumcised boy\".\n\nOther Prophecies Accounts include:\n\n*'''Gender Equality and Rights of Women:''' It was foretold that a woman would own property just like a man and would work with their male counterparts, something which at the time was not only unheard of  but unimaginable to the effect that the prophet was ridiculed for saying so.\n*'''The return of Caucasian/ British people:''' Some prophecies account for the return of Caucasian to the regions of Kipsigis (or Kenya extensively).\n*'''Kipsigis leadership:''' It is a prophecy and a curse that the Kipsigis will never be united or have a leader until the day when the corpse or remains of Kipjomber arap Koileken would be return from Nyeri to his kin in Kipsigis land.\n\n== Westernization and Colonial pereiod ==\n\n=== Westernization to Christianity ===\n\n==== Catholic Church ====\nThe [[Catholic Church]] had its sentinel at Kericho to where Kenya's second largest diocese is located in Kericho. The Catholic Church is perhaps one of the most aggressively accepted denomination among the Kipsigis because of their relaxed attitude of culture and the romanticized preservation of Kalenjin mythologies plus Christianization of Kalenjin traditional religion where aspects of religion and the Kipsigis manner of worship was taken up and accepted. For instance, a Catholic church parish is colloquially called 'Kapkoros'.\n\nOne notable priest nicknamed Chemasus by the Kipsigis is most famous for converting Kipsigis into Christianity by indoctrination that it is allowed to drink alcohol (Nubian gin in this case) but in moderacy and that Asis is the same as Yahweh thus in the Catholic parishes in Kipsigis, it is not wrong to call the Israel/Christian God Cheptalel or Asis or any other artributes of Asis.\n\n==== Africa Inland Mission====\n[[Africa Inland Mission]] established their first centers in [[Cheptenye]] in [[Belgut Constituency|Belgut]] (a church and a rescue/education center for girls/young woman rescued from female genital mutilation and initiation) and in [[Tenwek]] in [[Bomet Constituency|Bomet]]. The group later broke into [[Africa Gospel Church]]'and [[Africa Inland Church]], with the latter establishing themselves mostly among the Nandi and in Litein. [[Africa Gospel Church]] became the de facto Christian denomination especially in Belgut and in Bomet. Africa Inland Mission took a more reformatory approach where converts had to completely disassociate with traditional religion and traditional life; male adult converts were baptized with only one wives of their choice while the others would not. Unlike the Catholic church, Asiisian religion was expressly not be faceted to Christianity.\n\n==== Impact and Implications of Westernization/Christianization ====\n\n===== Heritage =====\n\n===== Culture =====\nAs a result of neglect of heritage, the culture of the Kipsigis became quickly westernized. The Kipsigis have since become the most westernized as compared to other Kalenjin and other nilotes.\n\n===== Health & Education =====\n\n===Imperial rule===\nThe Kipsigis especially of [[Cheptenye]] in [[Sosiot]] and [[Tenwek]] in Bomet had been coerced by the British through the [[Africa Inland Mission]] to give up Orgoik in exchange for scholarships and a peace treaty with British. This was easily arrived at with the leadership of Tenkwek AIM clergy, who led a propaganda against the Orgoik. The propaganda led the Kipsigis to associate the orgoik with the failures and disasters that had faced the Kipsigis including the [[failed battle of Mogori]].\n\nThe surge of negative attitude towards the orgoik led to the preparations for [[Lumbwa Treaty]]. With request from the Kipsigis, the orgoik and their families were arrested and put in Kericho cells. The Kipsigis then met at Kipkelion town, then called Lumbwa, and deliberated a treaty in the form and make of Kipsigis traditions under a custom called Muuma or Mummiat. It is detailed that the British promised together with the Kipsigis to collaborate and not harm each other then they went on to savour a dog in two parts and each party buried their half.\n\nThe British are said to have asked the Kipsigis as to what they would do with the Orgoik in Kericho and the Kipsigis asked that they be exiled and excommunicated. That day, the whole Orgoik families were exiled to Russinga Island in Kisumu. It is then said that the Orgoik cursed the Kipsigis and the Nandi (Mee Kipsigis ne-ki mee tereet, ko me Nandi ne-ki mee Sotet: May the Kipsigiss die the manner of broken pot and may the Nandi die the manner of a broken calabash)\n\nThe following were the settlement reserves for the Kipsigis:\n\nThe following include the white settlers who settled in Kipsigis land:\n\n*[[Daniel Ernest Cooper]] of Sotik\n* Laban of Kipkelion\n\n[[File:The Big Game of Africa (1910) - Lioness Sotik Plains 1909.png|thumb|264x264px|Big game in Sotik plains in 1910]]\n\n=== Big game ===\nFor some time after the Nandi resistance, the Uganda protectorate was marketed in the western nations as a wild get-away destination for Big-Game enthusiasts. The Kipsigis' land strategically had the forested Sotik plains which wild life roamed freely. The Kipsigis people at the time being called 'Lumbwa' had its warriors become porters to assist big-game hunters to kill various animals.\n[[File:T Roosevelt.jpg|left|thumb|154x154px|26th president of the US]]\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] recorded using the [[.405 Winchester|405 Whinchester ammunition]] as the effective 'cure' against the ferocious [[Panthera leo melanochaita|Sotik lion]].\n\n<br />\n\n=== Kipsigis County & Kipsigis County Council ===\n{{Main Article|Kipsigis County}}\n\n==== Cheborge arap Tengecha, Senior Chief of the Kipsigis Tribe ====\nHe was a paramount Kipsigis chief appointed by the British. This way, the Kipsigis were ruled indirectly by the British. He was appointed to the [[1961 Birthday Honours|Queens's 1961 Birthday Honours]].\n\n==== William Kimutai Martin, Secretary/Treasurer of the Kipsigis African District Council ====\nHe was appointed to the [[1960 Birthday Honours|Queen's 1960 Birthday Honours]].\n\n=== Nandi Protest of 1923 ===\nA number of factors taking place in the early 1920s led to what has come to be termed the Nandi Protest or Uprisings of 1923. It was the first expression of organized resistance by the Nandi since the [[Nandi Resistance|wars of 1905-06]].\n\nPrimary contributing factors were the land alienation of 1920 and a steep increase in taxation, taxation tripled between 1909 and 1920 and because of a change in collection date, two taxes were collected in 1921. The Kipsigis and Nandi refused to pay and this amount was deferred to 1922. Further, due to fears of a spread of [[rinderpest]] following an outbreak, a stock quarantine was imposed on the Nandi Reserve between 1921 and 1923. The Nandi, prevented from selling stock outside the Reserve, had no cash, and taxes had to go unpaid. Normally, grain shortages in Nandi were met by selling stock and buying grain. The quarantine made this impossible. The labor conscription that took place under the Northey Circulars only added to the bitterness against the [[Kenya Colony|colonial government]].\n\nAll these things contributed to a buildup of antagonism and unrest toward the government between 1920 and 1923. In 1923, the ''saget ab eito'' (sacrifice of the ox), a historically significant ceremony where leadership of the community was transferred between generations, was to take place. This ceremony had always been followed by an increased rate of cattle raiding as the now formally recognized warrior age-set sought to prove its prowess. The approach to a saget ab eito thus witnessed expressions of military fervour and for the ceremony all Nandi males would gather in one place.\n\nAlarmed at the prospect and as there was also organized protest among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] at that time, the colonial government came to believe that the [[Orkoiyot]] was planning to use the occasion of the Saget ab eito of 1923 as a cover under which to gather forces for a massive military uprising. On October 16, 1923, several days before the scheduled date for the saget ab eito, the Orkoiyot [[Barsirian Arap Manyei]] and four other elders were arrested and deported to Meru. Permission to hold the ceremony was withdrawn and it did not take place, nor has it ever taken place since. The Orkoiyot [[Barsirian Arap Manyei]] would spend the next forty years in political detention, becoming Kenya's, and possibly Africa's, longest serving political prisoner.\n\n==Independence, settlement schemes and Nyanza boundary==\nThe Kipsigis were oblivious to think about independence; they thought there was no might that would de-legitimize imperial rule for they (British) had killed [[Koitalel arap Samoei]]. Independence therefore was a magical and surprising outcome for the Kipsigis.\n\nIn 1963 however, the Kipsigis obtained loans which facilitated them to buy the white settlement schemes. 1000 Kenya shillings was equivalent to 40 acres of land.\n[[File:This is how Datooga tribe welcoming their Guest.jpg|thumb|Ethnic Datooga welcoming visitors with a dance. The Kipsigis came to consider the Datooga a lost Kalenjin tribe and thus there is an interest among many Kipsigis to visit The Datooga]]\n[[File:Datoga Skinning Hide.jpg|left|thumb|166x166px|A Datooga woman skinning a cow's hide; this is a practice similarly done by the Kalenjin in the same manner]]\nIn 1964, Kipsigis were living to the reaches of [[Nyamira|Borabu]] (in [[Abagusii]] land where the settlement schemes were located) adjacent to present Kericho county but [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Daniel Arap Moi]], [[Taita Towett]]'' (his protagonistic role in this agreement has been argued by some Kipsigis that it was because his origin is among tha Abagusii people- his clan is Zoigoek meaning they were adopted from Abagusii)'', [[Prof. Lawrence Sagini]] and the then Rift Valley province Provincial Commissioner, [[Simeon Nyachae]] agreed to move the Nyanza border to the currently known former Nyanza-Rift-valley border. The then Chepalungu (currently Sotik and Chepalungu constituencies) MP, Barmalel campaigned against this move (probably because he was a member of [[Talaai clan]] and the shift of boundary would alter his clans legacy)\n\nBy this timeline, [[Kericho]], [[Kipkelion|Lumbwa/Kipkelion]], [[Sosiot]] and [[Sotik]] were the centre points of the whole of Kipsigis.\n\nIn the 1960s, there was significant emigration of the Kipsigis in their known territory to [[Mwanza]] and [[Tarime District|Tarime]] in Tanzania because at the time, Tanzania's Ujamaa communist system was a popular alternative to the Kenyan capitalist system. The reports of a Kalenjin group in Tanzania called [[Datooga people|Datooga]] may have also enticed the Kipsigis to commune and contact the lost tribe. The findings thus far is that the Datooga share certain customs with the Kalenjin but their interaction with the Abakusu has transformed some of their ways. It is noted that in Tanzania, the immigrants were frequently affected by Malaria and as a result, subsequent deaths and information on the same in 'Emet ab Kipsigis' led to an eventual pause to the emigration.\n==Post-independence==\n===Culture===\n[[File:Traditional Gourd Used by the Kipsigis tribe in kenya..jpg|left|thumb|204x204px|Milk gourd, a cultural symbol of the Kipsigis]]\nAfter the [[Lumbwa treaty]], the Kipsigis exercised a shift into Christianity and almost abandoned their culture. This took place in association with the Catholic Church which had its grounds in [[Kericho Town]] and [[Kaplong]]; [[Africa Inland Church]] which had its ground in [[Litein]] and [[Africa Gospel Church]] which had its grounds in [[Cheptenye]], Sosiot - currently [[Cheptenye Boys' High School]] and [[Cheptenye AGC church]] and also in [[Tenwek]], [[Bomet]].\n\nThe Kipsigis have ceased naming their children by ancestral reincarnation because missionaries led them to believe it was an evil practice. Birth time naming still continue and as such, boys and girls are still named by the ''\"Kip-\"'' and ''\"Chep-\"'' names which usually makes up their second name. Girls and young women have ceased to be initiated or circumcised which subsequently, has led to the loss of ''\"Tab-\"'' naming. Boys and young men still circumcise and initiate and thus the ''\"Arap-''\" naming system has been retained albeit the fact that the [[Kenyan Registra of persons|Kenyan Registra]] bodies all only for 25 characters of which the ''Arap'' title would lead to an excess, hence they only use cerfix to ''Arap'' naming system. The later version of Arap naming makes up the surname for initiated men and boys. The first names for the Kipsigis are the secular and gospel names traded from western cultures though the missionaries and pop-culture.\n\nCurrently among its youth, the Kipsigis are exercising a shift to pop culture. This is evident in the shift to initiation ceremonies held in conjunction with the various churches called ''banda en tililindo'' against the traditional ''Kipgaa''. It is also evident in the robust gospel and secular music scene unlike any in [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]].\n\nOf the many customs that Kipsigis kept and performed, the current most prominent are the circumcision and initiation of boys and marriage by elopement and thus the current Kipsigis are nothing like their ancestors. To make it worse, the Kipsigis have a high-level of security and departmentalization of information and knowledge on their customs thus leading to constant misinterpretation and attrition of their culture.\n\nThe Kipsigis view \"happiness\" as a lack of negative experiences, indicating a quiet and calm state. This convention under the [[culture and positive psychology]] studies when contrasted to other indigenous communities of the gives researchers an obstacle in obtaining a qualitative or quantitative measure of happiness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e527342012-701|title=The Quiet Clam Is Quite Calm: Transposed-Letter Neighborhood Effects in Reading|last=Johnson|first=Rebecca L.|date=2007|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==== Music, Film and written Arts ====\nContemporary Kalenjin music has long been influenced by the Kipsigis leading to [[Kericho|Kericho's]] perception as a cultural innovation center in Kenya and effectively in the Great-Lakes Region of Africa.<ref>The King of Kalenjin gospel, [https://www.nation.co.ke/counties/kericho/The-King-of-Kalenjin-gospel/3444860-1303720-14bb4evz/index.html Daily Nation]</ref> The secular music scene is the pioneering and perhaps the most decorative and celebrated in Kipsigis and effectively in Kalenjin. \n\nA song \"Chemirocha III\" collected by ethnomusicologist [[Hugh Tracey]] in 1950 from the Kipsigis tribe was written in honor of [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].

The Kipsigis people have emphasized [[male circumcision]] as a cautionary measure of preventing HIV transmissions. The Kipsigis also like many other Kenyan communities have become educated on the matter; stigma has reduced by a big margin and only limited to isolated events. The infected individuals are being actively monitored by health institutions and adhere to [[Antiviral drug|ARV medication]].\n\n==== Cancer & Carcinogenic food/drinks ====\nThe rural Kipsigis communities stereotipcally take tea several times a day and preferably at very hot temperatures (about 72 degree celcius). They also celebrate sour milk known colloqually as Mursiik and usually take it with vegetables and a thick paste of cooked maize/millet flour known colloqually as Kimyeet and Ugali in Swahili. Mursiik in particular has been highlighted by Tenwek Hospital to cause throat cancer especially in Bomet. Another thesis put forward by a district hospital in Busia, Western Kenya, points out that not only that caffeine is carcinogenic but at the intervals and volume of consumption plus the preferable temperatures of beverages such as tea and coffee are dangerous combination of risk factors causing the increasingly communial cases of various cancers and throat cancer in particular.\n\nAlthough the reports and research put forward highlights caffeine beverages and sour milk, it is also imperative to consider that a significant demographic of the Kipsigis population are popular with indegenous nubian gin brew and also with recognized alcoholic brands and thus this combination plus the pupularity of hot beverages, caffeine beverages and Mursiik could also be a risk factor to consider.\n\n===== Population Chart and Demographics =====\nIn the 2009 Kenya census, the Kipsigis population was 1,916,000 individuals; this made them the most populous tribe of Kalenjin confederation throughout the Great Lakes Region. In the 2019 Kenya census, the Kipsigis were 1, 932,000. This figure implies a plateauing pase of population growth. It is believed that this is because polygamy had been abolished until 2018; also that the Kenyan economy is slowing and life is becoming expensive due to Uhuru Kenyatta's government look east policy and extravagant borrowing.\n\n[[Bomet County|Bomet county]] is believed to have the highest life expectancy in Kenya. [[Mzee Barnabas Kiptanui Arap Rob]] who is believed to have been born in 1879 was mystified as to have achieved [[longevity]]. He died in 2017 aged 133.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.jaluo.com/?p=26171|title=Kenya: The death of one of the oldest men in Kipsigis land at the age of 133 he was a veteran of the First World War &#124; Jaluo dot Kom|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Diaspora ===\nKipsigis community today has a diapora presence predominantly in [[United States|United States of America]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[France]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], [[Tanzania]] and [[South Sudan]]. A majority of the diapora of Kipsigis origin are educated and well-qualified, usually with well-paying jobs. It is observed that like most other Kenyan diapora, the Kipsigis diaspora have a positive attitude toward Kenya and more so on the Emet ab Kipsigis.\n\nTogether with other Kalenjin elite diaspora, there is an organization called '[[Kwaneet]]' which usually operates a televised or teleconferenced programs on Kass media group.[[File:Wilson Kiprugut 1968.jpg|thumb|169x169px|Wilson Kiprugut of Kericho]]\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Mercy Cherono by Augustas Didzgalvis.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Mercy Cherono of Sotik]]\nNotable Kipsigis athletes (deceased, alive, retired and active) include:\n\n*[[Wilson Kiprugut|Wilson Kiprugut arap Chumo]], Kenya's piooneering athlete/Olympian in 1964; participated  barefoot; won a gold medal\n*[[Paul Kipsiele Koech]]\n*[[Mercy Cherono]]\n*[[Joyce Chepchumba]]\n*[[Edwin Soi|Edwin Cheruiyot Soi]]\n*[[David Kimutai|David Kimutai Rotich]]\n*[[Peter Cheruiyot Kirui]]\n*[[William Chirchir]]\n*[[John Cheruiyot Korir]]\n*[[Cornelius Chirchir]]\n*[[Lineth Chepkurui]]\n*[[Kipkurui Misoi]]\n*[[Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot]]\n*[[Hellen Chepngeno]]\n*[[Faith Kipyegon|Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon]]\n*[[Emily Chebet]]\n*[[Paskalia Chepkorir Kipkoech]]\n*[[John Korir Kipsang]]\n\nThe Kipsigis are not usually known to excel or even participate in soccer but [[Nicholas Kipkirui]] ([[Kenya national football team|Harambee Stars]] player contracted to [[Gor Mahia F.C.|Gor Mahia]]), Dominic Kiprono (contracted to [[Zoo Kericho F.C.|Zoo Kericho F.C]]) and Isaac Kipyegon (contracted to [[Zoo Kericho F.C.|Zoo Kericho F.C]]) are changing this stereotype.[[File:Paul Kipsiele Koech 2010 Memerial Van Damme.jpg|thumb|144x144px|Paul Kipsiele Koech of Sotik]]\n\n=== Agriculture and Agri-Politics ===\n\n===Politics===\n\n==== Community Politics ====\nThe Kipsigis community is a rich political arena. [[Bomet County]] has been selected by a University based in Nairobi as a jurisdiction in which its [[Political Science]] department actively monitors.  The Kipsigis present themselves in a united political front but [[Bomet County]] has been observed to promote quality politics. [[Radio broadcasting|Radio stations]] such as [[Kass fm]], [[Chamgei fm]] and [[Kitwek fm]] play a very important political role by way of hosting leaders and holding thematic political discusions.\n\nThe Kipsigis aspire to present Kenya a president. In part, some Kipsigis estimate anonymously that they have done so since [[Jomo Kenyatta]] (whom the Kipsigis sometimes refer to as ''Kipkemo'') is alleged to be the biological son to [[Chebochok Kiptonui arap Boisio]].  During Daniel Moi's regime, the Kipsigis had [[Dr. Taaitta Towett]] who was being groomed by [[Daniel Toroitich arap Moi]] to become his successor but he later defected onto a leftist front and thus Daniel Moi engaged Towett in politics of attrition. Daniel Moi thus began grooming [[Professor Jonathan Kimetet arap Ng'eno|Professor Jonathan Kimetet arap Ngeno]]. Professor Jonathan was faced with opposition by culturalists who sidelined him as a man who had been initiated through '''''Kimuutaat''''', a derogative term for the initiations held in conjunction with churches. [[William Ruto|William Kipchirchir Samoei arap Ruto]] whose origin and ethnicity is Kipsigis from the Komosi clan in [[Sigowet\u2013Soin Constituency|Sigowet-Soin]], is currently set to contend for the presidency in 2022.\n\nThe Kipsigis believe that they have supernatural impeditment to their aspiration. This including the curses made by Oorgooiik as they were bannished by British government, Christian [[Africa Inland Mission|AIM]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches and Kipsigis community followed by [[Lumbwa Treaty|Lumbwa treaty]].  Another superstitous impediment is believed to be the lost Kaplelach age-set who were decimated in River Maggori (River Migori) and thus there is an interest to demarkate a memorial cemetery for the killed soldiers. Apparently, there is a believe too that the remains of Oorgooiik in [[Nyeri]] and [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]] should be returned to Kipsigis.\n\n===== Prominent Leadership =====\n\n====== Presidency ======\n[[File:William Ruto IAEA.png|thumb|[[William Ruto|William Kipchirchir Ruto]], the [[Deputy President of Kenya]].]]\n[[William Ruto|'''Dr.''' '''William Kipchirchir Samoei araap Ruto''']] (Komosii clan): William Ruto is from the kipsigis ethnicity but largely misunderstood and/or mistaken to be of Nandi ethnicity. The ability of a Nandi tribesperson to be elected a leader in Kipsigis and vice versa highlights the unity and coperation between Kipsigis and Nandi who still see each other as the diaspora of the other and as close kin even compared to other Kalenjin. Other geopolitically (Kipsigis-Nandi) inverted leaders include Tamason Barmalel from Nandi elected MP in Chepalungu and Isaack Ruto elected MP for Chepalungu and Governor for Bomet county.\n\nWilliam Ruto was the [[Member of Parliament in Kenya|Member of Parliament]] for [[Eldoret North Constituency]], [[Cabinet Minister for Education Kenya|Cabinet Minister for Education]] and [[Cabinet Minister for Agriculture of Kenya|Cabinet Minister for Agriculture]]. He is the incurmbent [[Deputy President of Kenya]]. He has been serving in this docate since his first term between 2013 and 2017 and currently in his second term which began in 2018 and will wend in 2022. He has been deputizing the 4th president of Kenya, [[Uhuru Kenyatta|Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta]].  William Ruto has since 2017 openly hinted and since declared to contend Kenya's 2022 presidential post. \n\n====== Ambassadors ======\n\n# [[Francis Sigey]] (Kibororek): Ambassador of Kenya to Nigeria\n\n====== [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Kenya|Speaker of Parliament]] ======\n\n# [[Moses Kiprono arap Keino]] (''Kipkelezek clan''): Third Speaker of the Parliament of Kenya from 1988 until 1991\n# [[Professor Jonathan Kimetet arap Ng'eno]] (''Becherek clan''): Fourth Speaker of the Parliament of Kenya from 1991 until 1993\n\n====== Cabinet Ministers and Cabinet Secretaries ======\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Ministers of Kipsigis Ethnicity Infographic\n!Minister/Secretary\n!Photo\n!Clan\n!Period\n!Ministry\n!Government\n!Other Major Political Achievement\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[Taaitta Toweett|Dr. Taaitta Toweett]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" |''Zoigoek clan''\n|1961\n|Labour and housing\n|[[Imperial East Africa]]\n|\n|-\n|1962\n|Lands, Survey & Town Planning\n|[[Imperial East Africa]]\n|\n|-\n|1974\n|Education\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|1974\n|Housing and Social Services\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Professor Jonathan Kimetet arap Ng'eno]]\n|\n|''Becherek clan''\n|\n|Education\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|John Koech\n|\n|\n|\n|East African Community\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Franklin Bett]]\n|\n|''Mochoek Clan''\n|2008-\n|Roads and Transportation\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Davis Chirchir]]\n|\n|\n|2013-2017\n|Engineering and Petroleum\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|Eng.

The plaintiffs were more than 100,000 ethnic Kipsigis victims and the members of [[Talai Clan|Talai clan]]\n\n===== Provisions for Oorgoiik and Their Plight =====\nThe Talai clansmen returned or continued to peacefully live with Kipsigis people after independence. After the sinister campaign of AIM and Catholic church the Talai clansmen were sidelined and hated but today, they exist peacefully with the Kipsigis and take upon the identity of the Kipsigis equally like any other clansmen. Notably, the residents of Chepalungu constituency (today's [[Sotik Constituency|Sotik]] and [[Chepalungu Constituency|Chepalungu]] constituencies) voted in [[Tamason Barmalel]], the grandson of [[Koitalel Arap Samoei]], as their [[Member of Parliament|MP]] between 1969 and 1974.\n\nApparently, allocations of land made by the [[Government of Kenya|Kenyan Government]] under [[Taaitta Toweett|Taaita Towet]] and [[Daniel arap Moi]] to the Talai clansmen has been reported to be grabbed and commercialized by corrupt agents and thus, those living in Kericho live in wanting situations and poverty.[[File:Western kenya banner.jpg|center|thumb|1116x1116px|A section of the Kericho Tea farms and tea estates, part of the land annexed from the Kipsigis by the British and leased by Kenyan government to British companies (Finlay, Williamson Tea among others). Plans are underway to reclaim the land from the British government.]]\n\n===== Mau Settlement and Poltical Evictions =====\n\n====Conflicts & Violence ====\n[[File:Kenya SOC Correlations.png|thumb|An SOC correlation neural network by [[Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention|The Sentinel Project]] for factors that could trigger genocide in [[Kenya]] |269x269px]]\n\nThe Kipsigis are known to be welcoming and hospitable but with a reputation to raise alarm and mobilize militant ranks in a short response time possible if attacked. Traditionally, they used to raid Abagusii, Maasai and Luo for cattle and for adoption of entire families or villages. \nIn recent history, the Kipsigis have ceased to instigate cattle rustling (or people rustling!) as it has become an outdated and illegal practice. It is however observed that cattle rustling still occur especially in Sotik where organized goons between Abagusii and Kipsigis delinquents operate systematic cattle theft. This thus create a negative attitude among the Abagusii toward the Kipsigis and thus build up tensions that explode in conflicts most probably during post-elections. The government is also known to favour the Abagusii by giving them policing agents such as Anti-stock theft and General Service Units who arbitrarily and punitively beat up the residents of Sotik (while the real answer could most possibly be found by intensifying intelligence operations to nab the organized goons).\n\nAfter independence and with the Kalenjin consciousness, the Kipsigis along with other highland nilotes have political unity that which is the target of political dynasties.\n\nMost notably is the Mau forest government residence program that was perpetuated by Mwai Kibaki's government under the ministry of lands which saw many Kipsigis acquire land in Mau forest only for them to be forcefully evicted by the same government in 2008 and by Uhuru Kenyatta's government in 2018/2019. The evictions were violent, inconsiderate and uncompensated.\n\nAfter a comprehensive risk assessment of social, economic and political factors that increase the likelihood of genocide in Kenya, the Sentinel Project's May 2011 report identified several risk factors including; a low degree of democracy, isolation from the international community, high levels of military expenditure, severe government [[discrimination]] or active repression of native groups, socioeconomic deprivation combined with group-based [[Social inequality|inequality]] and a legacy of intergroup [[hatred]] among other risk factors.\n\n===== 1992 Skirmishes =====\nIn 1991, multi-party democracy was a contentious issue as Kikuyu people had been angered by Moi's regime and associated aggressively authoritarian rule. The Kikuyu associated Kipsigis to Daniel Moi and then demonized them as retrogressive and enemies of democracy. The Kikuyu primarily supported Kenneth Matiba and in retaliation, the Kipsigis supported Daniel Moi. \u00a0\n\nThe buildup of tension and hate resulted in pre-election ethnicity-based violence of 1992 where in Kipkelion constituencies, the Kipsigis torched houses of non-Kipsigis (excluding Nandi and other Kalenjin). This affected majorly the Kikuyu and Kisii people plus also Luo people. 5,000 people were killed and another 75,000 displaced in the [[Rift Valley Province]], with the town of [[Molo, Kenya|Molo]] being an epicenter of the violence. The conflict was primarily between the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] and [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] communities with Land ownership cited as one of key reasons for the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/73319/KENYA-Clashes-elections-and-land-church-keeps-watch-in-Molo|title=Clashes, elections and land - church keeps watch in Molo|date=19 July 2007|website=Irinnews.org|accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref> The Kisii in Kipkelion fled to Nyanza, where they found refuge among their kin. As a result, the Kisii people bordering Bureti, Sotik and Narok West constituencies retaliated against the Kipsigis. This resulted in skirmishes in the region; primarily associated with groups of fighters from both ethnicities holding sentinel.\n\nIn effect, Kipkelion for some few years was void of Kikuyu and Kisii people. After the elections, Moi won and in turn, the Kipsigis were at ease and the violence stopped.\n\n===== 2007/2008 Post-Election Violence =====\nWhile violence recorded in Sotik-Borabu and the rest of Kenya was during the post-election period, an area called Kagasiik in Sotik constituency along the Rift Valley-Nyanza boundary had already been experiencing skirmishes as early as August 2007.\n\nThe primary root for violence (post election) was the believe that the 2007 presidential elections had been rigged in favour of Mwai Kibaki and against Raila Omolo Odinga who the Kipsigis were rooting for. Strategically in 2007, Raila was receiving support from Kalenjin, Luo, Maasai and the Coastal-North Eastern peoples; it was the cutting edge support with a multitude of support and thus the rusults coming in favour of Kibaki was simply not possible. The results of the said elections are questionable to date.\n\nThe Kisii people were rooting for Mwai Kibaki. This led to tensions in the Nyaza-Rift boundary regions and in Nakuru county where the Kipsigis border or live with Kikuyu people. Immediately on 27 December 2007, skirmishes ensued in the said regions. Towns recorded ethnic cleansing war, barricading of roads with alight tyres and logs. The police were reluctant to stop the violence and in some instances, they are reported to have taken part in the violence.\n\nIn the Rift Valley - Nyanza boundary, groups armed with crude weapons had taken sentinel on both sides and were involved in confrontation and running battles. The sentinel groups on the Kisii side were reported to have martialled [[Chingororo|chingororo vigilante]] who had mastered archery skills.\n\n===== 2018 Maa-Kipsigis Skirmmishes =====\nThe Maasai and the Kipsigis have historically and traditionally antagonized each other right from and a period earlier than the Maasai era. This usually manufested as cattle raids, eventual battles and the subsequent southward thwarting and ejection of the Maasai. After Kenya's independence, there have been periodic tensions between the Maasai and the Kipsigis which have backgrounds in history and traditions and fuelled by political incitement especially during elections period. Politicians have been said to fuel the clashes with their remarks, both in public forums and on social media. In 2018 for instance, Narok County Senator [[Ledama Olekina]], part of the Maasai community, has been criticized for remarks about the evictions.<ref name=\"landportal.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://landportal.org/news/2018/09/kenya%E2%80%99s-mau-forest-evictions-balancing-conservation-human-rights-and-ethnic-clashes|title=Kenya\u2019s Mau Forest Evictions: Balancing Conservation, Human Rights, and Ethnic Clashes|date=2018-09-18|website=Land Portal|language=fr|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 particularly, the Uhuru government under the Minister of Lands evicted a section of the [[Mau Complex Settlement|Mau Complex]] settlers who are mainly of Kipsigis ethnicity. The evictions were particularly forceful, inconsiderate, inhuman and without compensation. A major section of the Maasai leaders supported the evictions and are said or known to have committed hate speech. In the wake of the polarization, the Maasai are reported to have attacked Kipsigis evictees and in retaliation, Kipsigis men in Narok and Bomet counties retaliated. The battles implored the use of crude or/and traditional weaponry including nuts (a nut used to fit to a screw fitted onto a wooden handle about a foot and a half long), spears, bows and arrows, swords and torches (or at least, petrol/gasoline and lighters).\n\nFollowing the 2018 evictions and Maasai-Kipsigis clashes, several human-rights defenders came together to file a paper in protest of the human-rights violations committed by the Kenyan government in evicting people from the forests; it said in part, ''\u201cThe actions of the Government of Kenya in forcibly evicting tens of thousands of people from forests violates a range of human rights, which are contained in international instruments to which Kenya is a State Party.\u201d''  Kenyan lawyer [[Leonard Sigey Bett]] filed a petition with the [[International Criminal Court]] at [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]] challenging the evictions.  It is however imperative to note that Environmental conservation groups generally support the eviction of people from the forest, but only if the exercise is done amicably and humanely.<ref name=\"landportal.org\"/>\n\n===Science and academia===\nIt is observed that among the Kipsigis, knowledge is measured binomially where to be thought of as knowledgeable, ''ng\u2019om'', one has to display the application of the corresponding knowledge.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/10/parental_ethnotheories_and_how_parents_in_america_differ_from_parents_everywhere.html|title=Parental ethnotheories and how parents in America differ from parents everywhere else.|last=Day|first=Nicholas|date=10 April 2013|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Taaitta Toweett|'''Dr. Taaitta Araap Toweett''']] was a Kipsigis elite and political leader.

He obtained a B.A. (1956) and B.A. (Hons) 1959 from the [[University of South Africa]]. On his return from Britain in 1957, he was appointed Community Development Officer for [[Nandi District]], the first African CDO to be recruited locally in Kenya. During this period was the editor of the Kipsigis vernacular magazine ''[[Ngalek Ap Kipsigisiek]]'', published quarterly. He was one of the eight original Africans elected to the Legislative Council in 1958 as Member for the Southern Area, a constituency comprising mainly Kipsigis and Maasai Districts. He formed [[Kalenjin Political Alliance Party]] that later on got into an alliance with [[Kenya African Democratic Union|KADU]]. He served on the Dairy Board and played a crucial role in the foundation of the co-operative movement nationally. In 1960, 1962, 1963 he attended the [[Lancaster House Conferences (Kenya)|Lancaster House Conferences]] held in [[London]] to draft Kenya's Constitution, paving the way for complete self-rule.

It also hosts [[Kericho Teachers' College]].\n\nPrimary schools within emet ab Kipsigis with a long history often bear names of cultural value. Boarding secondary/ high schools in the southern Rift region have co-ed dormitories named after heroes, heroines and/or legends. Such eponyms for co-ed dormitories include: Menya or Kisiara or Menya Kisiara, Techog or Tejog and Moi. In universities and colleges, similar to secondary schools, co-ed dormitories can bear the same names but significantly and more recently, social co-ed organizations of the Kipsigis are seen to emerge in all universities in Kenya with a context of Kalenjin unity.\n\n=== Media and information dissemination ===\nKipsigis people of Kenya use [[Safaricom]], [[Airtel Kenya|Airtel]], [[Telkom Kenya|Telkom]] and Faiba connection to access [[GSM]], [[UMTS|WCDMA]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] and fibre-optic service provision from [[Telkom Kenya|Jamii Telkom]]'s [[Faiba]]. About 8 in 10 adults among the Kipsigis own a phone of some sort. Radio is still quite popular with radio stations dedicated to the Kipsigis including Chamgei fm, Kitwek fm and. About 1 in 20 Kipsigis households have a satellite TV from startimes, [[Zuku sattellite|Zuku]], [[DStv|DSTV]], Bamba TV and [[DStv|GoTV]]. They also have access to postal services by [[posta kenya]].\n\n==== Kipsigis Media Identity ====\nIn Kenya, the Kipsigis are stereotypically known for mother tongue interference when speaking Swahili and thus, comedians in Kenya get punchlines by just speaking Swahili like the Kipsigis. The Kipsigis are primarily thought to prefer teaching, military and policing careers. Among the Kipsigis, the Bomet Kipsigis are thought to be taking up alottments in varsity placement thus in many Kenyan varsities, there is a considerable co-ed organisations of Bomet students who are characterized by browned teeth and flocking to Christian Union societies.\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n*'''[[Kipsigis Hill]]:''' Overlooking Londiani junction, the hill is sacred to the Kipsigis and of both cultural and historical importance to the Kipsigis ethnicity. It was here were the first circumcisions were practiced.\n*[[Kericho|'''Kericho town''']]''':''' The cultural centre of the Kalenjin.

They belong to the '''[[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin ethnic group]]'''  and live in close relation and association with the [[Nandi people|Nandi]]. They are structurally [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] with an amalgamation of '[[Kipsigis Genealogical Organizations|ortinwek]]' (genealogical organizations analogous to clans) from [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Okiek people|Okieik]], [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Kisii people|Kisii]], [[Luo people|Luo]]  and aboriginal ethnicities of [[Kenya]]. \n\nIn the mid [[19th century AD]], the Kipsigis were eponymized as [[Lumbwa people|'''<u>Lumbwa</u>''']] (''a name derived from [[Meru people|Ameru peoples]] for a community that was associated with [[Sirikwa culture]])''. By the [[20th century]], the term was used to identify the Kipsigis but with also a connotation to identify the [[Kwavi people|Wakuavi Maasai]] of [[Tanzania]]. Other insignificant names include: ''Kipsikis, Ilparakuyo, Baraguyu, Kwavi,'' and ''Iloikop.''\n\nThe Kipsigis people speak the [[Kipsigis language]]. This language falls under the [[Nandi\u2013Markweta languages|Nandi-Marakweta languages]] of [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]. Kipsigis language speakers therefore can or may not be able to communicate with [[P\u00f6koot language|Pokot]], [[Elgon languages|Sebei]] and [[Terik people|Terik]] tribes of Kalenjin but there is diction of words common to all Kalenjin thus a vague message can be depicted from listening closely over a period of time.\n\nThe Kipsigis together with other linguistically and culturally related tribes now identify as '''[[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]''', an identity they have been collectively using since 1950s. The Kipsigis tribe in census and other statistics are the most populous compared to their akin tribes of Kalenjin; conservative estimates point at the Kipsigis being '''31.76%''' against cumulative population of Kalenjin in Kenya, Uganda and South-Sudan while within Kenya, the Kipsigis account for about '''63%''' of Kalenjin and occupy the largest geographic zones..\n\nThe Kipsigis are explicitly and unapologetically the most sophisticated and modernized ethnic tribe among the Kalenjin confederation. Notably, the Kipsigis are the pioneering and leading cultural ambassadors of Kalenjin especially through music i.e. ''[[Emily Chepjumba track]]'' is formulated as the Kalenjin anthem in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Perhaps even among the [[Nilotic peoples]], the Kipsigis succeed or precede the [[Luo people|Luo]] in terms of westernized cultural dynamics and modernity.  One other distinguishing characteristic of the Kipsigis in contrast to other Kalenjin is their pioneering role and a dynamic communal state of being early adopters.\n\nThe Kipsigis people live predominantly in a region politically known as ''South Rift Region'' and includes [[Bomet County|Bomet county]]: ([[Sotik Constituency|Sotik]], [[Chepalungu Constituency|Chepalungu]], [[Bomet East Constituency|Bomet East]], [[Bomet Central Constituency|Bomet Central]] and [[Konoin Constituency|Konoin]] constituencies) and [[Kericho County|Kericho county]]: ([[Kipkelion East Constituency|Kipkelion East]], [[Kipkelion West Constituency|Kipkelion West]], [[Ainamoi Constituency|Ainamoi]], [[Bureti Constituency|Bureti]], [[Belgut Constituency|Belgut]] and [[Sigowet\u2013Soin Constituency|Sigowet-Soin]] constituencies). In [[Nakuru County|Nakuru county]], the Kipsigis live in [[Kuresoi North Constituency|Kuresoi North]], [[Kuresoi South Constituency|Kuresoi South]], [[Njoro Constituency|Njoro]], [[Molo Constituency|Molo]], [[Subukia Constituency|Subukia]] and [[Rongai Constituency|Rongai]] constituencies.In [[Laikipia County|Laikipia county]], a few populations of Kipsigis live in [[Laikipia West Constituency|Laikipia West constituency]]. In [[Narok County|Narok county]], the Kipsigis live in: [[Narok West Constituency|Narok West constituency]], [[Emurua Dikirr Constituency|Emurua Dikirr constituecy]] and [[Narok South Constituency|Narok South constituency]]. In [[Tanzania]], the Kipsigis live in [[Tarime District|Tarime]] and [[Mwanza Region|Mwanza]].\n\nThe traditional occupations of the Kipsigis included: Semi-pastoral herding, military expeditions and farming cereal (millet). Living on the Western Highlands at an altitude of 1500 to 2000m, the Kipsigis now also grow maize, wheat, [[pyrethrum]] and tea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africanlatitude.com/en/info/the-ancestral-peoples/the-kipsigis.html |title=The Kipsigis |website=African Latitude Safari |accessdate=15 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215102243/http://www.africanlatitude.com/en/info/the-ancestral-peoples/the-kipsigis.html |archive-date=15 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe eponymous name '''''<nowiki/>'Kipsigis'<nowiki/>''''' can be translated as <u>'prolific</u>' or <u>'the ones who bear many children</u>' where ''<nowiki/>'Kip''<nowiki/>' is the masculine name prefix and ''<nowiki/>'sigiis''' implying the process of giving birth. An initiated male is referred to as '''''Kipsigisiindet''''', although it can also refer to a woman of Kipsigis ethnicity. A woman of Kipsigis ethnicity is referred to as '''''Chepsigiisiindet'''''. A group of people of Kisigiis ethnicity are referred to as '''''Kipsigisiek'''''.\n\nIn academia, the 'Kipsigis' word or eponym has inspired the nomenclature of an extinct genus of East African antelope from the middle miocene ([[Kipsigicerus]]). Other academic terms associated with the Kipsigis include: [[Acraea sotikensis]] and [[Sotik lion|Sotik Lion]] ([[Panthera leo melanochaita]]).\n\nAccording to the Swahili traders and alien visitors, the Kipsigis would have seemed as part of the Nandi as were all the other Kalenjin tribes and in this accord, Kalenjin was referred to as Nandi-Speaking communities.\n\nLumbwa connotation being used to identify the Kipsigis can be attributed to an encounter by Meru ancestors of a people who spoke a proto-kalenjin language. This community would most probably be the [[Tugen people|Tugen]] community of Kalenjin which used to occupy a region between South of Lake Turkana and Southeast toward mount Kenya. However, after the rise of Maasai and their expeditions that followed, the Lumbwa community was displaced from mount Kenya and as later researchers tried to look for the Lumbwa community, geography and similarities would lead them to believe the Kipsigis were the Lumbwa.\n\nThe Lumbwa term among the elderly Kipsigis as of today is revered and supposed not to be mentioned supposedly because it is associated with the Lumbwa treaty with the British and also perhaps because it doesn't have a literal or historical meaning to the Kipsigis.\n\n== Genetic genealogy ==\nThere are no publicized or extensive documentation on the genetic studies carried on ethnic Kipsigis individuals. Based on their [[Nilotic]] origins from [[South Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]], it is expected that future studies will paint a Kipsigis relationship with [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Datooga people|Datooga]] and [[Okiek people|Ogiek]] as well as several other [[Nilotic]]-speaking people of [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]].\n\n=== Autosomal DNA ===\n\n=== Y-DNA ===\n\n=== Mitochondrial DNA ===\n\n=== Lactose Tolerance/Intolerance ===\n\n== Kipsigis Position and Facet to Kalenjin ==\nThe Kipsigis people are part of a confederation of  Southearstern Nilotic ethnic tribes inhibiting the highlands of [[East Africa|East Afrca]] in [[African Great Lakes|African Great Lakes Region]] known as [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]. The Kalenjin include: '''Kipsigis''', [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Tugen people|Tugen]], [[Okiek people|Okiek]], [[Marakwet people|Marakwet]], [[Sengwer people|Sengwer]], [[Sabaot people|Sabaot]], [[Terik people|Terik]], [[Pokot people|Pokot]] and [[Sebei people|Sebei]]. The confederation come about as Maliri people from Ethiopia and South Sudan migrated into Uganda and Kenya, thus interacting with the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Iraqw people|Iraqw]] (who are examined to be reminiscent to [[Sengwer people|Sengwer]]) and aboriginal inhabitants of the Great Lakes including [[Okiek people|Okiek]] and [[Oropom people|Oropom]].\n\nThe Kalenjin speak archaic languages with each tribe having its own variations but can communicate and understand each other. The Kipsigis use nomencleture similar to all the other tribes except the Marakwet whose names of persons have been inverted gender-wise; this is said to be probably because of a genocide that may have targeted males or females of the Marakwet. Theism is similar across Kalenjin and it is examined to have radiated from the Kibasisek clan originally from Marakwet. The Kibasisek clan found across most or all the Kalenjin spread the worship of the sun (Asiisian Religion). However, further examinations find the Maliri Kalenjin (Pokot and Sebei) to have faceted in former Kalenjin religion (Tororutian Religion).\n\nHeritage is almost uniform across Kalenjin but with circumcision absent in some tribes. Kalenjin can traditionally marry from within Kalenjin as if it were within each individuals tribe. Clans may be found across the various tribes and thus, for instance, the Kipsigis and the Nandi are particularly intricate thus making both seem as a single identity even to date.  Culture is similar and cultural dynamics cut across all Kalenjin. Systems of administration were similar across Kalenjin but Nandi and Kipsigis later borrowed the Laibon kingly post from the Maasai and christened it as Orkoiyot in Nandi and Oorgoiiyoot in Kipsigis.\n\n==Origin and Establishment==\n{{Main|History of the Kalenjin people}}\n\n===Origin===\nThe Kipsigis was initially a single group and identity with the Nandi until 1800 when the Nandi community was separated by a wedge of Uas Nkishu Maasai in Kipchorian River (River Nyando); the resulting community south of Nandi hills (Kipkelion) became Kipsgis.\n\n{{Quote\n|...the Kipsigis and the Nandi moved to Rongai area. The Kipsigs and the Nandi are said to have lived as a united group for about a century, but eventually were forced to separate due to antagonistic environmental. Some of these were droughts and invasion of the Maasai from Uasin Gishu.       \n|C.

Merile reverted to Southern Ethiopia. Pokotozek moved to a region between Mount Cherangany and Mount Moroto and then to Lake Baringo thus disturbing a community called [[Oropom people|Oropom]] (an aboriginal and indigenous community to the region)who thus dispersed in various directions (Turkwel excursion, Uasin Ngishu excursion which was likely adopted to the Maasai and Oropom,- an excursion which shrunk to a region they had already been occupying around Chemorongit hills and South of Mount Moroto hills). Pokotozek went on to defeat Lloikop Maasai at Baringo and thus Pokotozek broke into two, a community called [[Chok people|Chok]] or the Suk who occupied Baringo while another branch moved west and called itself [[Sebei people|Sebei]]. The Chok or Suk are then known to have transformed from being farmers into pastoralists and as the two factions developed, Chok consumed Suk and the new confederation became known as [[Pokot people|Pokot]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=M\u00e9dard|first=Claire|date=2002|title=Les Kalenjin du Kenya : entre ethnicit\u00e9 et territoire (The Kalenjin of Kenya : between ethnicity and territory)|journal=Bulletin de l'Association de g\u00e9ographes fran\u00e7ais|volume=79|issue=2|pages=199\u2013210|doi=10.3406/bagf.2002.2270|issn=0004-5322}}</ref> Neighbouring the Maliri descendant groups were the [[Lumbwa people|Lumbwa]] (although this community could have been confused for other groups such as Siger/Sengwer),<ref name=\"Fadiman 1994 83\u201389\"/> Sekker/Siger/Sengwer<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/suktheirlanguage00beecrich|title=The Suk - Their Language and Folklore|last=Beech|first=M.W.H|date=1911|publisher=The Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=[https://archive.org/details/suktheirlanguage00beecrich/page/2 2]}}</ref> and Karamojong.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=J.G.|date=1970|title=Preliminary Observation On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age|journal=The Journal of the Uganda Society|volume=34|issue=2|pages=133}}</ref> It is imperative to note that the Sebei came to call Oropom, Sirikwa. Kipsigis and the Nandi can very possibly be Sebei faction that moved to Uasin Ngishu, Iinteracted with peoples including Sirikwa (who could be Oropom or Datooga) and Chemwal (who interchangeably with Sirikwa could most probably be Iraqw or Datooga) and from here, they grew to occupy the regions they occupy today.\n\n''Linguistically, the Kipsigis language is closely related to Nandi, Keiyo (Keyo, [[Elgeyo]]), South Tugen (Tuken), and Cherangany. This thus implies a common culture bed for these communities. Thus, while Pokot and Sebei are directly descendants of Maliri, the Kipsigis, Nandi, Elgeiyo and Southern factions of Tugen may have a common ancestry.''\n[[File:Facing kerio valley from anin.jpg|thumb|196x196px|[[Kerio Valley]], where Maliri Kalenjin and Kutiit Kalenjin emerged to defeat and eject [[Maasai people|Maasai]]. Here too, the [[Iraqw people|Iraqw]] interacted intricately with the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] and [[Datooga people|Datooga]].]]\nMore than any of the other sections, the Nandi and Kipsigis, in response to Maasai expansion, borrowed from the Maasai some of the traits that would distinguish them from other Kalenjin: large-scale economic dependence on herding, military organization and aggressive cattle raiding, as well as centralized religious-political leadership. The family that established the office of [[Orkoiyot]] (warlord/diviner) among both the Nandi and Kipsigis were migrants from northern [[Chemwal people|Chemwal]] regions. By the mid-nineteenth century, both the Nandi and Kipsigis [[Kimnyole#Reconquest of Uasin Gishu|were expanding at the expense of the Maasai]]. For instance, [[Kwavi people|Kwavi Maasai]] were fought and driven away from Narok to Sang'alo by three major sub groups of the Maasai (Siria, Moi Tanik and Mburu) assisted by Kipsigis in the late 1600s, thus some found refuge among the [[Luhya people]] under the subtribe of [[Khayo]] were they facet the sub-tribe as the clan of Bakhabi.\n\n=== Sirikwa and Lumbwa Association ===\nSirikwa is a term originally coined by the Sebei people for Oropom who settled in Uganda and Western Kenya. The term is used by Kipsigis to refer to a people whose region they succeeded and were associated with [[Sirikwa culture]]. The Sirikwa to the Kipsigis would be what the Nandi called the [[Chemwal people]]. The Chemwal according to the Nandi are the ancestors of the Sengwer faction of Pokot. All these point at the [[Iraqw people]]s of Tanzania.\n\n=== Parakuyo and Kwavi Association ===\nThe Kipsigis are sometimes referred to as Parakuyo and/or Kwavi in curated articles and records. This points to the inadequate research on the extend and expanse of the Kipsigis community and their influence. The Kipsigis compared to other plain nilotes and highland Nilotes of Kenya are the most progressively advancing and westernizing community. In earlier times, the Kipsigis had attires similar to Maasai and even shared certain dialects but notably, the Kipsigis time to time had to shave their hair. The Kipsigis also did not braid their hair or dye them with ochre. The fact that some Maasai regions have Kipsigis/Kutiit/Kalenjin names thus implies that the Kipsigis community during the Maasai expansion era may have been ejected to Tanzania. It is plausible that the Parakuyo or Kwavi of Tanzania are facets of Kipsigis community or a lost Kalenjin tribe.\n\n=== Establishment of ''EMet ab Kipsigis and Circumcision'' ===\nThe Kipsigis eponym is not understood in terms of origin but the literal meaning can sound derogative although the Kipsigis themselves use it prestigiously and posteriously. The first collective population of the Kipsigis was located in Belgut, Kericho. The first circumcision was observed in Londiani, implying an eastward projection that resulted with a cultural interaction most probably with the Afro-Asiatic Iraqw who were known to the Kipsigis as Sirikwa rather than by other Kalenjin because for instance, the Nandi do not allow in the Kipsigis into their customs unless their clan belong among the Nandi or if a Kipsigis woman is married to Nandi man, she undergoes compartmentalized and secretive custom. Later projections spread south largely to Bureti.\n\nEmet ab Kipsigis was largely established by furious disciplined armies, diviners and leaders. The structures of society and system of governance were similar to those of other Kalenjin as they were copy-pasted from the Nandi.\n\nWhilst academia and archaeology find the Sirikwa as a pastoral neolithic period of the Kalenjin, among the Kipsigis, they mention living with a group of people they refer as [[Sirikwa]]. The Sirkwa are said to have dug up circular parameters where they kept their cattle and made huts on top of the parameters. It is also said that the Sirikwa had a thing about red ants, their appearance made them migrate as it was a bad omen for them. It is also told that the Sirikwa migrated southward toward Tanzania. The [[Iraqw people|Iraqw]] of [[Tanzania]] actually do confirm to be the [[Sirikwa culture|Sirikwa]] who interacted with the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] before migrating to Tanzania. The [[Sirgoik clan]] of the Kipsigis are thought to be adopted group of [[Iraqw people|Iraqw]] families.\n\n==== Statutes on Adoption ====\nThe Kipsigis did not practice or allow for adoption within members of their own tribe. Instead, foreigners, especially prisoners of war, were the only type of individuals to be adopted. Raids were not designed to capture and adopt foreign people but it was a subject of the outcome of raids as to whether the besieged would concede defeat and ask for mercy, thus they would be brought to Kipsigis land and made to undergo immigration procedures and process of customs relating to adoption called '''''Luleet''''' or '''''ko-luleet.'''''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=335|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n\nPatterns derived from cultural history led Kipsigis to adopt [[Kisii people|Kisii]] and [[Maasai people|Maasai]] peoples. This could be because the Maasai were seen as a preferable genetic pool for the Kipsigis as they had many cattle like the Kipsigis and with a heritage similar to [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] while the Kisii were seen as industrious and likely facet the Kipsigis community in terms of agriculture and farming.\n\n==== Male initiations ====\nAs a unified identity, the Kipsigis and the Nandi had not begun circumcising their males; that's until they were separated and the Nandi were introduced to circumcision by [[Sengwer people|Cheragany people]] and thus they called themselves [[Chemwal people|Chemwal]] for a period before they obtained the Nandi eponym. The Kipsigis about the same timeline were introduced to circumcision in [[Kipsigiis Hill|Londiani hill top]] in Londiani (Also called '''''Tulwaap Kipsigis'''''- Mount of the Kipsigis,  '''''Tulwaap Monyiis'''''- Mount of the penis, '''''Tulwaap Lagook'''''- Children's mountain or '''''Tulwaap Ng'etiik'''''- Mount of the uninitiated boys). It is not clearly mentioned who introduced it to the Kipsigis but it is plausible that either [[Lumbwa|Lumbwa people]] or Cherangany people are the ones who did so.\n\n==== Female initiation ====\nFemale initiation seems analogous to male initiation with most features and customs reflecting, being exactly the same or complementing features and customs performed to the males. Females initiation included surgical modification of female genitalia, seclusion and apparent segments like the one for boys. The main aim of female initiation was to turn girls into virile women. Virginity was a treasured aspect and a girl who was still a virgin during circumcision was accorded a special status by being let to 'sit in the ceremonial chair'. The distinct after mart of the female initiation was marriage.\n\nIt is however unclear when the first female circumcision took place and who introduced it to the Kipsigis.\n\n== Theism and religion ==\nThe Kipsigis observed a monotheistic version of Asisian religion where once some Kalenjin can have various deities and a major deity as Asis and/or Tororot, the Kipsigis instead have Asis as the supreme god and the other gods as artributes of Asis. This religion however may have had minor interjections to a former [[Kalenjin mythology#Earlier religion and ancient deities|Tororutian religion]] of the northern sections of Kalenjin. Theism was accompanied with no need for proof.\n\nThe ''Asisian'' religion is based on the sun ''- 'Asista','' and thus 'Asis' is an animated and personified instance of the sun. Previous translations state that ''Asis'' means the 'darlzing one' but 'to darzle' is coined by the term lili. ''Asis'' has nine attributes/names including: Asis - ''Sunny,'' Cheptalel - ''She who can be white;'' Thought of God with human nature. This attribute is coined by a legend which includes the sacrificing of girl which resulted in answer of rain after a severe drought. Cheptalel is the protagonist in the legend; Chepopkooiyo - ''She from halo;'' ''Kooiyo'' is derived from halo usually around the sun on a humid day. A halo around the sun was an important omen among the Kalenjin during war. By observing appearance of a halo before going to war, the Kalenjin would decided whether to go or not go to war. Chepopkooiyo thus implies the God of war; Chepomirchiio - ''she who leads war.'' It literally means the one who leads wars, or the god of hosts. He/she protects and leads armies. Chepkeelyen Sogool - ''she with nine legs;'' Nine is devine to the Kalenjin, it symbolizes infinity. It also has a meaning of nine rays of the sun as it rises which relates to a Maasai attribute of god called 'Isyet' with the same meaning. Chemalus - ''She who never looses/she who is wise.'' It can literally mean she who has a high intelligent quotient, never loses a riddle, always correct, never defeated. He/she is invoked in legal proceeds. Chebokimabai - ''She who dries millet.''This attribute invokes a prayer for warm and sunny climate to dry harvest of millet. Weerit Neoo - ''The eldest son;'' Cheboo - ''She who is big/large.'' Chepkochor - ''She who rises (especially to do with the sun rising)''. Tororot - ''The lifted, the promoted.''\n\n====Places of worship====\n\n*''Kaapkoros'' - Shrine\n\nThis was the common places of worship among the Kipsigis. The currently known and remembered shrines include: Kapkoros in Bomet, Kapkoros in Chepkechei, Tulwab Kipsgis ([[Mau Summit|Londiani Intersection]]) and Tulwab Bureti.\n\n*''Mabwaita'' - family altar\n\nThis was a household family altar positioned to the east of the house as one exited through the main door (the Nandi and Keiyo call it Korosyoot). It was continuously maintained and replenished by the initiated members of the household in a process called ''Kisoop mabwaiita''- ''to heal/ give life to the altar''. It is an erected structure composing of branches and vines of trees of sacred importance and purpose to the Kipsigis.\n\n*''Sach-Ooran''- Crossroads\n\n===Spiritual leaders and spiritual groups===\n\n====Tisiindet/tisiik (priest)====\nThey were men from specific clans who did not partake in war. They prayed for the community and led the processions of the harvest ceremonies.\n\n====Women====\nWomen were seen as acceptable beings to god as they bore no or less sins compared to men and thus, they believed a prayer by a woman would be granted effectively compared to a prayer by a man. This was the reason why women were the ones who prayed for their families in their homestead alter. The Kipsigis women were also rain-makers and rain chasers. they would practice a communal prayer in a river while naked and this would paranormally bring or avert rain.\n\n=== Cow Cult ===\nThe Kipsigis are observed to have explicitly seen the cow as a devine animal. A variety of products from the cow were used as sacrifice to Asis, or would convey gifts to asis. Most importantly were the tail of a cow, used to bless congregations and armies or used in prayer. A cows horn 'Lalet' could be used as a horn to call people to congregate or it could also be used to keep churned fat from milk or from roasting meat.\n\n=== Perception of Evil and Agents of Evil ===\nThe Kipsigis by the turn of 20th century had not mythologized a centralized source of evil i.e. [[Satan]]; it was believed that evil was the premise of individuals who were influenced by jealousy or evil spirits. When the missionaries of [[Africa Inland Mission|AIM]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]] reached Kipsigis, the Christian character, Satan was translated as '''''Ooiindet''''' which originally means <u>ancestors</u> to the Kalenjin; '''''Setaniiaat''''' however, a term used to refer to Satan colloquially is a borrowed word from [[Bible|The Bible]] and not related in any way to the word '''''Seetaanik''''', material implements of the '''''Oorgoiyoot''''' smeared or effected on a knobkerry of military Captains ('''''Kiptaayiiat''''').\n\n== Social and Cultural development ==\nSociety and culture among the Kipsigis was a direct product of its heritage. This thus means the culture of the Kipsigis was stifled and stringent, hardly changing. The Kipsigis have a circular view of life. They were a superstitious as well as a spiritual community. They considered all life as sacred. They believed that the natural world is all connected and that a good deed never goes unnoticed. Similarly bad deeds lead to consequences in various forms. This view ensures that all members of the community act in a morally upright manner.\n\n===Naming===\n{{Main|Kipsigis Naming System}}\nA male was given four set of names. First two after birth: the first based on time, place or weather of the time of birth, usually proceeded by a 'Kip' prefix; and a second being an attribute of a reincarnated ancestor. A third name was a borrowed name from a local hero. A fourth name was given to males after initiation which is based on the first name of the father where if the father was Kiprotich, the son would be called Arap Rotich. Naming of the females followed a similar process.\n\n=== Kipsigis Language ===\n{{Main|Kipsigis language}}\nThe Kipsigis language falls under Kuutiit cluster ([[Nandi\u2013Markweta languages|Nandi-Marakwet languages]]). It however differs from the other languages in the cluster by the following features:\n\n* Slower tempo\n* Usage of double vowels whereas the other Kuutiit languages use single vowels i.e. ''Orkoiyot'' in Nandi is termed ''Oorgoiiyoot'' in Kipsigis.\n* '''''<nowiki/>'K'''''' in Kuutiit languages is interchangeable for '''''<nowiki/>'g'''''' in Kipsigis language.\n* Conjunction '''''<nowiki/>'aap'''''' is used while the other Kuutiit use '''''<nowiki/>'ab''''''.\n\nPhonetically proper spelling as pronounced by the Kipigiis aftect some of the assumed words by the other Kalenjin such as: '''''aap''''' for '''''ab''''', '''''araap''''' for '''''arap''''', '''''Asiis''''' for '''''Asis''''', '''''laagok''''' for '''''lagok''''', '''''poiyoot''''' for '''''boiyo'''''t among others.\n\n==== A Summary of Oral Traditions and Mythologies ====\n[[File:Nandi bear 1961.png|thumb|A 1961 illustration of [[Nandi bear|Chemosi]] being hunted]]Perhaps even up to date, most if not all of the oral traditions, usually narated by a grandmother at her hut to a group of children, usually her grandchildren; are of and about a creature known as Chemosi. It has been adopted in the Western World as the Nandi Bear. It is often but not always potrayed as a canivorous beast with the ability to speak the Kipsigis or Kalenjin language. The stucture of the traditions usually begin with unrully kids who disobey the instruction of their elder siblings, parents or community members, then are lost in a forest where then, the Nandi Bear finds them, takes them to their residence, asks them to perform some musical or performed arts then roast or cook them before they are eaten but usually, the relatives and friends of the abducted arrive just in time to save them before being roasted or cooked. \n\nAmong the [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Nandi bear|Nandi Bear]] is called Chemosit, Kerit, Kododoelo, Ngoloko or Duba.\n\nIn [[Chepsongwor]], there is said to have been a dragon or an enormous reptile named Lulu which shone light at night that could be seen miles away (or at least its eggs). About 1930s, it is reported that the big-game hunters did adventure into the dragon's cave and acquire the dragon or its eggs as bounty.\n\nThere is also local speculation about a creature called [[Dingonek]]. This is a fearsome looking water creature which has features including armadillo-like leopard patterned hippo size back, head looking like a leopard's but with two large protruding fangs among other features. It was reported by the Lumbwa/Kipsigis and the Wadoko/Agiek to be seen in River Maggori. The creature was recorded to have been seen by [[Edgar Beecher Bronson]].\n\nAnother notable mystery is [[Nandi bear|Chemosi]] which from oral traditions paints an image of a human like giant with reduced intelligence, more like trolls except they don't turn to stone in sunlight. \n\nPerhaps more prevalent is what is called Mur-ngetunyit, its name literally meaning 'a darkened or blackened lion beast'. The description are sketchy and perhaps misleading where certain beasts, probably the cheetah, could be mistaken for the beast. The name however implies it could possibly be the [[black panther]].\n\n=== Arithmetics, Geo-mapping and Calendar constructs ===\n\n====Numbers and counting (''kaitosyek'')====\n1. (One): '''''Agenge''''': It has no significance\n\n2. (Two): '''''Aeng''''': It is a good number. It symbolizes marriage and is a reciprocal/multiple of the masculine number (four).\n\n3. (Three):'''''Somok''''': It is a feminine number and a feminine symbol. It was also the maximum number of acquittal for offences, the fourth resulted in death by execution.\n\n4. (Four): '''''Ang'wan''''': Four is a masculine and military number.\n\n5. (Five): '''''Muut''''': It is associated with biology and physiology i.e., five fingers on hands and feet.\n\n6. (Six): '''''Lo''''': It is a neutral number\n\n7. (Seven): '''''Tisaap''''': It is associated with the seven age sets.\n\n8. (Eight): '''''Sisit''''': It has no significance\n\n9. (Nine): '''''Sogool''':'' It is a divine number. It is also a complete number (it is the largest one's value)\n\n10. (Ten): '''''Taman''''': It is not significant as it is a round off figure i.e. 9+1\n\n'''''Kiptaman ak Sogol''''' literally means ''ten and nine'' but it means ''a thousand and one times (___ * 1001)''; although '''''Bogol''''' means and equals a hundred, '''''Bogolai''''' means or implies ''Thanks a million.''\n\n==== Astronomy ====\nThe [[Milky Way]] is known as Poit'ap kechei (literally sea of stars), the morning star - Tapoiyot, the midnight star - Kokeliet, and [[Orion's Belt|Orion's belt]] - Kakipsomok. The Milky Way was traditionally perceived as a great lake in which children are bathing and playing. However, there are indications that there was an awareness of the movement of the stars. For instance, the [[wikiwikiweb:evening star|Evening star]] is called the Okiek's star - Kipokiot, because it was by its appearance, in times past, that the wives of the [[Okiek people|Okiek]] knew that their husbands were shortly to return home. Further, there are indications that this movement of stars was sometimes linked to earthly concerns. Here, it was by the appearance or non-appearance of the [[Pleiades]] - Koremerik, that the Nandi knew whether or not to expect a good or a bad harvest. Sometimes superstitions were held regarding certain events. A [[22\u00b0 halo|halo]] - ormarichet, was traditionally said to represent a cattle stockade. At least as of the early 20th century, a [[Parhelic circle|break]] occurring on the east side was considered to be unlucky while one on the west side was seen to be lucky. A [[comet]] - cheptapisiet or kipsaruriet was at the same time regarded as the precursor of a great misfortune.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hollis|first=A.C|title=The Nandi - Their language and folklore|date=1909|publisher=The Clarendon Press|isbn=9781444605150|location=Oxford|page=100}}</ref>\n\n==== Navigation and direction ====\nThe Kipsigis would tell their location in respect to the rising place of the sun (east) and plotting the four cardinal points descriptively by their position in relation to the east. The Kipsigis are also said to have been able the navigate at night by plotting the appearance of various constellations of the stars.\n\n# Kong'asiis ak Cherongo (East and West)\n# Murot' Tai ak Murot' Katam (South and North)\n\n====Kalenjin/Kipsigis calendar====\nThe Kipsigis call a month 'Arawet', which is also the term for our satellite, the moon. A year is called 'Kenyit' which can be derived from the phrase 'Ki-nyit' meaning 'to accomplish, to fill in'. A year was marked by the order of months and more importantly by ceremonial and religious celebration of the yearly harvest which was held at the various Kapkoros (Shrines). This event being analogous to a practice observed by most of the other Africans has inspired the [[Kwanzaa|Kwanza festivities]] celebrated by predominantly by people of [[African Americans|African descent]] in the United States. Kenyit started in February. It had two seasons known as olto (pl. oltosiek) and was divided into twelve months, arawet (pl. arawek).<ref name=\"Hollis A.C 1909, p. 94\">Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p. 94</ref>  In place of a decade is the order of 'Ibinda' which is usually between 10 and 17 years. In place of a century is the completion of the age set which takes between 100 and 120 years.\n\n===== Seasons (oltosiek) =====\nThe first season of the year, olt-ap-iwot (iwotet), was the wet season and ran from March to August. The dry season, olt-ap-keme (kemeut), ran from September to February.<ref name=\"Hollis A.C 1909, p. 94\" />\n\nThe kipsunde and kipsunde oieng harvest ceremonies were held in September and October respectively to mark the change in Seasons.<ref>Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore.

For the floor, women make a sludge of cow-dung and clay soil and spread it on the floor evenly.\n\nThe homestead huts included the main hut, a hut for unwed initiated men and boys (bachelors among the Kipsigis are explicitly guys who have passed about 40 and are still single, unwed initiated youth instead are not regarded as bachelors), a makeshift hut for initiated women (occasionally). An enclosure for cattle to stay at during the night called '''''Kaaptich''''' which is/was adjusted to '''''Kaaptuguut''''', a small house for men who guarded the flocks and herds.\n\nThe main hut consisted of two sections: '''''Koima,''''' the left side of the house where women and children stayed and the '''''Injor''''', the right side of the hut where the initiated men stayed and also with the goats and sheep.\n\n=== Food, Food Security and Meal Time ===\nKipsigis people traditionally had the staple food being ''Kipsiongik''- a thick hand blended paste of millet flour (sometimes mixed with sorghum flour) cooked in a pot with water. Kipsiongik was complemented prominently with goat's meat or cow's meat. It was a taboo to eat meat and drink milk in the same meal time. Milk was usually drunk unboiled as it was a taboo to boil milk. Prominently, the Kipsigis alao processed sour milk in a gourd (colloqually : 'Sotet') by first, cleaning the gourd then secondly sooting with charred stick of the 'itet' shrub plant which has an aromatic flavour and reduces the sour taste of sour milk; third, milk is filled into the gourd and left three to ten days to brew. Milk or sour milk would preferably be mixed with bull's blood. A sheep's tail was notably eaten during tilling of land and it was primarily designated for kids. The tongue and the testicles of a cow or a goat was reserved to the most elderly men in the family. The usual and prominent herder was offered the colon of the slaughtered animal and the herder usually roasted and ate it on the slaughter place. The liver was designated to women.\n\nIn the morning, the Kipsigis made and took millet porridge, children would take it with left over Kipsiongik (mokoryet) while the older teens and adults would take it with the snack of 'Morik'. Packed meals were carried by men (notably raw millet and perhaps sometimes, a small gourd with milk).\n\n'''Masagisyeet''' was a societal food inadequacy mitigation/feeding programme targeted at children. A hungry child would go to a cross-road with a 'kissyet'-a woven plate/bowl, undress the hide garment and place on it Sereetyoot (Kikuyu grass, ''Pennisetum clandestinum'') and then would hide in a nearby bush (this saved the respective family of the child from embarrassment). Women passing by the cross-roads often with a basket of food would then naturally recognize the coded message and place some portions of food in the child's bowl. After the child noticed that food had been donated, he/she would pick the food and return to his/her duties.<ref name=\":02\" /> Apparently, if a disadvantaged family had a child who was ready for circumcision and seclusion but could not provide food, the father would take a goat or a sheep and tie it to the homestead of a well-off family, this meant and lead to an unnegotiable plea for provision of food from the later party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=280 & 281|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n\n=== Omen Reading and Interpretation (''Tartook'') ===\nKipsigis people being a superstitious group were always on the look out to identify patterns and abnormalities in various aspects of life and environment and the interpretation of the same subsequently led them to decide on what to do. These various practices were common in [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin cultures]] as it was part of their heritage. They are similar in context and practice to the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman's]] [[Augury]] and [[Haruspex]].\n\n#'''Guts/Entrails:''' Kipsigis considered the gut to be the centre of all feelings and intuitions. To predict the future, much more like the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] did, the Kipsigis would dissect the gut of an animal. It was not allowed to dissect a person so, instead, omen expertise would dissect a goat, a sheep, a cow or a bull as substitute. It was believed that somehow, the entrails and guts of a dissected animal would convey the same message of the person in question. The reading of entrails omens was done by an expert who had apprenticed on the medium and expertise of entrails omens. Entrails interpretation ranged from mundane as saying that good omens were observed from healthy animals which were well fed to more mystical expertise where an expert could tell the weather patterns, the outcome of war and the onset of disasters or prosperity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=227 & 228|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n#'''Snakes:''' The Kipsigis systematically and communally feared snakes; snakes were a source of terror (although some Kipsigis clans adopted from Kisii people keep snakes for cultural reasons). The appearance of a snake was an omen for evil intervention. It was believed that evil spirits (''Masambwaanik'') dwelt in snakes. It was also believed that snakes were a commune system for spirits of the deceased relatives from the spirit realm to the homesteads of the living. A snake which had veered into a homestead was never to be killed but instead, it was offered milk and beer to drink as a way of appeasing the evil spirit and then led out through a punched hole on the wall as it had serious paranormal consequence to let the snake through the door. If a snake crossed path with a person, that person had to cancel his/her duties for the day and embark on them the next day. A snake could be killed in the open but in the process, the person doing so was supposed not to make a mess from the savored snake's body; should a mess occur, the said person had to slaughter a goat lest he/she would fall ill and die.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=228 & 229|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n#'''Birds:'''\n##'''Woodpecker (''Kiptildilyeet''):''' If a woodpecker was heard near a homestead before a warring expedition, it was a good omen; if it were to be heard to the left side of an army during war, it was a bad omen while if it were to be heard on the right, it was a good omen.\n##'''Vulture (''Sangiit/Sanginook''):''' Should there have a sighting of vultures as armies formed procession ranks to war or cattle raids, instantly, the armies would have broken ranks and returned home, it was a very horrid omen.\n##'''''Chepkogosyot'' (Brown Hawk with a white belly):''' The appearance of the belly of this hawk during approach was an omen of abundant luck while the appearance of the brown back during approach was an omen for bad luck.\n##'''Owl (''Zuguruut''):''' Among the Kipsigis, the owl is associated with death.

The affected family or individuals moved to another kokwet.\n#'''Miscellaneous:'''\n#*'''Halo:''' The Kipsigis regarded the halo around the sun as a divine message.\n\n=== Magic and Witchcraft ===\nThe Kipsigis observed and conceived that magic and witchcraft was not part of their culture. It was also believed that it had no origin among the Kipsigis or the rest of Kalenjin. Religion and magic or witchcraft according to the Kipsigis and perhaps the whole of Kalenjin were separate thematic subject matters seen as unrelated (Asiisian religion being seen as original to Kalenjin and magic or witchcraft being alien).\n\n#'''Pooniindet:''' A witch, usually a woman, although in rare occasions, a man could be identified as a witch. A male witch was usually associated with ill effects on cattle while a female witch was usually associated with illness and death on adults and children. The motives of practice of witchcraft were based on jealousy. When a party was suspected of witchcraft, he/she was warned and rebuked. Should there have been correlated events of illness or death of people or cattle thought to be the cause of the same lady witch, then the community would summon her, have  her divorced, tied by the limbs and suspended in levitation then beaten with stinging nettles. For a man, he would be disowned and ripped off citizenship.\n#'''Chebusuryot/Chebusurenik:''' This was usually a cluster of evil women who practiced black magic. Their magic utilizes material objects such as metals, bones et cetera being placed in people thus causing erratic discomfort, ill health and death. This form of magic was never thought to be practiced by men.\n#'''Witchdoctors (Male -Kipsoogeiyoot/Kipsoogeiinik, Female - Chepsoogeiyoot/Chepsoogeiinik) : T'''hey practiced magic meant to cure people from the effects and ravages of witchcraft and spells. Their practice involved rubbing an oily substance on the gut of the ill person while casting spells. They would not practice their skills for ill purposes, even if they wanted to. The witchdoctors with elevated expertise and status were thought to be at a level to cure infertility.\n#'''Orgoinotet:''' With regard to magic, Orgoinotet is the ability to foresee and rule with paranormal powers. An Oorgoiyoot was usually a male individual who was from the Talaai genealogical organization. One of the paranormal roles was the provision of war-medicine called '''''seetanik''''' which was substance put in the knobkerrie (''kirokto'') of a '''''Kiptaiyaat,''''' an army general then sent to the general through the Oorgoiyoot's messenger, '''''Maotyoot'''.'' Specifically with provision of seetanik by the Oorgoiyoot, they obtained an eponym: '''''kipseetmet''''', because the seetanik served as insignia and the knobkerrie of the general effective or as a believe was a portal or presence of the Oorgoiyot thus <nowiki>''their heads raid in war''</nowiki>.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=241|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n\n===Clothing, ornaments and costumes===\n[[File:Lumbwa woman and girl, showing dress and ear and other ornaments.jpg|thumb|Kipsigis woman and girl in a fashion statement of their culture in 1910]]\nThe Kipsigis had a relaxed attitude to dress codes for children and thus tribal nudism among the uncircumcised youth was common. An initiated Kipsigis, especially a woman had very strict code of dressing that where right from neck down to the knee had to be clothed (usually with a hide garment). Men however were supposed to wear a garment that would conceal their groins and rears. Both men and women would adorn themselves with earrings, necklaces, bangles and bells. [[Kanga (African garment)|Shukas]] for men started becoming a common item of attire for men replacing the hides when the missionaries arrived in Kipsigis' land.\n\n=== Gender and Gender Roles ===\n\n==== Uninitiated boys ====\nBoy children among the Kipsigis were thought of as 'children of Kipsigis' and not part of Kipsigis until they had been initiated. Their roles may have included part of looking after cattle, hunting and gathering but were mainly known to engage in play, adult mock practices and apprenticeship.\n\n==== Uninitiated girls ====\nGirl children among the Kipsigis were thought of as 'children of Kipsigis' and not part of Kipsigis until they had been initiated. Their roles major included assistance with homestead duties. They would also engage in play and apprenticeship.\n\n==== Initiated men ====\nInitiated men had the main role of protecting the community as derived from the word 'Muren' for man meaning 'defender'. They can be divided into two:\n\n===== Militant men =====\nThey were the younger generation of initiated men whose ibinda had just had the latest Saget ab eito custom. Their major task was acquiring catlle from rustling expeditions for bride price and wealth. They also made up a majority of the procession ranks of the Kipsigis military but did not make military decisions.\n\n===== Elders =====\nThey were the older generations whose ibinwek had passed duties in Saget ab eito custom to the younger men. Their major role was defence and their secondary roles included leadership, guidance/counseling and decision making.\n\n==== Initiated women ====\nThey were expected to be married of and become mothers. Some would continue with the careers they had apprenticed for as diviners, healers, seers or witch doctors.\n\n==== Transgender individuals and Binary identities ====\nThe Kipsigis had individuals with binary identity by way of naming where a boy could obtain a name and identity of a female ancestor or a girl, an identity and a name of a male ancestor but at the same time, have respective masculine or feminine names according to their gender and thus their identities, although mixed were normal in both respects. There was also a context of individuals who took up the opposite gender identity especially in the context of initiation (Kamuratanet). A transgender man is known as '''''chemenjo'''''. A transgender woman is called '''''chepkwony''''' or '''''chepotipiik'''''. It is to be noted that transgender individuals were not receive surgical modification associated with gender transition but rather came to take up their identity and roles especially during initiation.\n\n=== Initiation Rites (Tuumwek) ===\nInitiation among the Kipsigis was done from childhood thought adolescences and sometimes into early adulthood. It was an analogue for today's preliminary education. It's ultimate goal was to prepare the community's youth to become hardworking, resilient and responsible adults. It also secondarily served as a means of initiating per se, children into a community of secrecy, respect and behavior of ranks and commitment to non-disclosure agreement and military-like adherence to ideals of the Kipsigis ethnicity. Another major aspect of initiation was the communal tolerance to pain and hardships.\n\nThe rites were faceted at birth, kamuratenet (circumcision & seclusion) and finally, marriage.\n\n====Age group and age set====\n\n===== Age group =====\nAge groups were patriarchal groupings of men according to the groups and time of initiation. A group of male individuals initiated together in the same seclusion home (a makeshift home for young male adults called ''Menjo'') would call themselves ''Baghuleh'' and became closer and bonded than blood brothers. The groups males iniated the same year or a year bofore or after the other called themselves ''Botuum''. Women inherited the age group of their husbands. Girls and boys did not have an age set.\n\n===== Age set =====\nKipsigis have cyclical age setting, each usually offsetting not less than 15 years. It can be viewed as a mechanism of tracking the age expectancy of the community. In order, a new age set can never be called in while an old person of the same age set is still alive; not even one. The sets are:\n\n#''Nyongi''\n#''Maina''\n#''Sawe''\n#''Chumo''\n#''Kerongoro''\n#''Kaplelach''\n#''Kipnyi'gee''\n\n====Marriage and divorce====\n=====Marriage =====\nAs with some other ceremonies, so with marriages, some details and customs varied from clan to clan but the basic customs were uniform and same across the Kipsigis community and among all the clans.<ref name=\":02\" /> At least '''eight separate ceremonies''' entailed marriage including: ''Kaayaeet/ Yaatet-aap Kooito, Kibendii Kooito, Chuutet-aap Njoor, Kekanda/ Dowry & Sueet-aap Tuuga, Rateet, Keeseet/Keipis, keeteitei Koroseek, Katunisyeet/Tororyeet and Tyegeet-aap Seguut.''<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n*'''Marriage by betrothal''': This was the marriage by means of betrothal by the groom's family and upon acceptance of the brides family, marriage would precede.\n*'''Marriage by elopement (''Choret'' - stealing)''': Elopement occurred if the groom or bride suspected that either parental sides would not allow for their marriage or if the groom did not have enough funds and status in the society.\n*'''[[Same-sex marriage#Non-sexual same-sex marriage#Kenya|Lesbian marriage (''Kitunji Toloch'')]]''': This was a marriage between a middle aged barren woman and a young woman (just completed initiation). The young woman would be respected and identified as any other wive and would get children from random men.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=126|oclc=40199906}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Atanga|first=Lilian Lem|title=Gender and language in sub-Saharan Africa|date=2013|pages=1\u201326|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-1874-2|last2=Ellece|first2=Sibonile Edith|last3=Litosseliti|first3=Lia|last4=Sunderland|first4=Jane|doi=10.1075/impact.33.01ata}}</ref>\n*'''Promisal marriage (''Kabwatereret'')''': This was a marriage organized by parents so that when the young boy and they young girl were initiated, then followed the custom of marriage (ratet)\n*'''Marriage by proxy (''Museet'')''': This is where a mother of the groom (who may have traveled or was in war) would actually marry a bride (as proxy).\n*'''Inheritance Marriage ''(Kaandiet)''''': This was the practice of man of close kinship to a deceased man would look after the widow, her children and her welfare.\n\nIn the event that a wife may have engaged in extra-marital sex and subsequently become pregnant out of wedlock, she would have been sent to her parents and bitter words exchanged, sometimes violence ensued. As an outcome, the husband could forgive her. To allow the couple to settle back with their lives, the wife's family would have to pay the husband a heifer under a custom called '''''Keeturum Saandet.'''''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin Heritage : traditional religious and social practices|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|others=Fish, Gerald W.|year= 1996|isbn=0-87808-769-9|location=Kericho, Kenya|pages=129\u2013130|oclc=35228457}}</ref>\n\nThere was an honorary ceremony called '''''Katunisyeet-aap Tororyeet''''' (which translates to marriage for might) held for a couple and their children when they had lived together peacefully and harmoniously for a long time. It involved in-law members of both sides and it was held in the home of the wife if the wife's parents were still alive or at one of the husband's age group men.\n\n=====Divorce=====\nDivorce was practiced primarily if any party was suspected or caught practicing black magic (''banisyeet''). A wife could also be divorced if they were known to have committed adultery (a man would not be accused of adultery, extramarital sex for men was common and were not seen as an offense unless they had had sex with a married woman which was a big No!-No! for the Kipsigis).\n\n====Death====\nAmong the Kipsigis, there is a mixed explanation of what death and funeral entailed. An important event before or after death was 'Kerar-geet' event which involved the delivery of an oral will by the dying individual and the proceeding interpretation of it by the kin of the dead person after his/her death.\n\nAll Kipsigis agree that funerals were not a rite of passage (tuum), but rather just that- death (''me-et'' or ''meet''). Proceeding the death of a person however, there are two explanations:\n\n*'''Laying'''- where the dead were cleaned, adorned and taken with their belongings by a single next of kin to a bush or forest and laid to rest in a very specific manner; after which the body would be left to decay and fed on by hyenas.\n*'''Burying'''- this explanation details a very specific and intricate manner of burial where a dead person would be buried at the dung heap, west of their household and laid in their graves head on to the western side so that they ''would rise to see the rising sun''.\n\nIt is argued by some Kipsigis that Laying was done to individuals who died before marrying or having children or who had a low status in the society while burials were done for rich or well defined and prestigious people.*'''Poore:''' This was a ritual among the Kipsigis where if there had been lack of births over a period of time, the elderly in the affected commune would pray for death as it was believed this would invoke birth of new members of the society.\n\n== Organization ==\n\n=== Geo-Political Organization ===\n\n==== Em/emet ====\nEm or emet, was the highest recognized geographic division among the Kipsigis. It spans a geopolitical region demarcated as being a jurisdiction of the Kipsigis entitled to ultimate sovereignty (but shared and entitled to the Nandi as well). This unit was identifiable as a political institution but the main work of civil control and administration was done by the ''kokwotinwek'' (plural of ''kokwet'').<ref>Snell, G.S, Nandi Customary Law, (Kenya Literature Bureau: 1954), p.9-10.</ref> Linguistic evidence indicates that this form of societal organization dates back to their Southern Nilotic heritage. It is believed that the Southern Nilotes of two thousand years ago cooperated in loose supra-clan groupings, called *e:m.<ref>Ehret, Christopher. An African Classical Age: Eastern & Southern Africa in World History 1000 B.C. to A.D.400. University of Virginia, 1998, p.179</ref> It was a prestigious factor and symbol of unity, peace and prosperity.\n\n===== The Office of the King (Oorgoiiyoot) =====\nOperational in Nandi, the [[Orkoiyot]] institution was communed to Kipsigis in 1890, after the ousting and assassination of [[Kimnyole|Kimnyole Arap Turgat]]. Kimnyole sent his three sons (Kipchomber arap Koilege, Arap Boisyo and Arap Buigut)<ref>{{Citation|last=Lynch|first=Gabrielle|title=African American Studies Center|chapter=Samoei, Koitalel arap|date=2011-12-08|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530173-1|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195301731.013.49880}}</ref> to Kipsigis who immediately began to establish a Kipsigis confederation, each of them establishing kingly homesteads with servants, messengers and reception parlors.\n\nThe office of the '''''Oorgoiiyoot''''' was dissolved after the [[Lumbwa Treaty|Lumbwa treaty]].\n\n==== Kokwet ====\n''Kokwet'' was the most significant political and judicial unit among the Kipsigis. The governing body of each kokwet was its ''kok'' (village council). Kokwet denotes a geographic cluster of settlement similar in concept to a village. It was established once there was a settlement pattern group of families. Such settlements were initiated by a few pioneer groups who usually were derived from men of the same genealogical organization (oret) or age group from the same seclusion home or initiation year (botuumisyek).\n\nK''ok'' elders were the local authority for allocating land for cultivation; they were the body to whom the ordinary member of the tribe would look for a decision in a dispute or problem which defied solution by direct agreement between the parties.<ref>Snell, G.S, Nandi Customary Law, (Kenya Literature Bureau: 1954), p.10</ref>\n\n===== The office of Kook (Village Sittings) =====\nThe office of the village elders was native to the Kipsigis and the elders. It consisted of retired army officers who were usually old, rich and with a reputation of wisdom in passing judgement. Their sittings were usually leisurely in the afternoon over a large pot of Nubian gin. With regard to administration and justice, a plaintiff or messengers would convey their aggrievances or messages to the elders and thus, a congregation was called on a date. Such a congregation depending on the nature could be all inclusive of the immediate community or it could only be attended by men.\n\n<br />\n\n=== Abstract Constitution ===\nThe Kipsigis observed an unwritten constitution enveloped in the Kipsigis/Kalenjin heritage under moral codes. They were narrated and explained from childhood all through life. Significantly though, they were also sang to initiates in the seclusion homes. The implicit constitution made provisions for theism, identity, expectations of various groups, management of resources, environmental provisions and moral standards\n\n==== Laws, Offenses and Penal codes ====\n=== Neighboring Communities ===\n\n===== 1. Nandiek (Nandi) =====\nThe nandi are a closely related community to the Kipsigis as they both once had a single identity. They always work together and communal decisions made in either community affects the other.\n\nBefore annexation of the Kenyan land by British (before 1890's), the Nandi bordered the Kipsigis along River Nyando (''<nowiki/>'Oino-ap Kipchorian' - River Kipchorian'') to the north while the Kipsigis lived south of the River and prominently in Belgut only to expand within a century to what is known today as South Rift  and even more extensions that had earlier on be marked and mapped by Captain ...... ('''''Kipleltiondo''''').\n\n===== 2. Kosobo / Kosobek / Kamama (Abagusii) =====\nKosobo means the land of or 'of appertaining to' the Kosobek, (Abagusii). Kosobek means an instance of a distinctive populus group of people kmown for being medicine men. Kamama means literally 'maternal uncle' or effectively, collective family of maternal uncle's family and household including the uncle.\n\nThese terms are used to implicate the Abagusii people of Western Kenya known to the Kipsigis for the love-hate relationship between the two communities. The Kamama artibute is thought to be a connotation developed by Abagusii adoptees while Kosobo or Kosobek being a friendly but distant eponym could be the original term of Kipsigis for Abagusii.\n\nThe Kipsigis held a mythology that Asis granted them absolute ownership over cattle of all the other communities and thus, conducted cattle rustling expeditions against its neighbours (except the Nandi). Abagusii were the main target of these expeditions alongside Luo and Maasai.\n\nIn the past, the most recalled event is the failed battle of Mogori where warriors of the ageset of Kaplelach were 'wiped out' at River Migori by an alliance of Abagusii, Maa and Abakusu warriors.\n\nDuring various droughts that resulted in absolute food insecurity, young Kipsigis children were barter traded for cereal and other foodstuff to the Abagusii.\n\nThere was also a practice of intermarriages between the two communities.\n\n===== 3. Lim/Liumek (Luo) =====\n\n===== 4. Masaaek (Maasai) =====\n\n===Genealogical Organization===\n{{Main|Kipsigis Genealogical Organizations}}\nKipsigis clans are exclusively a [[Oreet|Nandi system of patriachiarchal kinship]] that the Kipsigis naturally took up.\n\nThe ancestors, notably the patriarch Kakipoch, immigrated the Nandi-Kipsigis population to Uasin Ngishu county. Formulation of clan system is thought to have resulted due to interaction with Lumbwa people or perhaps Tugen people. The purpose of creating clans as it seems was to prevent marriages between individuals who share a patriarchal relationship to the third generation (marriages being mainly heterosexual but with a lesbian marriage in context). Clans also projected various professionalism and probably adopted identities where for instance, certain clans were exclusively priests, others were exclusively smiths, others exclusively hunters and gathers while others had other particular peculiarities. With the breakage of Nandi-Kipsigis unity, the Kipsigis took up the Kipsigis identity, while the Nandi took up the Chemwal identity only later to acquire Nandi eponym from the Swahili traders and the Kipsigis assuming Lumbwa eponym from scholars and British imperialists.\n\nSince, the Kipsigis went on to adopt many clans mostly from Abagusii to the effect that residents of Bomet town and its environs are exclusively Abugusii adoptees.\n\nThe totems are personified and animated identities based on mammals and birds including: lion (Ng'etundo), buffalo (Zoet), snake (Ndaret/Komut-get), hyena (Kimagetiet), baboon (M\u00d6seet), Crested Cranes (Kong'onyot), hare (Kiplekweet), Dik-Dik (Cheptirgikyet) and the dog/coyote/kayote (Ng'okto).\n\n=== Millitary Organization ===\n\n==== Millitary Formation and Organization (Oondo) ====\nThis was the responsibility and role of initiated men. There were various posts delegated to this men by custom including: those who should protect women and children at home, spies (''Yotiik'', ''Seegeik'' and ''Sogooldaiik''), the generals (Kiptayat/Kiptaiinik)and the procession ranks (''Ng'anymetyeet'', ''Pirtiich'', ''Oldimdo/Lumweet'' and ''Kipeelbany''). Each soldier in their various posts had a division among four including ''Ngetunyo, Kebeni/Kebeny'' and some other two. There were yearly mock up practice for warring called ''Kaambageet''.\n\nThe Kipsigis armies were not exclusive but all inclusive. Their response time was instantaneous but each individual assumed regular roles in the community which earned a reputation of being insurmountable.\n\n==== Weaponry and Attire of War ====\nThe arms of the fighting men usually consisted of a spear, shield, sword and club. By the late 19th century, up to four kinds of spears, representing various eras and areas were in use. In Nandi, the '''eren-gatiat''', of the Sirkwa era was still in use though only by old men. It had a short and small leaf-shaped blade with a long socketed shank and a long butt. Two types of the Maasai era spear, known as '''ngotit''', were also in use. Those of the eastern, northern and southern counties had long narrow blades with long iron butt, short socket and short shaft. Those of the central county (emgwen) had short broad blades with short iron butts. In the western counties, a spear that had a particularly small head, a long shaft and no butt was in use, it was known as '''ndirit'''.<ref>Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore.

The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.1</ref>\n\nArchery was also very much a prominent skill practiced among the Kipsigis for purposes ranging from agriculture to defense and security. There were an array of arrows for various specialties such as for shooting a bull for blood, hunting arrows and defensive arrows meant either as a deterrent by causing mortal wounds or others meant to get stuck in the victim while others were poisoned and thus each of the arrow types were used depending on the occasion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n'''''Soongoolyet,''''' an ostrich feather was a prominent headgear for the Kipsigis.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fish, Burnette C.|title=The Kalenjiin heritage : traditional religious and social practices|date=1995|publisher=Africa Gospel Church|isbn=0-9620406-6-5|location=|pages=140|oclc=40199906}}</ref>\n\n==== Discipline of Armies, Customs Associated with War and Age-related Military order ====\n\n===== Sageet-aap Eito =====\nThis was a ceremony performed for the passing out of the old generation of soldiers and the entering in of the incoming generation of soldiers. It was associated with seclusion among the parties taking part in bushes for 24 hours, initiates would sleep in the attic (''tabuut'') or outside in the forest or bushes. The ceremony was completed by sacrificing a white ox and the involved parties would wear rings made from the ox' hide called ''Tamokiet'' (if the omens read from the ox's intestines were good ). This event is likened to the pass out ceremonies of police and the army.\n\n===== Isset-aap Murenik =====\nA night before a military expedition, a prayer was made under a ceremony called '''''Isset-app Murenik''''' where god was explicitly NOT to be referred to as '''Asis''' but exclusively, '''''Chebomirchio'''''. This ceremony would sometimes be skipped especially when the armies were retaliating on an attack.\n\n=== Economic activities and Professional Organization ===\n\n==== Hunting and gathering ====\n\nHunting and gathering (Logeet) seem to also be a prominent part of culture among the Kipsigis although there is an indication that it was the culture of Ogiek Kipsigis. It included hunting various animals and birds and collection of mushrooms (Bobeek), wild honey (Kulumbenik) and honey (Kuumiik). These were the activities of men (especially the hunting part), women and children (especially the gathering part).{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Agriculture ====\n\n===== Pastoralism =====\nThe system of habitation was semi-permanent and the region of settlement was abundant of grazing grass, water and salts. This made the Kipsigis lead a miniaturized version of pastoralism, only moving when there were droughts, or when there were migration for reasons such as adventure or antagonistic reasons as disputes or omens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===== Cultivation and Farming =====\nKipsigis people practiced farming. They used to farm and grow finger millet and sorghum. Black nite shade and spider plant made up the diet of the Kipsigis implying that it was also farmed. Farming was an all gender and age activity; everyone participated in clearing, tilling and land preparation, men were the experts of planting, weeding was more of female work and harvest was all-inclusive, festive and religious event.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Skill-based professions  & Activities ====\n\n===== Medicine & Treatment =====\n\n===== Smithing =====\nBy the early 20th century, there were a number of smiths (kitongik) in Nandi who spoke both Nandi and Maasai. The smiths gave the following account of their arrival. \"After they had lost all their cattle from various causes, the [[Oropom people|Uasin Gishu Maasai]] quitted their homes and split up in different directions. Some of those who wandered into Nandi were hospitably received by Arap Sutek who was the only smith in Nandi at the time.<ref>Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p. 36</ref>\n\n===== Cereal processing/Milling and Breweries =====\nKipsigis people in earliear times used pepple and stone tools to process grain for various uses. The known tools were 'koitap-bai', meaning 'stone of millet' which was simple two stones used to grind grain by hand. Later times, the Kipsigis came to adopt a milling technology that utilized water peddle to motor a contraption of larger milling stones.\n\nNubian gin as a legacy liquor was very popular and reserved for elders only. It was also very important and used in various customs. Production of Nubian gin followed the production of cereal processing.\n\n==== Salts: Munyek/Munyuk, Ng'enda and Muyeywek (roof soot) ====\nThe Kipsigis used to rear their livestock occasionally with salts usually obtained from rocks or by having their livestock water at a stream with hard salty water usually discovered by observing red-brown slimmy slum on rocks around the water body.\n\nPregnant women would occasionally chew Ng'eenda but the Kipsigis did not join the missing link to obtain salts for their meals. In place of salts, the Kipsigis would apply roof soot, especially on preserved meat for a salty aromatic effect.\n\n==== Money ====\nThe Kipsigis did not mint their money but there is context of usage of cowrie shells among other forms of currency. Notably between the Kipsigis and Abagusii was barter trade that mainly included the exchange of agricultural produce for children or cattle.\n\n==== Flora ====\nPlants were prominent in the culture and heritage of the Kipsigis. Most importantly, plants were sacred to the Kipsigis and used some specific plants to construct an alter; explicitly, an alter was exclusively made from plants. Plants were also utilized as medical resources and the knowledge of the various plants was treasured and kept from one generation to the next.\n\n===Sports===\n\n==History (Disasters & Emergencies, Expansion, Prosperity and Orgoik)==\nThe earlier Kipsigis population occupied what would be today's [[Kipkelion East Constituency|Kipkelion East]] and [[Kipkelion West Constituency|Kipkelion West]] constituencies. In oral traditions, the Kipsigis consider [[Belgut Constituency|Belgut]] their first populous settlement. Much of Kericho and southward was occupied by [[Maasai people]], Bureti and portions of Belgut were occupied by [[Kisii people|Abagusii]] and Western portions of Belgut were occupied by the [[Luo people]]. The Kipsigis began as just a small group of Nandi people who settled in an area North of River Chemosit (Itare River) and an area South of Kipchorian River (River Nyando); and expanded within 80 years to a century to an expanse larger than today's Kipsigis' regions.\n\nThe prosperity and exansion of the Kipsigis population and jusrisdixtion was remarkable. They had thwarted Kisii people out of Kericho and driven them South to Southern portions of Bureti. They had also attritioned the Maasai claim to Kericho and drove them towards Chemosit River and then made a treaty to expand their territories South respectively. There was then sudden catastrophes including famine, starvation, rinderpest disease and the dissastrous anhilation of the men of Kaplelach age set in a failed battle, the [[battle of Maagoori]]. For sometimes thus, the Kipsigis community was in the brink of collapse but it is observed that the community swiftly adopted raft measures including the relaxation rules on [[Sociosexual orientation|sociosexuality]] and aggressive adoption of Maasai, Luo and Abagusii.\n\n=== Disastor Spell Period ===\n\n====Kaplelach Age-set and the Halocaust of Maaggoori====\n{{Main Article|Holocaust of Maaggoori}}\nThe Kaplelach ageset of between 1870 and to their anhilation in about 1890 are majorly portrayed as a generation who had issues of systematic indiscipline in war who had grown invincible and believed they would thrash any opponents. They are infamously narrated to have instigated horrid and painful ordeals on the neighboring communities. One such example is found in oral traditions of how the legion of Kaplelach armies raided a community of Maasai people and killed everyone in the affected locality, then went on to cut the ears of Maasai women so that they would get hold of the beautiful ornaments; they also cut their feet and hands to remove bells and other ornaments and left them to be eaten by crocodiles in River Amalo.\n\nTheir next target was the Abagusii community. They banded their armies together and began preparing to raid. The new difeerence from other generations was that the Kaplelach wanted to eject Abagusii and kill anyone in site while the other generations usually would just instead run stealth stock theft that ensured the besiged remained with some cattle to milk. They then defied warning of deviners and the rebuke of the elders and ventured to Abagusii land. In a covert plan and in retaliation, the Maasai had intelligence of the plans of the Kipsigis armies, they martialied an overnight vigilante of Maasai, Kuria and Abagusii guerilla warriors in River Maagoori (River Migori) and here, the stealth vigilanted cornered the Kipsigis legion and slaughtered them one by one; the major element being surprise and confusion. Out of the legion, only a bunch survived the holocaust by survival tricks or the occasional one or two left alive to narrate the ordeal to the Kipsigis people.\n\n* Techjog of Bureti after whom many dormitories of high schools within Emet ab Kipsigis are named.\n\n===Menya Arap Kisiara===\nMenya was a member of the Kapkaon clan. He is the great-grandfather to [[Johanna Ngeno]]. He is a legend among the Kipsigis people. He mitigated a treaty with the Maasai that resulted in peaceful migration of Maasai from Kaplong in Sotik all through to Trans-Mara and Narok.\n\n===Orgoik===\nThe Kipsigis had wizards who would heal and treat or read omens or foresee or bless. Such individuals included ''chepsogeiyot''- a seer and healer; and ''Motirenik''-  Masters of culture and ceremonies and ''Tisiik''- Priests. Orgoik seems to be alien to Kipsigis and with an origin in Nandi. In Kipsigis an Orgoiyot is any member of the Talai clan while in Nandi, it has a meaning of collective or paramount leader with paranormal powers.\n\nTalai clansmen were adopted to the Nandi from [[Laibon|Segelai Maasai]] who actually were also adopted by the Maasai from the [[Marakwet people|Marakwet]] faction known as [[Sengwer people|Sengwer]] who also happen to be adopted from [[Sirikwa culture|Sirikwa]] ([[Iraqw people|Iraqw]]).\n\nThe orgoik have an origin among the Maasai and are known to them as [[Laibon]]. They came to the Nandi and established themselves in Nandi but a predominant family of the Talai in Nandi, the Turgat family had three sons sent to Kipsigis: [[Arap Koilege]], [[Arap Boisyo]] and [[Arap Buiygut]]. These three are the brothers to [[Koitalel arap Samoei]]. Initially, their benefactor was [[Arap Kiroisi]]- the father to [[Mugenik]].\n\nThe three brothers would later on about 1903 be deported to Kikuyuland while their siblings and immediate families consisting of about 700 individuals were banished to [[Gwassi Constituency|Gwassi]] in Homa Bay County and stayed there excommunicated between 1934 and 1962. They were later on resettled in Kablilo, Sigowet-Soin, Kiptere, Ainamoi, Belgut and some few in Emgwen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/amp/article/200010006/the-last-laibon-of-songhor|title=The Standard|last=Digital|first=Standard|website=The Standard|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>[[File:The Nandi, their language and folk-lore (1909) (14781614624).jpg|thumb|263x263px|Kipchomber or Arap Koileke, the Chief Medicine Man of the Kipsigis, with his son, Sonaiet or Arap Kipchomber, his principal advisers, and the headmen of Bureti and Sotik.

He was instrumental for dispersing Luo people from Kiptere to [[Sondu]]. [[File:JOMO KENYATTA.JPG|thumb|Cultural attire worn by Jomo in art statue|alt=|left]]Among the Kipsigis, and perhaps among all the other Kalenjin, Arap Koilege is believed to have blessed [[Jomo Kenyatta|Kenyatta Jomo]] and handed to him his attire which included a hide, a belt colloqually called 'Kenyatet', a head gear among others after which, Koilege asked Kenyatta to visit a leader of the Maasai who was a Laibon. The attire was worn by Jomo very many ceremonial times when he was the president of Kenya.\n\n=====Chebochok Kiptonui arap Boisio=====\nChebochock was the son to [[Kimnyole|Kimyole Arap Turgat]]. After Kimyole was ousted and assainated by the [[Nandi people|Nandi]], Chebochok and his two brothers found refuge among the Kipsigis people while [[Koitalel Arap Samoei]] found refuge among the [[Tugen people]]. Chebochock Kiptonui arap Boisio settled in [[Londiani]]. He established himself a kingly estate. He empowered and commandeered Kipsigis armies to acquire land towards Laikipia.\n\nHe is reported or speculated to have fathered a boy to a widow who used to herd cattle, she was known as [[Jomo Kenyatta#Early life|Wambui]]. The boy is reported to have been named [[Jomo Kenyatta|Johnstone Peter Kamau]]. She then moved to a farm in Nyeri where she married Muigai but who later divorced her because of issues associated with [[cuckold]]ry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1913, Chebochok Kiptonui Arap Boiso and his two brothers were banished to [[Muranga County|Fort Hall]] and [[Nyeri]]. Coincidentally, Wambui was assigned the role to look after the three brothers by the Europeans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://kipsigisdictionary.weebly.com/jomo-kenyatta.html|title=Jomo Kenyatta|website=KIPSIGIS DICTIONARY|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n=====Kibuigut=====\n===Mugenik arab Sitonik===\nHe was the cousin to [[Koitalel arap Samoei]] and lived in village called Sotik to where Sotik town is currently situated.\n\nHe gave prophecies that the Kipsigis still hold in great anticipation and record. These prophecies were even recorded by [[Rafael Kipchambai arap Tabaitui]] and is usually played by [[Kass fm]] on occasion. The prophecies include:\n\n*'''Sotik police officers and station''' - where he referred that they were Kipsigis children who held what appeared to be cooking sticks but their appearance stroke fear among commons.\n*'''Sotik KCC and two bridges under color bar''' - He prophesied of two bridges where one (located at the Kisii-Sotik road, at the west periphery of Sotik town) would be exclusive to the white people while the other at Kimase, would be exclusive to the natives.\n*'''Migration of Kosobek'''- He mentioned that the Abagusii would come to Kipsigis land and live among them like vines of squash but would leave dramatically but peacefully and the Kipsigis would scramble markers on 'very beautiful huts.'\n*'''Profound migrations''' - Kipsigis people would acquire large portions of land and emigrate in two formations and direction; one toward Laikipia, and another, towards Tanzania.\n*'''Decimation of the Kipsigis people''' - That the vast Kipsigis populations of the Kipsigis will be decimated and then only limited to a very few remnants only in Bureti. He said that this would be a cause of \"an uncircumcised boy\".\n\nOther Prophecies Accounts include:\n\n*'''Gender Equality and Rights of Women:''' It was foretold that a woman would own property just like a man and would work with their male counterparts, something which at the time was not only unheard of  but unimaginable to the effect that the prophet was ridiculed for saying so.\n*'''The return of Caucasian/ British people:''' Some prophecies account for the return of Caucasian to the regions of Kipsigis (or Kenya extensively).\n*'''Kipsigis leadership:''' It is a prophecy and a curse that the Kipsigis will never be united or have a leader until the day when the corpse or remains of Kipjomber arap Koileken would be return from Nyeri to his kin in Kipsigis land.\n\n== Westernization and Colonial pereiod ==\n\n=== Westernization to Christianity ===\n\n==== Catholic Church ====\nThe [[Catholic Church]] had its sentinel at Kericho to where Kenya's second largest diocese is located in Kericho. The Catholic Church is perhaps one of the most aggressively accepted denomination among the Kipsigis because of their relaxed attitude of culture and the romanticized preservation of Kalenjin mythologies plus Christianization of Kalenjin traditional religion where aspects of religion and the Kipsigis manner of worship was taken up and accepted. For instance, a Catholic church parish is colloquially called 'Kapkoros'.\n\nOne notable priest nicknamed Chemasus by the Kipsigis is most famous for converting Kipsigis into Christianity by indoctrination that it is allowed to drink alcohol (Nubian gin in this case) but in moderacy and that Asis is the same as Yahweh thus in the Catholic parishes in Kipsigis, it is not wrong to call the Israel/Christian God Cheptalel or Asis or any other artributes of Asis.\n\n==== Africa Inland Mission====\n[[Africa Inland Mission]] established their first centers in [[Cheptenye]] in [[Belgut Constituency|Belgut]] (a church and a rescue/education center for girls/young woman rescued from female genital mutilation and initiation) and in [[Tenwek]] in [[Bomet Constituency|Bomet]]. The group later broke into [[Africa Gospel Church]]'and [[Africa Inland Church]], with the latter establishing themselves mostly among the Nandi and in Litein. [[Africa Gospel Church]] became the de facto Christian denomination especially in Belgut and in Bomet. Africa Inland Mission took a more reformatory approach where converts had to completely disassociate with traditional religion and traditional life; male adult converts were baptized with only one wives of their choice while the others would not. Unlike the Catholic church, Asiisian religion was expressly not be faceted to Christianity.\n\n==== Impact and Implications of Westernization/Christianization ====\n\n===== Heritage =====\n\n===== Culture =====\nAs a result of neglect of heritage, the culture of the Kipsigis became quickly westernized. The Kipsigis have since become the most westernized as compared to other Kalenjin and other nilotes.\n\n===== Health & Education =====\n\n===Imperial rule===\nThe Kipsigis especially of [[Cheptenye]] in [[Sosiot]] and [[Tenwek]] in Bomet had been coerced by the British through the [[Africa Inland Mission]] to give up Orgoik in exchange for scholarships and a peace treaty with British. This was easily arrived at with the leadership of Tenkwek AIM clergy, who led a propaganda against the Orgoik. The propaganda led the Kipsigis to associate the orgoik with the failures and disasters that had faced the Kipsigis including the [[failed battle of Mogori]].\n\nThe surge of negative attitude towards the orgoik led to the preparations for [[Lumbwa Treaty]]. With request from the Kipsigis, the orgoik and their families were arrested and put in Kericho cells. The Kipsigis then met at Kipkelion town, then called Lumbwa, and deliberated a treaty in the form and make of Kipsigis traditions under a custom called Muuma or Mummiat. It is detailed that the British promised together with the Kipsigis to collaborate and not harm each other then they went on to savour a dog in two parts and each party buried their half.\n\nThe British are said to have asked the Kipsigis as to what they would do with the Orgoik in Kericho and the Kipsigis asked that they be exiled and excommunicated. That day, the whole Orgoik families were exiled to Russinga Island in Kisumu. It is then said that the Orgoik cursed the Kipsigis and the Nandi (Mee Kipsigis ne-ki mee tereet, ko me Nandi ne-ki mee Sotet: May the Kipsigiss die the manner of broken pot and may the Nandi die the manner of a broken calabash)\n\nThe following were the settlement reserves for the Kipsigis:\n\nThe following include the white settlers who settled in Kipsigis land:\n\n*[[Daniel Ernest Cooper]] of Sotik\n* Laban of Kipkelion\n\n[[File:The Big Game of Africa (1910) - Lioness Sotik Plains 1909.png|thumb|264x264px|Big game in Sotik plains in 1910]]\n\n=== Big game ===\nFor some time after the Nandi resistance, the Uganda protectorate was marketed in the western nations as a wild get-away destination for Big-Game enthusiasts. The Kipsigis' land strategically had the forested Sotik plains which wild life roamed freely. The Kipsigis people at the time being called 'Lumbwa' had its warriors become porters to assist big-game hunters to kill various animals.\n[[File:T Roosevelt.jpg|left|thumb|154x154px|26th president of the US]]\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] recorded using the [[.405 Winchester|405 Whinchester ammunition]] as the effective 'cure' against the ferocious [[Panthera leo melanochaita|Sotik lion]].\n\n<br />\n\n=== Kipsigis County & Kipsigis County Council ===\n{{Main Article|Kipsigis County}}\n\n==== Cheborge arap Tengecha, Senior Chief of the Kipsigis Tribe ====\nHe was a paramount Kipsigis chief appointed by the British. This way, the Kipsigis were ruled indirectly by the British. He was appointed to the [[1961 Birthday Honours|Queens's 1961 Birthday Honours]].\n\n==== William Kimutai Martin, Secretary/Treasurer of the Kipsigis African District Council ====\nHe was appointed to the [[1960 Birthday Honours|Queen's 1960 Birthday Honours]].\n\n=== Nandi Protest of 1923 ===\nA number of factors taking place in the early 1920s led to what has come to be termed the Nandi Protest or Uprisings of 1923. It was the first expression of organized resistance by the Nandi since the [[Nandi Resistance|wars of 1905-06]].\n\nPrimary contributing factors were the land alienation of 1920 and a steep increase in taxation, taxation tripled between 1909 and 1920 and because of a change in collection date, two taxes were collected in 1921. The Kipsigis and Nandi refused to pay and this amount was deferred to 1922. Further, due to fears of a spread of [[rinderpest]] following an outbreak, a stock quarantine was imposed on the Nandi Reserve between 1921 and 1923. The Nandi, prevented from selling stock outside the Reserve, had no cash, and taxes had to go unpaid. Normally, grain shortages in Nandi were met by selling stock and buying grain. The quarantine made this impossible. The labor conscription that took place under the Northey Circulars only added to the bitterness against the [[Kenya Colony|colonial government]].\n\nAll these things contributed to a buildup of antagonism and unrest toward the government between 1920 and 1923. In 1923, the ''saget ab eito'' (sacrifice of the ox), a historically significant ceremony where leadership of the community was transferred between generations, was to take place. This ceremony had always been followed by an increased rate of cattle raiding as the now formally recognized warrior age-set sought to prove its prowess. The approach to a saget ab eito thus witnessed expressions of military fervour and for the ceremony all Nandi males would gather in one place.\n\nAlarmed at the prospect and as there was also organized protest among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] at that time, the colonial government came to believe that the [[Orkoiyot]] was planning to use the occasion of the Saget ab eito of 1923 as a cover under which to gather forces for a massive military uprising. On October 16, 1923, several days before the scheduled date for the saget ab eito, the Orkoiyot [[Barsirian Arap Manyei]] and four other elders were arrested and deported to Meru. Permission to hold the ceremony was withdrawn and it did not take place, nor has it ever taken place since. The Orkoiyot [[Barsirian Arap Manyei]] would spend the next forty years in political detention, becoming Kenya's, and possibly Africa's, longest serving political prisoner.\n\n==Independence, settlement schemes and Nyanza boundary==\nThe Kipsigis were oblivious to think about independence; they thought there was no might that would de-legitimize imperial rule for they (British) had killed [[Koitalel arap Samoei]]. Independence therefore was a magical and surprising outcome for the Kipsigis.\n\nIn 1963 however, the Kipsigis obtained loans which facilitated them to buy the white settlement schemes. 1000 Kenya shillings was equivalent to 40 acres of land.\n[[File:This is how Datooga tribe welcoming their Guest.jpg|thumb|Ethnic Datooga welcoming visitors with a dance. The Kipsigis came to consider the Datooga a lost Kalenjin tribe and thus there is an interest among many Kipsigis to visit The Datooga]]\n[[File:Datoga Skinning Hide.jpg|left|thumb|166x166px|A Datooga woman skinning a cow's hide; this is a practice similarly done by the Kalenjin in the same manner]]\nIn 1964, Kipsigis were living to the reaches of [[Nyamira|Borabu]] (in [[Abagusii]] land where the settlement schemes were located) adjacent to present Kericho county but [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Daniel Arap Moi]], [[Taita Towett]]'' (his protagonistic role in this agreement has been argued by some Kipsigis that it was because his origin is among tha Abagusii people- his clan is Zoigoek meaning they were adopted from Abagusii)'', [[Prof. Lawrence Sagini]] and the then Rift Valley province Provincial Commissioner, [[Simeon Nyachae]] agreed to move the Nyanza border to the currently known former Nyanza-Rift-valley border. The then Chepalungu (currently Sotik and Chepalungu constituencies) MP, Barmalel campaigned against this move (probably because he was a member of [[Talaai clan]] and the shift of boundary would alter his clans legacy)\n\nBy this timeline, [[Kericho]], [[Kipkelion|Lumbwa/Kipkelion]], [[Sosiot]] and [[Sotik]] were the centre points of the whole of Kipsigis.\n\nIn the 1960s, there was significant emigration of the Kipsigis in their known territory to [[Mwanza]] and [[Tarime District|Tarime]] in Tanzania because at the time, Tanzania's Ujamaa communist system was a popular alternative to the Kenyan capitalist system. The reports of a Kalenjin group in Tanzania called [[Datooga people|Datooga]] may have also enticed the Kipsigis to commune and contact the lost tribe. The findings thus far is that the Datooga share certain customs with the Kalenjin but their interaction with the Abakusu has transformed some of their ways. It is noted that in Tanzania, the immigrants were frequently affected by Malaria and as a result, subsequent deaths and information on the same in 'Emet ab Kipsigis' led to an eventual pause to the emigration.\n==Post-independence==\n===Culture===\n[[File:Traditional Gourd Used by the Kipsigis tribe in kenya..jpg|left|thumb|204x204px|Milk gourd, a cultural symbol of the Kipsigis]]\nAfter the [[Lumbwa treaty]], the Kipsigis exercised a shift into Christianity and almost abandoned their culture. This took place in association with the Catholic Church which had its grounds in [[Kericho Town]] and [[Kaplong]]; [[Africa Inland Church]] which had its ground in [[Litein]] and [[Africa Gospel Church]] which had its grounds in [[Cheptenye]], Sosiot - currently [[Cheptenye Boys' High School]] and [[Cheptenye AGC church]] and also in [[Tenwek]], [[Bomet]].\n\nThe Kipsigis have ceased naming their children by ancestral reincarnation because missionaries led them to believe it was an evil practice. Birth time naming still continue and as such, boys and girls are still named by the ''\"Kip-\"'' and ''\"Chep-\"'' names which usually makes up their second name. Girls and young women have ceased to be initiated or circumcised which subsequently, has led to the loss of ''\"Tab-\"'' naming. Boys and young men still circumcise and initiate and thus the ''\"Arap-''\" naming system has been retained albeit the fact that the [[Kenyan Registra of persons|Kenyan Registra]] bodies all only for 25 characters of which the ''Arap'' title would lead to an excess, hence they only use cerfix to ''Arap'' naming system. The later version of Arap naming makes up the surname for initiated men and boys. The first names for the Kipsigis are the secular and gospel names traded from western cultures though the missionaries and pop-culture.\n\nCurrently among its youth, the Kipsigis are exercising a shift to pop culture. This is evident in the shift to initiation ceremonies held in conjunction with the various churches called ''banda en tililindo'' against the traditional ''Kipgaa''. It is also evident in the robust gospel and secular music scene unlike any in [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]].\n\nOf the many customs that Kipsigis kept and performed, the current most prominent are the circumcision and initiation of boys and marriage by elopement and thus the current Kipsigis are nothing like their ancestors. To make it worse, the Kipsigis have a high-level of security and departmentalization of information and knowledge on their customs thus leading to constant misinterpretation and attrition of their culture.\n\nThe Kipsigis view \"happiness\" as a lack of negative experiences, indicating a quiet and calm state. This convention under the [[culture and positive psychology]] studies when contrasted to other indigenous communities of the gives researchers an obstacle in obtaining a qualitative or quantitative measure of happiness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e527342012-701|title=The Quiet Clam Is Quite Calm: Transposed-Letter Neighborhood Effects in Reading|last=Johnson|first=Rebecca L.|date=2007|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==== Music, Film and written Arts ====\nContemporary Kalenjin music has long been influenced by the Kipsigis leading to [[Kericho|Kericho's]] perception as a cultural innovation center in Kenya and effectively in the Great-Lakes Region of Africa.<ref>The King of Kalenjin gospel, [https://www.nation.co.ke/counties/kericho/The-King-of-Kalenjin-gospel/3444860-1303720-14bb4evz/index.html Daily Nation]</ref> The secular music scene is the pioneering and perhaps the most decorative and celebrated in Kipsigis and effectively in Kalenjin. \n\nA song \"Chemirocha III\" collected by ethnomusicologist [[Hugh Tracey]] in 1950 from the Kipsigis tribe was written in honor of [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].

In the cast, he takes on the role of Khiva\n\n=== Emerging Socio-cultural Trends and Dynamics ===\n\n==== HIV/AIDS ====\nIn the 1980s, some of the first reports of [[HIV]] were reported in [[Kenya]] in Mombasa and in the decades that followed, the virus has infected many people and killed many too. 1% of the Kenyan population is believed to be infected as of 2020. The Kipsigis people have emphasized [[male circumcision]] as a cautionary measure of preventing HIV transmissions. The Kipsigis also like many other Kenyan communities have become educated on the matter; stigma has reduced by a big margin and only limited to isolated events. The infected individuals are being actively monitored by health institutions and adhere to [[Antiviral drug|ARV medication]].\n\n==== Cancer & Carcinogenic food/drinks ====\nThe rural Kipsigis communities stereotipcally take tea several times a day and preferably at very hot temperatures (about 72 degree celcius). They also celebrate sour milk known colloqually as Mursiik and usually take it with vegetables and a thick paste of cooked maize/millet flour known colloqually as Kimyeet and Ugali in Swahili. Mursiik in particular has been highlighted by Tenwek Hospital to cause throat cancer especially in Bomet. Another thesis put forward by a district hospital in Busia, Western Kenya, points out that not only that caffeine is carcinogenic but at the intervals and volume of consumption plus the preferable temperatures of beverages such as tea and coffee are dangerous combination of risk factors causing the increasingly communial cases of various cancers and throat cancer in particular.\n\nAlthough the reports and research put forward highlights caffeine beverages and sour milk, it is also imperative to consider that a significant demographic of the Kipsigis population are popular with indegenous nubian gin brew and also with recognized alcoholic brands and thus this combination plus the pupularity of hot beverages, caffeine beverages and Mursiik could also be a risk factor to consider.\n\n===== Population Chart and Demographics =====\nIn the 2009 Kenya census, the Kipsigis population was 1,916,000 individuals; this made them the most populous tribe of Kalenjin confederation throughout the Great Lakes Region. In the 2019 Kenya census, the Kipsigis were 1, 932,000. This figure implies a plateauing pase of population growth. It is believed that this is because polygamy had been abolished until 2018; also that the Kenyan economy is slowing and life is becoming expensive due to Uhuru Kenyatta's government look east policy and extravagant borrowing.\n\n[[Bomet County|Bomet county]] is believed to have the highest life expectancy in Kenya. [[Mzee Barnabas Kiptanui Arap Rob]] who is believed to have been born in 1879 was mystified as to have achieved [[longevity]]. He died in 2017 aged 133.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.jaluo.com/?p=26171|title=Kenya: The death of one of the oldest men in Kipsigis land at the age of 133 he was a veteran of the First World War &#124; Jaluo dot Kom|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Diaspora ===\nKipsigis community today has a diapora presence predominantly in [[United States|United States of America]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[France]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], [[Tanzania]] and [[South Sudan]]. A majority of the diapora of Kipsigis origin are educated and well-qualified, usually with well-paying jobs. It is observed that like most other Kenyan diapora, the Kipsigis diaspora have a positive attitude toward Kenya and more so on the Emet ab Kipsigis.\n\nTogether with other Kalenjin elite diaspora, there is an organization called '[[Kwaneet]]' which usually operates a televised or teleconferenced programs on Kass media group.[[File:Wilson Kiprugut 1968.jpg|thumb|169x169px|Wilson Kiprugut of Kericho]]\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Mercy Cherono by Augustas Didzgalvis.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Mercy Cherono of Sotik]]\nNotable Kipsigis athletes (deceased, alive, retired and active) include:\n\n*[[Wilson Kiprugut|Wilson Kiprugut arap Chumo]], Kenya's piooneering athlete/Olympian in 1964; participated  barefoot; won a gold medal\n*[[Paul Kipsiele Koech]]\n*[[Mercy Cherono]]\n*[[Joyce Chepchumba]]\n*[[Edwin Soi|Edwin Cheruiyot Soi]]\n*[[David Kimutai|David Kimutai Rotich]]\n*[[Peter Cheruiyot Kirui]]\n*[[William Chirchir]]\n*[[John Cheruiyot Korir]]\n*[[Cornelius Chirchir]]\n*[[Lineth Chepkurui]]\n*[[Kipkurui Misoi]]\n*[[Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot]]\n*[[Hellen Chepngeno]]\n*[[Faith Kipyegon|Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon]]\n*[[Emily Chebet]]\n*[[Paskalia Chepkorir Kipkoech]]\n*[[John Korir Kipsang]]\n\nThe Kipsigis are not usually known to excel or even participate in soccer but [[Nicholas Kipkirui]] ([[Kenya national football team|Harambee Stars]] player contracted to [[Gor Mahia F.C.|Gor Mahia]]), Dominic Kiprono (contracted to [[Zoo Kericho F.C.|Zoo Kericho F.C]]) and Isaac Kipyegon (contracted to [[Zoo Kericho F.C.|Zoo Kericho F.C]]) are changing this stereotype.[[File:Paul Kipsiele Koech 2010 Memerial Van Damme.jpg|thumb|144x144px|Paul Kipsiele Koech of Sotik]]\n\n=== Agriculture and Agri-Politics ===\n\n===Politics===\n\n==== Community Politics ====\nThe Kipsigis community is a rich political arena. [[Bomet County]] has been selected by a University based in Nairobi as a jurisdiction in which its [[Political Science]] department actively monitors.  The Kipsigis present themselves in a united political front but [[Bomet County]] has been observed to promote quality politics. [[Radio broadcasting|Radio stations]] such as [[Kass fm]], [[Chamgei fm]] and [[Kitwek fm]] play a very important political role by way of hosting leaders and holding thematic political discusions.\n\nThe Kipsigis aspire to present Kenya a president. In part, some Kipsigis estimate anonymously that they have done so since [[Jomo Kenyatta]] (whom the Kipsigis sometimes refer to as ''Kipkemo'') is alleged to be the biological son to [[Chebochok Kiptonui arap Boisio]].  During Daniel Moi's regime, the Kipsigis had [[Dr. Taaitta Towett]] who was being groomed by [[Daniel Toroitich arap Moi]] to become his successor but he later defected onto a leftist front and thus Daniel Moi engaged Towett in politics of attrition. Daniel Moi thus began grooming [[Professor Jonathan Kimetet arap Ng'eno|Professor Jonathan Kimetet arap Ngeno]]. Professor Jonathan was faced with opposition by culturalists who sidelined him as a man who had been initiated through '''''Kimuutaat''''', a derogative term for the initiations held in conjunction with churches. [[William Ruto|William Kipchirchir Samoei arap Ruto]] whose origin and ethnicity is Kipsigis from the Komosi clan in [[Sigowet\u2013Soin Constituency|Sigowet-Soin]], is currently set to contend for the presidency in 2022.\n\nThe Kipsigis believe that they have supernatural impeditment to their aspiration. This including the curses made by Oorgooiik as they were bannished by British government, Christian [[Africa Inland Mission|AIM]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches and Kipsigis community followed by [[Lumbwa Treaty|Lumbwa treaty]].  Another superstitous impediment is believed to be the lost Kaplelach age-set who were decimated in River Maggori (River Migori) and thus there is an interest to demarkate a memorial cemetery for the killed soldiers. Apparently, there is a believe too that the remains of Oorgooiik in [[Nyeri]] and [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]] should be returned to Kipsigis.\n\n===== Prominent Leadership =====\n\n====== Presidency ======\n[[File:William Ruto IAEA.png|thumb|[[William Ruto|William Kipchirchir Ruto]], the [[Deputy President of Kenya]].]]\n[[William Ruto|'''Dr.''' '''William Kipchirchir Samoei araap Ruto''']] (Komosii clan): William Ruto is from the kipsigis ethnicity but largely misunderstood and/or mistaken to be of Nandi ethnicity. The ability of a Nandi tribesperson to be elected a leader in Kipsigis and vice versa highlights the unity and coperation between Kipsigis and Nandi who still see each other as the diaspora of the other and as close kin even compared to other Kalenjin. Other geopolitically (Kipsigis-Nandi) inverted leaders include Tamason Barmalel from Nandi elected MP in Chepalungu and Isaack Ruto elected MP for Chepalungu and Governor for Bomet county.\n\nWilliam Ruto was the [[Member of Parliament in Kenya|Member of Parliament]] for [[Eldoret North Constituency]], [[Cabinet Minister for Education Kenya|Cabinet Minister for Education]] and [[Cabinet Minister for Agriculture of Kenya|Cabinet Minister for Agriculture]]. He is the incurmbent [[Deputy President of Kenya]]. He has been serving in this docate since his first term between 2013 and 2017 and currently in his second term which began in 2018 and will wend in 2022. He has been deputizing the 4th president of Kenya, [[Uhuru Kenyatta|Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta]].  William Ruto has since 2017 openly hinted and since declared to contend Kenya's 2022 presidential post. \n\n====== Ambassadors ======\n\n# [[Francis Sigey]] (Kibororek): Ambassador of Kenya to Nigeria\n\n====== [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Kenya|Speaker of Parliament]] ======\n\n# [[Moses Kiprono arap Keino]] (''Kipkelezek clan''): Third Speaker of the Parliament of Kenya from 1988 until 1991\n# [[Professor Jonathan Kimetet arap Ng'eno]] (''Becherek clan''): Fourth Speaker of the Parliament of Kenya from 1991 until 1993\n\n====== Cabinet Ministers and Cabinet Secretaries ======\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Ministers of Kipsigis Ethnicity Infographic\n!Minister/Secretary\n!Photo\n!Clan\n!Period\n!Ministry\n!Government\n!Other Major Political Achievement\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[Taaitta Toweett|Dr. Taaitta Toweett]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" |''Zoigoek clan''\n|1961\n|Labour and housing\n|[[Imperial East Africa]]\n|\n|-\n|1962\n|Lands, Survey & Town Planning\n|[[Imperial East Africa]]\n|\n|-\n|1974\n|Education\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|1974\n|Housing and Social Services\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Professor Jonathan Kimetet arap Ng'eno]]\n|\n|''Becherek clan''\n|\n|Education\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|John Koech\n|\n|\n|\n|East African Community\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Franklin Bett]]\n|\n|''Mochoek Clan''\n|2008-\n|Roads and Transportation\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Davis Chirchir]]\n|\n|\n|2013-2017\n|Engineering and Petroleum\n|[[Government of Kenya]]\n|\n|-\n|Eng.

The plaintiffs were more than 100,000 ethnic Kipsigis victims and the members of [[Talai Clan|Talai clan]]\n\n===== Provisions for Oorgoiik and Their Plight =====\nThe Talai clansmen returned or continued to peacefully live with Kipsigis people after independence. After the sinister campaign of AIM and Catholic church the Talai clansmen were sidelined and hated but today, they exist peacefully with the Kipsigis and take upon the identity of the Kipsigis equally like any other clansmen. Notably, the residents of Chepalungu constituency (today's [[Sotik Constituency|Sotik]] and [[Chepalungu Constituency|Chepalungu]] constituencies) voted in [[Tamason Barmalel]], the grandson of [[Koitalel Arap Samoei]], as their [[Member of Parliament|MP]] between 1969 and 1974.\n\nApparently, allocations of land made by the [[Government of Kenya|Kenyan Government]] under [[Taaitta Toweett|Taaita Towet]] and [[Daniel arap Moi]] to the Talai clansmen has been reported to be grabbed and commercialized by corrupt agents and thus, those living in Kericho live in wanting situations and poverty.[[File:Western kenya banner.jpg|center|thumb|1116x1116px|A section of the Kericho Tea farms and tea estates, part of the land annexed from the Kipsigis by the British and leased by Kenyan government to British companies (Finlay, Williamson Tea among others). Plans are underway to reclaim the land from the British government.]]\n\n===== Mau Settlement and Poltical Evictions =====\n\n====Conflicts & Violence ====\n[[File:Kenya SOC Correlations.png|thumb|An SOC correlation neural network by [[Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention|The Sentinel Project]] for factors that could trigger genocide in [[Kenya]] |269x269px]]\n\nThe Kipsigis are known to be welcoming and hospitable but with a reputation to raise alarm and mobilize militant ranks in a short response time possible if attacked. Traditionally, they used to raid Abagusii, Maasai and Luo for cattle and for adoption of entire families or villages. \nIn recent history, the Kipsigis have ceased to instigate cattle rustling (or people rustling!) as it has become an outdated and illegal practice. It is however observed that cattle rustling still occur especially in Sotik where organized goons between Abagusii and Kipsigis delinquents operate systematic cattle theft. This thus create a negative attitude among the Abagusii toward the Kipsigis and thus build up tensions that explode in conflicts most probably during post-elections. The government is also known to favour the Abagusii by giving them policing agents such as Anti-stock theft and General Service Units who arbitrarily and punitively beat up the residents of Sotik (while the real answer could most possibly be found by intensifying intelligence operations to nab the organized goons).\n\nAfter independence and with the Kalenjin consciousness, the Kipsigis along with other highland nilotes have political unity that which is the target of political dynasties.\n\nMost notably is the Mau forest government residence program that was perpetuated by Mwai Kibaki's government under the ministry of lands which saw many Kipsigis acquire land in Mau forest only for them to be forcefully evicted by the same government in 2008 and by Uhuru Kenyatta's government in 2018/2019. The evictions were violent, inconsiderate and uncompensated.\n\nAfter a comprehensive risk assessment of social, economic and political factors that increase the likelihood of genocide in Kenya, the Sentinel Project's May 2011 report identified several risk factors including; a low degree of democracy, isolation from the international community, high levels of military expenditure, severe government [[discrimination]] or active repression of native groups, socioeconomic deprivation combined with group-based [[Social inequality|inequality]] and a legacy of intergroup [[hatred]] among other risk factors.\n\n===== 1992 Skirmishes =====\nIn 1991, multi-party democracy was a contentious issue as Kikuyu people had been angered by Moi's regime and associated aggressively authoritarian rule. The Kikuyu associated Kipsigis to Daniel Moi and then demonized them as retrogressive and enemies of democracy. The Kikuyu primarily supported Kenneth Matiba and in retaliation, the Kipsigis supported Daniel Moi. \u00a0\n\nThe buildup of tension and hate resulted in pre-election ethnicity-based violence of 1992 where in Kipkelion constituencies, the Kipsigis torched houses of non-Kipsigis (excluding Nandi and other Kalenjin). This affected majorly the Kikuyu and Kisii people plus also Luo people. 5,000 people were killed and another 75,000 displaced in the [[Rift Valley Province]], with the town of [[Molo, Kenya|Molo]] being an epicenter of the violence. The conflict was primarily between the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] and [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] communities with Land ownership cited as one of key reasons for the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/73319/KENYA-Clashes-elections-and-land-church-keeps-watch-in-Molo|title=Clashes, elections and land - church keeps watch in Molo|date=19 July 2007|website=Irinnews.org|accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref> The Kisii in Kipkelion fled to Nyanza, where they found refuge among their kin. As a result, the Kisii people bordering Bureti, Sotik and Narok West constituencies retaliated against the Kipsigis. This resulted in skirmishes in the region; primarily associated with groups of fighters from both ethnicities holding sentinel.\n\nIn effect, Kipkelion for some few years was void of Kikuyu and Kisii people. After the elections, Moi won and in turn, the Kipsigis were at ease and the violence stopped.\n\n===== 2007/2008 Post-Election Violence =====\nWhile violence recorded in Sotik-Borabu and the rest of Kenya was during the post-election period, an area called Kagasiik in Sotik constituency along the Rift Valley-Nyanza boundary had already been experiencing skirmishes as early as August 2007.\n\nThe primary root for violence (post election) was the believe that the 2007 presidential elections had been rigged in favour of Mwai Kibaki and against Raila Omolo Odinga who the Kipsigis were rooting for. Strategically in 2007, Raila was receiving support from Kalenjin, Luo, Maasai and the Coastal-North Eastern peoples; it was the cutting edge support with a multitude of support and thus the rusults coming in favour of Kibaki was simply not possible. The results of the said elections are questionable to date.\n\nThe Kisii people were rooting for Mwai Kibaki. This led to tensions in the Nyaza-Rift boundary regions and in Nakuru county where the Kipsigis border or live with Kikuyu people. Immediately on 27 December 2007, skirmishes ensued in the said regions. Towns recorded ethnic cleansing war, barricading of roads with alight tyres and logs. The police were reluctant to stop the violence and in some instances, they are reported to have taken part in the violence.\n\nIn the Rift Valley - Nyanza boundary, groups armed with crude weapons had taken sentinel on both sides and were involved in confrontation and running battles. The sentinel groups on the Kisii side were reported to have martialled [[Chingororo|chingororo vigilante]] who had mastered archery skills.\n\n===== 2018 Maa-Kipsigis Skirmmishes =====\nThe Maasai and the Kipsigis have historically and traditionally antagonized each other right from and a period earlier than the Maasai era. This usually manufested as cattle raids, eventual battles and the subsequent southward thwarting and ejection of the Maasai. After Kenya's independence, there have been periodic tensions between the Maasai and the Kipsigis which have backgrounds in history and traditions and fuelled by political incitement especially during elections period. Politicians have been said to fuel the clashes with their remarks, both in public forums and on social media. In 2018 for instance, Narok County Senator [[Ledama Olekina]], part of the Maasai community, has been criticized for remarks about the evictions.<ref name=\"landportal.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://landportal.org/news/2018/09/kenya%E2%80%99s-mau-forest-evictions-balancing-conservation-human-rights-and-ethnic-clashes|title=Kenya\u2019s Mau Forest Evictions: Balancing Conservation, Human Rights, and Ethnic Clashes|date=2018-09-18|website=Land Portal|language=fr|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 particularly, the Uhuru government under the Minister of Lands evicted a section of the [[Mau Complex Settlement|Mau Complex]] settlers who are mainly of Kipsigis ethnicity. The evictions were particularly forceful, inconsiderate, inhuman and without compensation. A major section of the Maasai leaders supported the evictions and are said or known to have committed hate speech. In the wake of the polarization, the Maasai are reported to have attacked Kipsigis evictees and in retaliation, Kipsigis men in Narok and Bomet counties retaliated. The battles implored the use of crude or/and traditional weaponry including nuts (a nut used to fit to a screw fitted onto a wooden handle about a foot and a half long), spears, bows and arrows, swords and torches (or at least, petrol/gasoline and lighters).\n\nFollowing the 2018 evictions and Maasai-Kipsigis clashes, several human-rights defenders came together to file a paper in protest of the human-rights violations committed by the Kenyan government in evicting people from the forests; it said in part, ''\u201cThe actions of the Government of Kenya in forcibly evicting tens of thousands of people from forests violates a range of human rights, which are contained in international instruments to which Kenya is a State Party.\u201d''  Kenyan lawyer [[Leonard Sigey Bett]] filed a petition with the [[International Criminal Court]] at [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]] challenging the evictions.  It is however imperative to note that Environmental conservation groups generally support the eviction of people from the forest, but only if the exercise is done amicably and humanely.<ref name=\"landportal.org\"/>\n\n===Science and academia===\nIt is observed that among the Kipsigis, knowledge is measured binomially where to be thought of as knowledgeable, ''ng\u2019om'', one has to display the application of the corresponding knowledge.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/10/parental_ethnotheories_and_how_parents_in_america_differ_from_parents_everywhere.html|title=Parental ethnotheories and how parents in America differ from parents everywhere else.|last=Day|first=Nicholas|date=10 April 2013|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Taaitta Toweett|'''Dr. Taaitta Araap Toweett''']] was a Kipsigis elite and political leader.

He obtained a B.A. (1956) and B.A. (Hons) 1959 from the [[University of South Africa]]. On his return from Britain in 1957, he was appointed Community Development Officer for [[Nandi District]], the first African CDO to be recruited locally in Kenya. During this period was the editor of the Kipsigis vernacular magazine ''[[Ngalek Ap Kipsigisiek]]'', published quarterly. He was one of the eight original Africans elected to the Legislative Council in 1958 as Member for the Southern Area, a constituency comprising mainly Kipsigis and Maasai Districts. He formed [[Kalenjin Political Alliance Party]] that later on got into an alliance with [[Kenya African Democratic Union|KADU]]. He served on the Dairy Board and played a crucial role in the foundation of the co-operative movement nationally. In 1960, 1962, 1963 he attended the [[Lancaster House Conferences (Kenya)|Lancaster House Conferences]] held in [[London]] to draft Kenya's Constitution, paving the way for complete self-rule.

He was also elected President of the 19th General Assembly of [[UNESCO]] (1976\u201378). In 1977, he finished his Ph.D. thesis on '''\u201cA Study Of  Kalenjin Linguistics\u201d'''. In 1980, he was appointed as the chairperson of [[Kenya Literature Bureau|Kenya Literature Bereau]]. In 1983\u20131985, he served as the Charperson, [[Kenya Airways]] after which he was appointed the chairperson, [[Kenya Seed Company]].

It also hosts [[Kericho Teachers' College]].\n\nPrimary schools within emet ab Kipsigis with a long history often bear names of cultural value. Boarding secondary/ high schools in the southern Rift region have co-ed dormitories named after heroes, heroines and/or legends. Such eponyms for co-ed dormitories include: Menya or Kisiara or Menya Kisiara, Techog or Tejog and Moi. In universities and colleges, similar to secondary schools, co-ed dormitories can bear the same names but significantly and more recently, social co-ed organizations of the Kipsigis are seen to emerge in all universities in Kenya with a context of Kalenjin unity.\n\n=== Media and information dissemination ===\nKipsigis people of Kenya use [[Safaricom]], [[Airtel Kenya|Airtel]], [[Telkom Kenya|Telkom]] and Faiba connection to access [[GSM]], [[UMTS|WCDMA]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] and fibre-optic service provision from [[Telkom Kenya|Jamii Telkom]]'s [[Faiba]]. About 8 in 10 adults among the Kipsigis own a phone of some sort. Radio is still quite popular with radio stations dedicated to the Kipsigis including Chamgei fm, Kitwek fm and. About 1 in 20 Kipsigis households have a satellite TV from startimes, [[Zuku sattellite|Zuku]], [[DStv|DSTV]], Bamba TV and [[DStv|GoTV]]. They also have access to postal services by [[posta kenya]].\n\n==== Kipsigis Media Identity ====\nIn Kenya, the Kipsigis are stereotypically known for mother tongue interference when speaking Swahili and thus, comedians in Kenya get punchlines by just speaking Swahili like the Kipsigis. The Kipsigis are primarily thought to prefer teaching, military and policing careers. Among the Kipsigis, the Bomet Kipsigis are thought to be taking up alottments in varsity placement thus in many Kenyan varsities, there is a considerable co-ed organisations of Bomet students who are characterized by browned teeth and flocking to Christian Union societies.\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n*'''[[Kipsigis Hill]]:''' Overlooking Londiani junction, the hill is sacred to the Kipsigis and of both cultural and historical importance to the Kipsigis ethnicity. It was here were the first circumcisions were practiced.\n*[[Kericho|'''Kericho town''']]''':''' The cultural centre of the Kalenjin.

[[Chandarana Records]], a pioneer of [[Benga music]] and the Kenyan music recording industry is based in Kericho town. \n*'''[[Sotik town]]:''' The home of the Kipsigis prophet, Mugenik. It was built by Indians and Europeans as an agricultural center.\n*'''[[Sosiot|Sosiot town]]''': Located in Belgut, Sosiot is an old town that hosts Cheptenye community thus making it the one of the centers where the Kipsigis were reached and received Christianity.\n*'''[[Bomet|Bomet town]]:''' Formerly known as '''''Soot''''', it is the Capital of [[Bomet County]] and the [[Sister city|Sister City]] to [[Milwaukee]]. It hosts [[Tenwek community]] ([[Tenwek Hospital]], [[Tenwek Boys' High School]], [[Chebonei Girls' High School]], [[Tenwek Africa Gospel Church]] and [[Tenwek Hydroelectric dam]]) that was established by [[Africa Inland Mission]] and currently associated and branded by [[Africa Gospel Church]].\n*'''[[Fort Ternan]]:''' A prehistoric site where [[Kenyapithecus]] fossils were first discovered by [[Louis Leakey]] in 1962. There is a museum about 15&nbsp;km from Fort Ternan Town.\n*'''[[Kapkatet town]]''': The current centre of Kipsigis community.
