The font is a major masterpiece of [[Mosan art]], remarkable for the classicism of its style, whose origin has been the subject of great debate among [[art historian]]s. The [[Meuse River]] valley in modern Belgium and France, roughly coterminous with the [[Diocese of Li\u00e8ge]], was the leading 12th-century centre of Romanesque metalwork, which was still the most prestigious medium in art.\n\n==History==\nThe Li\u00e8ge font was commissioned after 1107 and completed by 1118 for the church of Notre-Dame-aux-Fonts (\"[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]]'s with the font\"), which abutted [[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Li\u00e8ge|the old Li\u00e8ge Cathedral]] and functioned as the [[baptistry]] for the city.<ref>Beckwith, 178. See Xhayet and Halleux, 123, note 17 for a fuller account of the status of the church and its priest.</ref> These dates are based on the period of office of the Abb\u00e9 Hellin, parish priest of the church, known to have commissioned it, for in his obituary in the contemporary ''{{lang|la|Chronicon Rythmicum Leodiense}}'' ({{lang-en|Li\u00e8ge Rhyming Chronicle}}) the font is clearly described, though with no mention of the artist.<ref>Xhayet and Halleux, 21 (quotes chronicle) and 122\u2013123</ref>  Both cathedral and church were destroyed during the French Revolution, and the font was hidden for safe-keeping before being moved to its present location in 1804. The Li\u00e8ge chronicle describes a cover with figures of the [[Four Evangelists]] and prophets, presumably also in metal, which was lost during the Revolution, along with  two of the supporting oxen.<ref>Xhayet and Halleux, 21 and 123 and Li\u00e8ge City Tourism</ref>  The present stone plinth and setting replaced in the 20th century a solid round stone one built in 1804.<ref>{{citation|first=Henry|last=Rousseaux|title=Bulletin des Mus\u00e9es Royaux d'arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels|chapter=Les fonts baptismaux de Saint Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my \u00e0 Li\u00e8ge|language=French| url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletin06musuoft#page/58/mode/2up/search/barthel|year=1907|pages=58\u201360}}</ref><ref>See [[:File:Baptismal font of St Barthelemy Church - Liege - 1846 .jpg|old photos on Commons]]</ref>  The font is still used for baptisms today; there is normally a small charge for viewing it.<ref>Li\u00e8ge City Tourism</ref>\n\n==Renier de Huy==\n[[File:Renier de Huy MCL3.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Detail of [[John the Baptist]] baptising the two neophytes.]]\nThe font was traditionally attributed to [[Renier de Huy]], a 12th-century metalworker and sculptor, but this, and even the Mosan origin of the font, have been questioned and alternative theories advanced.  Nothing is known of Rainer's life other than that he was mentioned in a document of 1125 as a [[goldsmith]],<ref>Beckwith, 178</ref> but a 14th-century [[chronicle]] mentions him as the artist of the font.<ref>Oxford</ref>  He may have died about 1150.<ref>Beckwith, 178. The Getty Union Artist Names List has him active until 1144 [http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Rainer+of+Huy&role=&nation=&prev_page=1&subjectid=500081355]</ref>  Another equally shadowy figure in Mosan metalwork from the next generation, [[Godefroid de Huy]] or de Claire, also came from the small but prosperous city of [[Huy]] on the Meuse.\n\nThe only other work generally agreed to be by the same master as the font is a small bronze [[crucifix]] ([[Schn\u00fctgen Museum]], [[Cologne]]);<ref>Lasko, 181</ref> another in [[Brussels]] has many similarities.<ref>Illustrated in Xhayet and Halleux, before p. 129</ref> A censer in similar style is attributed to Renier or a follower by many.<ref>Lasko</ref>\n\n==Style and origin==\nThe figures on the font are in very high [[relief]], and have a remarkable classicism of style; so much so that it has also been suggested that it was in fact made in [[Constantinople]],<ref>Oxford</ref> or by Greeks in [[Rome]] about 1000.

The font is a major masterpiece of [[Mosan art]], remarkable for the classicism of its style, whose origin has been the subject of great debate among [[art historian]]s. The [[Meuse River]] valley in modern Belgium and France, roughly coterminous with the [[Diocese of Li\u00e8ge]], was the leading 12th-century centre of Romanesque metalwork, which was still the most prestigious medium in art.\n\n==History==\nThe Li\u00e8ge font was commissioned after 1107 and completed by 1118 for the church of Notre-Dame-aux-Fonts (\"[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]]'s with the font\"), which abutted [[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Li\u00e8ge|the old Li\u00e8ge Cathedral]] and functioned as the [[baptistry]] for the city.<ref>Beckwith, 178. See Xhayet and Halleux, 123, note 17 for a fuller account of the status of the church and its priest.</ref> These dates are based on the period of office of the Abb\u00e9 Hellin, parish priest of the church, known to have commissioned it, for in his obituary in the contemporary ''{{lang|la|Chronicon Rythmicum Leodiense}}'' ({{lang-en|Li\u00e8ge Rhyming Chronicle}}) the font is clearly described, though with no mention of the artist.<ref>Xhayet and Halleux, 21 (quotes chronicle) and 122\u2013123</ref>  Both cathedral and church were destroyed during the French Revolution, and the font was hidden for safe-keeping before being moved to its present location in 1804. The Li\u00e8ge chronicle describes a cover with figures of the [[Four Evangelists]] and prophets, presumably also in metal, which was lost during the Revolution, along with  two of the supporting oxen.<ref>Xhayet and Halleux, 21 and 123 and Li\u00e8ge City Tourism</ref>  The present stone plinth and setting replaced in the 20th century a solid round stone one built in 1804.<ref>{{citation|first=Henry|last=Rousseaux|title=Bulletin des Mus\u00e9es Royaux d'arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels|chapter=Les fonts baptismaux de Saint Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my \u00e0 Li\u00e8ge|language=French| url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletin06musuoft#page/58/mode/2up/search/barthel|year=1907|pages=58\u201360}}</ref><ref>See [[:File:Baptismal font of St Barthelemy Church - Liege - 1846 .jpg|old photos on Commons]]</ref>  The font is still used for baptisms today; there is normally a small charge for viewing it.<ref>Li\u00e8ge City Tourism</ref>\n\n==Renier de Huy==\n[[File:Renier de Huy MCL3.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Detail of [[John the Baptist]] baptising the two neophytes.]]\nThe font was traditionally attributed to [[Renier de Huy]], a 12th-century metalworker and sculptor, but this, and even the Mosan origin of the font, have been questioned and alternative theories advanced.  Nothing is known of Rainer's life other than that he was mentioned in a document of 1125 as a [[goldsmith]],<ref>Beckwith, 178</ref> but a 14th-century [[chronicle]] mentions him as the artist of the font.<ref>Oxford</ref>  He may have died about 1150.<ref>Beckwith, 178.

To keep costs low on high-volume competitive products, the CPU core is usually bundled into a system-on-chip (SOC) integrated circuit. SOCs contain the processor core, cache and the processor's local data on-chip, along with clocking, timers, memory (SDRAM), peripheral (network, serial I/O), and bus (PCI, PCI-X, ROM/Flash bus, I2C) controllers. IBM also offers an open bus architecture (called [[CoreConnect]]) to facilitate connection of the processor core to memory and peripherals in a SOC design.  IBM and Motorola have competed along parallel development lines in overlapping markets. A later development was the [http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/BOOK_EUM.pdf Book E PowerPC Specification], implemented by both IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, which defines embedded extensions to the PowerPC programming model.\n\n===AMCC===\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440SP]]: 533-667&nbsp;MHz, 10/100/1G Ethernet, (2) 64bit PCI-X, 32bit PCI-X, XOR engine, 32k L1 Cache.\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440SPe]]: 533-667&nbsp;MHz, 10/100/1G Ethernet, (3) 64bit PCI-Express, 64bit PCI-X, XOR engine, 32k L1 Cache.\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440EPx]]: 333-667&nbsp;MHz, (2) 10/100/1G Ethernet, Hardware Security, PCI, DDR-II, FPU, USB 1.1 or USB 2.0, 32k L1 Cache.\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440GR]]: 333-667&nbsp;MHz, (2) 10/100 Ethernet, (4) UART, (2) IIC, 53 GPIO, SPI, 32k L1 Cache.\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440GRx]]: 333-667&nbsp;MHz, (2) 10/100/1G Ethernet, (4) UART, (2) IIC, 53 GPIO, SPI, DDR-II, Hardware Security, 32k L1 Cache.\n* PowerPC [[Titan (microprocessor)|Titan]], 32-bit, dual core, 2&nbsp;GHz.

To keep costs low on high-volume competitive products, the CPU core is usually bundled into a system-on-chip (SOC) integrated circuit. SOCs contain the processor core, cache and the processor's local data on-chip, along with clocking, timers, memory (SDRAM), peripheral (network, serial I/O), and bus (PCI, PCI-X, ROM/Flash bus, I2C) controllers. IBM also offers an open bus architecture (called [[CoreConnect]]) to facilitate connection of the processor core to memory and peripherals in a SOC design.  IBM and Motorola have competed along parallel development lines in overlapping markets. A later development was the [http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/BOOK_EUM.pdf Book E PowerPC Specification], implemented by both IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, which defines embedded extensions to the PowerPC programming model.\n\n===AMCC===\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440SP]]: 533-667&nbsp;MHz, 10/100/1G Ethernet, (2) 64bit PCI-X, 32bit PCI-X, XOR engine, 32k L1 Cache.\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440SPe]]: 533-667&nbsp;MHz, 10/100/1G Ethernet, (3) 64bit PCI-Express, 64bit PCI-X, XOR engine, 32k L1 Cache.\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440EPx]]: 333-667&nbsp;MHz, (2) 10/100/1G Ethernet, Hardware Security, PCI, DDR-II, FPU, USB 1.1 or USB 2.0, 32k L1 Cache.\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440GR]]: 333-667&nbsp;MHz, (2) 10/100 Ethernet, (4) UART, (2) IIC, 53 GPIO, SPI, 32k L1 Cache.\n* [[PowerPC 400#PowerPC 440|440GRx]]: 333-667&nbsp;MHz, (2) 10/100/1G Ethernet, (4) UART, (2) IIC, 53 GPIO, SPI, DDR-II, Hardware Security, 32k L1 Cache.\n* PowerPC [[Titan (microprocessor)|Titan]], 32-bit, dual core, 2&nbsp;GHz.

He later became a semi-regular on ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' (from 1989 to 1990) as Neal Tanner. He guest-hosted a special episode of ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Super Sloppy Double Dare]]'' in 1989 where host [[Marc Summers]] and announcer [[Harvey (announcer)|Harvey]] played against each other. The game ended with both Summers and Harvey playing the Obstacle Course and winning all eight prizes for their respective civilian teammates. Stage assistants Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar guest-announced that episode.\n\nAfter ''ALF'' went off the air in 1990, Bullock remained active with [[theatre]], [[television]], and [[film]] work. He briefly hosted a syndicated [[talk show]] with ex-[[televangelist]] [[Tammy Faye Messner]]. The ''Jim J. and Tammy Faye Show'' debuted in 1996, but Messner exited the program a few months later following a cancer diagnosis. Bullock continued with new co-host, Ann Abernathy, and the show became ''The Jim J. and Ann Show'' until it was canceled.\n\nBullock was the voice of ''[[Queer Duck]]'' in the animated series of cartoons of the same name which have appeared on both the [[internet]] and the cable TV network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. In 2000, Bullock was a regular panelist on the revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. He also performed on the national tour of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' as Wilbur Turnblad, a role he took to the Broadway stage starting September 18, 2007. Some of his other noteworthy roles include the pilled-up narcoleptic Prince [[Valium]] in the 1987 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and the \"Not-Quite-Out-of-the-Closet\" character in the date montage at the beginning of 2001's ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''. From 2004 to 2007, he had a recurring role as Mr. Monroe, a teacher at the fictional James K. Polk Middle School on the [[Nickelodeon]] live action sitcom ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1985, while ''Too Close For Comfort'' was being retooled as ''The Ted Knight Show'', Bullock learned that he was [[HIV]] positive.

Bullock\") and was a regular guest on [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]]'s updated version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; Bullock occasionally substituted for Davidson as host.<ref name=\"av140615\">{{cite news |first1=Marah |last1=Eakin |first2=John |last2=Teti |first3=Erik |last3=Adams |newspaper=[[The A.V.

He later became a semi-regular on ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' (from 1989 to 1990) as Neal Tanner. He guest-hosted a special episode of ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Super Sloppy Double Dare]]'' in 1989 where host [[Marc Summers]] and announcer [[Harvey (announcer)|Harvey]] played against each other. The game ended with both Summers and Harvey playing the Obstacle Course and winning all eight prizes for their respective civilian teammates. Stage assistants Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar guest-announced that episode.\n\nAfter ''ALF'' went off the air in 1990, Bullock remained active with [[theatre]], [[television]], and [[film]] work. He briefly hosted a syndicated [[talk show]] with ex-[[televangelist]] [[Tammy Faye Messner]]. The ''Jim J. and Tammy Faye Show'' debuted in 1996, but Messner exited the program a few months later following a cancer diagnosis. Bullock continued with new co-host, Ann Abernathy, and the show became ''The Jim J. and Ann Show'' until it was canceled.\n\nBullock was the voice of ''[[Queer Duck]]'' in the animated series of cartoons of the same name which have appeared on both the [[internet]] and the cable TV network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. In 2000, Bullock was a regular panelist on the revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. He also performed on the national tour of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' as Wilbur Turnblad, a role he took to the Broadway stage starting September 18, 2007. Some of his other noteworthy roles include the pilled-up narcoleptic Prince [[Valium]] in the 1987 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and the \"Not-Quite-Out-of-the-Closet\" character in the date montage at the beginning of 2001's ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''. From 2004 to 2007, he had a recurring role as Mr. Monroe, a teacher at the fictional James K. Polk Middle School on the [[Nickelodeon]] live action sitcom ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1985, while ''Too Close For Comfort'' was being retooled as ''The Ted Knight Show'', Bullock learned that he was [[HIV]] positive.

P. Matthen''', (1890\u20131960) CP Matthen was born in 1890 to a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in the Mavelikara district. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and did his Bachelor Of History degree at the Madras Christian College (MCC) followed by a BL. After college at the age of 29, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank with its headquarters in Kollum (Quilon), The Quilon Bank headquarter building was then constructed and completed in 1935. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000. The success of the bank moved Matthen from a village in Travancore called Thiruvilla, to being a leading businessman in Madras with wide business\u00a0 interests - in banking, insurance, manufacturing and plantations.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr K C Mammen Mapallay, whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism, and his main job was being the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper called the Manorama. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the great commercial success of this new venture led them to amalgamate their respective banks in 1937. Since the merged bank would become the largest bank in South India, the plan was to move the headquarters of the consolidated bank from Travancore to Madras, but at this point Sir CP Ramaswamy Iyer, the then Diwan of Travancore, encouraged them to establish the bank headquarters in Travancore, and as an incentive he offered to place Rs 7,000,000 of Travancore treasury money as a deposit with the merged bank. The temptation of the Travancore treasury money, persuaded the two businessmen to establish the consolidated bank\u2019s headquarters in Quilon (in what was then Travancore), though Matthen, as the CEO and Managing Director continued to live in Madras and operate from the new Travancore National & Quilon Bank Central Office in Anderson Hall, Madras, purchased by Mammen and part of the Old Madras Christian Christian College buildings on the Esplanade https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.218123/page/n167/mode/2up.  \n\nThe amalgamated Bank had the following branch network.\n\nAlleppey, Alwaye, Athirampuzha, Bangalore City, Bangalore Cantt.(South Parade Road), Bangalore Cantt.(Central Street), Bombay, Calcutta, Calicut, Changanacherry, Chirayinkil, Cochin, Coimbatore, Colombo, Coonoor, Cuddapah, Devicolam, Dindigul, Ernakulam, Erode, Galle, Hyderabad, Jaffna, Kandy, Karaikudi, Kayamkulam, Kottayam, Kumbakonam.\n\nMadras: Anderson Hall, G.T., Flower Bazaar, Mount Road, Triplicane, Mylapore, Vepery, Thyagarayanagar, Royapettah. \n\nMadura, Mangalore, Marthandorn, Mercara, Munnar, Mysore, Nagercoil, New Delhi, Ootacamund, Palghat, Parur, Perumpavoor, Pollachi, Poona, Pudukottah, Quilon, Quilon Sub Office, Rajapalayam, Salem, Secunderabad, Shertallai, Srirangam, Tellicherry, Tenkasi, Tinnevelly, Tinnevelly Junction, Tirupur, Thiruvella, Trichinopoly (25 Lascjar Street), Trichinopoly (Chinnakadai Teppakulam), Trichur, Trippunittura, Trivandrum (Main Road), Trivandrum (Chalai Bazaar), Tuticorin, Udumalpet, Vellore, Virudhunagar, Vizagapatam.\n\n==Imprisonment==\nThe amalgamated Travancore National & Quilon Bank was established in 1936 with a new Quilon headquarters building which Matthen built at a cost of Rs. 140,000 (a very large sum of money at that time). To retain the business and deposits of the Travancore State, Matthen and Mammen had not only agreed to the headquarters in Travancore but that two of the bank\u2019s directors were the Dewan\u2019s appointees and also that the Bank\u2019s General Manager, a confidant of the Dewan named K. S. Ramanujam, was appointed at the specific recommendation of Sir CP. Despite this initial support from the Travancore Government, in a couple of years, rumors started making its rounds that the bank was insolvent, and by 1938 there was a run on the bank\u2019s assets \u2013 this was instigated not only by the Dewan but was publicized by the Travancore State\u2019s Department of Publicity. The bank\u2019s financial run concluded with 88% of the public\u2019s deposits being returned by the bank, and the bank becoming insolvent. At this point the trap was sprung, by Sir CP\u2019s administration demanding the extradition of Matthen and Mammen to from Madras Presidency to Travancore State to stand trial for defrauding the public. Sir CP also convinced the British Government in Madras that the bank and its directors had been financing the Congress party and the Independence movement, so appeals to the Madras High Court and the Privy Council in London to stay the extradition orders were rejected and 3 directors of the bank including Matthen, Mammen and Mammen\u2019s elder brother and Mammen\u2019s son, were transported in chains from Madras to Quilon to stand trial.\n\nAt the trial in Trivandrum, the erstwhile General Manager of the bank - K. S. Ramanujam, who was the nominee of the Maharaja's government - falsely testified that Mammen and Matthen had defrauded the bank and four directors (including Mammen\u2019s brother and son) were then awarded 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The bank\u2019s remaining assets were liquidated by the State, and the bank\u2019s assets were distributed - mainly to confidants of Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer, one of whom acquired the bank headquarters\u2019 building in Quilon for Rs 15,000 - approximately a tenth of what it had cost to build three years earlier. With the first year in jail, Mammen\u2019s imprisoned elder brother died a broken man. Soon afterwards, Sir CP, who had been an astute lawyer in the colonial administration, being keenly aware of the weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case \u2013 which depended on K. S. Ramanujam who vanished abroad after the trial - sent word to Mammen and Matthen that if they admitted their accused guilt and sought the Maharaja\u2019s mercy they could be pardoned. Mammen and his son, had other major family problems, so they agreed to sign the false declaration but Matthen continued to refuse. Sir CP initially declined to agree to the release without all of three of them admitting guilt, but finally released Mammen and his son on receiving their written \u201cconfessions\u201d. Matthen continued to hold out on his refusal to sign any false confession, despite heavy pressure brought on him through the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abdul Karim, visiting him regularly in jail and suggesting that he sign a letter \u2013 which the IG had drafted, requesting the Maharaja to pardon and release him.\nFinally, on 22nd January 1942, Mr. C. P. Matthen was unconditionally released by the Maharaja's Government without any written or verbal false admission of guilt. The IG, Mr. Abdul Karim, took Matthen in his official car from Travancore jail to his house where his family had waited patiently for his release from jail.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nMr. C. P. Matthen was a member of the First [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament) in 1952, representing [[Mavelikara]] Constituency of [[Kerala]].\n\n==Lok Sabha Member and Ambassador==\nHe was elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1953, from Mavelikera constitutioncy in Kerala by one of the largest majorities of that election.  \n\nAfter completing his term in the [[Lok Sabha]], in 1957, he was appointed as the Indian Ambassador to [[Sudan]]. He retired a year later due to health reasons caused by his years of imprisonment in Trivandrum.\n\n==Death==\nDied on 2 June 1960 in [[Paris]], \u00cele-de-France, France and buried at [[Thiruvalla]], Kerala, India.<ref name=\"geni\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Chalakuzhy-Poulose-Matthen-C-P-Matthen/6000000006434764012|title=Matthen (1890 - 1960) - Genealogy|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Hard Copy==\n# N.M.Mathew, ''History of the Mar Thoma Church'', (Malayalam), Vol 3, 2008. page 75\n#''Chalakuzhy Kudumba Charitram'', Thomas Mathew (ed.) 1987.\n\n==External links==\n#{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/10/07/stories/2009100759851300.htm|title=C.P.

With the first year in jail, Mammen\u2019s imprisoned elder brother died a broken man. Soon afterwards, Sir CP, who had been an astute lawyer in the colonial administration, being keenly aware of the weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case \u2013 which depended on K. S. Ramanujam who vanished abroad after the trial - sent word to Mammen and Matthen that if they admitted their accused guilt and sought the Maharaja\u2019s mercy they could be pardoned. Mammen and his son, had other major family problems, so they agreed to sign the false declaration but Matthen continued to refuse. Sir CP initially declined to agree to the release without all of three of them admitting guilt, but finally released Mammen and his son on receiving their written \u201cconfessions\u201d. Matthen continued to hold out on his refusal to sign any false confession, despite heavy pressure brought on him through the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abdul Karim, visiting him regularly in jail and suggesting that he sign a letter \u2013 which the IG had drafted, requesting the Maharaja to pardon and release him.\nFinally, on 22nd January 1942, Mr. C. P. Matthen was unconditionally released by the Maharaja's Government without any written or verbal false admission of guilt. The IG, Mr. Abdul Karim, took Matthen in his official car from Travancore jail to his house where his family had waited patiently for his release from jail.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nMr. C. P. Matthen was a member of the First [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament) in 1952, representing [[Mavelikara]] Constituency of [[Kerala]].\n\n==Lok Sabha member and Ambassador==\nHe was elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1953, from Mavelikera constitutioncy in Kerala by one of the largest majorities of that election.  \n\nAfter completing his term in the [[Lok Sabha]], in 1957, he was appointed as the Indian Ambassador to [[Sudan]].

People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a [[bias]]ed way. The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for [[emotion]]ally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched [[belief]]s.\n\nPeople also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [[attitude polarization]] (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [[#Persistence of discredited beliefs|belief perseverance]] (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [[illusory correlation]] (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).\n\nA series of [[Experimental psychology|psychological experiments]] in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include [[wishful thinking]] and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way. However, even scientists and intelligent people can be prone to confirmation bias.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Lee|first1=C.J.|last2=Sugimoto|first2=C.R.|last3=Zhang|first3=G.|last4=Cronin|first4=B.|year=2013|title=Bias in peer review|journal=J Am Soc Inf Sci Tec|volume=64|pages=2\u201317|doi=10.1002/asi.22784}}<br />*{{Citation|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=1|issue=3|pages=229\u201338|title=Psychology of the scientist: An analysis of problem-solving bias|first1=Michael J.|last1=Mahoney |first2=B.G.|last2=DeMonbreun |year=1977|doi=10.1007/BF01186796}}<br />*{{Citation|title=Norms and counter-norms in a select group of the Apollo moon scientists: A case study of the ambivalence of scientists|first=I.

After each ball was drawn, participants in one group were asked to state out loud their judgments of the probability that the balls were being drawn from one or the other basket. These participants tended to grow more confident with each successive draw\u2014whether they initially thought the basket with 60% black balls or the one with 60% red balls was the more likely source, their estimate of the probability increased. Another group of participants were asked to state probability estimates only at the end of a sequence of drawn balls, rather than after each ball. They did not show the polarization effect, suggesting that it does not necessarily occur when people simply hold opposing positions, but rather when they openly commit to them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|p=201}}</ref>\n\nA less abstract study was the Stanford biased interpretation experiment in which participants with strong opinions about the death penalty read about mixed experimental evidence.

The Taber and Lodge study used the emotionally charged topics of [[gun politics|gun control]] and [[affirmative action]].<ref name=\"taber_political\" /> They measured the attitudes of their participants towards these issues before and after reading arguments on each side of the debate. Two groups of participants showed attitude polarization: those with strong prior opinions and those who were politically knowledgeable. In part of this study, participants chose which information sources to read, from a list prepared by the experimenters. For example, they could read the [[National Rifle Association]]'s and the [[Brady Campaign|Brady Anti-Handgun Coalition]]'s arguments on gun control. Even when instructed to be even-handed, participants were more likely to read arguments that supported their existing attitudes than arguments that did not.

The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for [[emotion]]ally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched [[belief]]s.\n\nPeople also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [[attitude polarization]] (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [[#Persistence of discredited beliefs|belief perseverance]] (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [[illusory correlation]] (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).\n\nA series of [[Experimental psychology|psychological experiments]] in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives.

The participants were randomly assigned to write essays either for or against their preferred side of an argument and were given research instructions that took either a balanced or an unrestricted approach. The balanced-research instructions directed participants to create a \"balanced\" argument, i.e., that included both pros and cons; the unrestricted-research instructions included nothing on how to create the argument.<ref name=\"Wolfe 2008\" />\n\nOverall, the results revealed that the balanced-research instructions significantly increased the incidence of opposing information in arguments. These data also reveal that personal belief is not a ''source'' of myside bias; however, that those participants, who believe that a good argument is one that is based on facts, are more likely to exhibit myside bias than other participants.

According to these ideas, each answer to a question yields a different amount of information, which depends on the person's prior beliefs. Thus a scientific test of a hypothesis is one that is expected to produce the most information. Since the information content depends on initial probabilities, a positive test can either be highly informative or uninformative.

After playing for South St. Paul High School in Minnesota, Miller enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]] where he had a four-year collegiate career. Miller helped the Golden Gophers to two NCAA championship titles in his sophomore (1974) and senior (1976) seasons while playing for Hall of Fame coach [[Herb Brooks]].\n\nMiller was drafted by the [[New York Rangers]] in the 21st Round (241st overall) in the 1974 [[National Hockey League]] Amateur Draft, his [[World Hockey Association]] rights were held by the [[Calgary Cowboys]].  Calgary retained Miller's rights after the franchise relocated from Vancouver who had selected him in the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft. After school, Miller elected to play with Calgary where he played  83 games in parts of two seasons with the Cowboys tallying 55 points (23 G, 32 A) before the franchise folded.\n\nObtained by the [[Edmonton Oilers]] prior to the 1977-78 he would only play 18 games scoring just 2 goals with 4 assists before being traded to the [[Quebec Nordiques]] with Dave Inkpen, Rick Morris and Ken Broderick for Don McLeod and Pierre Guite. In 60 games with Quebec he had 38 points (14 G, 24 A).\n \nPrior to the 1978-79 season Miller was traded to the [[New England Whalers]] for Louis Levassuer. In the WHA's final season he notched a career high in goals with 26 adding 23 assists for 49 points. After the WHA merger with the NHL to start the 1979-80 season Miller had been claimed in the expansion draft by the Rangers who held his NHL rights. In one season in New York he played 55 games but had only 13 points on 6 goals and 7 assists.\n\nThe following season he was sold back to the now Hartford Whalers for cash considerations.

After playing for South St. Paul High School in Minnesota, Miller enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]] where he had a four-year collegiate career. Miller helped the Golden Gophers to two NCAA championship titles in his sophomore (1974) and senior (1976) seasons while playing for Hall of Fame coach [[Herb Brooks]].\n\nMiller was drafted by the [[New York Rangers]] in the 21st Round (241st overall) in the 1974 [[National Hockey League]] Amateur Draft, his [[World Hockey Association]] rights were held by the [[Calgary Cowboys]].  Calgary retained Miller's rights after the franchise relocated from Vancouver who had selected him in the 1974 WHA Amater Draft. After school, Miller elected to play with Calgary where he played  83 games in parts of two seasons with the Cowboys tallying 55 points (23 G, 32 A) before the franchise folded.\n\nObtained by the [[Edmonton Oilers]] prior to the 1977-78 he would only play 18 games scoring just 2 goals with 4 assists before being traded to the [[Quebec Nordiques]] with Dave Inkpen, Rick Morris and Ken Broderick for Don McLeod and Pierre Guite. In 60 games with Quebec he had 38 points (14 G, 24 A).\n \nPrior to the 1978-79 season Miller was traded to the [[New England Whalers]] for Louis Levassuer. In the WHA's final season he notched a career high in goals with 26 adding 23 assists for 49 points. After the WHA merger with the NHL to start the 1979-80 season Miller had been claimed in the expansion draft by the Rangers who held his NHL rights. In one season in New York he played 55 games but had only 13 points on 6 goals and 7 assists.\n\nThe following season he was sold back to the now Hartford Whalers for cash considerations. He played the final three seasons of his career in the mall scoring 33 goals, assisting on 44 others for 77 points in his final 207 games.\n\nOverall he played in 262 games in the NHL and 238 games in the WHA for five franchises over eight professional seasons.\n\nMiller was also a member of the US team at the [[1981 Canada Cup]] and 1977, 1981 [[Ice Hockey World Championship]] tournaments.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{"title_page": "American football in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|The most popular sport in the United States}}'''American football''' is the most popular sport in the United States. The National Football League has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world. In the United States the game is most often referred to as simply \"football\".\n\n==Organization in the United States==\n\nThere is no single national governing body for American football in the United States or a continental governing body for North America. There is an international governing body, the International Federation of American Football, or IFAF.\nBefitting its status as a popular sport, football is played in leagues of different size, age and quality, in all regions of the country.  Organized football is played almost exclusively by men and boys, although a few amateur and semi-professional women's leagues have begun play in recent years, and women and girls are free to play on male teams provided they can physically compete. A team / academy may be referred to as a 'football program' \u2013 not to be confused with football program.\n\n=== Professional ===\nThe governing body for American football in the United States is USA Football.\nThe 32-team National Football League (NFL) is currently the only major American football league in the United States. There have been numerous attempts over the past several decades to create a second major or high-level professional league, most of which failed within a few years or, in the cases of the All-America Football Conference and 1960s American Football League, merged with the NFL.\n\nThe NFL has not operated any developmental minor leagues since the folding of the NFL Europe League in 2007. From the time of the Spring Football League's 2000 collapse until the founding of the independent Stars Football League in 2011, there were no minor American football leagues (independent or affiliated) anywhere in the country. Since then, there has been the SFL (which ran through 2013), Fall Experimental Football League (which played from 2014 to 2015 before it was reformatted as the non-paying The Spring League for 2017), and the Alliance of American Football, which played one abbreviated season in 2019 before collapsing in a management dispute. The AAF positioned itself as an upper-level minor league serving to transition between the college game and the NFL.\n\nThe XFL, a revamp of a league of the same name that played one season in 2001, began play in February 2020. In contrast to the former AAF, it does not position itself as a minor league, but an independent alternative league.\n\nThere are several professional and semi-professional indoor football leagues, played at basketball-sized arenas. The largest one is the Indoor Football League which has 13 teams spanning from Ohio to California. Historically the Arena Football League, which launched in 1987 was the most prominent league but as the league had operational issues following its 2008 bankruptcy, teams folded and left for other leagues before the Arena Football League folded in 2019. Most other indoor leagues are also regional in nature. Indoor football leagues play by significantly different rules that accommodate a smaller field of play.\n\nSome players that do not make the NFL play in the XFL, in indoor leagues, or go to Canada and play in the Canadian Football League, which operates professionally on a somewhat older rule system with a number of differences from the American game but still recognizable as \"football\" to the casual American football observer. The CFL allocates half of its teams' rosters for players born and raised in Canada but allows the rest of the players to be foreign born (in practice, these spots are almost always filled by Americans); the CFL also has television presence in the United States and as recently as 1995 played games in the U.S.\n\n=== University and collegiate ===\nCollege football is also popular throughout North America. Most of college football in the United States is governed by the NCAA. Many colleges and universities have football teams, often with dedicated football stadiums. These teams mostly play other similarly sized schools, through the NCAA's divisional system, which divides collegiate sports teams into four divisions (I-FBS, I-FCS, II and III).  The largest, most popular collegiate teams routinely fill stadiums larger than 75,000.  Eight college football stadiums\u2014the University of Michigan's Michigan Stadium, Penn State's Beaver Stadium, Ohio State's Ohio Stadium, Texas A&M's Kyle Field, the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium, LSU's Tiger Stadium, Alabama's Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium, and Darrell K Royal\u2013Texas Memorial Stadium at the University of Texas at Austin\u2014seat more than 100,000 fans and usually sell out.  The weekly autumn ritual of college football includes marching bands, cheerleaders, homecoming, parties, the tailgate party; it forms an important part of the culture in much of small-town America. Football is a major source of revenue to the athletic programs of schools, public and private, in the United States. The top college football players enter the NFL Draft after their college careers are over, in hopes of signing with an NFL team.\n\n\"FBS\" and \"FCS\" are abbreviations for the Football Bowl Subdivision and Football Championship Subdivision, two sections of Division I that exist only in football. These two subdivisions were formerly known as Divisions I-A and I-AA respectively. The Championship Subdivision, consisting mostly of smaller schools than the FBS but larger than D-II, has a multiple-round playoff system just like Divisions II and III, while the Bowl Subdivision has only a limited, and unofficial, four-team playoff and has historically only featured division championships and bowl games. FBS and FCS teams can, and often do, play against each other. Unofficially, the Bowl Subdivision is divided into two further subdivisions, \"major conferences\" (also known as \"Power Five conferences\") and \"mid-majors\" (known in modern parlance as the \"Group of Five\"). In practice, only major conference teams are eligible to compete for the national championship and receive significant favor in the opinion polling over mid-majors, and it was not until the addition of the BCS National Championship Game that mid-majors had a realistic chance at appearing in one of the major bowls. Although the FCS has a playoff, three conferences do not participate (the Ivy League does not allow its teams to play in the postseason, and the historically black SWAC and MEAC instead play each other in a bowl of their own). Division III teams do not offer scholarships to their players; two Division I FCS leagues also do not offer scholarships\u2014the Ivy League, which prohibits athletic scholarships in any sport, and the Pioneer Football League, which only competes in football and whose members all offer scholarships in non-football sports.\n\nWith the exception of the annual Army\u2013Navy Game, only Power Five conference teams air on national broadcast television, although mid-majors, FCS teams, D-II and D-III games can see more limited coverage on cable and local television.\n\nThough the NCAA is the most publicized college athletic organization, the NAIA (which houses mostly smaller private colleges in the midwest), NJCAA (an association for community colleges), and California Community College Athletic Association (that state's equivalent to the NJCAA) also sanction football games; there also exists a club football circuit for student-run teams and colleges that choose not to compete at the varsity level. In addition to this, 10 colleges field teams in the Collegiate Sprint Football League, a league in which all players must weigh no more than {{convert|178|lb|kg}} in order to be eligible to play; four of those teams are long-established sprint teams that co-exist alongside their NCAA counterparts (two from the Ivy League and two military academies), while six teams that have been added since the CSFL began an ongoing expansion in 2008 either never had a varsity squad (one recent addition, 2015 expansion team Chestnut Hill College, was an all-women's school that did not even admit men until 2003) or downgraded from an NCAA team to a sprint team.\n\n=== High school ===\nMost American high schools field football teams.  High school football is popular; top schools regularly fill stadiums holding over 10,000 fans, and can afford artificial playing surfaces.\n\nHigh school teams generally play only against other teams from their state (notable exceptions include matchups between nearby schools located on opposite sides of a state line and occasional matchups between two nationally ranked teams for television purposes).  Still, some private Christian high schools play for national championships through organizations like the Federated Christian Athletic Association. Public high school football in most states, as is the case with other high school sports, is governed by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS).\n\nFor rural schools that do not have the student body to support a full football team, the NFHS scantions nine-man football (most popular in the upper Midwest), six-man football (most commonly used in Texas, although previously more widely popular and undergoing a minor revival elsewhere), and eight-man football (which the most common reduced-man format in most other states).\n\n=== Adult Amateur Football / Semi-Pro Football ===\nAdult amateur football, also known as semi-pro football, is a level of American football.  It's commonly known as \"working man's\" football, meaning the players have regular jobs and play football on the weekends. Though the players don't get paid, the leagues and the games are run in a somewhat professional manner.  For most leagues, it's against the rules to pay its players to play.  The rules of the game are usually a hybrid of NFL and NCAA rules.\n\nThere are several different leagues playing in the United States:\n\nThe North American Football League (NAFL) is an adult amateur American football league.  Its teams are located mainly in the Eastern, Midwestern and Southern United States.  The teams mostly play regionally in the regular season to keep travel short.  In the playoffs, winners of regional play will meet each other for the league championship.\n\nThe New England Football League (NEFL) has over 30 teams, with at least one in each of the six New England states.  The league has three skill levels (A being more for recreational play; AAA being the most competitive; AA is somewhat in between).\n\nThe Eastern Football League, based in New England, but at times teams from New York state have competed, is one of the country's oldest semi-pro leagues.  It started play in 1961.\n\nThe Mid Continental Football League began play in 1991 and by the 1990s had expanded through much of the midwest and mid-Atlantic United States before the league split apart and contracted into a four-state area in the midwest. Upstate New York also houses the oldest surviving professional football club in the United States, the Watertown Red & Black, founded in 1896. \n\nThe Pacific Northwest Football League (PNFL) started in 2016 and currently has 6 teams, 4 in Portland, Oregon and 2 in Vancouver, Washington. \n\nSeveral leagues supporting women's semi-professional football play have existed. The two current major leagues are the Independent Women's Football League (IWFL) and the Women's Football Alliance (WFA). The WFA plans to begin play in 2009 stocked with teams from two recently dissolved leagues, the National Women's Football Association and Women's Professional Football League (NWFA and WPFL respectively).\n\n== US National American football team ==\nUSA Football assembles a national football team for competition in the IFAF World Championship every four years. Because of concerns over competitive balance, USA Football did not field teams for the first two events in 1999 and 2003. The 2007 team consisted solely of amateur players who had graduated from college that spring, from a diverse mix of smaller and larger colleges and universities. The 2011 squad's criteria were looser, allowing some professional players to play (mostly unemployed, lower-end and minor league players; no NFL or NCAA stars participated). Both the 2007 and 2011 incarnations of the team won their year's respective world championship.\n\nThe IFAF also fields an U-19 team composed of high school football players that has participated in the 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2016 junior world championships. The national U-19 team won the 2009 and 2014 contests but lost the 2012 contest to Canada.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*NCAA's complete college football rules; available as a PDF file \n*National Football League Official Signals.\n*Annual Survey of Football Injury Research\n*American Youth Football\n*American Football rules and History\n*American football training drills\n\n{{American football in the United States}}\n{{Sport in the United States}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:American Football In The United States}}\n[[Category:American football in the United States| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|The most popular sport in the United States}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}\n{{Sport overview\n| country               = United States\n| sport                 = American football\n| image                 = Football play from scrimmage.jpg\n| imagesize             = 260px\n| caption               = The U.S. Navy Midshipmen (at left, in blue) line up on offense against the Army's Black Knights\n| union                 = [[USA Football]]\n| nickname              = \n| first                 = 1869, [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]\n| registered            = \n| clubs                 = \n| match                 = \n| league                = \n| national_list         = [[Super Bowl]]\n| club_list             = [[National Football League]]\n| intl_list             = [[IFAF World Championship]]\n}}\n\n'''[[American football]]''' is the most popular sport in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/american-fb/story/_/id/10354114/harris-poll-nfl-most-popular-mlb-2nd|title=Harris Poll: NFL still most popular; MLB 2nd|website=Espn.co.uk|accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/popularity-contest-baseball-vs-football-1428679449|title=Popularity Contest: Baseball vs. Football|first=Jo Craven|last=McGinty|date=10 April 2015|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/audibles/2014/04/14/nfl-ranked-as-most-popular-american-sport-for-30th-consecutive-year|title=NFL ranked as most popular American sport for 30th consecutive year|first=Bryan|last=Rose|website=Si.com|accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2012/10/09/why-is-football-so-popular/#42e4f7961faa|title=Why Is Football So Popular?|first=Monte|last=Burke|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/the-geography-of-nfl-fandom/379729/|title=Here Is Every U.S. County's Favorite Football Team (According to Facebook)|first=Robinson|last=Meyer|website=Theatlantic.com|accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theharrispoll.com/sports/Americas_Fav_Sport_2016.html|title=Pro Football is Still America\u2019s Favorite Sportl|website=Theharrispoll.comEspn.co.uk|accessdate=2016-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129010323/http://www.theharrispoll.com/sports/Americas_Fav_Sport_2016.html|archive-date=2016-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/01/nfl-most-popular-sport-poll|title=The NFL is the most popular sport in America for the 30th year running|date=26 January 2014|website=Ftw.usatoday.com|accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref> The [[National Football League]] has the highest [[List of sports attendance figures#Top 10 leagues in average attendance|average attendance of any sports league in the world]].

These two subdivisions were formerly known as Divisions I-A and I-AA respectively. The Championship Subdivision, consisting mostly of smaller schools than the FBS but larger than D-II, has a multiple-round playoff system just like Divisions II and III, while the Bowl Subdivision has only a limited, and unofficial, [[College Football Playoff|four-team playoff]] and has historically only featured division championships and [[bowl game]]s. FBS and FCS teams can, and often do, play against each other. Unofficially, the Bowl Subdivision is divided into two further subdivisions, \"major conferences\" (also known as \"[[Power Five conferences]]\") and \"[[mid-major]]s\" (known in modern parlance as the \"Group of Five\"). In practice, only major conference teams are eligible to compete for the [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championship]] and receive significant favor in the [[opinion polling]] over mid-majors, and it was not until the addition of the [[BCS National Championship Game]] that mid-majors had a realistic chance at appearing in one of the major bowls. Although the FCS has a playoff, three conferences do not participate (the [[Ivy League]] does not allow its teams to play in the postseason, and the historically black [[Southwestern Athletic Conference|SWAC]] and [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference|MEAC]] instead play each other in a [[Celebration Bowl|bowl of their own]]). Division III teams do not offer scholarships to their players; two Division I FCS leagues also do not offer scholarships\u2014the Ivy League, which prohibits athletic scholarships in any sport, and the [[Pioneer Football League]], which only competes in football and whose members all offer scholarships in non-football sports.\n\nWith the exception of the annual [[Army&ndash;Navy Game]], only Power Five conference teams air on national broadcast television, although mid-majors, FCS teams, D-II and D-III games can see more limited coverage on cable and local television.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nThough the NCAA is the most publicized college athletic organization, the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] (which houses mostly smaller private colleges in the midwest), [[National Junior College Athletic Association|NJCAA]] (an association for [[community college]]s), and [[California Community College Athletic Association]] (that state's equivalent to the NJCAA) also sanction football games; there also exists a [[club football]] circuit for student-run teams and colleges that choose not to compete at the varsity level. In addition to this, 10 colleges field teams in the Collegiate [[Sprint football|Sprint Football]] League, a league in which all players must weigh no more than {{convert|178|lb|kg}} in order to be eligible to play; four of those teams are long-established sprint teams that co-exist alongside their NCAA counterparts (two from the Ivy League and two military academies), while six teams that have been added since the CSFL began an ongoing expansion in 2008 either never had a varsity squad (one recent addition, 2015 expansion team [[Chestnut Hill College]], was an all-women's school that did not even admit men until 2003) or downgraded from an NCAA team to a sprint team.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== High school ===\n{{further|High school football}}\nMost American [[high school]]s field [[High school football|football]] teams.  High school football is popular; top schools regularly fill stadiums holding over 10,000 fans, and can afford artificial playing surfaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/football-top-sport-us-1088158-high-school-players|title=Football Is Top Sport in U.S.: 1,088,158 High School Players|date=2 February 2014|website=Cnsnews.com|accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2014/09/25/youth-football-despite-reported-declines-is-about-as-popular-as-ever/#4ff6b9a24e3e|title=Youth Football, Despite Reported Declines, Is About As Popular As Ever|first=Bob|last=Cook|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref>\n\nHigh school teams generally play only against other teams from their [[U.S. state|state]] (notable exceptions include matchups between nearby schools located on opposite sides of a [[Border|state line]] and occasional matchups between two nationally ranked teams for television purposes).  Still, some private Christian high schools play for national championships through organizations like the [[Federated Christian Athletic Association]]. Public high school football in most states, as is the case with other high school sports, is governed by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS).\n\nFor rural schools that do not have the student body to support a full football team, the NFHS scantions [[nine-man football]] (most popular in the upper Midwest), [[six-man football]] (most commonly used in Texas, although previously more widely popular and undergoing a minor revival elsewhere), and [[eight-man football]] (which the most common reduced-man format in most other states).\n\n=== Adult Amateur Football / Semi-Pro Football ===\nAdult amateur football, also known as semi-pro football, is a level of American football.  It's commonly known as \"working man's\" football, meaning the players have regular jobs and play football on the weekends. Though the players don't get paid, the leagues and the games are run in a somewhat professional manner.  For most leagues, it's against the rules to pay its players to play.  The rules of the game are usually a hybrid of NFL and NCAA rules.\n\nThere are several different leagues playing in the United States:\n\nThe [[North American Football League]] (NAFL) is an adult amateur American football league.  Its teams are located mainly in the Eastern, Midwestern and Southern United States.  The teams mostly play regionally in the regular season to keep travel short.  In the playoffs, winners of regional play will meet each other for the league championship.\n\nThe [[New England Football League]] (NEFL) has over 30 teams, with at least one in each of the six [[New England]] states.  The league has three skill levels (A being more for recreational play; AAA being the most competitive; AA is somewhat in between).\n\nThe Eastern Football League, based in New England, but at times teams from New York state have competed, is one of the country's oldest semi-pro leagues.  It started play in 1961.\n\nThe Mid Continental Football League began play in 1991 and by the 1990s had expanded through much of the midwest and mid-Atlantic United States before the league split apart and contracted into a four-state area in the midwest. Upstate New York also houses the oldest surviving professional football club in the United States, the [[Watertown Red & Black]], founded in 1896. \n\nThe [[Pacific Northwest Football League]] (PNFL) started in 2016 and currently has 6 teams, 4 in Portland, Oregon and 2 in Vancouver, Washington. \n\nSeveral leagues supporting [[women's American football|women's semi-professional football]] play have existed. The two current major leagues are the [[Independent Women's Football League]] (IWFL) and the [[Women's Football Alliance]] (WFA). The WFA plans to begin play in 2009 stocked with teams from two recently dissolved leagues, the [[National Women's Football Association]] and [[Women's Professional Football League]] (NWFA and WPFL respectively).\n\n== US National American football team ==\n{{further|United States national American football team}}\n[[USA Football]] assembles a national football team for competition in the [[IFAF World Championship]] every four years. Because of concerns over competitive balance, USA Football did not field teams for the first two events in 1999 and 2003. The 2007 team consisted solely of amateur players who had graduated from college that spring, from a diverse mix of smaller and larger colleges and universities. The 2011 squad's criteria were looser, allowing some professional players to play (mostly unemployed, lower-end and minor league players; no NFL or NCAA stars participated). Both the 2007 and 2011 incarnations of the team won their year's respective world championship.\n\nThe IFAF also fields an U-19 team composed of high school football players that has participated in the [[2009 IFAF Junior World Cup|2009]], [[2012 IFAF U-19 World Championship|2012]], [[2014 IFAF U-19 World Championship|2014]] and [[2016 IFAF U-19 World Championship|2016]] junior world championships. The national U-19 team won the 2009 and 2014 contests but lost the 2012 contest to [[Canadian national football team|Canada]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|American football}}\n{{Commons|College football}}\n*[https://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2006/2006_football_rules.pdf NCAA's complete college football rules; available as a PDF file] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624213428/http://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2006/2006_football_rules.pdf |date=24 June 2008 }}\n*National Football League [http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/signals Official Signals].\n*[http://www.unc.edu/depts/nccsi/SurveyofFootballInjuries.htm Annual Survey of Football Injury Research]\n*[http://www.americanyouthfootball.com American Youth Football]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080315052101/http://www.football-rules.com/ American Football rules and History]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141219170441/http://www.footballsportstraining.com/football-training-drills.php American football training drills]\n\n{{American football in the United States}}\n{{Sport in the United States}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:American Football In The United States}}\n[[Category:American football in the United States| ]]\n", "name_user": "103.126.214.185", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(masumkhan88957@gmail.com)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_in_the_United_States"}
