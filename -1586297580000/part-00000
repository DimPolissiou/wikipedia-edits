Jacobsen}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===The beginning===\nDuring the 1840s, a number of German families moved to the city of Dubuque. Many of these families were [[Catholic]]. Initially, they attended Mass at [[Saint Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|St. Raphael's Cathedral]]. However, the cathedral was becoming quite crowded due to the growing German and Irish populations of the city. Also, Bishop Mathias Loras was having difficulty ensuring that the German families were adequately cared for.\n\nIn 1849, Bishop Loras granted permission for 40 German families to form a new parish. Gerhard Hueckels donated land at the corner of 8th and White Streets in Dubuque. In 1850, a church was built on the land. This church, named Holy Trinity, was built of native stone with a tower about twenty feet tall.\n\nFor the first few years, there was a lack of priests in the still-young diocese. The people of Holy Trinity parish were served at first by a missionary, Father Gerhard Plathe. Finally, in 1853, they were given a resident priest, Father William Edmonds.\n\nSoon the first major influx of German immigrants occurred. The small Holy Trinity church was filled to capacity. In 1863, the pastor, Father George Fendrick, and members of the parish founded the \"German Roman Catholic Association of Dubuque.\" Their goal was to build a new church to support the parish - which now had over 300 families. At first, they attempted to purchase the Presbyterian Seminary in Dubuque for $15,000. After other Christian denominations opposed this plan, the group instead purchased an orchard for $3,000. This site, about seven blocks north of the Holy Trinity Church, is the site of the current church.\n\n===Construction of the new St. Mary's Church===\nIn 1864, construction was begun on the new church. The plans were designed by the architect John Mullany, who had designed the [[Saint Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|present Cathedral building]].  Father Aloysius Meis directed the construction. The new building was done in Gothic Architecture style.\n\n[[Image:MainAltarStMaryDubMay04.jpg|left|thumbnail|The original high altar]]\nAs with many other churches during the 19th century, most of the excavation and construction work was done by the men of the parish. By the time the foundation was complete in September 1864, only $3.03 was left in the treasury. The remaining $80,000 needed to finish the church was brought in through more fundraising and additional donations.\n\n===From 1867 to 1922===\nOn February 10, 1867, Bishop John Hennessy dedicated the new St. Mary's Church. Over the next 55 years, the population of Dubuque continued to grow. This was especially true in the 1880s with the arrival of the Milwaukee Railroad shops. St. Mary's was the mother parish of four other area parishes. [[Sacred Heart Catholic Church (Dubuque)|Sacred Heart]] was established in 1879, followed by Holy Ghost in 1896. In 1910, a new Holy Trinity Church was built near Eagle Point Park in Dubuque in memory of the first church in Dubuque to carry that name. Finally in 1922, Nativity parish was built near what today is called [[Loras College]].\n\nIn the early 1870s, the [[Hook and Hastings]] Company - a prominent 19th century organ builder - installed an organ in the choir loft. This organ was placed in a visually impressive case. The organ was significantly altered by the Lima Pipe Organ Company of Elida, Ohio, in 1965; the case and most of the pipes were retained, augmented by all new mechanism (including windchests constructed of aluminum) and several additional ranks of pipes. It currently has three manuals and 33 stops.\n\nThe sanctuary was extended in 1911, followed by the construction of two small chapels at the rear of the church. In 1914, stained glass windows built in Bavaria were installed in the church, though the shipment of the windows was nearly stopped because of the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Twelve large stained glass windows honor the Blessed Virgin Mary, and a large mural of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was painted behind the altar, because the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the patron saint of the parish.\n\n===From 1922 to the present===\n[[File:St. Mary's Rectory - Dubuque, Iowa.jpg|thumb|St. Mary's Rectory]]\nIn 1935, [[Father Aloysius Schmitt]] was ordained in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. He returned to the [[United States]], and his first assignment was as an associate at Saint Mary's Church. In 1941, he was killed in the attack at [[Pearl Harbor]], becoming the first American chaplain of any faith to die in the [[Second World War]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]] were implemented. The parish removed the communion rail and placed a new altar in the sanctuary that faced the congregation. However, the original high and side altars were left largely intact.\n\nIn recent years, St. Mary's Church had combined efforts with the nearby [[Saint Patrick's Church (Dubuque)|St. Patrick's Church]]. The two parishes shared administrative staff and school facilities.  The parish has been affected by the [[Priest shortage]] and a decline in membership as some families moved to suburban locations. The parish had a priest to lead Mass, but most of the administrative work was handled by a lay woman minister, the wife of a former U.S. Representative who is a deacon.\n\nIn the 1990s, St. Mary's built a new handicapped entrance. This entrance is located at the northeast corner of the church and has an elevator. Before that, the church was not as accessible as other churches in the area.\n\nWith a heavy debt load and a declining membership, the parish council recommended to the Archdiocese that the parish be closed.  In late 2009 it was announced that the parish would be closed.  On May 25, 2010, St. Mary's held its final mass as a Catholic parish with 700 attendees.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoverman |first=Sr. Carol |title=Saying goodbye to St. Mary Parish |url=http://st-patrick-dubuque.org/Closureinformation.aspx |work=The Witness |access-date=30 May 2014 |date=30 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822025120/http://st-patrick-dubuque.org/Closureinformation.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2011 }}</ref>  The building is still considered a [[Oratory status|church]], but the parish is no longer active.\n\nThe movie ''[[F.I.S.T.]],'' which was largely filmed in Dubuque, had a scene which featured exterior shots of St. Mary's Church.\n\nA book entitled \"St. Marys: Finest church west of the Mississippi\" covering the complete history of the church was published in August 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Marys: Finest church west of the Mississippi|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/st-marys-candice-chaloupka/1117506082?ean=9780982777206|publisher=Barnes and Noble|accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref>  In 2014 a conceptual plan (but no timeline or cost estimate) to renovate the campus to provide office space for small businesses, a community kitchen and 12 units of low income housing was jointly announced by the Dubuque Archdiocese, non-Catholic community groups such as Dubuque's Economic Development Department and the Washington Neighborhood Corporation, and Dubuque-based Gronen Restoration.<ref>{{cite news|last=Habegger|first=Becca|title=St. Mary's church in Dubuque has bright future|url=http://www.kwwl.com/story/24534733/2014/01/23/st-marys-church-in-dubuque-has-bright-future|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=KWWL (TV)|date=23 Jan 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Jessica|title=Grand plans unveiled for St. Mary's Church Campus  Group plans extensive renovations for the church campus.

St. Patrick's Church is located two blocks away from [[Saint Mary's Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)|St. Mary's Church]].  The reason for the close proximity of the two parishes was that St. Mary was originally built for service to German families of Dubuque, and St. Patrick's provided services for the Irish settlers to Dubuque.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Saint Patrick's Rectory - Dubuque, Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|Rectory]]\nThe parish was founded in 1852 as a mission of [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque, Iowa)|St. Raphael Cathedral]].<ref name=Patrick>{{cite web|url=http://straphaelcathedral.org/about-us/st-patrick/|title=St. Patrick Catholic Church History|publisher=St. Patrick Church|accessdate=2015-05-25|author=}}</ref>  The parish buildings were built on land that [[Mathias Loras|Bishop Mathias Loras]] had purchased when it was offered for sale by the Federal government.  Originally, a wood frame building was used as a church building, and was located at what is now the front of the rectory. The first church was dedicated by Bishop Loras in 1853. St. Patrick's became an independent parish five years later when the Rev. Patrick McCabe was assigned as the first resident pastor.  The [[cornerstone]] of the present brick church was laid in 1877, and the building dedicated on August 15, 1878.  In 1928, the Rev. J.J. Hanley remodeled and enlarged the church.\n\nSt. Patrick Church was originally built for service to the Irish settlers of Dubuque and while the parish has maintained a healthy respect for its Irish heritage over its many years of service, the parish now specializes in service to the [[Hispanic]] residents of Dubuque.<ref name=Patrick/>  The parish offers a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] Mass on Sundays, and the offices of Hispanic ministry are also located at the parish.

The church and [[rectory]] were included as [[Contributing property|contributing properties]] in the [[Jackson Park Historic District (Dubuque, Iowa)|Jackson Park Historic District]] that was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986.  St. Patrick's Church is located two blocks away from [[Saint Mary's Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)|St. Mary's Church]].  The reason for the close proximity of the two parishes was that St. Mary was originally built for service to German families of Dubuque, and St. Patrick's provided services for the Irish settlers to Dubuque.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Saint Patrick's Rectory - Dubuque, Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|Rectory]]\nThe parish was founded in 1852 as a mission of [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque, Iowa)|St. Raphael Cathedral]].<ref name=Patrick>{{cite web|url=http://straphaelcathedral.org/about-us/st-patrick/|title=St. Patrick Catholic Church History|publisher=St. Patrick Church|accessdate=2015-05-25|author=}}</ref>  The parish buildings were built on land that [[Mathias Loras|Bishop Mathias Loras]] had purchased when it was offered for sale by the Federal government.  Originally, a wood frame building was used as a church building, and was located at what is now the front of the rectory. The first church was dedicated by Bishop Loras in 1853. St. Patrick's became an independent parish five years later when the Rev. Patrick McCabe was assigned as the first resident pastor.  The [[cornerstone]] of the present brick church was laid in 1877, and the building dedicated on August 15, 1878.  In 1928, the Rev. J.J. Hanley remodeled and enlarged the church.\n\nSt. Patrick Church was originally built for service to the Irish settlers of Dubuque and while the parish has maintained a healthy respect for its Irish heritage over its many years of service, the parish now specializes in service to the [[Hispanic]] residents of Dubuque.<ref name=Patrick/>  The parish offers a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] Mass on Sundays, and the offices of Hispanic ministry are also located at the parish.  From 1995 to 2008 a pastoral administrator led the St. Patrick's congregation.  During that same time, from 1999 to 2010, St. Patrick's was clustered with St. Mary's Parish.  St. Mary's closed in May 2010 and St. Patrick's was clustered with St. Raphael's Cathedral at that time.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Saint Patrick's Church - Dubuque, Iowa 02.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the church from behind]]\nSt. Patrick's Church was designed by Dubuque architect John Keenan in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. In early March, the national plan was extended for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Ergaenzung_Pandemieplan_Covid.pdf |title=Erg\u00e4nzung zum Nationalen Pandemieplan \u2013 COVID-19 \u2013 neuartige Coronaviruserkrankung |last=[[Robert Koch-Institut]] |date=4 March 2020 |language=de |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> Four major targets are included in this plan:\n\n* Reduce morbidity and mortality\n* Ensure treatment of infected persons\n* Upkeep of essential public services\n* Short and accurate information for decision-makers, media and public\n\nThe plan has three stages which might eventually overlap:\n* Containment (circumstances of dedicated cases and clusters)\n* Protection (circumstances of further spreading infections and unknown sources of infections)\n* Mitigation (circumstances of widespread infections)\n\nIn the ''containment stage'' health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

The EGA card includes a 16&nbsp;[[kibibyte|KB]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] to extend the system [[BIOS]] for additional graphics functions, and includes a custom [[Video display controller|CRT controller (CRTC)]] that has limited backward compatibility with the [[Motorola]] [[MC6845]] chip used to generate video timing signals in earlier IBM PC graphics controllers.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Hart |first = Glenn A. |date = December 25, 1984 |title = IBM Sets a New Standard |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=azbgSlPdJawC&pg=PA173#v=onepage&q&f=false |journal = PC Magazine  |publisher = Ziff-Davis Publishing |page = 173 |volume = 3 |issue = 25}}</ref>  The EGA CRTC can support all of the modes of the IBM MDA and CGA adapters, partially through specific mode options intended for this purpose, but even in its maximum-compatibility mode configuration it is not register-compatible with an MC6845, so programs that directly program the 6845 to set up video modes will fail on an EGA.  When an MDA or CGA mode is set up on the EGA by calling the BIOS, then the raster timing, video memory layout, data format, and some other low-level hardware details such as cursor control are identical to those aspects of the operation of an MDA or CGA, providing a high degree of direct software and hardware (e.g. CRT monitor) compatibility.\n\nIn the 640\u00d7350 high resolution mode, each of the sixteen colors can be selected from a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] comprising all possible combinations of two bits per pixel each for red, green and blue, allowing four levels of intensity for each primary color and sixty-four possible colors overall.  EGA also includes full sixteen-color versions of the CGA 640\u00d7200 and 320\u00d7200 graphics modes. Depending on the monitor, only the sixteen [[Color Graphics Adapter#Color palette|CGA/RGBI colors]] are available in these modes; see [[#Color palette|color palette]] below.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} EGA four-bit (sixteen colors) [[All Points Addressable|graphic modes]] are also notable for a sophisticated use of [[bit plane]]s and [[bit mask|mask]] [[hardware register|registers]]<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/KB/45699 Complete Instructions to BLOAD and BSAVE EGA and VGA Screens], [[Microsoft]]</ref> together with CPU [[bitwise operation]]s,<ref>{{cite book |title=Graphics Programming Black Book |last=Abrash |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Abrash |year=2001 |publisher=[[Penguin Group|Coriolis Group Books]] |location= |isbn=1-57610-174-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/michaelabrashsgr00abra/page/1342 1342] |url=https://archive.org/details/michaelabrashsgr00abra/page/1342 |chapter=Chapter 43: Bit-plane animation |chapterurl=http://www.phatcode.net/res/224/files/html/ch43/43-01.html |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |url-access=registration }}</ref> which constitutes an early [[graphics accelerator]] inherited by [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] and numerous compatible hardware design models.\n\nEGA is dual-sync; it scans at 21.8&nbsp;kHz when 350-line modes are used and 15.7&nbsp;kHz when 200-line modes are used. The original CGA modes are also present, though EGA is not 100% hardware compatible with CGA, as was mentioned.  EGA can drive an [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]] monitor by a special setting of switches on the board (or by direct hardware programming&mdash;the switches only affect the operation of the BIOS); only 640\u00d7350 high-resolution monochrome graphics and the standard MDA [[text mode]] are available in this mode.  In summary, the EGA supports all BIOS-standard video modes of all previous IBM PC video adapters except the enhanced CGA of the IBM PCjr.  The standard MDA and CGA modes are supported 100% at the BIOS level, with additional support in some details at the hardware register level.  The three enhanced graphics modes of the PCjr&mdash;160x200 16-color, 320x200 16-color, and 640x200 4-color&mdash;are not supported by the EGA, and IBM lists their BIOS video mode numbers (08, 09, and 0A hexadecimal) as reserved.  However, the EGA can generate displays equivalent to these modes using different modes (with different video memory formats, requiring different programming). The EGA 320x200 16-color mode is not the same as nor compatible with the PCjr mode of the same format: the PCjr mode uses 4-bit pixels that are packed 2 pixels to a byte (one in the low nibble, and one in the high nibble) in a 32 KB video buffer that is split into 4 banks of interleaved lines (similar to the two interleaved banks in CGA graphics modes), whereas the EGA mode uses the linear bit-plane format that is native to the EGA.\n\nEGA cards use the PC [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus and were available starting in both eight- and sixteen-bit versions. The original IBM EGA card had 64&nbsp;KB of onboard RAM and required a daughter-board to add an additional 64&nbsp;KB (cards with 64&nbsp;KB are limited to four colors when 640\u00d7350 mode is used). All third-party cards came with 128&nbsp;KB already installed and some even 256&nbsp;KB, allowing multiple graphics pages, multiple text-mode character sets, and large scrolling displays. A few third-party EGA clones (notably the [[ATI Technologies]] and [[Western Digital|Paradise]] boards) feature a range of extended graphics modes (e.g., 640\u00d7400, 640\u00d7480 and 720\u00d7540), as well as automatic monitor type detection, and sometimes also a special 400-line [[Interlaced video|interlace mode]] for use on CGA monitors.\n\n[[File:Tvm-md-3-prevga-monitor-front-and-rear.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Front and rear views of the TVM MD-3 CRT monitor (EGA / pre-VGA era).

This also allows the [[Color Graphics Adapter#With an RGBI monitor|CGA's alternate brown]] color to be used without any additional display hardware. The later [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] standard built on this by allowing each of the 64 colors to be further customized.\n\nHowever, standard EGA monitors do not support use of the extended color palette in 200-line modes. The monitor cannot distinguish between being connected to a CGA card or being connected to an EGA card in a 200-line mode. Compared to CGA, EGA redefines some pins of the connector to carry the extended color information. If the monitor were connected to a CGA card, these pins would not carry valid color information, and the screen might be garbled if the monitor were to interpret them as such. For this reason, standard EGA monitors will use the CGA pin assignment in 200-line modes so the monitor can also be used with a CGA card. Some EGA monitors are ''switchable'', meaning they can be set up to use the full palette even in 200-line modes, often through a mechanical switch. Only a few commercial games were released with support for the extended color palette in 320\u00d7200 or 640\u00d7200 (including the DOS version of [[Super Off Road]]).\n\nWhen selecting a color from the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#6-bit RGB|EGA palette]], two bits are used for the red, green and blue channels. This allows each channel a value of 0, 1, 2 or 3. To select the color magenta, the red and blue values would be medium intensity (2, or 10 in binary) and the green value would be off (0). When calculating the intended value in the 64-color EGA palette, the binary number of the intended entry is of the form \"rgbRGB\" where a lowercase letter is the least significant bit of the channel intensity and an uppercase letter is the most significant bit. For magenta, the most significant bit in the red and blue values is a 1, so the uppercase R and B placeholders would become 1. All other digits are zeros, giving the binary number 000101 for the color magenta. This is 5 in decimal, so setting a palette entry to 5 would result in it being set to magenta. All the color values for the default colors are listed in the table on the right.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Default EGA 16-color palette (set up to match the standard [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] colors)\n|-\n!

The hardware signal interface, including the pin configuration, is largely compatible with CGA.  The differences are in the re-purposing of three pins for the EGA's secondary RGB signals: the CGA \"Intensity\" pin (pin six) has been changed to \"Secondary Green (Intensity)\"; the second ground of CGA (pin two) has been changed to \"Secondary Red (Intensity)\", and pin seven (Reserved on the CGA) is now used for \"Secondary Blue (Intensity)\".  If the EGA is operated in modes having the same scan rates as CGA, a connected CGA monitor should operate correctly, though if the monitor connects pin two to ground, the shorting of the EGA's secondary red output to ground could conceivably damage the EGA adapter.  Similarly, if the CGA monitor is wired with pin two as its sole ground (which is poor design), it will not work with the EGA, though it will work with a CGA.  Finally, because of the use of the CGA's intensity pin as secondary green, on a CGA monitor connected to an EGA, all CGA colors will display correctly, but all other EGA colors will incorrectly display as the standard CGA color which has the same values for the g, R, G, and B bits (ignoring the r and b bits.)  Conversely, an EGA monitor should work with a CGA adapter, but the secondary red signal will be grounded (always zero) and the secondary blue will be floating (unconnected), causing all high-intensity CGA colors except brown to display incorrectly, and all colors to potentially have a variable blue tint due to the indeterminate state of the unconnected secondary blue.\n\nAlmost all EGA cards have DIP switches on the back of the card to select the monitor type. If CGA is selected, the card will operate in 200-line mode and use 8x8 characters in text mode. 350-line modes cannot be accessed, nor any of the extended color palette. If EGA is selected, the card will operate in 350-line mode and use 8\u00d714 text. When 200-line modes are set, it will sync down to 15&nbsp;kHz. If MDA is selected, the card also uses 350 lines and 8\u00d714 text, but the only graphics mode that can be accessed is 640\u00d7350\u00d72.\n\nThe IBM 5154 EGA monitor has a special IBM 5153 CGA compatibility mode when operating with CGA sync signals, and it will automatically change to the CGA pinout to avoid all of the mentioned problems when operating in this mode.<ref>IBM Options and Adapters, Volume 1, \"Enhanced Color Display\", page 4: \"When operating in Mode 1, the display maps the 4 input bits into 16 of the possible 64 colors as shown in the following chart.\" August 2nd, 1984.</ref>\n\n=== Memory mapping ===\nEGA graphics modes are [[planar (computer graphics)|planar]], as opposed to the interlaced [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] and [[Hercules_Graphics_Card|Hercules]] modes. The video memory is divided into four pages (except 640\u00d7350\u00d72, which has two pages), one for each component of the RGBI color space. Each bit represents one pixel. If a bit in the red page is enabled, but none of the equivalent bits in the other pages are, a red pixel will appear in that location on-screen. If all the other bits for that particular pixel were also enabled, it would become white, and so forth. The planes are 8&nbsp;KB in size (200-line modes and 640\u00d7350 with two colors and 32&nbsp;KB video RAM), 16&nbsp;KB (640\u00d7350 with 64&nbsp;KB video RAM), or 32&nbsp;KB (640\u00d7350 with 128&nbsp;KB video RAM) and reside at segment A000 in the CPU's address space.  They are bank-switched and only one plane can be read on the CPU bus at once<!--Though internally, the EGA always reads all 4 planes at once and stores the byte read from each plane in the Graphics Controller data latch for that plane, regardless of which plane is selected to be read on the [CPU] I/O bus-->, although the programmer may set the control registers on the EGA card to select which planes are written to. Thus, it is possible to write to all of them at once even though just one plane can be read from at any given moment.  However, there is an exception: in read mode 1, all four planes are read and compared with programmed \"Color Compare\" data, and a byte indicating the result of comparing all four planes is what is read on the I/O bus.\n\nFor color text and CGA graphics modes, the video memory is mapped to 16 KB of memory addresses beginning at address B8000h. In monochrome (MDA-compatible) text mode, video memory occupies 16 KB beginning at B0000h.  These address mappings are for backwards compatibility.  For modes new to the EGA, the video memory begins at address A0000h and occupies 64 KB. The card can also be set to map 128 KB at that base address, but no standard BIOS video modes use that option.  The different base addresses for color vs. monochrome modes makes it possible for an EGA  to be operated simultaneously with a monochrome graphics card in the same computer, or for an EGA in MDA text mode to operated simultaneously with a CGA in the same computer.\n\n=== Connector ===\nFemale [[DE-9 connector]], on EGA (computer).<br />\nPin numbers (looking at socket): top row is pins 1\u20135, bottom row is pins 6 to 9, both '''numbered from right to left''' in this illustration.\n\n[[File:DE9 Diagram.svg|177px]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Pin assignments'''\n|-\n!

However CGA had inferior graphics to the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] computer families, which became very popular in Europe in particular from 1987 onward delaying general acceptance of the PC as home and games machines until the early 90s. The Atari could display 16 colours from a palette of 512 in 320\u00d7200 or 256 (NTSC/PAL), while the first generation Amigas generally displayed 32 colours out of a pallette of 4096 in 320\u00d7200 or 256, but could display all 4096 simultaneously. Commercial software began supporting EGA by 1986 and Sierra's ''[[King's Quest III]]'' was one of the earliest [[PC game]]s to use it. Most software made up to 1991 can run in EGA, although the vast majority of commercial games used 320\u00d7200 with 16 colors for reasons of compatibility with CGA and Tandy and to support users who did not own a proper EGA monitor. The 350-line modes were mostly used by freeware/shareware games and application software, although ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'' is a notable example of a commercial game that runs in 640\u00d7350\u00d716 mode.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|EGA}}\n* {{ill|JEGA|ja|Japanese Enhanced Graphics Adapter}} (Japanese Enhanced Graphics Adapter for [[AX architecture|AX]] computers)\n* [[Video card]]\n* [[Graphics display resolution]]\n* [[Graphics processing unit]]\n* [[List of video connectors|List of display interfaces]]\n* [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes]]{{snd}}[[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#6-bit RGB|6-bit RGB]] section\n* [[List of 16-bit computer color palettes]]{{snd}}[[List of 16-bit computer color palettes#EGA|EGA]] section\n* [[Professional Graphics Controller]]\n* [[VGA compatible text mode]]{{snd}}EGA\u2019s own modes are just a subset, and all features are nearly the same\n* [[List of defunct graphics chips and card companies]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=Upgrading and Repairing PCs |edition=second |last=Mueller |first=Scott |year=1992 |publisher=Que Books |isbn=0-88022-856-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/upgradingrepairi0000muel_2ndedition }}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Computer display standard}}\n\n[[Category:Computer display standards]]\n[[Category:IBM video hardware]]\n[[Category:Video cards]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1984]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox GPU\n| name         = Enhanced Graphics Adapter\n| image        = \n| codename     = \n| created      = {{Start date and age|October 1984}}<ref>IBM Announcement Letter Number 184-114 dated September 10, 1984, http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/4/897/ENUS184-114/index.html&lang=en&request_locale=en</ref>\n| transistors  = \n| architecture = [[Motorola 6845]], [[Chips and Technologies]]\n| entry        = IBM EGA card, [[Chips and Technologies]], [[ATI_Wonder_series#EGA_Cards|ATI EGA Wonder]]\n| midrange     = [[ATI_Wonder_series#EGA_Cards|ATI EGA Wonder 800]]\n| highend      = [[ATI_Wonder_series#EGA_Cards|ATI EGA Wonder 800+]]\n| enthusiast   = \n| d3dversion   = \n| predecessor  = [[IBM Monochrome Display Adapter|Monochrome Display Adapter]], [[Color Graphics Adapter]]\n| successor    = [[Video Graphics Array]]\n}}\n\n[[File:IBM EGA card.jpg|thumb|IBM EGA card \u2013 64&nbsp;KB version]]\n[[File:KL Genoa EGA.jpg|thumb|A non-IBM EGA card]]\n\nThe '''Enhanced Graphics Adapter''' ('''EGA''') is an [[IBM PC]] [[computer display standard]] from 1984 that superseded and exceeded the capabilities of the [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] standard introduced with the original IBM PC, and was itself superseded by the [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] standard in 1987.\n\n== History ==\nEGA was introduced in October 1984 by [[IBM]],<ref>High-Resolution Standard Is Latest Step in DOS Graphics Evolution, ''InfoWorld'', June 26, 1989, p. 48</ref><ref>News Briefs, Big Blue Turns Colors, ''InfoWorld'', Oct. 8, 1984</ref> shortly after (but not exclusively for) its new [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|PC/AT]].\n\nThe EGA standard was made obsolete by the introduction in 1987 of [[Multi-Color Graphics Array|MCGA]] and [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] with the [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] computer line.<ref>Scott Mueller, ''Upgrading and Repairing PCs, Tenth Edition'', Que,1998, 0-7897-1636-4, page 515</ref>\n\nShortly before the introduction of VGA, Genoa Systems introduced a half-size graphics card built around a proprietary chip set, which they called ''Super EGA'' (later cards supporting an extended version of the VGA were similarly named [[Super VGA]]).<ref>Hardware, Genoa Systems Ready to Ship $449 Half-Size Graphics Card, ''InfoWorld'', February 23, 1987</ref>  Also around that time, Byte Magazine reviewed various proprietary enhanced EGA adapters described with the term \"EEGA\".\n\n== Design ==\nEGA produces a display of sixteen simultaneous colors from a palette of sixty-four, at a resolution of up to 640\u00d7350 pixels. The EGA card includes a 16&nbsp;[[kibibyte|KB]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] to extend the system [[BIOS]] for additional graphics functions, and includes a custom [[Video display controller|CRT controller (CRTC)]] that has limited backward compatibility with the [[Motorola]] [[MC6845]] chip used to generate video timing signals in earlier IBM PC graphics controllers.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Hart |first = Glenn A. |date = December 25, 1984 |title = IBM Sets a New Standard |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=azbgSlPdJawC&pg=PA173#v=onepage&q&f=false |journal = PC Magazine  |publisher = Ziff-Davis Publishing |page = 173 |volume = 3 |issue = 25}}</ref>  The EGA CRTC can support all of the modes of the IBM MDA and CGA adapters, partially through specific mode options intended for this purpose, but even in its maximum-compatibility mode configuration it is not register-compatible with an MC6845, so programs that directly program the 6845 to set up video modes will fail on an EGA.  When an MDA or CGA mode is set up on the EGA by calling the BIOS, then the raster timing, video memory layout, data format, and some other low-level hardware details such as cursor control are identical to those aspects of the operation of an MDA or CGA, providing a high degree of direct software and hardware (e.g. CRT monitor) compatibility.\n\nIn the 640\u00d7350 high resolution mode, each of the sixteen colors can be selected from a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] comprising all possible combinations of two bits per pixel each for red, green and blue, allowing four levels of intensity for each primary color and sixty-four possible colors overall.  EGA also includes full sixteen-color versions of the CGA 640\u00d7200 and 320\u00d7200 graphics modes. Depending on the monitor, only the sixteen [[Color Graphics Adapter#Color palette|CGA/RGBI colors]] are available in these modes; see [[#Color palette|color palette]] below.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} EGA four-bit (sixteen colors) [[All Points Addressable|graphic modes]] are also notable for a sophisticated use of [[bit plane]]s and [[bit mask|mask]] [[hardware register|registers]]<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/KB/45699 Complete Instructions to BLOAD and BSAVE EGA and VGA Screens], [[Microsoft]]</ref> together with CPU [[bitwise operation]]s,<ref>{{cite book |title=Graphics Programming Black Book |last=Abrash |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Abrash |year=2001 |publisher=[[Penguin Group|Coriolis Group Books]] |location= |isbn=1-57610-174-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/michaelabrashsgr00abra/page/1342 1342] |url=https://archive.org/details/michaelabrashsgr00abra/page/1342 |chapter=Chapter 43: Bit-plane animation |chapterurl=http://www.phatcode.net/res/224/files/html/ch43/43-01.html |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |url-access=registration }}</ref> which constitutes an early [[graphics accelerator]] inherited by [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] and numerous compatible hardware design models.\n\nEGA is dual-sync; it scans at 21.8&nbsp;kHz when 350-line modes are used and 15.7&nbsp;kHz when 200-line modes are used. The original CGA modes are also present, though EGA is not 100% hardware compatible with CGA, as was mentioned.  EGA can drive an [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]] monitor by a special setting of switches on the board (or by direct hardware programming&mdash;the switches only affect the operation of the BIOS); only 640\u00d7350 high-resolution monochrome graphics and the standard MDA [[text mode]] are available in this mode.  In summary, the EGA supports all BIOS-standard video modes of all previous IBM PC video adapters except the enhanced CGA of the IBM PCjr.  The standard MDA and CGA modes are supported 100% at the BIOS level, with additional support in some details at the hardware register level.  The three enhanced graphics modes of the PCjr&mdash;160x200 16-color, 320x200 16-color, and 640x200 4-color&mdash;are not supported by the EGA, and IBM lists their BIOS video mode numbers (08, 09, and 0A hexadecimal) as reserved.  However, the EGA can generate displays equivalent to these modes using different modes (with different video memory formats, requiring different programming). The EGA 320x200 16-color mode is not the same as nor compatible with the PCjr mode of the same format: the PCjr mode uses 4-bit pixels that are packed 2 pixels to a byte (one in the low nibble, and one in the high nibble) in a 32 KB video buffer that is split into 4 banks of interleaved lines (similar to the two interleaved banks in CGA graphics modes), whereas the EGA mode uses the linear bit-plane format that is native to the EGA.\n\nEGA cards use the PC [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus and were available starting in both eight- and sixteen-bit versions. The original IBM EGA card had 64&nbsp;KB of onboard RAM and required a daughter-board to add an additional 64&nbsp;KB (cards with 64&nbsp;KB are limited to four colors when 640\u00d7350 mode is used). All third-party cards came with 128&nbsp;KB already installed and some even 256&nbsp;KB, allowing multiple graphics pages, multiple text-mode character sets, and large scrolling displays. A few third-party EGA clones (notably the [[ATI Technologies]] and [[Western Digital|Paradise]] boards) feature a range of extended graphics modes (e.g., 640\u00d7400, 640\u00d7480 and 720\u00d7540), as well as automatic monitor type detection, and sometimes also a special 400-line [[Interlaced video|interlace mode]] for use on CGA monitors.\n\n[[File:Tvm-md-3-prevga-monitor-front-and-rear.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Front and rear views of the TVM MD-3 CRT monitor (EGA / pre-VGA era).

This also allows the [[Color Graphics Adapter#With an RGBI monitor|CGA's alternate brown]] color to be used without any additional display hardware. The later [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] standard built on this by allowing each of the 64 colors to be further customized.\n\nHowever, standard EGA monitors do not support use of the extended color palette in 200-line modes. The monitor cannot distinguish between being connected to a CGA card or being connected to an EGA card in a 200-line mode. Compared to CGA, EGA redefines some pins of the connector to carry the extended color information. If the monitor were connected to a CGA card, these pins would not carry valid color information, and the screen might be garbled if the monitor were to interpret them as such. For this reason, standard EGA monitors will use the CGA pin assignment in 200-line modes so the monitor can also be used with a CGA card. Some EGA monitors are ''switchable'', meaning they can be set up to use the full palette even in 200-line modes, often through a mechanical switch. Only a few commercial games were released with support for the extended color palette in 320\u00d7200 or 640\u00d7200 (including the DOS version of [[Super Off Road]]).\n\nWhen selecting a color from the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#6-bit RGB|EGA palette]], two bits are used for the red, green and blue channels. This allows each channel a value of 0, 1, 2 or 3. To select the color magenta, the red and blue values would be medium intensity (2, or 10 in binary) and the green value would be off (0). When calculating the intended value in the 64-color EGA palette, the binary number of the intended entry is of the form \"rgbRGB\" where a lowercase letter is the least significant bit of the channel intensity and an uppercase letter is the most significant bit. For magenta, the most significant bit in the red and blue values is a 1, so the uppercase R and B placeholders would become 1. All other digits are zeros, giving the binary number 000101 for the color magenta. This is 5 in decimal, so setting a palette entry to 5 would result in it being set to magenta. All the color values for the default colors are listed in the table on the right.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Default EGA 16-color palette (set up to match the standard [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] colors)\n|-\n!

The hardware signal interface, including the pin configuration, is largely compatible with CGA.  The differences are in the re-purposing of three pins for the EGA's secondary RGB signals: the CGA \"Intensity\" pin (pin six) has been changed to \"Secondary Green (Intensity)\"; the second ground of CGA (pin two) has been changed to \"Secondary Red (Intensity)\", and pin seven (Reserved on the CGA) is now used for \"Secondary Blue (Intensity)\".  If the EGA is operated in modes having the same scan rates as CGA, a connected CGA monitor should operate correctly, though if the monitor connects pin two to ground, the shorting of the EGA's secondary red output to ground could conceivably damage the EGA adapter.  Similarly, if the CGA monitor is wired with pin two as its sole ground (which is poor design), it will not work with the EGA, though it will work with a CGA.  Finally, because of the use of the CGA's intensity pin as secondary green, on a CGA monitor connected to an EGA, all CGA colors will display correctly, but all other EGA colors will incorrectly display as the standard CGA color which has the same values for the g, R, G, and B bits (ignoring the r and b bits.)  Conversely, an EGA monitor should work with a CGA adapter, but the secondary red signal will be grounded (always zero) and the secondary blue will be floating (unconnected), causing all high-intensity CGA colors except brown to display incorrectly, and all colors to potentially have a variable blue tint due to the indeterminate state of the unconnected secondary blue.\n\nAlmost all EGA cards have DIP switches on the back of the card to select the monitor type. If CGA is selected, the card will operate in 200-line mode and use 8x8 characters in text mode. 350-line modes cannot be accessed, nor any of the extended color palette. If EGA is selected, the card will operate in 350-line mode and use 8\u00d714 text. When 200-line modes are set, it will sync down to 15&nbsp;kHz. If MDA is selected, the card also uses 350 lines and 8\u00d714 text, but the only graphics mode that can be accessed is 640\u00d7350\u00d72.\n\nThe IBM 5154 EGA monitor has a special IBM 5153 CGA compatibility mode when operating with CGA sync signals, and it will automatically change to the CGA pinout to avoid all of the mentioned problems when operating in this mode.<ref>IBM Options and Adapters, Volume 1, \"Enhanced Color Display\", page 4: \"When operating in Mode 1, the display maps the 4 input bits into 16 of the possible 64 colors as shown in the following chart.\" August 2nd, 1984.</ref>\n\n=== Memory mapping ===\nEGA graphics modes are [[planar (computer graphics)|planar]], as opposed to the interlaced [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] and [[Hercules_Graphics_Card|Hercules]] modes. The video memory is divided into four pages (except 640\u00d7350\u00d72, which has two pages), one for each component of the RGBI color space. Each bit represents one pixel. If a bit in the red page is enabled, but none of the equivalent bits in the other pages are, a red pixel will appear in that location on-screen. If all the other bits for that particular pixel were also enabled, it would become white, and so forth. The planes are 8&nbsp;KB in size (200-line modes and 640\u00d7350 with two colors and 32&nbsp;KB video RAM), 16&nbsp;KB (640\u00d7350 with 64&nbsp;KB video RAM), or 32&nbsp;KB (640\u00d7350 with 128&nbsp;KB video RAM) and reside at segment A000 in the CPU's address space.  They are bank-switched and only one plane can be read on the CPU bus at once<!--Though internally, the EGA always reads all 4 planes at once and stores the byte read from each plane in the Graphics Controller data latch for that plane, regardless of which plane is selected to be read on the [CPU] I/O bus-->, although the programmer may set the control registers on the EGA card to select which planes are written to. Thus, it is possible to write to all of them at once even though just one plane can be read from at any given moment.  However, there is an exception: in read mode 1, all four planes are read and compared with programmed \"Color Compare\" data, and a byte indicating the result of comparing all four planes is what is read on the I/O bus.\n\nFor color text and CGA graphics modes, the video memory is mapped to 16 KB of memory addresses beginning at address B8000h. In monochrome (MDA-compatible) text mode, video memory occupies 16 KB beginning at B0000h.  These address mappings are for backwards compatibility.  For modes new to the EGA, the video memory begins at address A0000h and occupies 64 KB. The card can also be set to map 128 KB at that base address, but no standard BIOS video modes use that option.  The different base addresses for color vs. monochrome modes makes it possible for an EGA  to be operated simultaneously with a monochrome graphics card in the same computer, or for an EGA in MDA text mode to operated simultaneously with a CGA in the same computer.\n\n=== Connector ===\nFemale [[DE-9 connector]], on EGA (computer).<br />\nPin numbers (looking at socket): top row is pins 1\u20135, bottom row is pins 6 to 9, both '''numbered from right to left''' in this illustration.\n\n[[File:DE9 Diagram.svg|177px]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Pin assignments'''\n|-\n!

However CGA had inferior graphics to the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] computer families, which became very popular in Europe in particular from 1987 onward delaying general acceptance of the PC as home and games machines until the early 90s. The Atari could display 16 colours from a palette of 512 in 320*200 or 256 (NTSC/PAL), while the first generation Amigas generally displayed 32 colours out of a pallette of 4096 in 320*200 or 256, but could display all 4096 simultaneously. Commercial software began supporting EGA by 1986 and Sierra's ''[[King's Quest III]]'' was one of the earliest [[PC game]]s to use it. Most software made up to 1991 can run in EGA, although the vast majority of commercial games used 320\u00d7200 with 16 colors for reasons of compatibility with CGA and Tandy and to support users who did not own a proper EGA monitor. The 350-line modes were mostly used by freeware/shareware games and application software, although ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'' is a notable example of a commercial game that runs in 640\u00d7350\u00d716 mode.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|EGA}}\n* {{ill|JEGA|ja|Japanese Enhanced Graphics Adapter}} (Japanese Enhanced Graphics Adapter for [[AX architecture|AX]] computers)\n* [[Video card]]\n* [[Graphics display resolution]]\n* [[Graphics processing unit]]\n* [[List of video connectors|List of display interfaces]]\n* [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes]]{{snd}}[[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#6-bit RGB|6-bit RGB]] section\n* [[List of 16-bit computer color palettes]]{{snd}}[[List of 16-bit computer color palettes#EGA|EGA]] section\n* [[Professional Graphics Controller]]\n* [[VGA compatible text mode]]{{snd}}EGA\u2019s own modes are just a subset, and all features are nearly the same\n* [[List of defunct graphics chips and card companies]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=Upgrading and Repairing PCs |edition=second |last=Mueller |first=Scott |year=1992 |publisher=Que Books |isbn=0-88022-856-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/upgradingrepairi0000muel_2ndedition }}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Computer display standard}}\n\n[[Category:Computer display standards]]\n[[Category:IBM video hardware]]\n[[Category:Video cards]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1984]]\n", "name_user": "Odysseus Giacosa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAdoption", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Graphics_Adapter"}

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
