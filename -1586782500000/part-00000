Outbursts of antisemitism emanating from [[Far right in the United Kingdom|far right groups]] continued, however, leading to the formation of the [[43 Group]] led by Jewish ex-servicemen which broke up fascist meetings from 1945 to early 1950.\n\nThe Communal Security Trust (CST) was formed in 1994 to \"[protect] British Jews from antisemitism and related threats\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cst.org.uk/about-cst|title=About CST \u2013 CST \u2013 Protecting Our Jewish Community|website=cst.org.uk|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> It works in conjunction with the police and other authorities to protect Jewish schools, Synagogues, and other community institutions.\n\nWhile records of antisemitic incidents have been compiled since 1984, changing reporting practices and levels of reporting make comparison over time difficult.\n\n==Communal institutions==\n<!--more specific inclusion criteria useful: include only Jewish orgs based in UK that have articles (no redlinks or EXT), sorted alphabetically, these can be found in [[Category:Jewish organisations based in the United Kingdom]] (and sub cats), and other cats-->\nBritish Jewish communal organisations include:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Anglo-Jewish Association]]\n* [[Association of Jewish Refugees]]\n* [[Board of Deputies of British Jews|Board of Deputies]] (1760)\n* [[CCJO Ren\u00e9 Cassin]]\n* [[Community Security Trust]]\n* [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]]\n* [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]\n* [[Jewish Book Week|Jewish Book Council]]\n* [[Jewish Care]]\n* [[Jewish Council for Racial Equality]]\n* [[Jewish Genealogical Society of Great Britain]]\n* [[Jewish Leadership Council]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejlc.org/members|title=Members|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[JW3]] \u2013 a London venue\n* [[Kisharon]]\n* [[League of British Jews]]\n* [[League of Jewish Women]]\n* [[Leo Baeck Institute London]]\n* [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]]\n* [[Limmud]]\n* [[London Jewish Forum]]\n* [[London Jewish Cultural Centre]]\n* [[Maccabaeans]]\n* [[Mitzvah Day International]]\n* [[Movement for Reform Judaism]]\n* [[Norwood (charity)|Norwood]]\n* [[Scottish Council of Jewish Communities]]\n* [[Tzelem]]\n* [[UCL Institute of Jewish Studies]]\n* [[UK Jewish Film Festival]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Students]]\n* [[United Restitution Organization]]\n* [[United Synagogue]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Women]]\n* [[World Jewish Relief]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Judaism}}\n* [[List of British Jews]]\n* [[List of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the Jews in England]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Scotland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in the Isle of Man]]\n* [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group= n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |title= Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130822190807/http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |archivedate= 22 August 2013 }}&nbsp;{{small|(430&nbsp;KB)}}.

He won the [[BDO World Darts Championship]] in 1996 and is a former [[Darts world rankings|World No. 1]].\n\n==Background==\nBeaton was born in [[Coventry]], [[Warwickshire]], [[England]].\n\n==BDO career==\n\nBeaton made his World Championship debut in 1992, at a time when the world darts championship was still a unified tournament. He lost in the first round to [[Chris Johns (darts player)|Chris Johns]] 1\u20133,<ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=16</ref> but he was encouraged by his performance in the same tournament in 1993 when he achieved a huge upset win over the tournament favourite and former world champion [[Dennis Priestley]], and he also beat another former world champion in [[Bob Anderson (darts player)|Bob Anderson]], before losing in the semi-final to [[Alan Warriner-Little|Alan Warriner]].<ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=17</ref> He became a full-time professional later in 1993 at a time after [[split in darts|the split]], which saw the [[Professional Darts Corporation|WDC]] players banned from all [[British Darts Organisation|BDO]] tournaments \u2013 and Beaton went on to win the prestigious [[Winmau World Masters]], beating [[Les Wallace]] in the final.\n\nAfter the WDC (now PDC) players were expelled from all BDO tournaments in April 1993, it left Beaton as the top seeded player for the 1994 and 1995 BDO world championships, but he lost in the first round both times, to [[Nick Gedney]] and [[Dave Askew]] respectively,<ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=18</ref><ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=19</ref> both times losing 2\u20133 after leading 2\u20130. But in 1996, he finally delivered at the BDO world championships, beating [[Co Stomp\u00e9]], [[John Part]], [[Martin Adams]], [[Andy Fordham]] and then [[Richie Burnett]] in the final to clinch the BDO World Championship.<ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=20</ref>\n\nWhen he defended his world title in 1997, Beaton was within the width of the Double 10 wire of reaching the final, but he lost to [[Marshall James]] in a tight semi-final match.\n\nBeaton won many Open titles during his career in BDO tournaments including the Dutch, Danish, Belgian and Swedish Opens.\n\nBeaton continued to play in the BDO version of the World Championship until 2001 (reaching the semi-final in 1997 and quarter-final in 1998), while also participating in some televised [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] events. When the PDC changed the eligibility rules for their televised tournaments from the start of 2002, Beaton decided to switch to playing in the [[PDC World Darts Championship]].\n\n==PDC career==\n\nBeaton has never made the same impact in the PDC, having failed to reach the quarter-finals in any of his attempts at the world crown, his best finishes being three Round of 16 losses in 2002, 2004 and 2020. In 2002 the tournament was still only five rounds he got knocked out in round two by John Part 0\u20136. In 2004 when he got a bye to the third round and was knocked out in round four by Mark Dudbridge 1\u20134. His poor form has seen him slip down the [[Darts world rankings|world rankings]] but always maintained a position in the top 32. Beaton has however reached the semi-finals in four major PDC tournaments \u2013 the [[2001 World Matchplay (darts)|2001 World Matchplay]] when he lost to Richie Burnett, the [[2004 UK Open]] when he lost to [[Roland Scholten]], the 2004 World Grand Prix when he lost to Alan Warriner, and the [[2010 Grand Slam of Darts]] when he lost to [[Scott Waites]]. Prior to losing to Waites at the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, Beaton had rolled back the years in his quarter final match by coming from 11\u201314 behind to win five legs in a row and defeat the 3-time defending champion, [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]], 16\u201314.\n\nBeaton saw a rise in form in the 2009 season taking him even further up the  rankings to 19th in the world. Beaton won his first title in almost nine years when he took the Players Championship in Nuland in October. He also finished runner up in the European championship beating the likes of [[Adrian Lewis]], [[Mark Walsh (darts player)|Mark Walsh]] and [[James Wade]] en route to the final where he was defeated 11\u20133 by Phil Taylor. This result however gave Beaton a place in the [[2009 Grand Slam of Darts]], where he progressed from the round robin stage courtesy of wins over [[Co Stomp\u00e9]] and [[Kevin McDine]] before being comprehensively outplayed by [[Simon Whitlock]].\n\nAs mentioned before, at the 2010 Grand Slam Of Darts, Beaton produced a major upset by beating three-time defending champion Phil Taylor 16\u201314 in the quarter-finals, having trailed 9\u201313 and 11\u201314. Earlier in the week, Beaton had needed to defeat [[Paul Nicholson (darts player)|Paul Nicholson]] 5\u20133 or better at the round robin stage to stay in the tournament (he won 5\u20131), and followed that up with a 10\u20136 win over [[Ted Hankey]] who had himself defeated Taylor in his group. Beaton was defeated by eventual champion [[Scott Waites]] 16\u20139 in the semi-final. Despite his good form in 2010 he was narrowly defeated in the first round of the [[2011 PDC World Darts Championship]] by [[Mark Hylton (darts player)|Mark Hylton]] eventually losing by 3 sets to 2. The following year, Beaton recovered from two sets and three match darts down against [[Magnus Caris]] to win 3\u20132, but was beaten by Simon Whitlock 1\u20134 in the second round.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/FixtureList.aspx?EventKey=3069 | title=2012 PDC World Championship Results | publisher=Darts Database | accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the rest of the major events in 2012, Beaton could not win more than one game in any of them with his best results being last 16 exits in the [[2012 World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]], [[2012 World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]] and [[2012 Players Championship Finals|Players Championship Finals]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Beaton 2012|url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/PlayerDetails.aspx?PlayerKey=33&organPd=All&tourns=All&plStat=1#PlayerResults|work=Darts Database|access-date=6 January 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106233717/http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/PlayerDetails.aspx?PlayerKey=33&organPd=All&tourns=All&plStat=1%23PlayerResults|archive-date=6 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On the [[2012 PDC Pro Tour|PDC Pro Tour]] he lost in the semi-finals of the second Players Championship in a deciding leg to [[Dave Chisnall]] and also reached two other quarter-finals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=3974 | title=2012 PDPA Players Championship Reading Results | publisher=Darts Database | accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2013 PDC World Darts Championship|2013 World Championship]] Beaton defeated qualifier [[Kyle Anderson (darts player)|Kyle Anderson]] 3\u20130, but was then beaten 4\u20132 by James Wade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=3831 | title=2013 PDC World Championship Results | publisher=Darts Database | accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref> After the tournament he was ranked world number 28.<ref>{{cite web|title=Order of Merit on 1 January 2013|url=http://www.pdc.tv/pdc-order-of-merit|work=[[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]|accessdate=6 January 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130106234729/http://www.pdc.tv/pdc-order-of-merit|archivedate=6 January 2013}}</ref> He reached the quarter-finals of a PDC Pro Tour event for the first time in six months in April at the seventh [[2013 PDC Pro Tour#2013 UK Open Qualifiers|UK Open Qualifier]], but lost 6\u20133 to [[John Part]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/15m54kjp89ve71gbggbalceij6/title/seventh-heaven-for-huybrechts | title=Seventh Heaven For Huybrechts | publisher=[[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] | access-date=27 April 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430003534/http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/15m54kjp89ve71gbggbalceij6/title/seventh-heaven-for-huybrechts | archive-date=30 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> At the [[2013 UK Open|UK Open]] itself, he lost 9\u20135 to Joey Palfreyman in the third round.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/kyvvdwabovg61ux60pkqc1lwb/title/speedy-services-uk-open---friday | title=Speedy Services UK Open \u2013 Friday | publisher=[[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] | accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> He lost in two consecutive semi-finals in European Tour events during the year.

He won the [[BDO World Darts Championship]] in 1996 and is a former [[Darts world rankings|World No. 1]].\n\n==Background==\nBeaton was born in [[Coventry]], [[Warwickshire]], [[England]].\n\n==BDO career==\n\nBeaton made his World Championship debut in 1992, at a time when the world darts championship was still a unified tournament. He lost in the first round to [[Chris Johns (darts player)|Chris Johns]] 1\u20133,<ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=16</ref> but he was encouraged by his performance in the same tournament in 1993 when he achieved a huge upset win over the tournament favourite and former world champion [[Dennis Priestley]], and he also beat another former world champion in [[Bob Anderson (darts player)|Bob Anderson]], before losing in the semi-final to [[Alan Warriner-Little|Alan Warriner]].<ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=17</ref> He became a full-time professional later in 1993 at a time after [[split in darts|the split]], which saw the [[Professional Darts Corporation|WDC]] players banned from all [[British Darts Organisation|BDO]] tournaments \u2013 and Beaton went on to win the prestigious [[Winmau World Masters]], beating [[Les Wallace]] in the final.\n\nAfter the WDC (now PDC) players were expelled from all BDO tournaments in April 1993, it left Beaton as the top seeded player for the 1994 and 1995 BDO world championships, but he lost in the first round both times, to [[Nick Gedney]] and [[Dave Askew]] respectively,<ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=18</ref><ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=19</ref> both times losing 2\u20133 after leading 2\u20130. But in 1996, he finally delivered at the BDO world championships, beating [[Co Stomp\u00e9]], [[John Part]], [[Martin Adams]], [[Andy Fordham]] and then [[Richie Burnett]] in the final to clinch the BDO World Championship.<ref>http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=20</ref>\n\nWhen he defended his world title in 1997, Beaton was within the width of the Double 10 wire of reaching the final, but he lost to [[Marshall James]] in a tight semi-final match.\n\nBeaton won many Open titles during his career in BDO tournaments including the Dutch, Danish, Belgian and Swedish Opens.\n\nBeaton continued to play in the BDO version of the World Championship until 2001 (reaching the semi-final in 1997 and quarter-final in 1998), while also participating in some televised [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] events. When the PDC changed the eligibility rules for their televised tournaments from the start of 2002, Beaton decided to switch to playing in the [[PDC World Darts Championship]].\n\n==PDC career==\n\nBeaton has never made the same impact in the PDC, having failed to reach the quarter-finals in any of his attempts at the world crown, his best finishes being three Round of 16 losses in 2002, 2004 and 2020. In 2002 the tournament was still only five rounds he got knocked out in round two by John Part 0\u20136. In 2004 when he got a bye to the third round and was knocked out in round four by Mark Dudbridge 1\u20134. His poor form has seen him slip down the [[Darts world rankings|world rankings]] but always maintained a position in the top 32. Beaton has however reached the semi-finals in four major PDC tournaments \u2013 the [[2001 World Matchplay (darts)|2001 World Matchplay]] when he lost to Richie Burnett, the [[2004 UK Open]] when he lost to [[Roland Scholten]], the 2004 World Grand Prix when he lost to Alan Warriner, and the [[2010 Grand Slam of Darts]] when he lost to [[Scott Waites]]. Prior to losing to Waites at the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, Beaton had rolled back the years in his quarter final match by coming from 11\u201314 behind to win five legs in a row and defeat the 3-time defending champion, [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]], 16\u201314.\n\nBeaton saw a rise in form in the 2009 season taking him even further up the  rankings to 19th in the world. Beaton won his first title in almost nine years when he took the Players Championship in Nuland in October. He also finished runner up in the European championship beating the likes of [[Adrian Lewis]], [[Mark Walsh (darts player)|Mark Walsh]] and [[James Wade]] en route to the final where he was defeated 11\u20133 by Phil Taylor. This result however gave Beaton a place in the [[2009 Grand Slam of Darts]], where he progressed from the round robin stage courtesy of wins over [[Co Stomp\u00e9]] and [[Kevin McDine]] before being comprehensively outplayed by [[Simon Whitlock]].\n\nAs mentioned before, at the 2010 Grand Slam Of Darts, Beaton produced a major upset by beating three-time defending champion Phil Taylor 16\u201314 in the quarter-finals, having trailed 9\u201313 and 11\u201314. Earlier in the week, Beaton had needed to defeat [[Paul Nicholson (darts player)|Paul Nicholson]] 5\u20133 or better at the round robin stage to stay in the tournament (he won 5\u20131), and followed that up with a 10\u20136 win over [[Ted Hankey]] who had himself defeated Taylor in his group. Beaton was defeated by eventual champion [[Scott Waites]] 16\u20139 in the semi-final. Despite his good form in 2010 he was narrowly defeated in the first round of the [[2011 PDC World Darts Championship]] by [[Mark Hylton (darts player)|Mark Hylton]] eventually losing by 3 sets to 2. The following year, Beaton recovered from two sets and three match darts down against [[Magnus Caris]] to win 3\u20132, but was beaten by Simon Whitlock 1\u20134 in the second round.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/FixtureList.aspx?EventKey=3069 | title=2012 PDC World Championship Results | publisher=Darts Database | accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the rest of the major events in 2012, Beaton could not win more than one game in any of them with his best results being last 16 exits in the [[2012 World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]], [[2012 World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]] and [[2012 Players Championship Finals|Players Championship Finals]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Beaton 2012|url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/PlayerDetails.aspx?PlayerKey=33&organPd=All&tourns=All&plStat=1#PlayerResults|work=Darts Database|access-date=6 January 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106233717/http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/PlayerDetails.aspx?PlayerKey=33&organPd=All&tourns=All&plStat=1%23PlayerResults|archive-date=6 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On the [[2012 PDC Pro Tour|PDC Pro Tour]] he lost in the semi-finals of the second Players Championship in a deciding leg to [[Dave Chisnall]] and also reached two other quarter-finals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=3974 | title=2012 PDPA Players Championship Reading Results | publisher=Darts Database | accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2013 PDC World Darts Championship|2013 World Championship]] Beaton defeated qualifier [[Kyle Anderson (darts player)|Kyle Anderson]] 3\u20130, but was then beaten 4\u20132 by James Wade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=3831 | title=2013 PDC World Championship Results | publisher=Darts Database | accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref> After the tournament he was ranked world number 28.<ref>{{cite web|title=Order of Merit on 1 January 2013|url=http://www.pdc.tv/pdc-order-of-merit|work=[[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]|accessdate=6 January 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130106234729/http://www.pdc.tv/pdc-order-of-merit|archivedate=6 January 2013}}</ref> He reached the quarter-finals of a PDC Pro Tour event for the first time in six months in April at the seventh [[2013 PDC Pro Tour#2013 UK Open Qualifiers|UK Open Qualifier]], but lost 6\u20133 to [[John Part]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/15m54kjp89ve71gbggbalceij6/title/seventh-heaven-for-huybrechts | title=Seventh Heaven For Huybrechts | publisher=[[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] | access-date=27 April 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430003534/http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/15m54kjp89ve71gbggbalceij6/title/seventh-heaven-for-huybrechts | archive-date=30 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> At the [[2013 UK Open|UK Open]] itself, he lost 9\u20135 to Joey Palfreyman in the third round.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/kyvvdwabovg61ux60pkqc1lwb/title/speedy-services-uk-open---friday | title=Speedy Services UK Open \u2013 Friday | publisher=[[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] | accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> He lost in two consecutive semi-finals in European Tour events during the year.

It is an institute that provides dynamic training to educate drivers about right ways of driving. The institute works sincerely towards fulfilling its initiative of increasing \u201cRoad Safety\" while driving as well as reducing the number of accidents happening due to untrained drivers.\n\n== Origin ==\nIn the midst 1990\u2019s the number of accidents in India were on a rise and the driving discipline and training was very weak. There was an indomitable need to develop a training facility to control the situation. IDTR was developed with the objective to go on and set a benchmark in professional driver education and lay down the ground rules for safe driving. Driving training facilities and [[curriculum]] were designed to impart training for driving a gamut of vehicles ranging from cars, trucks, buses, taxis to three-wheelers.\n\nThe first Institute of Driving Training and Research was built at [[Loni, Ghaziabad|Loni]], Delhi. It was a joint venture between the Department of Transport, [[Government of Delhi]] and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. Delhi based architecture firm, Creators Architects,<ref>[http://creatorsarchitects.com/ Creators Architects<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> experts in space design for automobile firms, was engaged to design the [[institute]] with world class infrastructure facilities and scientifically engineered tracks for practical training.

[[Sheila Dikshit]].\n\nLater on the IDTR network was expanded by building IDTR\u2019s in New Delhi ([[Sarai Kale Khan]]), two in Haryana ([[Rohtak]] and [[Bahadurgarh]]), one in [[Gujarat]] ([[Vadodara]]), one in [[Uttarakhand]] ([[Dehradun]]), one in [[Maharashtra]] ([[Pune]]) and a few others.\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The instructor-led discussions are a repository of information on engaging learners on the why\u2019s, how\u2019s and ways to prevent such incidents besides drawing solutions from participants.

A total of seven men have won all five eligible championships; [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Chris Jericho]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Triple H]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Big Show]], and [[Jeff Hardy]].\n\nAlthough the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]] is the counterpart to the Intercontinental Championship, it has not been designated as an acceptable substitute for the Triple Crown, though in 2015, it became a required championship for [[Grand Slam (professional wrestling)#WWE|WWE's Grand Slam]]. In July 2016, a second brand extension period began and two new titles were introduced: the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]]. In January 2017, these were designated as acceptable substitutes for their counterpart titles in the Grand Slam, but WWE have not yet confirmed if they are acceptable substitutes for the Triple Crown. Only four wrestlers have become a Triple Crown winner since the new titles were established, and for three of them, although they have held one of the newer titles, their Triple Crown designation is recognized by their previous titles held ([[Seth Rollins]] and [[Roman Reigns]] have each held the Universal Championship while [[Kofi Kingston]], [[The Miz]], [[Jeff Hardy]], and [[Daniel Bryan]] have each held the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, but these wrestlers had already held the required titles in those tiers). At [[Wrestlemania 36]], [[Braun Strowman]] won the Universal Championship after previously holding the Intercontinental and Raw Tag Team Championships, but WWE has yet to confirm if these accolades make Strowman a Triple Crown winner.\n\nCM Punk holds the record for completing the Triple Crown in the shortest amount of time between the first and third title. It took him 203 days between June 2008 and January 2009. This broke [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]]'s previous record of 227 days set in 1994.<ref name=\"CMPunkRecord\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2009/01/22/2009-01-22_punk_rocks_cm_is_wwes_triple_threat.html|title=Punk rocks!

A total of seven men have won all five eligible championships; [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Chris Jericho]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Triple H]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Big Show]], and [[Jeff Hardy]].\n\nAlthough the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]] is the counterpart to the Intercontinental Championship, it has not been designated as an acceptable substitute for the Triple Crown, though in 2015, it became a required championship for [[Grand Slam (professional wrestling)#WWE|WWE's Grand Slam]]. In July 2016, a second brand extension period began and two new titles were introduced: the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]]. In January 2017, these were designated as acceptable substitutes for their counterpart titles in the Grand Slam, but WWE have not yet confirmed if they are acceptable substitutes for the Triple Crown. Only four wrestlers have become a Triple Crown winner since the new titles were established, and for three of them, although they have held one of the newer titles, their Triple Crown designation is recognized by their previous titles held ([[Seth Rollins]] and [[Roman Reigns]] have each held the Universal Championship while [[Kofi Kingston]], [[The Miz]], [[Jeff Hardy]], and [[Daniel Bryan]] have each held the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, but these wrestlers had already held the required titles in those tiers). At [[Wrestlemania 36]], [[Braun Strowman]] won the Universal Championship after previously holding the Intercontinental and Raw Tag Team Championships, but WWE has yet to confirm if these accolades make Strowman a Triple Crown winner.\n\nCM Punk holds the record for completing the Triple Crown in the shortest amount of time between the first and third title. It took him 203 days between June 2008 and January 2009. This broke [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]]'s previous record of 227 days set in 1994.<ref name=\"CMPunkRecord\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2009/01/22/2009-01-22_punk_rocks_cm_is_wwes_triple_threat.html|title=Punk rocks!
