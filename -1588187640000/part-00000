{"title_page": "M\u00e1 vlast", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n'''''M\u00e1 vlast''''' ({{IPA-cs|ma\u02d0 vlast}}, meaning \"My homeland\" in [[Czech language]]) is a set of six [[symphonic poem]]s composed between 1874 and 1879 by the Czech composer [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]]. While it is often presented as a single work in six movements and \u2013 with the exception of ''Vltava'' \u2013 is almost always recorded that way, the six pieces were conceived as individual works. They had their own separate premieres between 1875 and 1880; the premiere of the complete set took place on 5 November 1882 in [[\u017dof\u00edn Palace]], Prague,<ref name=zofin>[http://www.zofin.cz/en/palac-zofin/ \u017dof\u00edn Palace] Official site of \u017dof\u00edn Palace, accessed 7 December 2016.</ref> under [[Adolf \u010cech]], who had also conducted two of the individual premieres.\n\nIn these works Smetana combined the symphonic poem form pioneered by [[Franz Liszt]] with the ideals of nationalistic music which were current in the late nineteenth century. Each poem depicts some aspect of the countryside, history, or legends of [[Bohemia]].\n\nSince 1952 the works have been performed to open the [[Prague Spring International Music Festival]] on 12 May, the anniversary of the death of their composer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival.cz/en%20/archives/62|title=Bed\u0159ich Smetana: My Country|year=2012|publisher=Pra\u017esk\u00e9 jaro|accessdate=10 June 2017}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Vy\u0161ehrad ==\n[[Image:Vysehrad as seen over the Vltava from Cisarska louka 732.jpg|thumb|right|Vy\u0161ehrad above the Vltava River]]\nThe first poem, ''Vy\u0161ehrad'' (The High Castle), composed between the end of September and 18 November 1874 and premiered on 14 March 1875, describes the [[Vy\u0161ehrad]] castle in [[Prague]] which was the seat of the earliest [[Czech kings]]. During the summer of 1874, Smetana began to lose his hearing, and total deafness soon followed; he described the gradual, but rapid loss of his hearing in a letter of resignation to the director of the Royal Provincial Czech Theatre, Anton\u00edn \u010c\u00ed\u017eek. In July 1874 he began hearing anomalous noise and then a permanent buzzing.  Not long after the onset he was unable to distinguish individual sounds. At the beginning of October he lost all hearing in his right ear, and finally on 20 October in his left. His treatment was based on maintaining isolation from all sounds, but was unsuccessful.<ref>Marta Ottlov\u00e1, et al. \"Smetana, Bed\u0159ich\". Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed November 1, 2012.</ref>\nThe poem begins with the sounds of the harp of the mythical singer [[Lum\u00edr]], and then crosses over into the tones of the castle's arsenal.  This section of the music introduces the main motifs, which are used in other parts of the cycle.  A four note motif (B{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}-D-B{{music|flat}}) represents the castle of Vy\u0161ehrad; this is heard again at the end of 'Vltava' and once more, to round the whole cycle off, at the conclusion of 'Blan\u00edk'.\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c'' { \\clef treble \\key ees \\major \\time 3/4 \\tempo \"Lento\" 4=50 <bes g ees>4\\f <ees c g ees>-> r8 <d bes f> | <bes g ees>4 } \\new Staff { \\clef bass \\key ees \\major \\time 3/4 <bes g ees> <c' g ees c>-> r8 <bes f d> | <bes g ees>4 } >> } </score>\n\nIn the score two harps are required to perform the opening arpeggios. After a dominant seventh chord, the winds take up the theme, followed by the strings, before the whole orchestra is employed to reach a climax. In the next part, Smetana recalls the story of the castle, using a faster tempo which becomes a march. A seemingly triumphant climax is cut short by a descending passage depicting the collapse of the castle, and the music falls quiet.  Then the opening harp material is heard again and the music reminds again of the beauty of the castle, now in ruins.  The music ends quietly, depicting the [[Vltava|River Vltava]] flowing below the castle.\n\nConceived between 1872 and 1874, it is the only piece in the cycle to be mostly completed before Smetana began to go noticeably deaf in the summer of 1874.

A depiction of the beauty of the Czech countryside and its people, the tone poem tells no real story. The first part is dedicated to   the grandeur of the forest with a surprising [[fugue]] in the strings, interrupted by a soft woodland melody of the horns, which is later taken over by the whole orchestra. In the second part, a village festival is depicted in full swing. This tone poem was originally written to be the finale of ''M\u00e1 vlast''.\n\n== T\u00e1bor ==\nThis piece, which was finished on 13 December 1878 and premiered on 4 January 1880, is named for the city of [[T\u00e1bor]] in the south of [[Bohemia]] founded by the [[Hussite]]s and serving as their center during the [[Hussite Wars]]. The theme for the piece is quoted from the first two lines of the Hussite hymn, \"[[Kto\u017e js\u00fa bo\u017e\u00ed bojovn\u00edci]]\" (\"Ye Who Are Warriors of God\").\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 3/2 \\key d \\minor d\\ff-. d-. d2-> d-> | r r d\\ff | e4-.-> c-. c1-> } </score>\n\n== Blan\u00edk ==\n[[File:Cerny-Jirasek.jpg|thumb|right|An army of knights led by St. Wenceslas]]\nBlan\u00edk was finished on 9 March 1879 and premiered on 4 January 1880. It is named for the mountain [[Blan\u00edk]] inside which a legend says that a huge army of knights led by [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|St. Wenceslas]] sleep. The knights will awake and help the country in its gravest hour (sometimes described as four hostile armies attacking from all [[cardinal direction]]s).\n\nMusically, ''Blan\u00edk'' begins exactly as ''T\u00e1bor'' ends, \"hammering\" out the motto which was left unresolved, but now continuing on, as if in the aftermath of the battle. Thus these last two tone poems of the cycle form a cohesive pair, as do the first two; the High Castle's theme returns as the Vltava's river journey triumphantly reaches that same destination, and again returns triumphantly at the end of ''Blan\u00edk''. Once again, the Hussite hymn used in T\u00e1bor is quoted, though this time it is the third line which rings out in the march at the end of the piece. The original lyrics to this line in the hymn are \"so that finally with Him you will always be victorious\", a reference to the eventual victorious rise of the Czech state.\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef bass \\time 3/2 \\key d \\major d->\\fff d-> d2-> d-> | e4-> c-> c2-> r | e4->-. c->~ c b->-. b2-> | a1->\\fz r2 | a4->\\sfz c-> c2-> a-> | a4-> f-> f2-> } </score>\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe work is scored for [[piccolo]], two [[flutes]], two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinets]], two [[bassoons]], four [[French horns]], two [[trumpets]], three [[trombones]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[bass drum]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[cymbals]], two [[harps]], and [[string instrument|strings]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Classical music}}\n{{Commons category|M\u00e1 vlast}}\n* {{IMSLP2|work=M\u00e1_Vlast_(Smetana,_Bedrich)|cname=Ma Vlast}}\n* [http://www.radio.cz/en/article/121632 A symphonic poem to the nation] Czech Radio programme in English by Christian Falvey\n* [http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/bfk4093/index.html Full score] of the second poem ''Vltava''\n* [http://ozaru.net/impromptu/downloads.html Sheet music of piano duet version] (arranged by the composer)\n<!-- ''A little bit of [[WP:OR]] seems to have got in here''?: * [http://www.cramim.rishon.k12.il/rishon/romani.mp3 \"Oi Scha\"] A Rumanian folksong about the oxen wagon, perhaps the source for the Vltava tune -->\n* [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2006/May06/Smetana_Dorati_4768717.htm Ates Orga ''M\u00e1 vlast'' (comparative CD review, 2006)]\n\n{{Bed\u0159ich Smetana|state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ma Vlast}}\n[[Category:Compositions by Bed\u0159ich Smetana]]\n[[Category:Symphonic poems]]\n[[Category:1874 compositions]]\n[[Category:1875 compositions]]\n[[Category:1878 compositions]]\n[[Category:1879 compositions]]\n", "text_old": "{{Italic title}}\n'''''M\u00e1 vlast''''' ({{IPA-cs|ma\u02d0 vlast}}, meaning \"My homeland\" in [[Czech language]]) is a set of six [[symphonic poem]]s composed between 1874 and 1879 by the Czech composer [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]].

The theme for the piece is quoted from the first two lines of the Hussite hymn, \"[[Kto\u017e js\u00fa bo\u017e\u00ed bojovn\u00edci]]\" (\"Ye Who Are Warriors of God\").\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 3/2 \\key d \\minor d\\ff-. d-. d2-> d-> | r r d\\ff | e4-.-> c-. c1-> } </score>\n\n== Blan\u00edk ==\n[[File:Cerny-Jirasek.jpg|thumb|right|An army of knights led by St. Wenceslas]]\nBlan\u00edk was finished on 9 March 1879 and premiered on 4 January 1880. It is named for the mountain [[Blan\u00edk]] inside which a legend says that a huge army of knights led by [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|St. Wenceslas]] sleep. The knights will awake and help the country in its gravest hour (sometimes described as four hostile armies attacking from all [[cardinal direction]]s).\n\nMusically, ''Blan\u00edk'' begins exactly as ''T\u00e1bor'' ends, \"hammering\" out the motto which was left unresolved, but now continuing on, as if in the aftermath of the battle. Thus these last two tone poems of the cycle form a cohesive pair, as do the first two; the High Castle's theme returns as the Vltava's river journey triumphantly reaches that same destination, and again returns triumphantly at the end of ''Blan\u00edk''. Once again, the Hussite hymn used in T\u00e1bor is quoted, though this time it is the third line which rings out in the march at the end of the piece. The original lyrics to this line in the hymn are \"so that finally with Him you will always be victorious\", a reference to the eventual victorious rise of the Czech state.\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef bass \\time 3/2 \\key d \\major d->\\fff d-> d2-> d-> | e4-> c-> c2-> r | e4->-. c->~ c b->-. b2-> | a1->\\fz r2 | a4->\\sfz c-> c2-> a-> | a4-> f-> f2-> } </score>\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe work is scored for [[piccolo]], two [[flutes]], two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinets]], two [[bassoons]], four [[French horns]], two [[trumpets]], three [[trombones]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[bass drum]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[cymbals]], two [[harps]], and [[string instrument|strings]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Classical music}}\n{{Commons category|M\u00e1 vlast}}\n* {{IMSLP2|work=M\u00e1_Vlast_(Smetana,_Bedrich)|cname=Ma Vlast}}\n* [http://www.radio.cz/en/article/121632 A symphonic poem to the nation] Czech Radio programme in English by Christian Falvey\n* [http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/bfk4093/index.html Full score] of the second poem ''Vltava''\n* [http://ozaru.net/impromptu/downloads.html Sheet music of piano duet version] (arranged by the composer)\n<!-- ''A little bit of [[WP:OR]] seems to have got in here''?: * [http://www.cramim.rishon.k12.il/rishon/romani.mp3 \"Oi Scha\"] A Rumanian folksong about the oxen wagon, perhaps the source for the Vltava tune -->\n* [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2006/May06/Smetana_Dorati_4768717.htm Ates Orga ''M\u00e1 vlast'' (comparative CD review, 2006)]\n\n{{Bed\u0159ich Smetana|state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ma Vlast}}\n[[Category:Compositions by Bed\u0159ich Smetana]]\n[[Category:Symphonic poems]]\n[[Category:1874 compositions]]\n[[Category:1875 compositions]]\n[[Category:1878 compositions]]\n[[Category:1879 compositions]]\n", "name_user": "Martinevans123", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVltava:tweaks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1_vlast"}

Office numbers go clockwise around each of the rings, and have two parts: a nearest-corridor number (1 to 10) followed by a bay number (00 to 99), so office numbers range from 100 to 1099. These corridors radiate out from the central courtyard, with corridor 1 beginning with the Concourse's south end. Each numbered radial corridor intersects with the corresponding numbered group of offices (for example, corridor 5 divides the 500 series office block). There are a number of historical displays in the building, particularly in the \"A\" and \"E\" rings.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nFloors in the Pentagon are lettered \"B\" for Basement and \"M\" for [[Mezzanine (architecture)|Mezzanine]], both of which are below ground level.

Thus, office 2B315 is on the second floor, B ring, and nearest to corridor 3 (between corridors 2 and 3). One way to get to this office would be to go to the second floor, get to the A (innermost) ring, go to and take corridor 3, and then turn left on ring B to get to bay 15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hqda.army.mil/aoguide/Pentagon_Map.htm|title=How to Find a Room in the Pentagon|accessdate=September 13, 2007|publisher=Headquarters, Dept. of the Army|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921023919/http://www.hqda.army.mil/aoguide/Pentagon_Map.htm|archivedate=September 21, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nIt is possible for a person to walk between any two points in the Pentagon in less than seven minutes.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/03/04/pentagon.shooting/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Man shoots 2 officers outside Pentagon |accessdate=May 25, 2010 | date=March 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe complex includes eating and exercise facilities, and meditation and prayer rooms.

Woodrum pressed Brigadier General [[Eugene Reybold]], who was representing the War Department at the hearing, for an \"overall solution\" to the department's \"space problem\" rather than building yet more temporary buildings.

Requirements for the new building were that it be no more than four stories tall, and that it use a minimal amount of steel. The requirements meant that, instead of rising vertically, the building would be sprawling over a large area.

Classified as a [[new religious movement]], its practitioners harken back to the [[Slavic paganism|historical belief systems]] of the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as '''[[Vedism]]''', '''[[Orthodoxy]]''', and '''[[Old Believers|Old Belief]]'''.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith beliefs and practices-->  \nRodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \"double belief\" following the [[Christianisation of the Slavs]] in the Middle Ages.{{refn|group=note|The idea that indigenous Slavic religion was preserved in a conscious \"double belief\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs is put into question by some contemporary scholars.}} Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and also non-Slavic sources such as [[Hinduism]] (as they are believed to be coming from the same [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Proto-Indo-European]] source). [[Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology|Rodnover theology and cosmology]] may be described as [[pantheism]] and [[polytheism]]\u2014worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith views on morality and Slavic identity-->  \nRodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of [[Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy|political and identitary philosophy]]. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as [[ethnic religion]]s, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as [[ethnic nationalism]], opposition to [[miscegenation]] and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central role in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|the mental constraints imposed through feudalism and the continuation of what they call \"mono-ideologies\"]].\n\n<!--History of the movement--> \nThe contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic [[Romanticism]], which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the [[Second World War]] and the establishment of [[communist state]]s throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent times, the movement has been increasingly [[Pagan studies|studied in academic scholarship]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{See also|Slavic paganism}}\n[[File:Russian Rodnover women.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnover women with child.]]\n\n[[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] regard Slavic Native Faith as a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013a|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=62|3a1=Skrylnikov|3y=2016|4a1=Shizhenskii|4a2=Aitamurto|4y=2017|4p=115}} They also characterise it as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1p=197|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|3y=2013|3p=165|4a1=Gaidukov|4y=2013|4p=315|5a1=Shnirelman|5y=2013|5pp=62, 73}} The movement has no overarching structure,{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} or accepted religious authority,{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} and contains much diversity in terms of belief and practice.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} The sociologist of religion Kaarina Aitamurto suggests that Rodnovery is sufficiently heterogeneous that it could be regarded itself not as a singular religion but as \"an umbrella term that gathers together various forms of religiosity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Szczodre Gody MIR 1.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish Rodnover outdoors altar.]]\n\nThe scholar of religion Alexey Gaidukov described \"Slavic Neopaganism\" as a term pertaining to \"all quasi-religious, political, ideological and philosophical systems which are based on the reconstruction and construction of pre-Christian Slavic traditions\".{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} The scholar of religion Adrian Ivakhiv describes the religion as a movement which \"harkens back to the pre-Christian beliefs and practices of ancient Slavic peoples\",{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=209}} while according to the historian and ethnologist [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor A. Shnirelman]], Rodnovers present themselves as \"followers of some genuine pre-Christian Slavic, Russian or Slavic-[[Aryan]] Paganism\".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}}\n\nSome involved in the movement avoid calling their belief system either \"paganism\" or \"religion\".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Many Rodnovers refer to their belief system as an \"[[ethnic religion]]\",{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1a2=Filip|1y=2013|1pp=34\u201335|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=105}} and Rodnover groups were involved in establishing the [[World Congress of Ethnic Religions]].{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|pp=34\u201335}} The usage of this term suggests that the religion is restricted to a particular ethnic group.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=35}} Some practitioners regard \"ethnic religion\" as a term synonymous with \"Native Faith\", but others perceive there as being a distinction between the two terms.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=35}}\n\nAccording to Shnirelman, it was the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[state atheism|official \"scientific\" atheism]], which severely weakened the infrastructure of universalist religions, combined with anti-Westernism and the research of intellectuals into an ancient \"Vedic\" religion of Russia, that paved the way for the rise of Rodnovery and other modern Paganisms in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2015|loc=''passim''}} After the Soviet Union, the pursuit of Rodnovery matured into the spiritual cultivation of organic folk communities (''ethnoi'') in the face of what Rodnovers consider as the alien cosmopolitan forces which drive global assimilation, chiefly represented by the [[Abrahamic religions]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2007|pp=43\u201344}} In the Russian intellectual milieu, Rodnovery also presents itself as the ideology of \"nativism\" (''narodnichestvo''),{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=141}} which in Rodnovers' own historical analysis is destined to supplant what they call the \"mono-ideologies\" whose final bankruptcy the world is now witnessing.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=123}}\n\n===Rodnovery as a new synthesis===\n\nShnirelman states that\u2014contrary to the beliefs of Rodnovers themselves\u2014their religion does not actually constitute the \"restoration of any pre-Christian religion as such\". Rather, he describes the movement as having been \"built up artificially by urbanised intellectuals who use fragments of early pre-Christian local beliefs and rites in order to restore national spirituality\".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=19}} In this way, Slavic Native Faith has been understood\u2014at least in part\u2014as an [[invented tradition]],{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=236|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=136}} or a form of ''[[Folklorismus]]''.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=69}} Simpson notes, studying the specific context of Poland, that unlike historical Slavic beliefs, which were integral to the everyday fabric of their society, modern Slavic Native Faith believers have to develop new forms of social organisation which set them apart from established society.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} Textual evidence for historical Slavic religion is scant, has been produced by Christian writers hostile to the systems being described and is usually open to multiple interpretations.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=89}}\n\nIn developing Slavic Native Faith, practitioners draw upon the primary sources about the historical religion of Slavic peoples, as well as elements drawn from later Slavic folklore, official and popular Christian belief and from non-Slavic societies.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}} Among these foreign influences have been beliefs and practices drawn from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic Heathenry]],{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=289|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=90}} [[Siberian shamanism]],{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} as well as ideas drawn from various forms of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2017|1p=88|2a1=Radulovic|2y=2017|2p=71}} Other influences include documents like the ''[[Book of Veles]]'', which claim to be genuine accounts of historical Slavic religion but which academics recognise as later compositions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} According to the folklorist Mariya Lesiv, through this syncretic process, \"a ''new'' religion is being created on the basis of the synthesis of elements from various traditions\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=14}} Many Rodnovers do not acknowledge this practice of [[syncretism]] and instead profess an explicitly anti-syncretic attitude, emphasising the need to retain the \"purity\" of the religion and thus maintain its \"authenticity\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=141}}\n\n===Slavic folk religion and double belief===\n[[File:\u0418\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u044b \u00ab\u041e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u00bb .jpg|thumb|''The Fiery Chariot of the Word''\u201419th-century Russian [[Old Believers]]' [[Russian icons|icon]] of the ''[[Theotokos]]'' as [[Ognyena Maria]] (\"Fiery Mary\"), fire goddess sister of [[Perun]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Rou\u010dek |editor-first=Joseph Slabey |title=Ognyena Maria |encyclopedia=Slavonic Encyclopedia |year=1949 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York}} p. 905</ref> Belief in a [[mother goddess]] as the receptacle of life, [[Mat Syra Zemlya]] (\"Damp Mother Earth\"), was preserved in Russian folk religion up to the 20th century, often disguised as the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] of Christianity.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|pp=15, 16}} The fiery \"six-petaled roses\" that umbego the Ognyena are one of the variants of the whirling symbol of the supreme God (Rod) and of its sons.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=17}}]]\n\nA different perspective is offered by [[Svetlana Chervonnaya]], who sees the return to folk beliefs among Slavs as part of a broader phenomenon that is happening to \"the mass religious mind\" not merely of Slavic or Eastern European peoples, but to peoples all over [[Asia]], and that expresses itself in new mythologemes endorsed by national elites.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alybyna |first=Tatiana |year=2014 |title=Vernacular Beliefs and Official Traditional Religion |url=https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |journal=Approaching Religion |volume=4 |number=1 |pages=89\u2013100 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707181157/https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |archive-date=7 July 2017}} Cites: Chervonnaya, Svetlana (1998).

This is a concept that was especially popular among nineteenth-century ethnographers who were influenced by [[Romanticism]] and retains widespread popularity across Eastern Europe, but has come under criticism in more recent times.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} Slavic Christianity was influenced by indigenous beliefs and practices as it was established in the Middle Ages and these folk practices changed greatly over the intervening millennia;{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=132\u2013133}} according to this, Rodnovers claim that they are just continuing living tradition.<ref>''vide'' {{cite magazine |last=Sadowski |first=Marcin |date=2015 |title=Polityka jedno\u015bci w rodzimowierstwie polskim |trans-title=Politics of unity in Polish Rodnovery |magazine=Gniazdo.

A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the \"problem of double belief\" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an \"undefeated paganism\", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion.{{sfn|Rock|2007|p=110}} Slavic Native Faith adherents, as far as they are concerned, believe that they can take traditional folk culture, remove the obviously Christian elements and be left with something that authentically reflects the historical beliefs of the Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}}\n\nIvakhiv says that despite the intense efforts of Christian authorities, the Christianisation of the Slavs, and especially of Russians, was very slow and resulted in a \"thorough synthesis of Pagan and Christian elements\", reflected for instance in the refashioning of gods as Christian saints ([[Perun]] as [[Elijah|Saint Elias]], [[Veles (god)|Veles]] as [[Saint Blaise|Saint Blasius]] and [[Yarilo]] as [[Saint George]]) and in the overlapping of Christian festivals on Pagan ones.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=212\u2013214}} The scholar of Russian folk religion Linda J.

Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[\u1e5ata]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), through a dual dynamism, represented by [[Belobog]] (\"White God\") and [[Chernobog]] (\"Black God\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, ''[[Prav-Yav-Nav]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabotkina|1y=2013|1p=240|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=1998|2p=8, note 35}} [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] (\"Three-Headed One\") and [[Svetovid]] (\"Worldseer\") are concepts representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}}\n\nWhen emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', \"believers in God\"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} This theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit\u2013matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, [[Perun]]).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript ''The Lay of Igor's Host'' may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of [[Dazhbog]] (the \"Giving God\", \"Day God\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}\n\nPantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=289\u2013290}} Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod;<ref name=\"Adversus paganos\">{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017}}</ref> these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as ''Vyshen'', i.e. [[Vishnu]], and ''Intra'', i.e. [[Indra]]), Iranian deities (such as [[Simargl]] and Khors), deities from the ''Book of Veles'' (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard [[Koschei]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=95}} Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (''[[volkhv]]'' Velimir), emphasises a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] eternal struggle between forces of [[good and evil]]; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=93}} Rodnovers also believe and worship [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of specific elements, lands and environments,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=204}} such as waters, forests and the household. Gods may be subject to functional changes among modern Rodnovers; for instance, the traditional god of livestock and poetry [[Veles (god)|Veles]] is called upon as the god of literature and communication.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}}\n\nIn Ukraine, there has been a debate as to whether the religion should be monotheistic or polytheistic.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} In keeping with the pre-Christian belief systems of the region, the groups who inherit Volodymyr Shaian's tradition, among others, espouse polytheism.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} Conversely, Sylenko's [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] (RUNVira; also called \"Sylenkoism\") regards itself as monotheistic and focuses its worship upon a single God who they identify with the name Dazhbog.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=225|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013a|2p=90|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=130}} For members of this group, Dazhbog is regarded as the life-giving energy of the cosmos.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}}\n\nSylenko characterised Dazhbog as \"light, endlessness, gravitation, eternity, movement, action, the energy of unconscious and conscious Being\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Based on this description, Ivakhiv argued that Sylenkoite theology might better be regarded as [[pantheism|pantheistic]] or [[panentheism|panentheistic]] rather than monotheistic.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Sylenko acknowledged that the ancient Ukrainian-Rus were polytheists but believed that a monotheistic view reflected an evolution in human spiritual development and thus should be adopted.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=91}} A similar view is adopted by Russian [[Ynglism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} Lesiv recorded one RUNVira member who related that \"we cannot believe in various forest, field and water spirits today. Yes, our ancestors believed in these things but we should not any longer\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} For Native Ukrainian National Faith's members, polytheism is regarded as backward.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} Some polytheist Rodnovers have regarded the approach adopted by Sylenko's followers as an inauthentic approach to the religion.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}}\n\n===Morality and ethics===\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping Perun in Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine.png|thumb|upright|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a ''kapy'' (pole) of [[Perun]], in [[Ternopil Oblast]], Ukraine.]]\n\nRodnovery emphasises the \"this-worldliness\" of morality and moral thinking, seen as a voluntary and thoughtful responsibility towards the others that sprouts from the awareness of the interconnectedness of all things and of the continuity of spirit\u2013matter and not as a strict set of rules. Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, ''[[Vyraj|Iriy]]'' or ''Vyriy'', they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=188}} People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}} Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that \"[[turning the other cheek]]\", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}}\n\n[[File:Rodnover wedding in Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Rodnover wedding ceremony.]]\n\nRodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=142}} This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is \"egoistic individualism\", not \"moral individualism\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=116}} Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines \"ecological responsibility\".{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2016|1p=138|2a1=Simpson|2y=2013|2p=120}}\n\nRodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Through the categories of contemporary sociology, Rodnover views are generally defined [[conservatism|conservative]]. Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=121}}\n\nWithin Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Men are seen as innately disposed towards \"public\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \"private\" administration of the family and the resources of the house.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=86}} Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being [[counterculture|countercultural]], presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of [[modernism]] and [[globalism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}}\n\nIdeas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society\u2014which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate\u2014are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and [[miscegenation]] are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \"hardly any women\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves [[feminism|feminists]], partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \"feminism\" has in Russian culture.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes.{{sfn|Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|2013|p=178}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions;{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=98|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2017|3p=143}} for instance, the [[Ynglist Church]]'s doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}}\n\nThe Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions\u2014compared to those of other organisations\u2014about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} They reflect their stance in the slogan \"unity in diversity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the [[Green Russia]] party.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\n==Identity and political philosophy==\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|upright|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate.

[[Marija Gimbutas]], instead, found Slavic religion to be a clear result of the overlap of Indo-European patriarchism and pre-Indo-European matrifocal beliefs. [[Boris Rybakov]] emphasised the continuity and complexification of Slavic religion through the centuries.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}}\n\nThe scholar of religion Scott Simpson states that Slavic Native Faith is \"fundamentally concerned with questions of community and ethnic identity\",{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=118}} while folklorist Nemanja Radulovic described practitioners as placing \"great emphasis on their national or regional identity\".{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|pp=65\u201366}} Rodnovery typically displays greater concern for [[individual and group rights|collective rights than individual rights]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} Most Rodnover groups will permit only Slavs as members, although there are a few exceptions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}}\n\n===Ethnic nationalism===\n\n\nSlavic Native Faith's world-view is often [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] in basis.{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=195|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} Aitamurto suggested that Russian Rodnovers' conceptions of nationalism encompass three main themes: that \"the Russian or Slavic people are a distinct group\", that they \"have\u2014or their heritage has\u2014some superior qualities\", and that \"this unique heritage or the existence of this ethnic group is now threatened, and, therefore, it is of vital importance to fight for it\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}}\n\nMany Rodnovers espouse socio-political views akin to those of the French ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]''.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=235}} Some blame many of the world's problems on the mixing of ethno-cultural groups,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=229}} and emphasise the idea of ethnic purity.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} Some Rodnovers promote [[racial segregation]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2015|p=98}} and have demanded a prohibition on mixed-race marriages.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Some Rodnovers regard ethnic minorities living in Slavic countries as a cause of [[social injustice]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} and encourage the removal of those regarded as \"aliens\" from Russia, namely those who are Jewish or have ethnic origins in the Caucasus,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}} an approach that could require [[ethnic cleansing]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Other Rodnovers are openly anti-Semitic,{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=234|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284}} for instance urging fellow Rodnovers not to get involved with Jews,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=234}} and endorsing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control the economic and political elite.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}}\n\nMany Rodnovers oppose what they regard as \"culturally destructive\" phenomena such as [[cosmopolitanism]], [[liberalism]] and [[globalisation]],{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} as well as [[Americanisation]] and [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} The political models proposed by Rodnovers as based on their interpretation of the ancient Slavic community model of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), similar to the ancient Germanic \"[[thing (assembly)|thing]]\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=2\u20133}} Western liberal ideas of freedom and democracy are traditionally perceived by Russian eyes as \"outer\" freedom, contrasting with Slavic \"inner\" freedom of the mind;

Glory to Dazhboh!\"{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=3}} Simpson noted that in Poland, several Rodnovers launched a poster campaign against [[Valentines Day]], which they regarded as not being an authentically Polish celebration.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=120}} In Russia, Rodnovers have vandalised and torched various churches.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=70}}\n\nChristians have also been responsible for opposition to Slavic Native Faith, for instance through the establishment of social media groups against the movement.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=325}} The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] has expressed opposition to the growth and spread of Slavic Native Faith across Russia on various occasions.{{Sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} Some Russian Rodnovers have however attempted to improve relations with the Orthodox Church, arguing that Russian Orthodoxy had adopted many elements of historical Slavic belief and rites.{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1pp=198\u2013199|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=290}} In this way they argue that Russian Orthodoxy is distinct from other forms of Christianity,{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} and seek to portray it as the \"younger brother\" of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|p=199}} The Orthodox Christian [[Old Believers]], a movement that split out from the Russian Orthodox Church during the reform of [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] in the seventeenth century, is seen by Rodnovers in a more positive light than the mainstream Russian Orthodox Church, as Old Believers are considered to have elements similar to those of the Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=61}}\n\n==Organisation, rites and practices==\n[[File:Kupala 2017 in Krasotinka, Kaluga (4).jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnover priest drawing a dot on the forehead of believers for the celebrations of [[Kupala Night]] festival.]]\n\nRodnovery is essentially a religion of the community, with most adherents actively joining organisations; only a minority of believers choose solitary practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=118|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2016|2p=63}} Sometimes, Slavic Native Faith groups send guests to the religious meetings of other groups, including those in other countries.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=79}} Most Slavic Native Faith groups strongly emphasise the commemoration of ancestors in their religious practices.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} For many Rodnovers, greater importance is given to creating what they perceive as \"genuine\" Slavic rituals rather than those which will be psychologically empowering.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}}\n\nThere is much variation in the patterns of organisation and practice between different groups, and depending on the level such groups intend to represent, whether national or local. For instance, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), one of the churches of the Ukrainian [[Sylenkoite]] branch of Rodnovery, holds unique weekly \"Holy Hour of Self-Realisation\", in which practitioners read from Sylenko's ''Maha Vira'', sermons are given, the ancestors are commemorated, and prayers and hymns are given. The meeting ends with the singing of ''[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]]'', the [[national anthem]] of Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=226}} The rival and near homonymous Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira), also conducts weekly Holy Hours, but incorporates a wider selection of sources\u2014such as readings from the pan-Rodnover ''Book of Veles'' or the poetry of [[Taras Shevchenko]]\u2014into the proceedings.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The structure of these Syenkoite rites is modelled on those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}}\n\n[[File:Koliada 2017 near Naro-Fominsk (1).jpg|thumb|left|Rodnovers engaged in a circle-dance around a bonfire, celebrating the [[Koliada]] festival in [[Naro-Fominsk]], [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia.]]\n\nAdherents of Slavic Native Faith often adopt elements from recorded folk culture. Lesiv described this process as one of \"Paganisation\", whereby Christian or otherwise non-Pagan elements are deliberately given a new meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=136}} In turn, some of these \"Paganised\" folk practices have been transmitted through the wider population, who has regarded them as authentic traditional practices.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} Some Rodnover groups also incorporate non-Slavic practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013b|1p=128|2a1=Simpson|2y=2017|2p=81}} For instance, a group of Polish Rodnovers has been documented to use the [[fire poi]] at their Midsummer festivities, a practice that originally developed in Pacific regions during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=80}} The Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith promotes a healing technique called ''Zhyva'' that has close similarities to the Japanese practice of [[reiki]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}} In another instance, Lesiv observed a Ukrainian Rodnover who legitimised the practice of [[yoga]] by claiming that this spiritual tradition had originally been developed by the ancestors of modern-day Ukrainians.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=137}} Another example are groups within [[Peterburgian Vedism]] which incorporate [[Ivanovism|Ivanovite]] healing techniques.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}\n\nRituals take place at secluded, consecrated spaces, and generally include the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of [[libation]]s, circle-dances (''horovod'' or simply ''kolo'', \"circle\"), and usually end with a communal meal. Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such gatherings, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes \"traditional clothes\", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=70}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=290}}\n\nBesides the rites of outgang from Christianity (''raskrestitsia''), Rodnovers practise rituals of initiation of the new members into the community of Slavic Native Faith. Central to this conversion is the \"renaming\", that is to say the adoption of a new Slavic name, symbolising the death and rebirth of the convert into the new community. Some groups, such as male brotherhoods, practise the cutting of a second \"life line\" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new \"blood bond\" that is formed with other members.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=292}}\n\n===Communities, citadels and temples===\n[[File:\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c.jpg|thumb|A building of the Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova in the [[Podolsky District]], Moscow Oblast, Russia.]]\n\nRodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history. They recover the pre-Christian social institution of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), which they also see as reflecting the concept of ''[[sobornost]]'' formulated in 20th-century Russian philosophy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=191}} ''Veche'' is used as the name of many Rodnover overarching organisations, including the international \"Veche of Slavic Native Faith\", an assembly held each summer, to which adherents from Slavic countries take part. Aitamurto (2008) characterises the ''veche'' as a model of organisation \"from below and to the top\", following descriptions given by Rodnovers themselves\u2014that is to say a grassroots form of governance which matures into a consensual authority and/or decision-making. Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves ''obshchina'' (the term for traditional peasant communities), while ''skhod'', ''sobor'' and ''mir'' are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is ''artel''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (''[[kremlin]]'') or citadels (''gorodok''), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses.

They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=272, note 11}}\n\nThough the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of ''zhritsa'' and ''vedunya'' (\"seeresses\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, [[Halyna Lozko]] from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}\n\n===Calendars and holidays===\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's calendars and holidays}}\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess at Vodokres holiday.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess' pole on Vodokre\u0161 holiday in the countryside.]]\n\nAccording to Aitamurto, rituals play \"a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion\", and thus they constitute an important complement to theology within Rodnovery. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like [[Vladimir Dal]] and [[Boris Rybakov]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nThe common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es set in the four phases of the year.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}} Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \"the cycles of nature\".{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}} A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the [[Kupala Night|''Kupala'' Night]] (June 23\u201324), although also important are the winter solstice festival ''Karachun'' and ''[[Koliada]]'' (December 24\u201325), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide\u2014called ''Komoeditsa'' or ''[[Maslenitsa]]'' (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the ''Krasnaya Gorka'' (literally \"Red Hill\", celebrated between April 30\u2013May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of [[Marzanna]] and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nUsually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \"core\" of practitioners, who are often professionally affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \"periphery\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside [[Maloyaroslavets]] in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \"aesthetically lavish\", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=69}}\n\nSome Slavic Native Faith organisations have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The calendar of one of the organisations of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a \"Christmas of Dazhboh's Light\" and an \"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The common Rodnover calendar leaves room for national and regional variations; for instance, the same Native Ukrainian National Faith's organisation observes holidays devoted to Ukrainian national heroes such as Shevchenko, [[Ivan Franko]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and [[Hryhory Skovoroda]], as well as those devoted to more abstract concepts such as \"Ukrainian Ancient Literature\" and \"New Ukrainian Literature\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=28}}\n\n===Artistic and other pursuits===\n[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 60.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnovers engaged in a martial arts dare.]]\n\nA number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] is one of the most popular subjects.<ref name=Gizbrekht2016>{{cite article |last=Gizbrekht |first=Andrey Ivanovich |year=2016 |title=\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u044b \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \"\u042f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\" (\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) |trans-title=The images of public figures of Russian history in the discourse of modern \"Pagan art\" (based on fine arts material) |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/obrazy-deyateley-rossiyskoy-istorii-v-diskurse-sovremennogo-yazycheskogo-iskusstva-na-materiale-izobrazitelnogo-tvorchestva |publisher=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b}} \u0423\u0414\u041a 298.9:7.044/.046.</ref> Rodnover rituals and festivals often include [[martial arts]] displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=95}} Slavic-hill wrestling (\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043e-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430, ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba'') was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=69}}{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=39}} Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are \"bench wrestling\" (''lavochki'') and \"wall against wall\" (''stenka na stenku'').{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:O S\u0142awia\u0144szczy\u017anie przed chrze\u015bcija\u0144stwem.

The study of this syncretic popular religion and philsophy was the foremost interest for late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Russian intellectuals: early revolutionaries ([[Alexander Herzen]], [[Nikolay Ogarev]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]]), [[Narodniks]] (Populists), and early [[Bolsheviks]] were inspired by the radical forms of society practised wihin folk religious communities, which in many ways were precursors to [[socialism]]. [[Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich]] was assigned by the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] the task of studying folk religious movements, and in 1908\u20131910 a faction of the Bolsheviks, represented by [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Alexander Bogdanov]], [[Maxim Gorky]], and [[Vladimir Bazarov]], formulated the \"[[God-Building]]\" movement (''Bogostroitelstvo''), whose aim was to create a new religion for the proletariat through a synthesis of socialism with folk religion.{{sfn|Smirnov|2020|loc=passim}}\n\n===1930s\u20131940s: Early developments===\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0435\u043a\u0430 (\u0416\u0430\u0440-\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0430).jpg|thumb|One of the earliest copies (dated 1955) of one of \"Isenbek's Planks\" (the n. 16), upon which the ''Book of Veles'' was supposedly written.]]\n \nIn Ukraine, the first practitioners of Slavic Native Faith appeared in the 1930s.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} One of the most influential Ukrainian Rodnover ideologues was [[Volodymyr Shaian]], a linguist and philologist who worked at [[Lviv University]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} He claimed that in 1934 he underwent a spiritual revelation atop Mount Grekhit in the [[Carpathian Mountains]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} Particularly interested in the ideas of an ancient Aryan race that were popular at the time,{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=129}} he subsequently began promoting what he called a \"pan-Aryan renaissance\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} He turned to recorded Ukrainian folklore to find what he regarded as the survivals of the ancient Slavic religion.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=129}} In 1944, he fled the Soviet government and travelled to refugee camps in Germany and Austria. There, he established the Order of the Knights of the Solar God (''Orden Lytsariv Boha Sontsia''), a religio-political group that he hoped would affiliate itself to the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=216\u2013217}}\n\nIn Poland, [[Jan Stachniuk]] established the ''Zadruga'' magazine in 1937;{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=113|2a1=Struty\u0144ski|2y=2013|2p=295}} the term \"Zadruga\" itself was a reference to a [[Zadruga|South Slavic tribal unit]].{{sfn|Struty\u0144ski|2013|p=288}} Continuing on from Do\u0142\u0119ga-Chodakowski, Stachniuk's own work criticised [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Catholicism in Poland]], arguing that it had had a negative effect on the country's national character.{{sfnm|1a1=Struty\u0144ski|1y=2013|1p=288|2a1=Potrzebowski|2y=2016|2pp=45, 177}} He did not develop his ideas into a religion, and those who shared his views remained \"a very loose and diverse intellectual clique\".{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} The magazine and its associated group embraced members with a wide variety of viewpoints, ranging from secularly [[Humanism|humanistic]] to religiously Slavic Native Faith stances.{{sfn|Potrzebowski|2016|p=51}} He was nevertheless labelled a ''neopoganin'' (\"Neopagan\") by the Polish popular press, a term that he embraced as a self-descriptor in later life.{{sfn|Struty\u0144ski|2013|p=294}}\n\n[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Ko\u0142odziej]] later claimed to have established a pre-war Holy Circle of the Worshippers of Svetovid (''\u015awi\u0119te Ko\u0142o Czcicieli \u015awiatowida''), although there is no evidence that they conducted regular meetings until many years later.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} During the Second World War, Stefan Potrzuski led a unit in the Peasant Battalion which battled the Nazi German occupation forces. His unit had a shrine to the god [[Svetovid]] in their secret forest base and held group rites in which they toasted a wooden image of the deity with mead.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} Stachniuk fought against the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345)|Nazi occupation]] during the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. Following the end of the war and the incorporation of Poland under a Stalinist regime, both Stachniuk and Ko\u0142odziej were arrested, preventing the establishment of a Slavic Native Faith community.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=113|2a1=Struty\u0144ski|2y=2013|2p=295}} In 1954, a student group known as Klan Ausran was established at the [[University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; officially dedicated to a study of Indo-European society, its members provided hymns and prayers.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=114}}\n\nA key influence on the movement was the circulation of the ''Book of Veles'' among Russian and Ukrainian emigrees.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1pp=217\u2013218|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=285}} This text was brought to the public by Yuri Mirolyubov, who claimed that it had been discovered by a friend of his, Fodor Arturovich Isenbek, while serving as a [[White movement|White Army]] officer during the [[Russian Civil War]].

It was in [[Chicago]] that he established the earliest groups of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] in 1966.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=217}} Sylenko presented himself as a prophet of Dazhbog who had been sent to the Ukrainian people.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} In his view, the Ukrainians were the superior manifestation of the European peoples,{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} and Kyiv the oldest city of the [[white race]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} Sylenko was a [[Charismatic authority|charismatic leader]], whose followers praised his talents and oratorical skills.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=135}} In 1979 he published ''Maha Vira'', a book which he claimed chronicled the ancient history of the Ukrainian people.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=217}} The system of Slavic Native Faith that he developed was influenced by [[deism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} A Native Ukrainian National Faith centre, the Temple of Mother Ukraine, was established in [[Spring Glen, New York]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=224}} Native Ukrainian National Faith congregations were established among Ukrainian emigree communities in other parts of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Germany.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=224|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=130}}\n\n[[File:Temple of Oriyana in Spring Glen, New York.jpg|thumb|left|The Temple of Mother Ukraine\u2013Oryana in Spring Glen, [[New York (state)|New York]], United States.]]\n\nDuring era of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, research into prehistoric societies was encouraged, with some scholars arguing that pre-Christian society reflected a form of communitarianism that was damaged by Christianity's promotion of entrenched class divisions. In doing so, pre-Christian belief systems underwent a rehabilitation.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=285\u2013286}} Joseph Stalin himself was a supporter of the idea of \"Slavic Vedism\", the shared Indo-European origins of [[Vedic period|Vedic]] and Slavic cultures.{{sfn|Kleinhempel|2015|pp=11\u201312}} Russian Native Faith originated in the [[Soviet dissidents]]' circles of the 1970s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=185}} An intellectual circle that cultivated themes of Slavic indigenous religion formed as a wing of the predominantly Orthodox Christian [[samizdat]] nationalist journal ''Veche'' (1971\u20131974). Such group included Anatoly Ivanov, the artist [[Konstantin Vasilyev]] (1942\u20131974), and Nikolai Bogdanov, among others. Vasilyev's art is widely celebrated within the Rodnover community. Ivanov, who declared himself a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and subscribed to \"Arism\" or \"Slavism\", published a fervently anti-Christian pamphlet entitled \"The Christian Plague\" (''Khristianskaya chuma''). Throughout the 1970s, the nationalist dissident movement split into two branches, an Orthodox Christian one and another one that developed [[National Bolshevism]], which eventually continued to harbour Pagan traditionalists.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=26\u201327}} Other influential texts in this period were Valery Yemelyanov's ''Desionizatsiya'' (\"De-Sionisation\") and later Istarkhov's ''Udar russkikh bogov'' (\"The Strike of Russian Gods\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Slavic Native Faith groups had to operate in secret, although a few small groups were known to exist in Moscow and Leningrad.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} These groups were closely linked to the nationalistic circles operating during the 1980s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} In Moscow, an [[occultism|occult]] circle was established by Yevgeny Golovin and Yuri Mamleyev; although not explicitly Pagan, they were influenced by occult Pagan thinkers like [[Guido von List]] and sought a return to a pre-Christian [[Aryan]] world.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=287}} In the early 1980s, the \"[[Pamyat]]\" movement was established by figures active at the Metropolitan Moscow Palace of Culture, which similarly looked with fondness on ancient Aryan culture.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=287}} Several Russian nationalists also began to state that pre-Christian belief systems were the true religion of the Russian people; Apollon Kuzmin did so in his 1988 book ''Padenie Peruna'' (\"The Fall of Perun\").{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=288}} In 1986, Viktor Bezverkhy established the Leningrad ([[Saint Petersburg]])-based Society of the Mages (''Obshchestvo Volkhvov''), an explicitly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and anti-Semitic organisation; it was followed by the Union of the Veneds, founded in 1990.{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1pp=288\u2013289|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2016|2p=35}} These organisations gave rise to the stream of Rodnovery known as \"[[Peterburgian Vedism]]\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}\n\n===1990s\u20132000s: Post-Soviet growth===\n[[File:Ukraine, outdoor Sylenkoite worship (1).png|thumb|Ukrainian Rodnovers engaged in public worship.]]\n\nAfter [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s Soviet government introduced the policy of ''[[perestroika]]'' in the 1980s, Slavic Native Faith groups established themselves in Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=220}} The collapse of the Soviet Union and its official policy of [[state atheism]] resulted in a resurgence of open religious adherence across the region.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} Many individuals arrived at Slavic Native Faith after exploring a range of different alternative spiritualities, with Asian religious influences being particularly apparent within Slavic Native Faith at that time.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=149}}\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became an independent republic, with many Ukrainians turning to strongly nationalistic agendas; among those to have done so are [[pseudo-archaeology|pseudo-archaeologists]] like Yuri Shylov, who posits Ukraine as the \"cradle of civilisation\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=221}} It is within this broader milieu of cultural nationalism and interest in alternative spiritualities that Slavic Native Faith re-emerged in Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} The United States-based [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] established itself in Ukraine soon after independence, with the first congregation in Ukraine gaining official recognition in [[Kiev]] in 1991.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=224|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} There had been schisms in the international organisation of Native Ukrainian National Faith.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} A number of senior followers broke with Sylenko during the 1980s, rejecting the idea that he should be the ultimate authority in the religion; they formed the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira) and secured legal control of the temple in Spring Glen.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=227}} A second group, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), maintained links with Sylenko himself, whom it regards as a prophet, and adopted his ''Maha Vira'' as a sacred text.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Despite the animosity that existed between these rival Ukrainian groups, there was some collaboration between them.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} In 2003, the First Forum of Rodnovers was held in the country, resulting in two public proclamations: the first urged the country's government to protect what the Rodnovers regarded as sacred sites and objects, and the second called on the government not to go ahead with the proposed privatisation of agricultural land.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} That same year, a group called Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith was established; in contrast to the anti-Russian slant taken by Sylenko, it embraced a Pan-Slavic perspective.{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\nThe social context of Slavic Native Faith's growth in Russia differed from that in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}} Russian nationalists had welcomed the collapse of the Soviet system but were disappointed with the arrival of [[capitalism]] and the dramatic economic downturn that Russia faced in that decade.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=147}} Large numbers became unemployed, and many turned to the past, including in ethnic terms.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|pp=87\u201388}} In this context, the growth of Rodnovery can be seen as a nationalistic project to regain national pride.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}} Many leaders of early post-Soviet Rodnovery were intellectuals that were already practising members of the movement in late Soviet times, for instance, Grigory Yakutovsky (Vseslav Svyatozar), Aleksei Dobrovolsky (Dobroslav) and Viktor Bezverkhy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} Other leaders that emerged in this period were Aleksandr Asov, publisher of numerous versions of the ''Book of Veles'', and Aleksei Belov, founder of the martial arts style known as \"Slavic-hill wrestling\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nRussian Rodnovers started to organise by the mid-1990s; in 1994 the Moscow Slavic Community was the first Rodnover group to be registered by the government. Concerted efforts by the communities of Moscow and [[Kaluga]] led to the establishment of the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities in 1997. The communities of Moscow and [[Obninsk]] later left the organisation for ideological differences. Another organisation, the Circle of Veles, which is one of the largest and administers communities also located in the territory of Ukraine, was founded in 1999. The [[Ynglist Church]] too was formally established in the early 1990s.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} In 2002, the same year of the Bittsa Agreement, the Circle of Pagan Tradition was established in Moscow.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|pp=184\u2013185}} Its purpose was to bring together Russian Rodnovers who did not share the extreme right-wing views then dominant in much of the community.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=203}} In 2009, the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities and the Circle of Pagan Tradition issued a joint statement against Ynglism, disapproving what they reck as Ynglists' \"pseudo-Pagan teachings, pseudo-linguistics, pseudo-science and outright fiction\".{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}\n\n[[File:Polish Rodnover celebrations (0).PNG|thumb|Polish Rodnovers worshipping in the woods.]]\n\nIn Poland, the [[Wroc\u0142aw]]-based publishing house ''Toporze\u0142'' has reissued Stachniuk's works and those of his disciple Antoni Wacyk.{{sfn|Potrzebowski|2016|p=183}} Zadruga also inspired the registered religious Association of Native Faith (''Zrzeszenie Rodzimej Wiary''; now called simply ''[[Rodzima Wiara]]'' [RW], lit. \"Native Faith\"),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Skupn |first=Anna |year=2013 |title=\u0179r\u00f3d\u0142a Rodzimej Wiary \u2013 w\u0105tki aryjskie i zadru\u017cne w doktrynie zwi\u0105zku wyznaniowego Rodzima Wiara |trans-title=Sources of Native Faith \u2013 Aryan and Zadruga themes in the doctrine of the religious association Native Faith |url=https://www.academia.edu/9071501 |language=pl}}</ref> whose founder [[Stanis\u0142aw Potrzebowski]] wrote his doctoral thesis on pre-war Zadruga in German (''Zadruga -

On the same occasion, they once again expressed disapproval for some authors and movements, including the large [[Skhoron ezh Sloven]], which is also present in Belarus and Ukraine.

Classified as a [[new religious movement]], its practitioners harken back to the [[Slavic paganism|historical belief systems]] of the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as '''[[Vedism]]''', '''[[Orthodoxy]]''', and '''[[Old Believers|Old Belief]]'''.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith beliefs and practices-->  \nRodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \"double belief\" following the [[Christianisation of the Slavs]] in the Middle Ages.{{refn|group=note|The idea that indigenous Slavic religion was preserved in a conscious \"double belief\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs is put into question by some contemporary scholars.}} Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and also non-Slavic sources such as [[Hinduism]] (as they are believed to be coming from the same [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Proto-Indo-European]] source). [[Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology|Rodnover theology and cosmology]] may be described as [[pantheism]] and [[polytheism]]\u2014worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith views on morality and Slavic identity-->  \nRodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of [[Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy|political and identitary philosophy]]. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as [[ethnic religion]]s, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as [[ethnic nationalism]], opposition to [[miscegenation]] and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central role in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|the mental constraints imposed through feudalism and the continuation of what they call \"mono-ideologies\"]].\n\n<!--History of the movement--> \nThe contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic [[Romanticism]], which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the [[Second World War]] and the establishment of [[communist state]]s throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent times, the movement has been increasingly [[Pagan studies|studied in academic scholarship]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{See also|Slavic paganism}}\n[[File:Russian Rodnover women.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnover women with child.]]\n\n[[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] regard Slavic Native Faith as a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013a|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=62|3a1=Skrylnikov|3y=2016|4a1=Shizhenskii|4a2=Aitamurto|4y=2017|4p=115}} They also characterise it as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1p=197|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|3y=2013|3p=165|4a1=Gaidukov|4y=2013|4p=315|5a1=Shnirelman|5y=2013|5pp=62, 73}} The movement has no overarching structure,{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} or accepted religious authority,{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} and contains much diversity in terms of belief and practice.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} The sociologist of religion Kaarina Aitamurto suggests that Rodnovery is sufficiently heterogeneous that it could be regarded itself not as a singular religion but as \"an umbrella term that gathers together various forms of religiosity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Szczodre Gody MIR 1.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish Rodnover outdoors altar.]]\n\nThe scholar of religion Alexey Gaidukov described \"Slavic Neopaganism\" as a term pertaining to \"all quasi-religious, political, ideological and philosophical systems which are based on the reconstruction and construction of pre-Christian Slavic traditions\".{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} The scholar of religion Adrian Ivakhiv describes the religion as a movement which \"harkens back to the pre-Christian beliefs and practices of ancient Slavic peoples\",{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=209}} while according to the historian and ethnologist [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor A.

Rather, he describes the movement as having been \"built up artificially by urbanised intellectuals who use fragments of early pre-Christian local beliefs and rites in order to restore national spirituality\".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=19}} In this way, Slavic Native Faith has been understood\u2014at least in part\u2014as an [[invented tradition]],{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=236|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=136}} or a form of ''[[Folklorismus]]''.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=69}} Simpson notes, studying the specific context of Poland, that unlike historical Slavic beliefs, which were integral to the everyday fabric of their society, modern Slavic Native Faith believers have to develop new forms of social organisation which set them apart from established society.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} Textual evidence for historical Slavic religion is scant, has been produced by Christian writers hostile to the systems being described and is usually open to multiple interpretations.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=89}}\n\nIn developing Slavic Native Faith, practitioners draw upon the primary sources about the historical religion of Slavic peoples, as well as elements drawn from later Slavic folklore, official and popular Christian belief and from non-Slavic societies.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}} Among these foreign influences have been beliefs and practices drawn from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic Heathenry]],{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=289|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=90}} [[Siberian shamanism]],{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} as well as ideas drawn from various forms of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2017|1p=88|2a1=Radulovic|2y=2017|2p=71}} Other influences include documents like the ''[[Book of Veles]]'', which claim to be genuine accounts of historical Slavic religion but which academics recognise as later compositions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} According to the folklorist Mariya Lesiv, through this syncretic process, \"a ''new'' religion is being created on the basis of the synthesis of elements from various traditions\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=14}} Many Rodnovers do not acknowledge this practice of [[syncretism]] and instead profess an explicitly anti-syncretic attitude, emphasising the need to retain the \"purity\" of the religion and thus maintain its \"authenticity\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=141}}\n\n===Slavic folk religion and double belief===\n[[File:\u0418\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u044b \u00ab\u041e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u00bb .jpg|thumb|''The Fiery Chariot of the Word''\u201419th-century Russian [[Old Believers]]' [[Russian icons|icon]] of the ''[[Theotokos]]'' as [[Ognyena Maria]] (\"Fiery Mary\"), fire goddess sister of [[Perun]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Rou\u010dek |editor-first=Joseph Slabey |title=Ognyena Maria |encyclopedia=Slavonic Encyclopedia |year=1949 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York}} p. 905</ref> Belief in a [[mother goddess]] as the receptacle of life, [[Mat Syra Zemlya]] (\"Damp Mother Earth\"), was preserved in Russian folk religion up to the 20th century, often disguised as the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] of Christianity.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|pp=15, 16}} The fiery \"six-petaled roses\" that umbego the Ognyena are one of the variants of the whirling symbol of the supreme God (Rod) and of its sons.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=17}}]]\n\nA different perspective is offered by [[Svetlana Chervonnaya]], who sees the return to folk beliefs among Slavs as part of a broader phenomenon that is happening to \"the mass religious mind\" not merely of Slavic or Eastern European peoples, but to peoples all over [[Asia]], and that expresses itself in new mythologemes endorsed by national elites.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alybyna |first=Tatiana |year=2014 |title=Vernacular Beliefs and Official Traditional Religion |url=https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |journal=Approaching Religion |volume=4 |number=1 |pages=89\u2013100 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707181157/https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |archive-date=7 July 2017}} Cites: Chervonnaya, Svetlana (1998).

Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[\u1e5ata]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), through a dual dynamism, represented by [[Belobog]] (\"White God\") and [[Chernobog]] (\"Black God\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, ''[[Prav-Yav-Nav]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabotkina|1y=2013|1p=240|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=1998|2p=8, note 35}} [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] (\"Three-Headed One\") and [[Svetovid]] (\"Worldseer\") are concepts representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}}\n\nWhen emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', \"believers in God\"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} This theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit\u2013matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, [[Perun]]).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript ''The Lay of Igor's Host'' may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of [[Dazhbog]] (the \"Giving God\", \"Day God\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}\n\nPantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=289\u2013290}} Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod;<ref name=\"Adversus paganos\">{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017}}</ref> these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as ''Vyshen'', i.e. [[Vishnu]], and ''Intra'', i.e. [[Indra]]), Iranian deities (such as [[Simargl]] and Khors), deities from the ''Book of Veles'' (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard [[Koschei]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=95}} Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (''[[volkhv]]'' Velimir), emphasises a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] eternal struggle between forces of [[good and evil]]; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=93}} Rodnovers also believe and worship [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of specific elements, lands and environments,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=204}} such as waters, forests and the household.

Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, ''[[Vyraj|Iriy]]'' or ''Vyriy'', they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=188}} People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}} Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that \"[[turning the other cheek]]\", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}}\n\n[[File:Rodnover wedding in Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Rodnover wedding ceremony.]]\n\nRodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=142}} This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is \"egoistic individualism\", not \"moral individualism\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=116}} Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines \"ecological responsibility\".{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2016|1p=138|2a1=Simpson|2y=2013|2p=120}}\n\nRodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Through the categories of contemporary sociology, Rodnover views are generally defined [[conservatism|conservative]]. Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=121}}\n\nWithin Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Men are seen as innately disposed towards \"public\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \"private\" administration of the family and the resources of the house.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=86}} Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being [[counterculture|countercultural]], presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of [[modernism]] and [[globalism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}}\n\nIdeas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society\u2014which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate\u2014are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and [[miscegenation]] are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \"hardly any women\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves [[feminism|feminists]], partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \"feminism\" has in Russian culture.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes.{{sfn|Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|2013|p=178}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions;{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=98|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2017|3p=143}} for instance, the [[Ynglist Church]]'s doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}}\n\nThe Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions\u2014compared to those of other organisations\u2014about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} They reflect their stance in the slogan \"unity in diversity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the [[Green Russia]] party.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\n==Identity and political philosophy==\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|upright|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate.

[[Marija Gimbutas]], instead, found Slavic religion to be a clear result of the overlap of Indo-European patriarchism and pre-Indo-European matrifocal beliefs. [[Boris Rybakov]] emphasised the continuity and complexification of Slavic religion through the centuries.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}}\n\nThe scholar of religion Scott Simpson states that Slavic Native Faith is \"fundamentally concerned with questions of community and ethnic identity\",{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=118}} while folklorist Nemanja Radulovic described practitioners as placing \"great emphasis on their national or regional identity\".{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|pp=65\u201366}} Rodnovery typically displays greater concern for [[individual and group rights|collective rights than individual rights]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} Most Rodnover groups will permit only Slavs as members, although there are a few exceptions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}}\n\n===Ethnic nationalism===\n\n\nSlavic Native Faith's world-view is often [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] in basis.{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=195|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} Aitamurto suggested that Russian Rodnovers' conceptions of nationalism encompass three main themes: that \"the Russian or Slavic people are a distinct group\", that they \"have\u2014or their heritage has\u2014some superior qualities\", and that \"this unique heritage or the existence of this ethnic group is now threatened, and, therefore, it is of vital importance to fight for it\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}}\n\nMany Rodnovers espouse socio-political views akin to those of the French ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]''.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=235}} Some blame many of the world's problems on the mixing of ethno-cultural groups,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=229}} and emphasise the idea of ethnic purity.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} Some Rodnovers promote [[racial segregation]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2015|p=98}} and have demanded a prohibition on mixed-race marriages.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Some Rodnovers regard ethnic minorities living in Slavic countries as a cause of [[social injustice]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} and encourage the removal of those regarded as \"aliens\" from Russia, namely those who are Jewish or have ethnic origins in the Caucasus,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}} an approach that could require [[ethnic cleansing]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Other Rodnovers are openly anti-Semitic,{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=234|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284}} for instance urging fellow Rodnovers not to get involved with Jews,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=234}} and endorsing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control the economic and political elite.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}}\n\nMany Rodnovers oppose what they regard as \"culturally destructive\" phenomena such as [[cosmopolitanism]], [[liberalism]] and [[globalisation]],{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} as well as [[Americanisation]] and [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} The political models proposed by Rodnovers as based on their interpretation of the ancient Slavic community model of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), similar to the ancient Germanic \"[[thing (assembly)|thing]]\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=2\u20133}} Western liberal ideas of freedom and democracy are traditionally perceived by Russian eyes as \"outer\" freedom, contrasting with Slavic \"inner\" freedom of the mind;

The meeting ends with the singing of ''[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]]'', the [[national anthem]] of Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=226}} The rival and near homonymous Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira), also conducts weekly Holy Hours, but incorporates a wider selection of sources\u2014such as readings from the pan-Rodnover ''Book of Veles'' or the poetry of [[Taras Shevchenko]]\u2014into the proceedings.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The structure of these Syenkoite rites is modelled on those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}}\n\n[[File:Koliada 2017 near Naro-Fominsk (1).jpg|thumb|left|Rodnovers engaged in a circle-dance around a bonfire, celebrating the [[Koliada]] festival in [[Naro-Fominsk]], [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia.]]\n\nAdherents of Slavic Native Faith often adopt elements from recorded folk culture. Lesiv described this process as one of \"Paganisation\", whereby Christian or otherwise non-Pagan elements are deliberately given a new meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=136}} In turn, some of these \"Paganised\" folk practices have been transmitted through the wider population, who has regarded them as authentic traditional practices.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} Some Rodnover groups also incorporate non-Slavic practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013b|1p=128|2a1=Simpson|2y=2017|2p=81}} For instance, a group of Polish Rodnovers has been documented to use the [[fire poi]] at their Midsummer festivities, a practice that originally developed in Pacific regions during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=80}} The Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith promotes a healing technique called ''Zhyva'' that has close similarities to the Japanese practice of [[reiki]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}} In another instance, Lesiv observed a Ukrainian Rodnover who legitimised the practice of [[yoga]] by claiming that this spiritual tradition had originally been developed by the ancestors of modern-day Ukrainians.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=137}} Another example are groups within [[Peterburgian Vedism]] which incorporate [[Ivanovism|Ivanovite]] healing techniques.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}\n\nRituals take place at secluded, consecrated spaces, and generally include the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of [[libation]]s, circle-dances (''horovod'' or simply ''kolo'', \"circle\"), and usually end with a communal meal. Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such gatherings, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes \"traditional clothes\", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=70}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=290}}\n\nBesides the rites of outgang from Christianity (''raskrestitsia''), Rodnovers practise rituals of initiation of the new members into the community of Slavic Native Faith. Central to this conversion is the \"renaming\", that is to say the adoption of a new Slavic name, symbolising the death and rebirth of the convert into the new community. Some groups, such as male brotherhoods, practise the cutting of a second \"life line\" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new \"blood bond\" that is formed with other members.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=292}}\n\n===Communities, citadels and temples===\n[[File:\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c.jpg|thumb|A building of the Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova in the [[Podolsky District]], Moscow Oblast, Russia.]]\n\nRodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history. They recover the pre-Christian social institution of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), which they also see as reflecting the concept of ''[[sobornost]]'' formulated in 20th-century Russian philosophy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=191}} ''Veche'' is used as the name of many Rodnover overarching organisations, including the international \"Veche of Slavic Native Faith\", an assembly held each summer, to which adherents from Slavic countries take part. Aitamurto (2008) characterises the ''veche'' as a model of organisation \"from below and to the top\", following descriptions given by Rodnovers themselves\u2014that is to say a grassroots form of governance which matures into a consensual authority and/or decision-making. Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves ''obshchina'' (the term for traditional peasant communities), while ''skhod'', ''sobor'' and ''mir'' are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is ''artel''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (''[[kremlin]]'') or citadels (''gorodok''), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses.

They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=272, note 11}}\n\nThough the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of ''zhritsa'' and ''vedunya'' (\"seeresses\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, [[Halyna Lozko]] from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}\n\n===Calendars and holidays===\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's calendars and holidays}}\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess at Vodokres holiday.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess' pole on Vodokre\u0161 holiday in the countryside.]]\n\nAccording to Aitamurto, rituals play \"a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion\", and thus they constitute an important complement to theology within Rodnovery. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like [[Vladimir Dal]] and [[Boris Rybakov]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nThe common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es set in the four phases of the year.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}} Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \"the cycles of nature\".{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}} A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the [[Kupala Night|''Kupala'' Night]] (June 23\u201324), although also important are the winter solstice festival ''Karachun'' and ''[[Koliada]]'' (December 24\u201325), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide\u2014called ''Komoeditsa'' or ''[[Maslenitsa]]'' (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the ''Krasnaya Gorka'' (literally \"Red Hill\", celebrated between April 30\u2013May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of [[Marzanna]] and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nUsually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \"core\" of practitioners, who are often professionally affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \"periphery\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside [[Maloyaroslavets]] in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \"aesthetically lavish\", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=69}}\n\nSome Slavic Native Faith organisations have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The calendar of one of the organisations of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a \"Christmas of Dazhboh's Light\" and an \"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The common Rodnover calendar leaves room for national and regional variations; for instance, the same Native Ukrainian National Faith's organisation observes holidays devoted to Ukrainian national heroes such as Shevchenko, [[Ivan Franko]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and [[Hryhory Skovoroda]], as well as those devoted to more abstract concepts such as \"Ukrainian Ancient Literature\" and \"New Ukrainian Literature\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=28}}\n\n===Artistic and other pursuits===\n[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 60.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnovers engaged in a martial arts dare.]]\n\nA number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] is one of the most popular subjects.<ref name=Gizbrekht2016>{{cite article |last=Gizbrekht |first=Andrey Ivanovich |year=2016 |title=\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u044b \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \"\u042f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\" (\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) |trans-title=The images of public figures of Russian history in the discourse of modern \"Pagan art\" (based on fine arts material) |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/obrazy-deyateley-rossiyskoy-istorii-v-diskurse-sovremennogo-yazycheskogo-iskusstva-na-materiale-izobrazitelnogo-tvorchestva |publisher=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b}} \u0423\u0414\u041a 298.9:7.044/.046.</ref> Rodnover rituals and festivals often include [[martial arts]] displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=95}} Slavic-hill wrestling (\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043e-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430, ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba'') was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=69}}{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=39}} Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are \"bench wrestling\" (''lavochki'') and \"wall against wall\" (''stenka na stenku'').{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:O S\u0142awia\u0144szczy\u017anie przed chrze\u015bcija\u0144stwem.

The study of this syncretic popular religion and philsophy was the foremost interest for late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Russian intellectuals: early revolutionaries ([[Alexander Herzen]], [[Nikolay Ogarev]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]]), [[Narodniks]] (Populists), and early [[Bolsheviks]] were inspired by the radical forms of society practised wihin folk religious communities, which in many ways were precursors to [[socialism]]. [[Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich]] was assigned by the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] the task of studying folk religious movements, and in 1908\u20131910 a faction of the Bolsheviks, represented by [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Alexander Bogdanov]], [[Maxim Gorky]], and [[Vladimir Bazarov]], formulated the \"[[God-Building]]\" movement (''Bogostroitelstvo''), whose aim was to create a new religion for the proletariat through a synthesis of socialism with folk religion.{{sfn|Smirnov|2020|loc=passim}}\n\n===1930s\u20131940s: Early developments===\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0435\u043a\u0430 (\u0416\u0430\u0440-\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0430).jpg|thumb|One of the earliest copies (dated 1955) of one of \"Isenbek's Planks\" (the n. 16), upon which the ''Book of Veles'' was supposedly written.]]\n \nIn Ukraine, the first practitioners of Slavic Native Faith appeared in the 1930s.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} One of the most influential Ukrainian Rodnover ideologues was [[Volodymyr Shaian]], a linguist and philologist who worked at [[Lviv University]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} He claimed that in 1934 he underwent a spiritual revelation atop Mount Grekhit in the [[Carpathian Mountains]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} Particularly interested in the ideas of an ancient Aryan race that were popular at the time,{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=129}} he subsequently began promoting what he called a \"pan-Aryan renaissance\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} He turned to recorded Ukrainian folklore to find what he regarded as the survivals of the ancient Slavic religion.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=129}} In 1944, he fled the Soviet government and travelled to refugee camps in Germany and Austria. There, he established the Order of the Knights of the Solar God (''Orden Lytsariv Boha Sontsia''), a religio-political group that he hoped would affiliate itself to the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=216\u2013217}}\n\nIn Poland, [[Jan Stachniuk]] established the ''Zadruga'' magazine in 1937;{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=113|2a1=Struty\u0144ski|2y=2013|2p=295}} the term \"Zadruga\" itself was a reference to a [[Zadruga|South Slavic tribal unit]].{{sfn|Struty\u0144ski|2013|p=288}} Continuing on from Do\u0142\u0119ga-Chodakowski, Stachniuk's own work criticised [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Catholicism in Poland]], arguing that it had had a negative effect on the country's national character.{{sfnm|1a1=Struty\u0144ski|1y=2013|1p=288|2a1=Potrzebowski|2y=2016|2pp=45, 177}} He did not develop his ideas into a religion, and those who shared his views remained \"a very loose and diverse intellectual clique\".{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} The magazine and its associated group embraced members with a wide variety of viewpoints, ranging from secularly [[Humanism|humanistic]] to religiously Slavic Native Faith stances.{{sfn|Potrzebowski|2016|p=51}} He was nevertheless labelled a ''neopoganin'' (\"Neopagan\") by the Polish popular press, a term that he embraced as a self-descriptor in later life.{{sfn|Struty\u0144ski|2013|p=294}}\n\n[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Ko\u0142odziej]] later claimed to have established a pre-war Holy Circle of the Worshippers of Svetovid (''\u015awi\u0119te Ko\u0142o Czcicieli \u015awiatowida''), although there is no evidence that they conducted regular meetings until many years later.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} During the Second World War, Stefan Potrzuski led a unit in the Peasant Battalion which battled the Nazi German occupation forces. His unit had a shrine to the god [[Svetovid]] in their secret forest base and held group rites in which they toasted a wooden image of the deity with mead.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} Stachniuk fought against the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345)|Nazi occupation]] during the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. Following the end of the war and the incorporation of Poland under a Stalinist regime, both Stachniuk and Ko\u0142odziej were arrested, preventing the establishment of a Slavic Native Faith community.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=113|2a1=Struty\u0144ski|2y=2013|2p=295}} In 1954, a student group known as Klan Ausran was established at the [[University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; officially dedicated to a study of Indo-European society, its members provided hymns and prayers.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=114}}\n\nA key influence on the movement was the circulation of the ''Book of Veles'' among Russian and Ukrainian emigrees.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1pp=217\u2013218|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=285}} This text was brought to the public by Yuri Mirolyubov, who claimed that it had been discovered by a friend of his, Fodor Arturovich Isenbek, while serving as a [[White movement|White Army]] officer during the [[Russian Civil War]].

It was in [[Chicago]] that he established the earliest groups of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] in 1966.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=217}} Sylenko presented himself as a prophet of Dazhbog who had been sent to the Ukrainian people.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} In his view, the Ukrainians were the superior manifestation of the European peoples,{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} and Kyiv the oldest city of the [[white race]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} Sylenko was a [[Charismatic authority|charismatic leader]], whose followers praised his talents and oratorical skills.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=135}} In 1979 he published ''Maha Vira'', a book which he claimed chronicled the ancient history of the Ukrainian people.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=217}} The system of Slavic Native Faith that he developed was influenced by [[deism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} A Native Ukrainian National Faith centre, the Temple of Mother Ukraine, was established in [[Spring Glen, New York]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=224}} Native Ukrainian National Faith congregations were established among Ukrainian emigree communities in other parts of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Germany.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=224|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=130}}\n\n[[File:Temple of Oriyana in Spring Glen, New York.jpg|thumb|left|The Temple of Mother Ukraine\u2013Oryana in Spring Glen, [[New York (state)|New York]], United States.]]\n\nDuring era of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, research into prehistoric societies was encouraged, with some scholars arguing that pre-Christian society reflected a form of communitarianism that was damaged by Christianity's promotion of entrenched class divisions. In doing so, pre-Christian belief systems underwent a rehabilitation.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=285\u2013286}} Joseph Stalin himself was a supporter of the idea of \"Slavic Vedism\", the shared Indo-European origins of [[Vedic period|Vedic]] and Slavic cultures.{{sfn|Kleinhempel|2015|pp=11\u201312}} Russian Native Faith originated in the [[Soviet dissidents]]' circles of the 1970s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=185}} An intellectual circle that cultivated themes of Slavic indigenous religion formed as a wing of the predominantly Orthodox Christian [[samizdat]] nationalist journal ''Veche'' (1971\u20131974). Such group included Anatoly Ivanov, the artist [[Konstantin Vasilyev]] (1942\u20131974), and Nikolai Bogdanov, among others. Vasilyev's art is widely celebrated within the Rodnover community. Ivanov, who declared himself a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and subscribed to \"Arism\" or \"Slavism\", published a fervently anti-Christian pamphlet entitled \"The Christian Plague\" (''Khristianskaya chuma''). Throughout the 1970s, the nationalist dissident movement split into two branches, an Orthodox Christian one and another one that developed [[National Bolshevism]], which eventually continued to harbour Pagan traditionalists.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=26\u201327}} Other influential texts in this period were Valery Yemelyanov's ''Desionizatsiya'' (\"De-Sionisation\") and later Istarkhov's ''Udar russkikh bogov'' (\"The Strike of Russian Gods\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Slavic Native Faith groups had to operate in secret, although a few small groups were known to exist in Moscow and Leningrad.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} These groups were closely linked to the nationalistic circles operating during the 1980s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} In Moscow, an [[occultism|occult]] circle was established by Yevgeny Golovin and Yuri Mamleyev; although not explicitly Pagan, they were influenced by occult Pagan thinkers like [[Guido von List]] and sought a return to a pre-Christian [[Aryan]] world.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=287}} In the early 1980s, the \"[[Pamyat]]\" movement was established by figures active at the Metropolitan Moscow Palace of Culture, which similarly looked with fondness on ancient Aryan culture.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=287}} Several Russian nationalists also began to state that pre-Christian belief systems were the true religion of the Russian people; Apollon Kuzmin did so in his 1988 book ''Padenie Peruna'' (\"The Fall of Perun\").{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=288}} In 1986, Viktor Bezverkhy established the Leningrad ([[Saint Petersburg]])-based Society of the Mages (''Obshchestvo Volkhvov''), an explicitly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and anti-Semitic organisation; it was followed by the Union of the Veneds, founded in 1990.{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1pp=288\u2013289|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2016|2p=35}} These organisations gave rise to the stream of Rodnovery known as \"[[Peterburgian Vedism]]\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}\n\n===1990s\u20132000s: Post-Soviet growth===\n[[File:Ukraine, outdoor Sylenkoite worship (1).png|thumb|Ukrainian Rodnovers engaged in public worship.]]\n\nAfter [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s Soviet government introduced the policy of ''[[perestroika]]'' in the 1980s, Slavic Native Faith groups established themselves in Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=220}} The collapse of the Soviet Union and its official policy of [[state atheism]] resulted in a resurgence of open religious adherence across the region.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} Many individuals arrived at Slavic Native Faith after exploring a range of different alternative spiritualities, with Asian religious influences being particularly apparent within Slavic Native Faith at that time.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=149}}\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became an independent republic, with many Ukrainians turning to strongly nationalistic agendas; among those to have done so are [[pseudo-archaeology|pseudo-archaeologists]] like Yuri Shylov, who posits Ukraine as the \"cradle of civilisation\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=221}} It is within this broader milieu of cultural nationalism and interest in alternative spiritualities that Slavic Native Faith re-emerged in Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} The United States-based [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] established itself in Ukraine soon after independence, with the first congregation in Ukraine gaining official recognition in [[Kiev]] in 1991.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=224|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} There had been schisms in the international organisation of Native Ukrainian National Faith.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} A number of senior followers broke with Sylenko during the 1980s, rejecting the idea that he should be the ultimate authority in the religion; they formed the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira) and secured legal control of the temple in Spring Glen.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=227}} A second group, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), maintained links with Sylenko himself, whom it regards as a prophet, and adopted his ''Maha Vira'' as a sacred text.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Despite the animosity that existed between these rival Ukrainian groups, there was some collaboration between them.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} In 2003, the First Forum of Rodnovers was held in the country, resulting in two public proclamations: the first urged the country's government to protect what the Rodnovers regarded as sacred sites and objects, and the second called on the government not to go ahead with the proposed privatisation of agricultural land.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} That same year, a group called Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith was established; in contrast to the anti-Russian slant taken by Sylenko, it embraced a Pan-Slavic perspective.{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\nThe social context of Slavic Native Faith's growth in Russia differed from that in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}} Russian nationalists had welcomed the collapse of the Soviet system but were disappointed with the arrival of [[capitalism]] and the dramatic economic downturn that Russia faced in that decade.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=147}} Large numbers became unemployed, and many turned to the past, including in ethnic terms.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|pp=87\u201388}} In this context, the growth of Rodnovery can be seen as a nationalistic project to regain national pride.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}} Many leaders of early post-Soviet Rodnovery were intellectuals that were already practising members of the movement in late Soviet times, for instance, Grigory Yakutovsky (Vseslav Svyatozar), Aleksei Dobrovolsky (Dobroslav) and Viktor Bezverkhy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} Other leaders that emerged in this period were Aleksandr Asov, publisher of numerous versions of the ''Book of Veles'', and Aleksei Belov, founder of the martial arts style known as \"Slavic-hill wrestling\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nRussian Rodnovers started to organise by the mid-1990s; in 1994 the Moscow Slavic Community was the first Rodnover group to be registered by the government. Concerted efforts by the communities of Moscow and [[Kaluga]] led to the establishment of the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities in 1997. The communities of Moscow and [[Obninsk]] later left the organisation for ideological differences. Another organisation, the Circle of Veles, which is one of the largest and administers communities also located in the territory of Ukraine, was founded in 1999. The [[Ynglist Church]] too was formally established in the early 1990s.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} In 2002, the same year of the Bittsa Agreement, the Circle of Pagan Tradition was established in Moscow.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|pp=184\u2013185}} Its purpose was to bring together Russian Rodnovers who did not share the extreme right-wing views then dominant in much of the community.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=203}} In 2009, the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities and the Circle of Pagan Tradition issued a joint statement against Ynglism, disapproving what they reck as Ynglists' \"pseudo-Pagan teachings, pseudo-linguistics, pseudo-science and outright fiction\".{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}\n\n[[File:Polish Rodnover celebrations (0).PNG|thumb|Polish Rodnovers worshipping in the woods.]]\n\nIn Poland, the [[Wroc\u0142aw]]-based publishing house ''Toporze\u0142'' has reissued Stachniuk's works and those of his disciple Antoni Wacyk.{{sfn|Potrzebowski|2016|p=183}} Zadruga also inspired the registered religious Association of Native Faith (''Zrzeszenie Rodzimej Wiary''; now called simply ''[[Rodzima Wiara]]'' [RW], lit. \"Native Faith\"),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Skupn |first=Anna |year=2013 |title=\u0179r\u00f3d\u0142a Rodzimej Wiary \u2013 w\u0105tki aryjskie i zadru\u017cne w doktrynie zwi\u0105zku wyznaniowego Rodzima Wiara |trans-title=Sources of Native Faith \u2013 Aryan and Zadruga themes in the doctrine of the religious association Native Faith |url=https://www.academia.edu/9071501 |language=pl}}</ref> whose founder [[Stanis\u0142aw Potrzebowski]] wrote his doctoral thesis on pre-war Zadruga in German (''Zadruga -

On the same occasion, they once again expressed disapproval for some authors and movements, including the large [[Skhoron ezh Sloven]], which is also present in Belarus and Ukraine.

Under the act, abortion is available without restrictions to any woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant. Women seeking an abortion after 20 weeks have to be assessed by a qualified health professional.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\">{{cite web |title=Abortion Legislation Bill 2019 164-1: Bill Digest |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-digests/document/52PLLaw25991/abortion-legislation-bill-2019-bills-digest-2599 |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative features==\nThe Abortion Legislation Act decriminalises abortion, better aligns the regulation of abortion services with other health services, and modernises the legal framework of abortion provided by the [[Crimes Act 1961]] and the [[Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977]] (CSA Act 1977). The Abortion Legislation Act repeals Sections 10 to 46 of the CSA Act 1977 including the Abortion Supervisory Committee (Section 10), the requirement that abortions need to be certified by two certifying consultants (Section 29), and the ban on women unlawfully procuring a miscarriage (Section 44). Under the Abortion Legislation Act, women can seek an abortion without restrictions within the first 20 weeks of their pregnancy. After the 20 week period, women seeking an abortion must consult a qualified health practitioner who will assess the patient's physical health, mental health, and well-being.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\" />\n\nThe Act also requires medical practitioners who have a [[conscientious objection to abortion|conscientious objection]] to performing abortions to inform their patients at the earliest opportunity and to provide them with information on how to access the closest abortion services. The Act also contains provisions for protecting the rights of conscientious objecting medical professionals from discrimination and termination.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\" />\n\nThe Abortion Legislation Act also amends Section 182 of the Crimes Act to allow for abortion services within the provisions of the CSA Act. The Act also repeals Sections 182 to 187A of the Crimes Act including the 14 year jail term for any persons with the exception of the woman or girl seeking to unlawfully procure abortion (Section 183); a seven year prison term for persons who unlawfully provide the means of procuring an abortion (Section 186), and seeking an abortion illegally before or after the 20 week gestation period (Section 187). The Abortion Legislation Act replaces these sections with Section 183 (clause 12) which makes it an offense for a person who is not a health practitioner to procure or perform an abortion for a woman.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\" />\n\nThe Abortion Legislation Act also extends the definition of health services in the [[Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994]] (HDC Act) to include abortion services.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Andrew Little 2018 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|175px|Andrew Little, the sponsor of the Abortion Legislation Act.]]\n===Background===\nOn 5 August 2019, the [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]] [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] announced that the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led coalition government]] would be introducing new legislation to decriminalise abortion and to allow women unrestricted access to abortion within the 20 week gestation period. The [[New Zealand Law Commission]] had proposed three options for abortion reform: having no statutory test to make sure the abortion was appropriate at any point; taking abortion of the Crimes Act but having a statutory test; or only having a test for later-term abortions, after 22 weeks. The Government adopted the third approach but reduced it to 20 weeks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Little |first1=Andrew |title=Bill to modernise abortion law introduced |url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/bill-modernise-abortion-law-introduced |website=Beehive.govt.nz |publisher=[[New Zealand Government]] |accessdate=6 August 2019 |date=5 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ODT 5 August 2019\">{{cite news |title=Govt unveils sweeping abortion law changes |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/govt-unveils-sweeping-abortion-law-changes |accessdate=5 August 2019 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=5 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Whyte |first1=Anna |title=New Government bill seeks to remove abortion from Crimes Act, treat it as a health issue |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/new-government-bill-seeks-remove-abortion-crimes-act-treat-health-issue |accessdate=5 August 2019 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=5 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Jancic |first1=Boris |title=Government unveils abortion law reforms |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12255624 |accessdate=4 August 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=5 August 2019}}</ref> While pro-choice groups like the [[Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand]] (ALRANZ) and Family Planning have welcomed the proposed changes but criticized the 20 week limit, the Government's proposed abortion law reform was opposed by the conservative lobby group [[Family First New Zealand]].<ref name=\"ODT 5 August 2019\" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Radical abortion law reform is deeply anti-human rights \u2013 Family First |url=http://www.voxy.co.nz/politics/5/344561 |accessdate=5 August 2019 |agency=Fuseworks Media |publisher=Voxy.com |date=5 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to media reports, the ruling [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] and its coalition partner [[New Zealand First]] conducted months of negotiations on the proposed Abortion Legislation Bill. New Zealand First Member of Parliament and Minister of Children [[Tracey Martin]], a supporter of abortion reform, played an active role in the negotiations. On 6 August 2019, NZ First leader and [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Winston Peters]] surprised both Martin and Labour by demanding a binding referendum on the Abortion Legislation Bill. The NZ First parliamentary caucus voted by a majority to support their leader's calls for a referendum. In response, Justice Minister Andrew Little ruled out support for a binding referendum on abortion, claiming that it had not been discussed during the negotiations. NZ First subsequently confirmed that it would support the Abortion Legislation Bill through its first and second readings while pushing for a referendum.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Patterson |first1=Jane |title=Abortion legislation: 'It wasn't part of our coalition agreement so why is it there' \u2013 Winston Peters |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/396224/abortion-legislation-it-wasn-t-part-of-our-coalition-agreement-so-why-is-it-there-winston-peters |accessdate=8 August 2019 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=8 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"NZ First blindsides Andrew Little\">{{cite news |last1=Jancic |first1=Boris |title=NZ First blindsides Andrew Little with talk of abortion referendum |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12256174 |accessdate=7 August 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Walls |first1=Jason |title=All nine NZ First MPs to vote in favour of abortion bill in first and second reading |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12256917 |accessdate=8 August 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=8 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Henry |title=Winston Peters suggests NZ First want binding referendum on abortion |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/114790808/winston-peters-suggests-nz-first-want-binding-referendum-on-abortion |accessdate=7 August 2019 |publisher=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=6 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe opposition [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] leader [[Simon Bridges]] has voiced his support for abortion reform but says it needs more safeguards.

Abortion Legislation Committee's chair Ruth Dyson and National MP [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] welcomed the bill's passage as long overdue for women's rights but expressed disappointment at the elimination of the safe zones around abortion clinics.<ref name=\"RNZ 18 March\">{{cite news |title=Abortion Legislation Bill passes third and final reading in Parliament |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/412087/abortion-legislation-bill-passes-third-and-final-reading-in-parliament |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=18 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330023938/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/412087/abortion-legislation-bill-passes-third-and-final-reading-in-parliament|archive-date=30 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"NZH 18 March\">{{cite news |last1=Wade |first1=Amelia |title=Abortion law reform passes third reading |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12317885 |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200410085449/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12317885|archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Newshub 18 March\">{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Zane |title=Abortion no longer a crime in New Zealand as law change passes final reading in Parliament |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/03/abortion-no-longer-a-crime-in-new-zealand-as-law-change-passes-final-reading-in-parliament.html |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=18 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319032334/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/03/abortion-no-longer-a-crime-in-new-zealand-as-law-change-passes-final-reading-in-parliament.html|archive-date=19 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Stuff 18 March\" /> \n\nDuring the final reading, Labour List MP [[Kieran McAnulty]] spoke about his Catholic faith and being adopted as a child but supported women's reproductive rights.

Under the act, abortion is available without restrictions to any woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant. Women seeking an abortion after 20 weeks have to be assessed by a qualified health professional.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\">{{cite web |title=Abortion Legislation Bill 2019 164-1: Bill Digest |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-digests/document/52PLLaw25991/abortion-legislation-bill-2019-bills-digest-2599 |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative features==\nThe Abortion Legislation Act decriminalises abortion, better aligns the regulation of abortion services with other health services, and modernises the legal framework of abortion provided by the [[Crimes Act 1961]] and the [[Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977]] (CSA Act 1977). The Abortion Legislation Act repeals Sections 10 to 46 of the CSA Act 1977 including the Abortion Supervisory Committee (Section 10), the requirement that abortions need to be certified by two certifying consultants (Section 29), and the ban on women unlawfully procuring a miscarriage (Section 44). Under the Abortion Legislation Act, women can seek an abortion without restrictions within the first 20 weeks of their pregnancy. After the 20 week period, women seeking an abortion must consult a qualified health practitioner who will assess the patient's physical health, mental health, and well-being.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\" />\n\nThe Act also requires medical practitioners who have a [[conscientious objection to abortion|conscientious objection]] to performing abortions to inform their patients at the earliest opportunity and to provide them with information on how to access the closest abortion services. The Act also contains provisions for protecting the rights of conscientious objecting medical professionals from discrimination and termination.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\" />\n\nThe Abortion Legislation Act also amends Section 182 of the Crimes Act to allow for abortion services within the provisions of the CSA Act. The Act also repeals Sections 182 to 187A of the Crimes Act including the 14 year jail term for any persons with the exception of the woman or girl seeking to unlawfully procure abortion (Section 183); a seven year prison term for persons who unlawfully provide the means of procuring an abortion (Section 186), and seeking an abortion illegally before or after the 20 week gestation period (Section 187). The Abortion Legislation Act replaces these sections with Section 183 (clause 12) which makes it an offense for a person who is not a health practitioner to procure or perform an abortion for a woman.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\" />\n\nThe Abortion Legislation Act also extends the definition of health services in the [[Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994]] (HDC Act) to include abortion services.<ref name=\"Bill Digest\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Andrew Little 2018 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|175px|Andrew Little, the sponsor of the Abortion Legislation Act.]]\n===Background===\nOn 5 August 2019, the [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]] [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] announced that the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led coalition government]] would be introducing new legislation to decriminalise abortion and to allow women unrestricted access to abortion within the 20 week gestation period. The [[New Zealand Law Commission]] had proposed three options for abortion reform: having no statutory test to make sure the abortion was appropriate at any point; taking abortion of the Crimes Act but having a statutory test; or only having a test for later-term abortions, after 22 weeks.

Abortion Legislation Committee's chair Ruth Dyson and National MP [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] welcomed the bill's passage as long overdue for women's rights but expressed disappointment at the elimination of the safe zones around abortion clinics.<ref name=\"RNZ 18 March\">{{cite news |title=Abortion Legislation Bill passes third and final reading in Parliament |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/412087/abortion-legislation-bill-passes-third-and-final-reading-in-parliament |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=18 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330023938/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/412087/abortion-legislation-bill-passes-third-and-final-reading-in-parliament|archive-date=30 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"NZH 18 March\">{{cite news |last1=Wade |first1=Amelia |title=Abortion law reform passes third reading |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12317885 |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200410085449/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12317885|archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Newshub 18 March\">{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Zane |title=Abortion no longer a crime in New Zealand as law change passes final reading in Parliament |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/03/abortion-no-longer-a-crime-in-new-zealand-as-law-change-passes-final-reading-in-parliament.html |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=18 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319032334/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/03/abortion-no-longer-a-crime-in-new-zealand-as-law-change-passes-final-reading-in-parliament.html|archive-date=19 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Stuff 18 March\" /> \n\nDuring the final reading, Labour List MP [[Kieran McAnulty]] spoke about his Catholic faith and being adopted as a child but supported women's reproductive rights.
