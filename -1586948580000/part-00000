The family celebrates the Slava annually on the saint's [[feast day]]. In November 2014 it was inscribed in [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe Slava is the family's annual ceremony and veneration of their patron saint, a social event in which the family is together at the house of the patriarch. The Slava also brings friends to the house, regardless if they have the same Slava. The family saint is inherited from the patriarch (head of the household) \u2013 from father to son, while women adopt the patron saint of their husbands upon marriage. As several patron saints are venerated twice a year, the main day is the ''Slava'', while the secondary one is called ''preslava''. Some families may celebrate another patron saint in the case when the wife is the only left of her kin, in respect to her family. In cases where the daughter's husband has joined (traditional) household of the parents-in-law (\"''prizet''\"/\"''domazet''\" = \"by-son-in-law\"/\"son-in-law-in-the-home\"), the wife's father's ''slava'' is celebrated as the main one (when guests are expected and/or invited) and the son-in-law's only as an additional lesser one (when just a festive meal is prepared for the family and no manual work is carried out, but no guests are expected).\n\nThe tradition is an important ethnic marker of [[Serbian national identity|Serbian identity]].<ref name=EB70/> The slogan: ''\"\u0413\u0434\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430, \u0442\u0443 \u0458\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u043d\"'' (\"Where there is a Slava, there is a [[Serbs|Serb]]\") was raised as a Serbian national identifier by [[Milo\u0161 Milojevi\u0107]]  after his travel to [[Kosovo and Metohija]] in 1871-1877.<ref name=EB70>{{cite book|title=Petko Hristov, The Use of Holidays for Propaganda Purposes: The \u201cSerbian\u201d Slava and/or the \u201cBulgarian\u201d S\u0103bor in Ethnologia Balkanica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ebpDLhkVWcC&pg=PA70|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|pages=69-80|id=GGKEY:ES2RY3RRUDS}}</ref> [[Serbs]] usually regard the Slava as their most significant and most solemn [[feast day]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Celia Jaes Falicov | title = Family Transitions: Continuity and Change Over the Life Cycle | publisher = Guilford Press | year = 1991 | location = [[New York City]] | page = 219 | url = | isbn = 978-0-89862-484-7}}</ref> The tradition is also very well preserved among the [[Serb diaspora|Serbs]] worldwide.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| author = Michael B.

According to some Serbian researchers, the thesis of how Slava is Serbian ethnic identification marker is simply patriotic delusion of the romantic and patriotic citizenry.<ref>Petko Hristov, The Use of Holidays for Propaganda Purposes: The \u201cSerbian\u201d Slava and/or the \u201cBulgarian\u201d S\u0103bor Petko Hristov, Ethnologia Balkanica, LIT Verlag, 2002, Issue No: 06, p 79: ''And here we completely agree to the conclusion of Milenko Filipovi\u0107 that the thesis regarding the slava, slu\u017eba or the krastno ime were a purely Serbian feature, was \u201c\u2026a delusion of the romantic and patriotic citizenry and those from among those circles that were writers\u201d, a delusion, of which \u2026je samo srpstvo imalo vi\u0161e \u0161tete, nego koristi\u201d [\u201cThe Serbian people have had more losses than benefits/advantages\u201d].

Although here and there in scholarly publications, and particularly in popular books, even in the formal publications of the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Church, some of these romantic delusions about the slava as a Serbian ethnic identification marker are repeated, the serious scholars giving interpretation to the slava M.Filipovi\u0107, V.\u010cajkanovi\u0107, P.Vlahovi\u0107, N.Panteli\u0107, S.Ze\u010devi\u0107, D.Bandi\u0107, point out mostly the agrarian and integrative functions of the set of rites and rituals, united under the name of slava, and its tie-up with the cult for the forefathers.''</ref>\n\n==Modern history==\nThe increased effective geographic mobility brought about by the post World War II urbanization of a previously highly agrarian society, combined with the suppression of [[Serbian Orthodox]] traditions under the Communist rule, has made some aspects of the custom more relaxed. In particular, in the second half of the 20th century it became common to see traditional patriarchal families separated by great distances, so by necessity Slava came to occasionally be celebrated at more than one place by members of the same family.\n\nWhile the ''Slava'' kept something of a grassroots underground popularity during the Communist period, the post-Communist revival of Serbian Orthodox traditions has brought it a resurgence. It is recognized as a distinctly (if not quite exclusively) Serbian custom, and today it is quite common for nonobservant Christians or even atheists to celebrate it in one form or another, as a hereditary family holiday and a mark of ethnocultural identification.\n\nIn November 2014 it was inscribed in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].\n\nThe custom is also helpful in genealogical studies as an indicator in kinship relations between families, tracing one's family to a specific region, etc.\n\n==Celebration==\n [[File:\u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435, \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0435, 190.jpg|thumb|Breaking the ''kola\u010d'', illustration by [[Vladislav Titelbah|V. Titelbah]], 1877.]]\nThe ritual foods that are prepared for the feast are the ''[[:sr:slavski kola\u010d|slavski kola\u010d]]'' (or simply ''kola\u010d'') = a ritual bread, and ''[[koljivo]]'' (or ''\u017eito''), a dish of minced boiled wheat, sweetened and sometimes mixed with chopped walnuts. The top of the ''kola\u010d'' is adorned with the [[Christian cross]], the [[Peace_symbols#The_dove_and_olive_branch|peace dove]], and other symbols. The ''koljivo'' is a symbol of the [[Resurrection of Christ]] (cf. \"if the grain does not die...\" in the [[Gospel]]) and partaken in memory of the dead (deceased family members). \n\nThe rest of the feast consists of a meal, the contents of which depends on whether or not the celebration falls in a period of [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Fasting|fasting]]. During a fast (''posno''), the meal would not contain any meat other than fish or other seafood, and would be highly unlikely to contain eggs or dairy products. Outside of a fasting period, these restrictions would not apply (''mrsno''). Thus, colloquially, ''slavas'' can be referred to as ''posna'' or ''mrsna''. Appropriately-made sweets are consumed, as well.\n\nThe family attends church services and partakes in [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] on the feast day. Following the service, traditionally, the parish priest is received in the family's home or the family brings the ''slavski kola\u010d'' to the church. The parish priest performs a small service which entails venerating the patron saint's memory, blessing the ''kola\u010d'' and ''koljivo'', as well as lighting the \"''slava'' candle\". Though not necessary, it is common for the priest to bless the house and perform a small memorial service for dead relatives.\n\nThe most common [[feast day]]s are [[St. Nicholas]] (''Nikoljdan'', 19 December), [[St. George]] (''[[\u0110ur\u0111evdan]]'', 6 May), [[St. John the Baptist]] (''Jovanjdan'', 20 January), [[St. Demetrius]] (''Mitrovdan'', 8 November), [[St. Michael]] (''Aran\u0111elovdan'', 21 November) and [[St. Sava]] (''Savindan'', 27 January).

The family celebrates the Slava annually on the saint's [[feast day]]. In November 2014 it was inscribed in [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe Slava is the family's annual ceremony and veneration of their patron saint, a social event in which the family is together at the house of the patriarch. The Slava also brings friends to the house, regardless if they have the same Slava. The family saint is inherited from the patriarch (head of the household) \u2013 from father to son, while women adopt the patron saint of their husbands upon marriage. As several patron saints are venerated twice a year, the main day is the ''Slava'', while the secondary one is called ''preslava''. Some families may celebrate another patron saint in the case when the wife is the only left of her kin, in respect to her family. In cases where the daughter's husband has joined (traditional) household of the parents-in-law (\"''prizet''\"/\"''domazet''\" = \"by-son-in-law\"/\"son-in-law-in-the-home\"), the wife's father's ''slava'' is celebrated as the main one (when guests are expected and/or invited) and the son-in-law's only as an additional lesser one (when just a festive meal is prepared for the family and no manual work is carried out, but no guests are expected).\n\nThe tradition is an important ethnic marker of [[Serbian national identity|Serbian identity]].<ref name=EB70/> The slogan: ''\"\u0413\u0434\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430, \u0442\u0443 \u0458\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u043d\"'' (\"Where there is a Slava, there is a [[Serbs|Serb]]\") was rised as a Serbian national identificator by [[Milo\u0161 Milojevi\u0107]]  after his travel to [[Kosovo and Metohija]] in 1871-1877.<ref name=EB70>{{cite book|title=Petko Hristov, The Use of Holidays for Propaganda Purposes: The \u201cSerbian\u201d Slava and/or the \u201cBulgarian\u201d S\u0103bor in Ethnologia Balkanica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ebpDLhkVWcC&pg=PA70|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|pages=69-80|id=GGKEY:ES2RY3RRUDS}}</ref> [[Serbs]] usually regard the Slava as their most significant and most solemn [[feast day]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Celia Jaes Falicov | title = Family Transitions: Continuity and Change Over the Life Cycle | publisher = Guilford Press | year = 1991 | location = [[New York City]] | page = 219 | url = | isbn = 978-0-89862-484-7}}</ref> The tradition is also very well preserved among the [[Serb diaspora|Serbs]] worldwide.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| author = Michael B.

According to some Serbian researchers, the thesis of how Slava is Serbian ethnic identification marker is simply patriotic delusion of the romantic and patriotic citizenry.<ref>Petko Hristov, The Use of Holidays for Propaganda Purposes: The \u201cSerbian\u201d Slava and/or the \u201cBulgarian\u201d S\u0103bor Petko Hristov, Ethnologia Balkanica, LIT Verlag, 2002, Issue No: 06, p 79: ''And here we completely agree to the conclusion of Milenko Filipovi\u0107 that the thesis regarding the slava, slu\u017eba or the krastno ime were a purely Serbian feature, was \u201c\u2026a delusion of the romantic and patriotic citizenry and those from among those circles that were writers\u201d, a delusion, of which \u2026je samo srpstvo imalo vi\u0161e \u0161tete, nego koristi\u201d [\u201cThe Serbian people have had more losses than benefits/advantages\u201d]. (Filipovi\u0107 M., 1985; 152). Although here and there in scholarly publications, and particularly in popular books, even in the formal publications of the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Church, some of these romantic delusions about the slava as a Serbian ethnic identification marker are repeated, the serious scholars giving interpretation to the slava M.Filipovi\u0107, V.\u010cajkanovi\u0107, P.Vlahovi\u0107, N.Panteli\u0107, S.Ze\u010devi\u0107, D.Bandi\u0107, point out mostly the agrarian and integrative functions of the set of rites and rituals, united under the name of slava, and its tie-up with the cult for the forefathers.''</ref>\n\n==Modern history==\nThe increased effective geographic mobility brought about by the post World War II urbanization of a previously highly agrarian society, combined with the suppression of [[Serbian Orthodox]] traditions under the Communist rule, has made some aspects of the custom more relaxed. In particular, in the second half of the 20th century it became common to see traditional patriarchal families separated by great distances, so by necessity Slava came to occasionally be celebrated at more than one place by members of the same family.\n\nWhile the ''Slava'' kept something of a grassroots underground popularity during the Communist period, the post-Communist revival of Serbian Orthodox traditions has brought it a resurgence. It is recognized as a distinctly (if not quite exclusively) Serbian custom, and today it is quite common for nonobservant Christians or even atheists to celebrate it in one form or another, as a hereditary family holiday and a mark of ethnocultural identification.\n\nIn November 2014 it was inscribed in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].\n\nThe custom is also helpful in genealogical studies as an indicator in kinship relations between families, tracing one's family to a specific region, etc.\n\n==Celebration==\n [[File:\u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435, \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0435, 190.jpg|thumb|Breaking the ''kola\u010d'', illustration by [[Vladislav Titelbah|V. Titelbah]], 1877.]]\nThe ritual foods that are prepared for the feast are the ''[[:sr:slavski kola\u010d|slavski kola\u010d]]'' (or simply ''kola\u010d'') = a ritual bread, and ''[[koljivo]]'' (or ''\u017eito''), a dish of minced boiled wheat, sweetened and sometimes mixed with chopped walnuts. The top of the ''kola\u010d'' is adorned with the [[Christian cross]], the [[Peace_symbols#The_dove_and_olive_branch|peace dove]], and other symbols. The ''koljivo'' is a symbol of the [[Resurrection of Christ]] (cf. \"if the grain does not die...\" in the [[Gospel]]) and partaken in memory of the dead (deceased family members). \n\nThe rest of the feast consists of a meal, the contents of which depends on whether or not the celebration falls in a period of [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Fasting|fasting]]. During a fast (''posno''), the meal would not contain any meat other than fish or other seafood, and would be highly unlikely to contain eggs or dairy products. Outside of a fasting period, these restrictions would not apply (''mrsno''). Thus, colloquially, ''slavas'' can be referred to as ''posna'' or ''mrsna''. Appropriately-made sweets are consumed, as well.\n\nThe family attends church services and partakes in [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] on the feast day. Following the service, traditionally, the parish priest is received in the family's home or the family brings the ''slavski kola\u010d'' to the church. The parish priest performs a small service which entails venerating the patron saint's memory, blessing the ''kola\u010d'' and ''koljivo'', as well as lighting the \"''slava'' candle\". Though not necessary, it is common for the priest to bless the house and perform a small memorial service for dead relatives.\n\nThe most common [[feast day]]s are [[St. Nicholas]] (''Nikoljdan'', 19 December), [[St. George]] (''[[\u0110ur\u0111evdan]]'', 6 May), [[St. John the Baptist]] (''Jovanjdan'', 20 January), [[St. Demetrius]] (''Mitrovdan'', 8 November), [[St. Michael]] (''Aran\u0111elovdan'', 21 November) and [[St. Sava]] (''Savindan'', 27 January).

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

To send his father on a wild goose chase, he agreed to marry but then produced a perfect golden statue of a woman, and asked his father to find him a woman that matched the statue. Four copies of the image were taken throughout the country to find the right woman.<!--110--> A ''brahmin'' from Kapila{{refn |group=note |P\u0101li sources have [[Sagala|S\u0101gala]] instead, which is in present-day Pakistan.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures. She replied she also did not care for such matters, whereupon he revealed that he was her future husband.{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=111}} Both versions relate that the two agreed to marry and to live celibately, to the chagrin of Pippali's parents.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=111}}\n\nPippali is depicted in the P\u0101li version as very wealthy, using much perfume and possessing much land and chariots.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} Later, in the P\u0101li version, Pippali and Bhadra saw animals eating each other on the fertile fields as they were plowed by their workers.

In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family.

Harvey states that the story originated among the \"Chan literati\".}} Although the Flower Sermon's main point is to depict a wordless special transmission \"outside the teaching\", the tradition was defended and authorized through Buddhist scripture.{{sfn |Welter |2000 |p=97}}\n\nThe Flower Sermon event is regarded by modern scholars as an invention, but does provide insight into the philosophical concerns and identity of Chan Buddhism.<ref name=\"Herschock\" /> Since Chan Buddhism values the direct transmission from the teacher's mind to that of the student, more so than scriptures, the unbroken lineage of patriarchs is an important part of the tradition.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=fozu}} Moreover, whereas in many Buddhist traditions it was recounted that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa would pass on Gautama Buddha's robe to Maitreya Buddha, in Chan a different tradition developed, in which Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa passed on the robe to the next patriarch \u0100nanda, and so on through a list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs.<!--339--> Some Chan masters, such as [[D\u014dgen]] (1200\u20131253), did believe that this robe would eventually be passed forward to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and eventually Maitreya.<!--340-->{{sfn |Faure |1995 |pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nAs Japanese Buddhist texts saw the transmission of Gautama Buddha's robe as a symbol of birth and gestation, similarly, the flower in the Flower Sermon was seen as a symbol of death and cremation.{{sfn |Faure |1995 |p=361, note 119}} Besides the Flower Sermon, the appearance of the Buddha's feet when Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa pays his final respects, as well as the Buddha sharing his seat with Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa are also considered mind-to-mind transmissions.{{sfn |Do-Ryun |1964 |p=41}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Values ===\n[[File:Mahakasyapa, Kizil, Cave above the Largest Cave, c. 422-529 AD, wall painting - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01724.JPG|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa depicted with hair and beard.

Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum,<!--177-178--> with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand.<!--187--> This can be traced back to these two disciples.<!--178-->{{sfn |Tilakaratne |2003 |pp=177\u2013178, 187}} Specifically, the Therav\u0101da tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=17}} In some early Therav\u0101da texts about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism.

Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council.<!--20-21--> Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers.

In both the Nik\u0101ya and \u0100gama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sth\u0101viras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's legacy.<!--26--> This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mah\u0101n\u0101man (5th\u20136th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mah\u0101n\u0101man's lineage with that of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya.<!--26-29-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=26\u201329}} However, some P\u0101li sources indicate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was part of the lineage of the ''A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya'' [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|reciters]], which is another collection than the ''Sa\u1e43yutta''.{{sfn |Gethin |2008 |p=18}}\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s ({{lang-pi|Kassap\u012bya}}), was founded by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, according to scholars [[Paramartha|Param\u0101rtha]] (499\u2013569) and [[Kuiji]] (632\u2013682).

The club was founded in 1910. Its official colours are red and white, hence their nicknames ''Czerwona Armia'' (Red Army) and ''Czerwono-bia\u0142o-czerwoni'' (Red-white-reds).\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=June 2016}}\nThe club was founded in 1910 as ''Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w Rozwoju Fizycznego Widzew (Society of Physical Development Fans Widzew)''.\n\nAfter the first world war the club was reactivated in 1922 as ''Robotnicze Towarzystwo Sportowe Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Workers' Sports Association Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a).''\n\nWidzew has won four Polish league championships (in 1981, 1982, 1996 and 1997) and the 1985 [[Polish Cup]].\n\nThey have appeared in 117 matches in European Cups, of which they won 42. Widzew knocked European giants [[Manchester United]] out of the 1980\u201381 UEFA Cup, although their biggest achievement was reaching the semi-final of the [[1982\u201383 European Cup]], eliminating then 3 times winners Liverpool along the way.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:1. Stadion Widzewa w budowie.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Stadion Widzewa|New ground]]]]\nIn the beginning of season 2007/2008 Widzew was bought by one of the wealthiest men in Poland \u2013 [[Sylwester Cacek]].<ref>[http://www.widzewiak.pl/dorobek/historia Historia Widzewa]</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, while playing in the [[I liga (Poland)|Second League]], the [[Polish Football Association]] ruled that Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a should be relegated due to their involvement in a corruption scandal. However, Widzew became champions that year and were allowed to stay in the second division, which was renamed First League (I liga) before the start of the 2008\u201309 season. Despite the deduction of six points as a penalty, Widzew managed to become champions once again, and were finally promoted to the [[Ekstraklasa]]. In total, Widzew played 35 seasons at the highest level before being relegated in the [[2013\u201314 Ekstraklasa|2013\u201314 season]].\n\nDue to financial problems, Widzew finished last at the end of the [[2014\u201315 I Liga (Poland)|2014\u201315 I Liga season]]. Subsequently, the club ruled by Sylwester Cacek went bankrupt.\n\nIn consequence local businessmen led by [[Marcin Ferdzyn]] and [[Grzegorz Waranecki]] decided to take on amateur status as a new association called ''Stowarzyszenie Reaktywacja Tradycji Sportowych Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Association of the Reactivation of the Sports Traditions of Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a)'',<ref>[http://www.lodz.sport.pl/sport-lodz/1,117110,18288014,Jest_nowy_Widzew__Reaktywacja_Tradycji_Sportowych.html Jest nowy Widzew! Reaktywacja Tradycji Sportowych Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ]</ref> which continues the tradition of the old RTS Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The new association was registered in a Polish court on 2.07.2015, and within a few weeks of summer 2015 they managed to find new coach [[Witold Obarek]] and collect a new squad, which started the 2015/2016 season in the [[IV liga (Poland)|fifth tier of Polish football]]. In first season in IV League Widzew has promoted to higher tier. In season 2016/17 Widzew achieved third place in III League, after [[Drw\u0119ca Nowe Miasto Lubawskie]] and [[\u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] but next season yielded promotion to II League. Now, on the halfway point of season 2018/19 Widzew is leader with 37 points in 17 matches.\n\n==Achievements==\n\n===Domestic===\n[[File:Stadion Widzewa Lodz - Polska.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ultras]] of Widzew]]\n[[File:RTS Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a -

The club was founded in 1910. Its official colours are red and white, hence their nicknames ''Czerwona Armia'' (Red Army) and ''Czerwono-bia\u0142o-czerwoni'' (Red-white-reds).\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=June 2016}}\nThe club was founded in 1910 as ''Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w Rozwoju Fizycznego Widzew (Society of Physical Development Fans Widzew)''.\n\nAfter the first world war the club was reactivated in 1922 as ''Robotnicze Towarzystwo Sportowe Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Workers' Sports Association Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a).''\n\nWidzew has won four Polish league championships (in 1981, 1982, 1996 and 1997) and the 1985 [[Polish Cup]].\n\nThey have appeared in 117 matches in European Cups, of which they won 42. Widzew knocked European giants [[Manchester United]] out of the 1980\u201381 UEFA Cup, although their biggest achievement was reaching the semi-final of the [[1982\u201383 European Cup]], eliminating then 3 times winners Liverpool along the way.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:1. Stadion Widzewa w budowie.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Stadion Widzewa|New ground]]]]\nIn the beginning of season 2007/2008 Widzew was bought by one of the wealthiest men in Poland \u2013 [[Sylwester Cacek]].<ref>[http://www.widzewiak.pl/dorobek/historia Historia Widzewa]</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, while playing in the [[I liga (Poland)|Second League]], the [[Polish Football Association]] ruled that Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a should be relegated due to their involvement in a corruption scandal. However, Widzew became champions that year and were allowed to stay in the second division, which was renamed First League (I liga) before the start of the 2008\u201309 season. Despite the deduction of six points as a penalty, Widzew managed to become champions once again, and were finally promoted to the [[Ekstraklasa]]. In total, Widzew played 35 seasons at the highest level before being relegated in the [[2013\u201314 Ekstraklasa|2013\u201314 season]].\n\nDue to financial problems, Widzew finished last at the end of the [[2014\u201315 I Liga (Poland)|2014\u201315 I Liga season]]. Subsequently, the club ruled by Sylwester Cacek went bankrupt.\n\nIn consequence local businessmen led by [[Marcin Ferdzyn]] and [[Grzegorz Waranecki]] decided to take on amateur status as a new association called ''Stowarzyszenie Reaktywacja Tradycji Sportowych Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Association of the Reactivation of the Sports Traditions of Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a)'',<ref>[http://www.lodz.sport.pl/sport-lodz/1,117110,18288014,Jest_nowy_Widzew__Reaktywacja_Tradycji_Sportowych.html Jest nowy Widzew! Reaktywacja Tradycji Sportowych Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ]</ref> which continues the tradition of the old RTS Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The new association was registered in a Polish court on 2.07.2015, and within a few weeks of summer 2015 they managed to find new coach [[Witold Obarek]] and collect a new squad, which started the 2015/2016 season in the [[IV liga (Poland)|fifth tier of Polish football]]. In first season in IV League Widzew has promoted to higher tier. In season 2016/17 Widzew achieved third place in III League, after [[Drw\u0119ca Nowe Miasto Lubawskie]] and [[\u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] but next season yielded promotion to II League. Now, on the halfway point of season 2018/19 Widzew is leader with 37 points in 17 matches.\n\n==Achievements==\n\n===Domestic===\n[[File:Stadion Widzewa Lodz - Polska.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ultras]] of Widzew]]\n[[File:RTS Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a -

The [[slope]] of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the marked point.]]\n{{Calculus |differential}}\n\nThe '''derivative''' of a [[function of a real variable]] measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of [[calculus]].  For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to [[time]] is the object's [[velocity]]: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the [[slope]] of the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point. The tangent line is the best [[linear approximation]] of the function near that input value.  For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n\nDerivatives may be generalized to [[function of several real variables|functions of several real variables]]. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a [[linear transformation]] whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The [[Jacobian matrix]] is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables.  It can be calculated in terms of the [[partial derivative]]s with respect to the independent variables.  For a [[real-valued function]] of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the [[gradient vector]].\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. The reverse process is called ''[[antiderivative|antidifferentiation]]''.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates antidifferentiation with [[integral|integration]]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.{{#tag:ref|Differential calculus, as discussed in this article, is a very well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources. See Apostol 1967, Apostol 1969, and Spivak 1994.|group=Note}}\n\n==Differentiation==\n''Differentiation'' is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} of a variable {{math|''x''}} is a measure of the rate at which the value {{math|''y''}} of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable {{math|''x''}}. It is called the ''derivative'' of {{math|''f''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}}. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[real number]]s, and if the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}} is plotted against {{math|''x''}}, the derivative is the [[slope]] of this graph at each point.\n\n[[File:Wiki slope in 2d.svg|right|thumb|250px|Slope of a linear function: <math>m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}</math>]]\nThe simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a [[constant function]], is when {{math|''y''}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''x''}}, meaning that the graph of {{math|''y''}} is a line. In this case, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, for real numbers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and the slope {{math|''m''}} is given by\n:<math>m=\\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x},</math>\nwhere the symbol {{math|\u0394}} ([[Delta (letter)|Delta]]) is an abbreviation for \"change in\", and  the combinations <math>\\Delta x</math> and <math>\\Delta y</math> refer to corresponding changes, i.e.: <math>\\Delta y = f(x + \\Delta x)- f(x)</math>. The above formula holds because\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ny + \\Delta y &= f\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right)\\\\\n  &= m\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right) +b =mx +m\\Delta x +b \\\\\n  &= y + m\\Delta x.\n\\end{align} </math>\nThus\n:<math> \\Delta y=m\\Delta x. </math>\n\nThis gives the value for the slope of a line.\n\nIf the function {{math|''f''}} is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies over the considered range: differentiation is a method to find a unique value for this rate of change, not across a certain range <math>(\\Delta x),</math> but at any given value of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 250\n | header    = Rate of change as a limit value\n | image1    = Tangent-calculus.svg\n | caption1  = '''Figure 1'''.

Animated illustration: the tangent line (derivative) as the limit of secants\n }}\n\nThe idea, illustrated by Figures 1 to 3, is to compute the rate of change as the [[limit of a function|limit value]] of the [[difference quotient|ratio of the differences]] {{math|\u0394''y'' / \u0394''x''}} as {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes infinitely small.\n\n===Notation===\n{{main|Notation for differentiation}}\nTwo distinct notations are commonly used for the derivative, one deriving from [[Leibniz]] and the other from [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].\n\nIn [[Leibniz's notation]], an [[infinitesimal]] change in {{math|''x''}} is denoted by {{math|''dx''}}, and the derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} is written\n: <math> \\frac{dy}{dx} </math>\nsuggesting the ratio of two infinitesimal quantities.  (The above expression is read as \"the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x''\", \"''dy'' by ''dx''\", or \"''dy'' over ''dx''\". The oral form \"''dy'' ''dx''\" is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.)\n\nIn [[Lagrange's notation]], the derivative with respect to {{math|''x''}} of a function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is denoted {{math|''f'''(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime of ''x''\") or {{math|''f<sub>x</sub>''\u2032(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime ''x'' of ''x''\"), in case of ambiguity of the variable implied by the differentiation. Lagrange's notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].\n\n===Rigorous definition===\n[[File:Tangent animation.gif|thumb|250px|A secant approaches a tangent when <math>\\Delta x \\to 0</math>.]]\nThe most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define the derivative as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of difference quotients of real numbers.<ref>Spivak 1994, chapter 10.</ref>  This is the approach described below.\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a real valued function defined in an [[open neighborhood]] of a real number {{math|''a''}}.  In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} was the unique line through the point {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} that did ''not'' meet the graph of {{math|''f''}} [[transversality (mathematics)|transversally]], meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph.  The derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} at {{math|''a''}} is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and a nearby point on the graph, for example {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  These lines are called [[secant line]]s.  A value of {{math|''h''}} close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in [[absolute value]]) of {{math|''h''}} will, in general, give better [[approximation]]s.  The slope {{math|''m''}} of the secant line is the difference between the {{math|''y''}} values of these points divided by the difference between the {{math|''x''}} values, that is, \n:<math>m = \\frac{\\Delta f(a)}{\\Delta a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h)-(a)} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]].  Passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a [[limit of a function|limit]].  Geometrically, the limit of the secant lines is the tangent line.  Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero, if it exists, should represent the slope of the tangent line to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  This limit is defined to be the derivative of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}:\n\n:<math>f'(a)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nWhen the limit exists, {{math|''f''}} is said to be ''[[differentiable function|differentiable]]'' at {{math|''a''}}.  Here {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is one of several common notations for the derivative ([[Derivative#Notations for differentiation|see below]]). From this definition it is obvious that a differentiable function  {{Math|''f''}} is [[increasing]] if and only if its derivative is positive, and is decreasing [[If and only if|iff]] its derivative is negative. This fact is used extensively when analyzing function behavior, e.g. when finding [[Maxima and minima|local extrema]].\n\nEquivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - (f(a) + f'(a)\\cdot h)}{h} = 0,</math>\nwhich has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} gives the ''best [[linear]] approximation''\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h</math>\nto {{math|''f''}} near {{math|''a''}} (i.e., for small {{math|''h''}}). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ([[Derivative#Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix|see below]]).\n\n[[Substitution property of equality|Substituting]] 0 for {{math|''h''}} in the difference quotient causes [[division by zero]], so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method.  Instead, define {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to be the difference quotient as a function of {{math|''h''}}:\n\n:<math>Q(h) = \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\n{{math|''Q''(''h'')}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is a [[continuous function]], meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then {{math|''Q''}} is a continuous function away from {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  If the limit {{math|lim{{sub|''h''\u21920}}''Q''(''h'')}} exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for {{math|''Q''(0)}} that makes {{math|''Q''}} a continuous function, then the function {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at {{math|''a''}}, and its derivative at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''Q''(0)}}.\n\nIn practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}} is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel {{math|''h''}} in the denominator. Such manipulations can make the limit value of {{math|''Q''}} for small {{math|''h''}} clear even though {{math|''Q''}} is still not defined at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}. This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process.\n\n===Definition over the hyperreals===\nRelative to a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension {{math|'''R''' \u2282 <sup>\u2217</sup>'''R'''}} of the real numbers, the derivative of a real function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} at a real point {{math|''x''}} can be defined as the [[shadow (mathematics)|shadow]] of the quotient {{math|{{sfrac|\u2206''y''|\u2206''x''}}}} for [[infinitesimal]] {{math|\u2206''x''}}, where {{math|\u2206''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'' + \u2206''x'') \u2212 ''f''(''x'')}}. Here the natural extension of {{math|''f''}} to the hyperreals is still denoted {{math|''f''}}. Here the derivative is said to exist if the shadow is independent of the infinitesimal chosen.\n\n===Example===\n[[File:Parabola2.svg|thumb|The square function]]\nThe square function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}, and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero of the difference quotient of {{math|''f''(3)}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf'(3) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(3+h)-f(3)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(3+h)^2 - 3^2}{h} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{6h + h^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe last expression shows that the difference quotient equals {{math|6 + ''h''}} when {{math|''h'' \u2260 0}} and is undefined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}, because of the definition of the difference quotient.  However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  The limit is the result of letting {{math|''h''}} go to zero, meaning it is the value that {{math|6 + ''h''}} tends to as {{math|''h''}} becomes very small:\n\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)} = 6 + 0 = 6. </math>\n\nHence the slope of the graph of the square function at the point {{math|(3, 9)}} is {{math|6}}, and so its derivative at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(3) {{=}} 6}}.\n\nMore generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the square function at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'') {{=}} 2''a''}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf'(a) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(a+h)^2 - a^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^2 + 2ah + h^2 - a^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{2ah + h^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(2a + h)} = 2a\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Continuity and differentiability===\n\n[[File:Right-continuous.svg|thumb|right|This function does not have a derivative at the marked point, as the function is not continuous there (specifically, it has a [[jump discontinuity]]).]]\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at {{math|''a''}}, then {{math|''f''}} must also be [[continuous function|continuous]] at {{math|''a''}}.  As an example, choose a point {{math|''a''}} and let {{math|''f''}} be the [[step function]] that returns the value 1 for all {{math|''x''}} less than {{math|''a''}}, and returns a different value 10 for all {{math|''x''}} greater than or equal to {{math|''a''}}.  {{math|''f''}} cannot have a derivative at {{math|''a''}}.  If {{math|''h''}} is negative, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is very steep, and as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero the slope tends to infinity.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} has slope zero.  Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.{{#tag:ref|Despite this, it is still possible to take the derivative in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].  The result is nine times the [[Dirac measure]] centered at {{math|''a''}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}|group=Note}}\n\n[[File:Absolute value.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value function is continuous, but fails to be differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left as they do from the right.]]\n\nHowever, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there.  For example, the [[absolute value]] function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{abs|''x''}} }} is continuous at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, but it is not differentiable there.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is one, whereas if {{math|''h''}} is negative, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is negative one.  This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.  Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its [[Vertical tangent|tangent is vertical]]: For instance, the function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>1/3</sup>}} is not differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nIn summary, a function that has a derivative is continuous, but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative.\n\nMost functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] point.  Early in the [[history of calculus]], many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points.  Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a [[monotone function]] or a [[Lipschitz function]], this is true.  However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  This example is now known as the [[Weierstrass function]].  In 1931, [[Stefan Banach]] proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a [[meager set]] in the space of all continuous functions.<ref>{{Citation|author=Banach, S.|title=Uber die Baire'sche Kategorie gewisser Funktionenmengen|journal=Studia Math.|issue=3|year=1931|pages=174\u2013179|postscript=.|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:SkKdCEmUd6QJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,50&scillfp=3432975470163241186&oi=lle}}.

In this case, the derivative is equal to:<math>\\sin \\left(x^2\\right) + 2x^2 \\cos\\left(x^2\\right)</math>]]\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a function that has a derivative at every point in its [[domain of a function|domain]].  We can then define a function that maps every point <math>x</math> to the value of the derivative of <math>f</math> at <math>x</math>.  This function is written {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}} and is called the ''derivative function'' or the ''derivative of''  {{math|''f''}}.\n\nSometimes {{math|''f''}} has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain.  The function whose value at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} whenever {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of {{math|''f''}}.  It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nUsing this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions.  If we denote this operator by {{math|''D''}}, then {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is the function {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}}.  Since {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is a function, it can be evaluated at a point {{math|''a''}}.  By the definition of the derivative function, {{math|''D''(''f'')(''a'') {{=}} ''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}}.\n\nFor comparison, consider the doubling function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}; {{math|''f''}} is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 1 &{}\\mapsto 2,\\\\\n 2 &{}\\mapsto 4,\\\\\n 3 &{}\\mapsto 6.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe operator {{math|''D''}}, however, is not defined on individual numbers.  It is only defined on functions:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n D(x \\mapsto 1) &= (x \\mapsto 0),\\\\\n D(x \\mapsto x) &= (x \\mapsto 1),\\\\\n D\\left(x \\mapsto x^2\\right) &= (x \\mapsto 2\\cdot x).\n\\end{align}</math>\nBecause the output of {{math|''D''}} is a function, the output of {{math|''D''}} can be evaluated at a point.  For instance, when {{math|''D''}} is applied to the square function, {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|''D''}} outputs the doubling function {{math|''x'' \u21a6 2''x''}}, which we named {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. This output function can then be evaluated to get {{math|''f''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''f''(2) {{=}} 4}}, and so on.\n\n==={{anchor|order of derivation}} Higher derivatives===\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a differentiable function, and let {{math|''f'' \u2032}} be its derivative. The derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2032}} (if it has one) is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[second derivative]] of {{math|f}}''.  Similarly, the derivative of the second derivative, if it exists, is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[third derivative]] of {{math|f}}''. Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the {{math|''n''}}th derivative as the derivative of the {{math|(''n''-1)}}th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called ''higher-order derivatives''. The {{math|''n''}}th derivative is also called the '''derivative of order {{math|''n''}}'''.\n\nIf {{math|''x''(''t'')}} represents the position of an object at time {{math|''t''}}, then the higher-order derivatives of {{math|''x''}} have specific interpretations in [[physics]]. The first derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the object's [[velocity]]. The second derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[acceleration]]. The third derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jerk (physics)|jerk]]. And finally, the fourth derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jounce]].\n\nA function {{math|''f''}} need not have a derivative (for example, if it is not continuous).  Similarly, even if {{math|''f''}} does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative.  For example, let\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} +x^2, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -x^2, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\nCalculation shows that {{math|''f''}} is a differentiable function whose derivative at <math>x</math> is given by\n:<math>f'(x) = \\begin{cases} +2x, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -2x, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\n{{math|''f'''(''x'')}} is twice the absolute value function at <math>x</math>, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have a {{math|''k''}}th derivative for each non-negative integer {{math|''k''}} but not a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}th derivative.  A function that has {{math|''k''}} successive derivatives is called ''{{math|k}} times differentiable''.  If in addition the {{math|''k''}}th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of [[differentiability class]] {{math|''C<sup>k</sup>''}}.  (This is a stronger condition than having {{math|''k''}} derivatives, as shown by the second example of {{slink|Smoothness|Examples}}.)  A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called ''infinitely differentiable'' or ''[[smoothness|smooth]]''.\n\nOn the real line, every [[polynomial function]] is infinitely differentiable.  By standard [[differentiation rules]], if a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is differentiated {{math|''n''}} times, then it becomes a [[constant function]].  All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero.  In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions.\n\nThe derivatives of a function {{math|''f''}} at a point {{math|''x''}} provide polynomial approximations to that function near {{math|''x''}}. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is twice differentiable, then\n:<math> f(x+h) \\approx f(x) + f'(x)h + \\tfrac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2</math>\nin the sense that\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x) - f'(x)h - \\frac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2}{h^2}=0.</math>\nIf {{math|''f''}} is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the [[Taylor series]] for {{math|''f''}} evaluated at {{math|''x'' + ''h''}} around {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Inflection point===\n{{Main|Inflection point}}\n\nA point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an ''inflection point''.<ref>{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=\u00a74.18}}</ref> At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^3</math>, or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^\\frac{1}{3}</math>. At an inflection point, a function switches from being a [[convex function]] to being a [[concave function]] or vice versa.\n\n==Notation (details)==\n{{Main|Notation for differentiation}}\n\n===Leibniz's notation===\n{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}\n\nThe symbols <math>dx</math>, <math>dy</math>, and <math>\\frac{dy}{dx}</math> were introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675.<ref>Manuscript of November 11, 1675 (Cajori vol. 2, page 204)</ref> It is still commonly used when the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} is viewed as a functional relationship between [[dependent and independent variables]]. Then the first derivative is denoted by\n\n: <math>\\frac{dy}{dx},\\quad\\frac{d f}{dx}, \\text{  or  }\\frac{d}{dx}f,</math>\n\nand was once thought of as an [[infinitesimal]] quotient.  Higher derivatives are expressed using the notation\n\n<!-- In the following formula, the function is a lower-case f, not an upper case F.

These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator. For example,\n:<math>\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right).</math>\n\nWith Leibniz's notation, we can write the derivative of <math>y</math> at the point <math>x = a</math> in two different ways:\n\n: <math>\\left.\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right|_{x=a} = \\frac{dy}{dx}(a).</math>\n\nLeibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator), which is relevant in [[partial derivative|partial differentiation]].  It also makes the [[chain rule]] easier to remember:{{#tag:ref|In the formulation of calculus in terms of limits, the ''du'' symbol has been assigned various meanings by various authors.

In practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using ''rules'' for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.\n\n===Rules for basic functions===\nMost derivative computations eventually require taking the derivative of some common functions.

The known derivatives of the elementary functions ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ''x''<sup>4</sup>, sin(''x''), ln(''x'') and {{nowrap|1=exp(''x'') = ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}, as well as the constant 7, were also used.\n\n==In higher dimensions==\n{{See also|Vector calculus|Multivariable calculus}}\n\n===Vector-valued functions===\nA [[vector-valued function]] '''y''' of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some [[vector space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions ''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ''y''<sub>2</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''), meaning that {{nowrap|1='''y'''(''t'') = (''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''))}}.  This includes, for example, [[parametric curve]]s in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  The coordinate functions are real valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them.  The derivative of '''y'''(''t'') is defined to be the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], called the [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]], whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions.  That is,\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t) = (y'_1(t), \\ldots, y'_n(t)).</math>\n\nEquivalently,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\mathbf{y}(t+h) - \\mathbf{y}(t)}{h},</math>\n\nif the limit exists.  The subtraction in the numerator is the subtraction of vectors, not scalars.  If the derivative of '''y''' exists for every value of ''t'', then '''y'''\u2032 is another vector-valued function.\n\nIf '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> is the standard basis for '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then '''y'''(''t'') can also be written as {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>1</sub> + \u2026 + ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the [[linearity of differentiation|linearity]] property, then the derivative of '''y'''(''t'') must be\n:<math>y'_1(t)\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cdots + y'_n(t)\\mathbf{e}_n</math>\nbecause each of the basis vectors is a constant.\n\nThis generalization is useful, for example, if '''y'''(''t'') is the position vector of a particle at time ''t''; then the derivative '''y'''&prime;(''t'') is the [[velocity]] vector of the particle at time ''t''.\n\n===Partial derivatives===\n{{Main|Partial derivative}}\n\nSuppose that ''f'' is a function that depends on more than one variable\u2014for instance,\n:<math>f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\n''f'' can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:\n:<math>f(x,y) = f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nIn other words, every value of ''x'' chooses a function, denoted ''f<sub>x</sub>'', which is a function of one real number.{{#tag:ref|This can also be expressed as the operation known as [[currying]].|group=Note}} That is,\n:<math>x \\mapsto f_x,</math>\n:<math>f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nOnce a value of ''x'' is chosen, say ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} determines a function ''f<sub>a</sub>'' that sends ''y'' to {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ay + ''y''<sup>2</sup>}}:\n:<math>f_a(y) = a^2 + ay + y^2.</math>\nIn this expression, ''a'' is a ''constant'', not a ''variable'', so ''f<sub>a</sub>'' is a function of only one real variable.  Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:\n:<math>f_a'(y) = a + 2y.</math>\nThe above procedure can be performed for any choice of ''a''.  Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of ''f'' in the ''y'' direction:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) = x + 2y.</math>\nThis is the partial derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''y''.  Here [[\u2202]] is a rounded ''d'' called the '''partial derivative symbol'''.  To distinguish it from the letter ''d'', \u2202 is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\".\n\nIn general, the '''partial derivative''' of a function {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in the direction ''x<sub>i</sub>'' at the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is defined to be:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n) = \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i+h,\\ldots,a_n) - f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i,\\ldots,a_n)}{h}.</math>\nIn the above difference quotient, all the variables except ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are held fixed.  That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable\n:<math>f_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}(x_i) = f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n),</math>\nand, by definition,\n:<math>\\frac{df_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}}{dx_i}(a_i) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n).</math>\nIn other words, the different choices of ''a'' index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above.  This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives.\n\nAn important example of a function of several variables is the case of a [[scalar-valued function]] {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} on a domain in Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> (e.g., on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>). In this case ''f'' has a partial derivative \u2202''f''/\u2202''x''<sub>''j''</sub> with respect to each variable ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. At the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>), these partial derivatives define the vector\n:<math>\\nabla f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n), \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)\\right).</math>\nThis vector is called the '''[[gradient]]''' of ''f'' at ''a''.  If ''f'' is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function \u2207''f'' that takes the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) to the vector \u2207''f''(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>).  Consequently, the gradient determines a [[vector field]].\n\n===Directional derivatives===\n{{Main|Directional derivative}}\n\nIf ''f'' is a real-valued function on '''R'''<sup>n</sup>, then the partial derivatives of ''f'' measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes.  For example, if ''f'' is a function of ''x'' and ''y'', then its partial derivatives measure the variation in ''f'' in the ''x'' direction and the ''y'' direction.  They do not, however, directly measure the variation of ''f'' in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}.  These are measured using directional derivatives.  Choose a vector\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1,\\ldots,v_n).</math>\nThe '''directional derivative''' of ''f'' in the direction of '''v''' at the point '''x''' is the limit\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}{\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{h}}.</math>\nIn some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector.  Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector.  To see how this works, suppose that {{nowrap|1='''v''' = ''\u03bb'''''u'''}}.  Substitute {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''k''/''\u03bb''}} into the difference quotient.  The difference quotient becomes:\n:<math>\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + (k/\\lambda)(\\lambda\\mathbf{u})) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k/\\lambda}\n= \\lambda\\cdot\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + k\\mathbf{u}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k}.</math>\nThis is ''\u03bb'' times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of ''f'' with respect to '''u'''. Furthermore, taking the limit as ''h'' tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as ''k'' tends to zero because ''h'' and ''k'' are multiples of each other.  Therefore, {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') = \u03bb''D''<sub>'''u'''</sub>(''f'')}}.  Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors.\n\nIf all the partial derivatives of ''f'' exist and are continuous at '''x''', then they determine the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v''' by the formula:\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^n v_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\nThis is a consequence of the definition of the [[total derivative]].  It follows that the directional derivative is [[linear map|linear]] in '''v''', meaning that {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v''' + '''w'''</sub>(''f'') = ''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') + ''D''<sub>'''w'''</sub>(''f'')}}.\n\nThe same definition also works when ''f'' is a function with values in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors.  In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.\n\n===Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix===\n{{Main|Total derivative}}\n\nWhen ''f'' is a function from an open subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, then the directional derivative of ''f'' in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at that point and in that direction.  But when {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}}, no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of ''f''. The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once.  That is, for any vector '''v''' starting at '''a''', the linear approximation formula holds:\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nJust like the single-variable derivative, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;&prime;('''a''')}} is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible.\n\nIf ''n'' and ''m'' are both one, then the derivative {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} is a number and the expression {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''v''}} is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} to be a number. If it were a number, then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} would be a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> while the other terms would be vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a function that sends vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} must denote this function evaluated at '''v'''.\n\nTo determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a}) \\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nNotice that if we choose another vector '''w''', then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting '''w''' for '''v'''. It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both '''w''' for '''v''' and {{nowrap|'''a''' + '''v'''}} for '''a'''. By subtracting these two new equations, we get\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a})\n\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{w} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.</math>\nIf we assume that '''v''' is small and that the derivative varies continuously in '''a''', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''' + '''v''')}} is approximately equal to {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}}, and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with {{nowrap|'''v''' + '''w'''}} substituted for '''v'''. The linear approximation formula implies:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0\n&\\approx f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a}) \\\\\n&= (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) \\\\\n&\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis suggests that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a [[linear transformation]] from the vector space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to the vector space '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations.  Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||'''v'''||, where the constant is independent of '''v''' but depends continuously on '''a'''. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities.  In particular, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a linear transformation up to a small error term.  In the limit as '''v''' and '''w''' tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as '''v''' goes to zero, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a linear transformation.\n\nIn one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients.  However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> while the denominator lies in the domain '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator.  To make precise the idea that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of ''f'' at ''a'' is the unique number {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)}{h} = 0.</math>\nThis is equivalent to\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)|}{|h|} = 0</math>\nbecause the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero.  This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s.\n\nThe definition of the '''total derivative''' of ''f'' at '''a''', therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''') : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{\\mathbf{h}\\to 0} \\frac{\\lVert f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{h}) - (f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{h})\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathbf{h}\\rVert} = 0.</math>\nHere '''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  However, ''f''\u2032('''a''')'''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.  If ''v'' is a vector starting at ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of '''v''' by ''f'' and is sometimes written {{nowrap|''f''<sub>\u2217</sub>'''v'''}}.\n\nIf the total derivative exists at '''a''', then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of ''f'' exist at '''a''', and for all '''v''', {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v'''.  If we write ''f'' using coordinate functions, so that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = (''f''<sub>1</sub>, ''f''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''m''</sub>)}}, then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  This matrix is called the '''[[Jacobian matrix]]''' of ''f'' at '''a''':\n\n:<math>f'(\\mathbf{a}) = \\operatorname{Jac}_{\\mathbf{a}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}\\right)_{ij}.</math>\n\nThe existence of the total derivative ''f''\u2032('''a''') is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on '''a'''.\n\nThe definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable.  That is, if ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists.  The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1\u00d71 matrix whose only entry is the derivative ''f''&prime;(''x'').  This 1\u00d71 matrix satisfies the property that {{nowrap|''f''(''a'' + ''h'') \u2212 (''f''(''a'') + ''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''h'')}} is approximately zero, in other words that\n\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h.</math>\n\nUp to changing variables, this is the statement that the function <math>x \\mapsto f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</math> is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at ''a''.\n\nThe total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case.  This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function.  Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the [[tangent bundle]] of the source to the tangent bundle of the target.\n\nThe natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a [[jet (mathematics)|jet]], cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors.  It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the [[jet bundle]].  The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the ''k''th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to ''k''.\n\nBy repeatedly taking the total derivative, one obtains higher versions of the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]], specialized to '''R'''<sup>''p''</sup>. The ''k''th order total derivative may be interpreted as a map\n:<math>D^k f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to L^k(\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbb{R}^m)</math>\nwhich takes a point '''x''' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and assigns to it an element of the space of ''k''-linear maps from '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> \u2013 the \"best\" (in a certain precise sense) ''k''-linear approximation to ''f'' at that point. By precomposing it with the [[Diagonal functor|diagonal map]] \u0394, {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2192 ('''x''', '''x''')}}, a generalized Taylor series may be begun as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n f(\\mathbf{x}) & \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x-a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\Delta(\\mathbf{x-a})) + \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x - a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\mathbf{x - a}, \\mathbf{x - a})+ \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + \\sum_i (D f)_i (x_i-a_i) + \\sum_{j, k} \\left(D^2 f\\right)_{j k} (x_j-a_j) (x_k-a_k) + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere f('''a''') is identified with a constant function, {{nowrap|''x''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are the components of the vector {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2212 '''a'''}}, and {{nowrap|(''Df'')<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{nowrap|(''D''<sup>2</sup>''f'')<sub>''jk''</sub>}} are the components of {{nowrap|''Df''}} and {{nowrap|''D''<sup>2</sup>''f''}} as linear transformations.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Main|Derivative (generalizations)}}\n\nThe concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a [[linear approximation]] of the function at that point.\n* An important generalization of the derivative concerns [[complex function]]s of [[Complex number|complex variable]]s, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers '''C''' to '''C'''. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If '''C''' is identified with '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by writing a complex number ''z'' as {{nowrap|''x'' + ''iy''}}, then a differentiable function from '''C''' to '''C''' is certainly differentiable as a function from '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to '''R'''<sup>2</sup> (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is ''complex linear'' and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]] \u2013 see [[holomorphic function]]s.\n* Another generalization concerns functions between [[smooth manifold|differentiable or smooth manifolds]]. Intuitively speaking such a manifold ''M'' is a space that can be approximated near each point ''x'' by a vector space called its [[tangent space]]: the prototypical example is a [[smooth surface]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map {{nowrap|''f'': ''M'' \u2192 ''N''}} between manifolds, at a point ''x'' in ''M'', is then a [[linear map]] from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the tangent space of ''N'' at ''f''(''x''). The derivative function becomes a map between the [[tangent bundle]]s of ''M'' and ''N''. This definition is fundamental in [[differential geometry]] and has many uses \u2013 see [[pushforward (differential)]] and [[pullback (differential geometry)]].\n* Differentiation can also be defined for maps between [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensional]] [[vector space]]s such as [[Banach space]]s and [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s.  There is a generalization both of the directional derivative, called the [[Gateaux derivative]], and of the differential, called the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]].\n* One deficiency of the classical derivative is that very many functions are not differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the [[weak derivative]]. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] and only require that a function is differentiable \"on average\".\n* The properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology \u2014 see, for example, [[differential algebra]].\n* The discrete equivalent of differentiation is [[finite difference]]s. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in [[time scale calculus]].\n* Also see [[arithmetic derivative]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of calculus}}\n[[Calculus]], known in its early history as ''infinitesimal calculus'', is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline focused on [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], derivatives, [[integral]]s, and [[infinite series]]. [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] independently discovered calculus in the mid-17th century. However, each inventor claimed the other stole his work in a [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy|bitter dispute]] that continued until the end of their lives.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Differential calculus#Applications of derivatives|Applications of derivatives]]\n* [[Automatic differentiation]]\n* [[Differentiability class]]\n* [[Differentiation rules]]\n* [[Differintegral]]\n* [[Fractal derivative]]\n* [[Generalizations of the derivative]]\n* [[Hasse derivative]]\n* [[History of calculus]]\n* [[Integral]]\n* [[Infinitesimal]]\n* [[Linearization]]\n* [[Mathematical analysis]]\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]\n* [[Numerical differentiation]]\n* [[Rate (mathematics)]]\n* [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem]]\n* [[Symmetric derivative]]\n* [[Schwarzian derivative]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Print===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Anton\n | first = Howard\n | last2 = Bivens\n | first2 = Irl\n | last3 = Davis\n | first3 = Stephen\n | date = February 2, 2005\n | title = Calculus: Early Transcendentals Single and Multivariable\n | place = New York\n | publisher = Wiley\n | edition = 8th\n | isbn  = 978-0-471-47244-5\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Apostol\n | first = Tom M.\n | author-link = Tom M.

The [[slope]] of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the marked point.]]\n{{Calculus |differential}}\n\nThe '''derivative''' of a [[function of a real variable]] measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of [[calculus]].  For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to [[time]] is the object's [[velocity]]: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the [[slope]] of the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point. The tangent line is the best [[linear approximation]] of the function near that input value.  For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n\nDerivatives may be generalized to [[function of several real variables|functions of several real variables]]. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a [[linear transformation]] whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The [[Jacobian matrix]] is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables.  It can be calculated in terms of the [[partial derivative]]s with respect to the independent variables.  For a [[real-valued function]] of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the [[gradient vector]].\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. The reverse process is called ''[[antiderivative|antidifferentiation]]''.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates antidifferentiation with [[integral|integration]]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.{{#tag:ref|Differential calculus, as discussed in this article, is a very well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources. See Apostol 1967, Apostol 1969, and Spivak 1994.|group=Note}}\n\n==Differentiation==\n''Differentiation'' is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} of a variable {{math|''x''}} is a measure of the rate at which the value {{math|''y''}} of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable {{math|''x''}}. It is called the ''derivative'' of {{math|''f''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}}. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[real number]]s, and if the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}} is plotted against {{math|''x''}}, the derivative is the [[slope]] of this graph at each point.\n\n[[File:Wiki slope in 2d.svg|right|thumb|250px|Slope of a linear function: <math>m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}</math>]]\nThe simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a [[constant function]], is when {{math|''y''}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''x''}}, meaning that the graph of {{math|''y''}} is a line. In this case, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, for real numbers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and the slope {{math|''m''}} is given by\n:<math>m=\\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x},</math>\nwhere the symbol {{math|\u0394}} ([[Delta (letter)|Delta]]) is an abbreviation for \"change in\", and  the combinations <math>\\Delta x</math> and <math>\\Delta y</math> refer to corresponding changes, i.e.: <math>\\Delta y = f(x + \\Delta x)- f(x)</math>. The above formula holds because\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ny + \\Delta y &= f\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right)\\\\\n  &= m\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right) +b =mx +m\\Delta x +b \\\\\n  &= y + m\\Delta x.\n\\end{align} </math>\nThus\n:<math> \\Delta y=m\\Delta x. </math>\n\nThis gives the value for the slope of a line.\n\nIf the function {{math|''f''}} is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies over the considered range: differentiation is a method to find a unique value for this rate of change, not across a certain range <math>(\\Delta x),</math> but at any given value of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 250\n | header    = Rate of change as a limit value\n | image1    = Tangent-calculus.svg\n | caption1  = '''Figure 1'''.

Animated illustration: the tangent line (derivative) as the limit of secants\n }}\n\nThe idea, illustrated by Figures 1 to 3, is to compute the rate of change as the [[limit of a function|limit value]] of the [[difference quotient|ratio of the differences]] {{math|\u0394''y'' / \u0394''x''}} as {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes infinitely small.\n\n===Notation===\n{{main|Notation for differentiation}}\nTwo distinct notations are commonly used for the derivative, one deriving from [[Leibniz]] and the other from [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].\n\nIn [[Leibniz's notation]], an [[infinitesimal]] change in {{math|''x''}} is denoted by {{math|''dx''}}, and the derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} is written\n: <math> \\frac{dy}{dx} </math>\nsuggesting the ratio of two infinitesimal quantities.  (The above expression is read as \"the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x''\", \"''dy'' by ''dx''\", or \"''dy'' over ''dx''\". The oral form \"''dy'' ''dx''\" is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.)\n\nIn [[Lagrange's notation]], the derivative with respect to {{math|''x''}} of a function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is denoted {{math|''f'''(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime of ''x''\") or {{math|''f<sub>x</sub>''\u2032(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime ''x'' of ''x''\"), in case of ambiguity of the variable implied by the differentiation. Lagrange's notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].\n\n===Rigorous definition===\n[[File:Tangent animation.gif|thumb|250px|A secant approaches a tangent when <math>\\Delta x \\to 0</math>.]]\nThe most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define the derivative as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of difference quotients of real numbers.<ref>Spivak 1994, chapter 10.</ref>  This is the approach described below.\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a real valued function defined in an [[open neighborhood]] of a real number {{math|''a''}}.  In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} was the unique line through the point {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} that did ''not'' meet the graph of {{math|''f''}} [[transversality (mathematics)|transversally]], meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph.  The derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} at {{math|''a''}} is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and a nearby point on the graph, for example {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  These lines are called [[secant line]]s.  A value of {{math|''h''}} close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in [[absolute value]]) of {{math|''h''}} will, in general, give better [[approximation]]s.  The slope {{math|''m''}} of the secant line is the difference between the {{math|''y''}} values of these points divided by the difference between the {{math|''x''}} values, that is, \n:<math>m = \\frac{\\Delta f(a)}{\\Delta a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h)-(a)} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]].  Passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a [[limit of a function|limit]].  Geometrically, the limit of the secant lines is the tangent line.  Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero, if it exists, should represent the slope of the tangent line to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  This limit is defined to be the derivative of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}:\n\n:<math>f'(a)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nWhen the limit exists, {{math|''f''}} is said to be ''[[differentiable function|differentiable]]'' at {{math|''a''}}.  Here {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is one of several common notations for the derivative ([[Derivative#Notations for differentiation|see below]]). From this definition it is obvious that a differentiable function  {{Math|''f''}} is [[increasing]] if and only if its derivative is positive, and is decreasing [[If and only if|iff]] its derivative is negative. This fact is used extensively when analyzing function behavior, e.g. when finding [[Maxima and minima|local extrema]].\n\nEquivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - (f(a) + f'(a)\\cdot h)}{h} = 0,</math>\nwhich has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} gives the ''best [[linear]] approximation''\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h</math>\nto {{math|''f''}} near {{math|''a''}} (i.e., for small {{math|''h''}}). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ([[Derivative#Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix|see below]]).\n\n[[Substitution property of equality|Substituting]] 0 for {{math|''h''}} in the difference quotient causes [[division by zero]], so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method.  Instead, define {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to be the difference quotient as a function of {{math|''h''}}:\n\n:<math>Q(h) = \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\n{{math|''Q''(''h'')}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is a [[continuous function]], meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then {{math|''Q''}} is a continuous function away from {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  If the limit {{math|lim{{sub|''h''\u21920}}''Q''(''h'')}} exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for {{math|''Q''(0)}} that makes {{math|''Q''}} a continuous function, then the function {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at {{math|''a''}}, and its derivative at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''Q''(0)}}.\n\nIn practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}} is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel {{math|''h''}} in the denominator. Such manipulations can make the limit value of {{math|''Q''}} for small {{math|''h''}} clear even though {{math|''Q''}} is still not defined at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}. This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process.\n\n===Definition over the hyperreals===\nRelative to a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension {{math|'''R''' \u2282 <sup>\u2217</sup>'''R'''}} of the real numbers, the derivative of a real function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} at a real point {{math|''x''}} can be defined as the [[shadow (mathematics)|shadow]] of the quotient {{math|{{sfrac|\u2206''y''|\u2206''x''}}}} for [[infinitesimal]] {{math|\u2206''x''}}, where {{math|\u2206''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'' + \u2206''x'') \u2212 ''f''(''x'')}}. Here the natural extension of {{math|''f''}} to the hyperreals is still denoted {{math|''f''}}. Here the derivative is said to exist if the shadow is independent of the infinitesimal chosen.\n\n===Example===\n[[File:Parabola2.svg|thumb|The square function]]\nThe square function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}, and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero of the difference quotient of {{math|''f''(3)}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf'(3) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(3+h)-f(3)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(3+h)^2 - 3^2}{h} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{6h + h^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe last expression shows that the difference quotient equals {{math|6 + ''h''}} when {{math|''h'' \u2260 0}} and is undefined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}, because of the definition of the difference quotient.  However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  The limit is the result of letting {{math|''h''}} go to zero, meaning it is the value that {{math|6 + ''h''}} tends to as {{math|''h''}} becomes very small:\n\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)} = 6 + 0 = 6. </math>\n\nHence the slope of the graph of the square function at the point {{math|(3, 9)}} is {{math|6}}, and so its derivative at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(3) {{=}} 6}}.\n\nMore generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the square function at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'') {{=}} 2''a''}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf'(a) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(a+h)^2 - a^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^2 + 2ah + h^2 - a^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{2ah + h^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(2a + h)} = 2a\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Continuity and differentiability===\n\n[[File:Right-continuous.svg|thumb|right|This function does not have a derivative at the marked point, as the function is not continuous there (specifically, it has a [[jump discontinuity]]).]]\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at {{math|''a''}}, then {{math|''f''}} must also be [[continuous function|continuous]] at {{math|''a''}}.  As an example, choose a point {{math|''a''}} and let {{math|''f''}} be the [[step function]] that returns the value 1 for all {{math|''x''}} less than {{math|''a''}}, and returns a different value 10 for all {{math|''x''}} greater than or equal to {{math|''a''}}.  {{math|''f''}} cannot have a derivative at {{math|''a''}}.  If {{math|''h''}} is negative, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is very steep, and as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero the slope tends to infinity.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} has slope zero.  Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.{{#tag:ref|Despite this, it is still possible to take the derivative in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].  The result is nine times the [[Dirac measure]] centered at {{math|''a''}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}|group=Note}}\n\n[[File:Absolute value.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value function is continuous, but fails to be differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left as they do from the right.]]\n\nHowever, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there.  For example, the [[absolute value]] function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{abs|''x''}} }} is continuous at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, but it is not differentiable there.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is one, whereas if {{math|''h''}} is negative, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is negative one.  This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.  Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its [[Vertical tangent|tangent is vertical]]: For instance, the function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>1/3</sup>}} is not differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nIn summary, a function that has a derivative is continuous, but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative.\n\nMost functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] point.  Early in the [[history of calculus]], many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points.  Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a [[monotone function]] or a [[Lipschitz function]], this is true.  However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  This example is now known as the [[Weierstrass function]].  In 1931, [[Stefan Banach]] proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a [[meager set]] in the space of all continuous functions.<ref>{{Citation|author=Banach, S.|title=Uber die Baire'sche Kategorie gewisser Funktionenmengen|journal=Studia Math.|issue=3|year=1931|pages=174\u2013179|postscript=.|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:SkKdCEmUd6QJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,50&scillfp=3432975470163241186&oi=lle}}.

In this case, the derivative is equal to:<math>\\sin \\left(x^2\\right) + 2x^2 \\cos\\left(x^2\\right)</math>]]\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a function that has a derivative at every point in its [[domain of a function|domain]].  We can then define a function that maps every point <math>x</math> to the value of the derivative of <math>f</math> at <math>x</math>.  This function is written {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}} and is called the ''derivative function'' or the ''derivative of''  {{math|''f''}}.\n\nSometimes {{math|''f''}} has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain.  The function whose value at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} whenever {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of {{math|''f''}}.  It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nUsing this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions.  If we denote this operator by {{math|''D''}}, then {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is the function {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}}.  Since {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is a function, it can be evaluated at a point {{math|''a''}}.  By the definition of the derivative function, {{math|''D''(''f'')(''a'') {{=}} ''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}}.\n\nFor comparison, consider the doubling function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}; {{math|''f''}} is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 1 &{}\\mapsto 2,\\\\\n 2 &{}\\mapsto 4,\\\\\n 3 &{}\\mapsto 6.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe operator {{math|''D''}}, however, is not defined on individual numbers.  It is only defined on functions:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n D(x \\mapsto 1) &= (x \\mapsto 0),\\\\\n D(x \\mapsto x) &= (x \\mapsto 1),\\\\\n D\\left(x \\mapsto x^2\\right) &= (x \\mapsto 2\\cdot x).\n\\end{align}</math>\nBecause the output of {{math|''D''}} is a function, the output of {{math|''D''}} can be evaluated at a point.  For instance, when {{math|''D''}} is applied to the square function, {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|''D''}} outputs the doubling function {{math|''x'' \u21a6 2''x''}}, which we named {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. This output function can then be evaluated to get {{math|''f''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''f''(2) {{=}} 4}}, and so on.\n\n==={{anchor|order of derivation}} Higher derivatives===\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a differentiable function, and let {{math|''f'' \u2032}} be its derivative. The derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2032}} (if it has one) is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[second derivative]] of {{math|f}}''.  Similarly, the derivative of the second derivative, if it exists, is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[third derivative]] of {{math|f}}''. Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the {{math|''n''}}th derivative as the derivative of the {{math|(''n''-1)}}th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called ''higher-order derivatives''. The {{math|''n''}}th derivative is also called the '''derivative of order {{math|''n''}}'''.\n\nIf {{math|''x''(''t'')}} represents the position of an object at time {{math|''t''}}, then the higher-order derivatives of {{math|''x''}} have specific interpretations in [[physics]]. The first derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the object's [[velocity]]. The second derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[acceleration]]. The third derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jerk (physics)|jerk]]. And finally, the fourth derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jounce]].\n\nA function {{math|''f''}} need not have a derivative (for example, if it is not continuous).  Similarly, even if {{math|''f''}} does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative.  For example, let\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} +x^2, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -x^2, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\nCalculation shows that {{math|''f''}} is a differentiable function whose derivative at <math>x</math> is given by\n:<math>f'(x) = \\begin{cases} +2x, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -2x, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\n{{math|''f'''(''x'')}} is twice the absolute value function at <math>x</math>, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have a {{math|''k''}}th derivative for each non-negative integer {{math|''k''}} but not a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}th derivative.  A function that has {{math|''k''}} successive derivatives is called ''{{math|k}} times differentiable''.  If in addition the {{math|''k''}}th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of [[differentiability class]] {{math|''C<sup>k</sup>''}}.  (This is a stronger condition than having {{math|''k''}} derivatives, as shown by the second example of {{slink|Smoothness|Examples}}.)  A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called ''infinitely differentiable'' or ''[[smoothness|smooth]]''.\n\nOn the real line, every [[polynomial function]] is infinitely differentiable.  By standard [[differentiation rules]], if a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is differentiated {{math|''n''}} times, then it becomes a [[constant function]].  All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero.  In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions.\n\nThe derivatives of a function {{math|''f''}} at a point {{math|''x''}} provide polynomial approximations to that function near {{math|''x''}}. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is twice differentiable, then\n:<math> f(x+h) \\approx f(x) + f'(x)h + \\tfrac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2</math>\nin the sense that\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x) - f'(x)h - \\frac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2}{h^2}=0.</math>\nIf {{math|''f''}} is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the [[Taylor series]] for {{math|''f''}} evaluated at {{math|''x'' + ''h''}} around {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Inflection point===\n{{Main|Inflection point}}\n\nA point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an ''inflection point''.<ref>{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=\u00a74.18}}</ref> At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^3</math>, or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^\\frac{1}{3}</math>.

A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions ''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ''y''<sub>2</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''), meaning that {{nowrap|1='''y'''(''t'') = (''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''))}}.  This includes, for example, [[parametric curve]]s in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  The coordinate functions are real valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them.  The derivative of '''y'''(''t'') is defined to be the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], called the [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]], whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions.  That is,\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t) = (y'_1(t), \\ldots, y'_n(t)).</math>\n\nEquivalently,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\mathbf{y}(t+h) - \\mathbf{y}(t)}{h},</math>\n\nif the limit exists.  The subtraction in the numerator is the subtraction of vectors, not scalars.  If the derivative of '''y''' exists for every value of ''t'', then '''y'''\u2032 is another vector-valued function.\n\nIf '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> is the standard basis for '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then '''y'''(''t'') can also be written as {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>1</sub> + \u2026 + ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the [[linearity of differentiation|linearity]] property, then the derivative of '''y'''(''t'') must be\n:<math>y'_1(t)\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cdots + y'_n(t)\\mathbf{e}_n</math>\nbecause each of the basis vectors is a constant.\n\nThis generalization is useful, for example, if '''y'''(''t'') is the position vector of a particle at time ''t''; then the derivative '''y'''&prime;(''t'') is the [[velocity]] vector of the particle at time ''t''.\n\n===Partial derivatives===\n{{Main|Partial derivative}}\n\nSuppose that ''f'' is a function that depends on more than one variable\u2014for instance,\n:<math>f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\n''f'' can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:\n:<math>f(x,y) = f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nIn other words, every value of ''x'' chooses a function, denoted ''f<sub>x</sub>'', which is a function of one real number.{{#tag:ref|This can also be expressed as the operation known as [[currying]].|group=Note}} That is,\n:<math>x \\mapsto f_x,</math>\n:<math>f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nOnce a value of ''x'' is chosen, say ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} determines a function ''f<sub>a</sub>'' that sends ''y'' to {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ay + ''y''<sup>2</sup>}}:\n:<math>f_a(y) = a^2 + ay + y^2.</math>\nIn this expression, ''a'' is a ''constant'', not a ''variable'', so ''f<sub>a</sub>'' is a function of only one real variable.  Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:\n:<math>f_a'(y) = a + 2y.</math>\nThe above procedure can be performed for any choice of ''a''.  Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of ''f'' in the ''y'' direction:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) = x + 2y.</math>\nThis is the partial derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''y''.  Here [[\u2202]] is a rounded ''d'' called the '''partial derivative symbol'''.  To distinguish it from the letter ''d'', \u2202 is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\".\n\nIn general, the '''partial derivative''' of a function {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in the direction ''x<sub>i</sub>'' at the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is defined to be:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n) = \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i+h,\\ldots,a_n) - f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i,\\ldots,a_n)}{h}.</math>\nIn the above difference quotient, all the variables except ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are held fixed.  That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable\n:<math>f_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}(x_i) = f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n),</math>\nand, by definition,\n:<math>\\frac{df_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}}{dx_i}(a_i) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n).</math>\nIn other words, the different choices of ''a'' index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above.  This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives.\n\nAn important example of a function of several variables is the case of a [[scalar-valued function]] {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} on a domain in Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> (e.g., on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>). In this case ''f'' has a partial derivative \u2202''f''/\u2202''x''<sub>''j''</sub> with respect to each variable ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. At the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>), these partial derivatives define the vector\n:<math>\\nabla f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n), \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)\\right).</math>\nThis vector is called the '''[[gradient]]''' of ''f'' at ''a''.  If ''f'' is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function \u2207''f'' that takes the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) to the vector \u2207''f''(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>).  Consequently, the gradient determines a [[vector field]].\n\n===Directional derivatives===\n{{Main|Directional derivative}}\n\nIf ''f'' is a real-valued function on '''R'''<sup>n</sup>, then the partial derivatives of ''f'' measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes.  For example, if ''f'' is a function of ''x'' and ''y'', then its partial derivatives measure the variation in ''f'' in the ''x'' direction and the ''y'' direction.  They do not, however, directly measure the variation of ''f'' in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}.  These are measured using directional derivatives.  Choose a vector\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1,\\ldots,v_n).</math>\nThe '''directional derivative''' of ''f'' in the direction of '''v''' at the point '''x''' is the limit\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}{\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{h}}.</math>\nIn some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector.  Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector.  To see how this works, suppose that {{nowrap|1='''v''' = ''\u03bb'''''u'''}}.  Substitute {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''k''/''\u03bb''}} into the difference quotient.  The difference quotient becomes:\n:<math>\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + (k/\\lambda)(\\lambda\\mathbf{u})) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k/\\lambda}\n= \\lambda\\cdot\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + k\\mathbf{u}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k}.</math>\nThis is ''\u03bb'' times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of ''f'' with respect to '''u'''. Furthermore, taking the limit as ''h'' tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as ''k'' tends to zero because ''h'' and ''k'' are multiples of each other.  Therefore, {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') = \u03bb''D''<sub>'''u'''</sub>(''f'')}}.  Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors.\n\nIf all the partial derivatives of ''f'' exist and are continuous at '''x''', then they determine the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v''' by the formula:\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^n v_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\nThis is a consequence of the definition of the [[total derivative]].  It follows that the directional derivative is [[linear map|linear]] in '''v''', meaning that {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v''' + '''w'''</sub>(''f'') = ''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') + ''D''<sub>'''w'''</sub>(''f'')}}.\n\nThe same definition also works when ''f'' is a function with values in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors.  In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.\n\n===Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix===\n{{Main|Total derivative}}\n\nWhen ''f'' is a function from an open subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, then the directional derivative of ''f'' in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at that point and in that direction.  But when {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}}, no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of ''f''. The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once.  That is, for any vector '''v''' starting at '''a''', the linear approximation formula holds:\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nJust like the single-variable derivative, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;&prime;('''a''')}} is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible.\n\nIf ''n'' and ''m'' are both one, then the derivative {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} is a number and the expression {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''v''}} is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} to be a number. If it were a number, then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} would be a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> while the other terms would be vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a function that sends vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} must denote this function evaluated at '''v'''.\n\nTo determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a}) \\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nNotice that if we choose another vector '''w''', then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting '''w''' for '''v'''. It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both '''w''' for '''v''' and {{nowrap|'''a''' + '''v'''}} for '''a'''. By subtracting these two new equations, we get\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a})\n\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{w} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.</math>\nIf we assume that '''v''' is small and that the derivative varies continuously in '''a''', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''' + '''v''')}} is approximately equal to {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}}, and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with {{nowrap|'''v''' + '''w'''}} substituted for '''v'''. The linear approximation formula implies:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0\n&\\approx f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a}) \\\\\n&= (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) \\\\\n&\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis suggests that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a [[linear transformation]] from the vector space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to the vector space '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations.  Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||'''v'''||, where the constant is independent of '''v''' but depends continuously on '''a'''. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities.  In particular, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a linear transformation up to a small error term.  In the limit as '''v''' and '''w''' tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as '''v''' goes to zero, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a linear transformation.\n\nIn one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients.  However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> while the denominator lies in the domain '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator.  To make precise the idea that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of ''f'' at ''a'' is the unique number {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)}{h} = 0.</math>\nThis is equivalent to\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)|}{|h|} = 0</math>\nbecause the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero.  This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s.\n\nThe definition of the '''total derivative''' of ''f'' at '''a''', therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''') : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{\\mathbf{h}\\to 0} \\frac{\\lVert f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{h}) - (f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{h})\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathbf{h}\\rVert} = 0.</math>\nHere '''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  However, ''f''\u2032('''a''')'''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.  If ''v'' is a vector starting at ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of '''v''' by ''f'' and is sometimes written {{nowrap|''f''<sub>\u2217</sub>'''v'''}}.\n\nIf the total derivative exists at '''a''', then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of ''f'' exist at '''a''', and for all '''v''', {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v'''.  If we write ''f'' using coordinate functions, so that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = (''f''<sub>1</sub>, ''f''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''m''</sub>)}}, then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  This matrix is called the '''[[Jacobian matrix]]''' of ''f'' at '''a''':\n\n:<math>f'(\\mathbf{a}) = \\operatorname{Jac}_{\\mathbf{a}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}\\right)_{ij}.</math>\n\nThe existence of the total derivative ''f''\u2032('''a''') is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on '''a'''.\n\nThe definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable.  That is, if ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists.  The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1\u00d71 matrix whose only entry is the derivative ''f''&prime;(''x'').  This 1\u00d71 matrix satisfies the property that {{nowrap|''f''(''a'' + ''h'') \u2212 (''f''(''a'') + ''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''h'')}} is approximately zero, in other words that\n\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h.</math>\n\nUp to changing variables, this is the statement that the function <math>x \\mapsto f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</math> is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at ''a''.\n\nThe total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case.  This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function.  Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the [[tangent bundle]] of the source to the tangent bundle of the target.\n\nThe natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a [[jet (mathematics)|jet]], cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors.  It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the [[jet bundle]].  The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the ''k''th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to ''k''.\n\nBy repeatedly taking the total derivative, one obtains higher versions of the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]], specialized to '''R'''<sup>''p''</sup>. The ''k''th order total derivative may be interpreted as a map\n:<math>D^k f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to L^k(\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbb{R}^m)</math>\nwhich takes a point '''x''' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and assigns to it an element of the space of ''k''-linear maps from '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> \u2013 the \"best\" (in a certain precise sense) ''k''-linear approximation to ''f'' at that point. By precomposing it with the [[Diagonal functor|diagonal map]] \u0394, {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2192 ('''x''', '''x''')}}, a generalized Taylor series may be begun as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n f(\\mathbf{x}) & \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x-a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\Delta(\\mathbf{x-a})) + \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x - a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\mathbf{x - a}, \\mathbf{x - a})+ \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + \\sum_i (D f)_i (x_i-a_i) + \\sum_{j, k} \\left(D^2 f\\right)_{j k} (x_j-a_j) (x_k-a_k) + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere f('''a''') is identified with a constant function, {{nowrap|''x''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are the components of the vector {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2212 '''a'''}}, and {{nowrap|(''Df'')<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{nowrap|(''D''<sup>2</sup>''f'')<sub>''jk''</sub>}} are the components of {{nowrap|''Df''}} and {{nowrap|''D''<sup>2</sup>''f''}} as linear transformations.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Main|Derivative (generalizations)}}\n\nThe concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a [[linear approximation]] of the function at that point.\n* An important generalization of the derivative concerns [[complex function]]s of [[Complex number|complex variable]]s, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers '''C''' to '''C'''. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If '''C''' is identified with '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by writing a complex number ''z'' as {{nowrap|''x'' + ''iy''}}, then a differentiable function from '''C''' to '''C''' is certainly differentiable as a function from '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to '''R'''<sup>2</sup> (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is ''complex linear'' and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]] \u2013 see [[holomorphic function]]s.\n* Another generalization concerns functions between [[smooth manifold|differentiable or smooth manifolds]]. Intuitively speaking such a manifold ''M'' is a space that can be approximated near each point ''x'' by a vector space called its [[tangent space]]: the prototypical example is a [[smooth surface]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map {{nowrap|''f'': ''M'' \u2192 ''N''}} between manifolds, at a point ''x'' in ''M'', is then a [[linear map]] from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the tangent space of ''N'' at ''f''(''x''). The derivative function becomes a map between the [[tangent bundle]]s of ''M'' and ''N''. This definition is fundamental in [[differential geometry]] and has many uses \u2013 see [[pushforward (differential)]] and [[pullback (differential geometry)]].\n* Differentiation can also be defined for maps between [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensional]] [[vector space]]s such as [[Banach space]]s and [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s.  There is a generalization both of the directional derivative, called the [[Gateaux derivative]], and of the differential, called the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]].\n* One deficiency of the classical derivative is that very many functions are not differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the [[weak derivative]]. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] and only require that a function is differentiable \"on average\".\n* The properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology \u2014 see, for example, [[differential algebra]].\n* The discrete equivalent of differentiation is [[finite difference]]s. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in [[time scale calculus]].\n* Also see [[arithmetic derivative]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of calculus}}\n[[Calculus]], known in its early history as ''infinitesimal calculus'', is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline focused on [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], derivatives, [[integral]]s, and [[infinite series]]. [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] independently discovered calculus in the mid-17th century. However, each inventor claimed the other stole his work in a [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy|bitter dispute]] that continued until the end of their lives.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Differential calculus#Applications of derivatives|Applications of derivatives]]\n* [[Automatic differentiation]]\n* [[Differentiability class]]\n* [[Differentiation rules]]\n* [[Differintegral]]\n* [[Fractal derivative]]\n* [[Generalizations of the derivative]]\n* [[Hasse derivative]]\n* [[History of calculus]]\n* [[Integral]]\n* [[Infinitesimal]]\n* [[Linearization]]\n* [[Mathematical analysis]]\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]\n* [[Numerical differentiation]]\n* [[Rate (mathematics)]]\n* [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem]]\n* [[Symmetric derivative]]\n* [[Schwarzian derivative]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Print===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Anton\n | first = Howard\n | last2 = Bivens\n | first2 = Irl\n | last3 = Davis\n | first3 = Stephen\n | date = February 2, 2005\n | title = Calculus: Early Transcendentals Single and Multivariable\n | place = New York\n | publisher = Wiley\n | edition = 8th\n | isbn  = 978-0-471-47244-5\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Apostol\n | first = Tom M.\n | author-link = Tom M.
