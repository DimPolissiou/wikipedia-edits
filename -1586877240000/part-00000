Donna Serniak ([[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]) was responsible for the first issue. It was first published independently of ''Women's Studies International Forum'' in 1986.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The journal is named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a mathematician and philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE. Al-Hibri said that the SWIP editorial board chose the name to reflect that women have \"deep roots in philosophy\". According to [[Linda L\u00f3pez McAlister]] ([[University of South Florida|USF]]), the idea for the name came from Sue Larson ([[Barnard College|Barnard]]) during a meeting of Eastern SWIP in 1973. [[Sandra Harding]] ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]), who was at the meeting, objected, thinking it awful to name a feminist-philosophy journal after a woman who had been \"stoned to death for telling the truth\". The first suggestion was ''Hypatia: A Journal of Philosophy and Feminism'', rather than ''A Journal of Feminist Philosophy'', because at the time it was unclear what feminist philosophy might be.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Throughout Hypatia\u2019s thirty-three-year history, the journal has been influential in legitimizing feminist philosophy within the field. It has served as one of the most pivotal sources of scholarship in feminist philosophy, both because it showcases a wide range of feminist viewpoints and because it has self-consciously addressed varied views and issues in the discipline. In a editorial statement titled \u201cThe Promise of Feminist Philosophy,\u201d the editors note that:<blockquote>Hypatia\u2019s specific history in this regard is complex. The journal\u2019s editors have often addressed questions of disciplinary pluralism, demographic exclusion and marginalization, and the journal\u2019s own role in setting the agenda for feminist agitation or compliance within the academy...The special issue structure has sometimes allowed ''Hypatia'' to create space for scholars who are subjected to the most persistent forms of marginalization in the discipline, and for intersectional feminist work, even as ''Hypatia'' as a whole has been justly criticized for the underrepresentation of such work.<sup><sup>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hypa.12490 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</sup></sup>...More recently, the development of ''Hypatia'' clusters (a set of two or more articles on a single theme in an open issue) offers another avenue that might be employed to highlight work that is marginalized in the larger discipline.</blockquote>\n\n=== Foot Notes ===\n----[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hypa.12490 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>] \u201cIn 1998, a double\u2010volume special issue thematized multicultural and postcolonial feminist challenges to philosophy and the need for feminists to engage internationally (Narayan and Harding 1998, 13.2, 13.3) and was followed by two additional special issues speaking to these themes (Scholtz 2013, 28.2; Herr and Park 2017, 32.3).

Donna Serniak ([[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]) was responsible for the first issue. It was first published independently of ''Women's Studies International Forum'' in 1986.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The journal is named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a mathematician and philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE. Al-Hibri said that the SWIP editorial board chose the name to reflect that women have \"deep roots in philosophy\". According to [[Linda L\u00f3pez McAlister]] ([[University of South Florida|USF]]), the idea for the name came from Sue Larson ([[Barnard College|Barnard]]) during a meeting of Eastern SWIP in 1973. [[Sandra Harding]] ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]), who was at the meeting, objected, thinking it awful to name a feminist-philosophy journal after a woman who had been \"stoned to death for telling the truth\". The first suggestion was ''Hypatia: A Journal of Philosophy and Feminism'', rather than ''A Journal of Feminist Philosophy'', because at the time it was unclear what feminist philosophy might be.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Throughout Hypatia\u2019s thirty-three-year history, the journal has been influential in legitimizing feminist philosophy within the field. It has served as one of the most pivotal sources of scholarship in feminist philosophy, both because it showcases a wide range of feminist viewpoints and because it has self-consciously addressed varied views and issues in the discipline. In a editorial statement titled \u201cThe Promise of Feminist Philosophy,\u201d the editors note that:<blockquote>Hypatia\u2019s specific history in this regard is complex. The journal\u2019s editors have often addressed questions of disciplinary pluralism, demographic exclusion and marginalization, and the journal\u2019s own role in setting the agenda for feminist agitation or compliance within the academy...The special issue structure has sometimes allowed ''Hypatia'' to create space for scholars who are subjected to the most persistent forms of marginalization in the discipline, and for intersectional feminist work, even as ''Hypatia'' as a whole has been justly criticized for the underrepresentation of such work.<sup><sup>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hypa.12490 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</sup></sup>...More recently, the development of ''Hypatia'' clusters (a set of two or more articles on a single theme in an open issue) offers another avenue that might be employed to highlight work that is marginalized in the larger discipline.</blockquote>\n\n=== Foot Notes ===\n----[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hypa.12490 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>] \u201cIn 1998, a double\u2010volume special issue thematized multicultural and postcolonial feminist challenges to philosophy and the need for feminists to engage internationally (Narayan and Harding 1998, 13.2, 13.3) and was followed by two additional special issues speaking to these themes (Scholtz 2013, 28.2; Herr and Park 2017, 32.3).

He is best known for his contemporary criticism of the [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] which appeared in [[St&nbsp;Anselm]]'s ''[[Proslogion]]''. In his work ''In Behalf of the Fool'',{{refn|The title of Gaunilo's book repeats Anselm's use of the fool mentioned in the [[Psalms]] who doubts the existence of God.<ref>Psalm 14:1</ref><ref>Psalm 53:1</ref>}} Gaunilo contends that St&nbsp;Anselm's ontological argument fails because logic of the same kind would force one to conclude many things exist which certainly do not.<ref>''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion'', Michael J.

Anselm wrote a [[Reply to Gaunilo|reply to it]], essentially arguing that Gaunilo had definitely missed his point.\n\n==The \"Lost Island\" refutation==\nAnselm claimed his ontological argument as proof of the existence of God, whom he described as that being for which no greater can be conceived.  A god that does not exist cannot be that than which no greater can be conceived, as existence would make it greater.  Thus, according to St. Anselm, the concept of God necessarily entails His existence. He denies Gaunilo a Godless [[epistemology]].<ref>''Anselm of Canterbury: The beauty of Theology'', David S. Hogg,\nAshgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, pg. 104.</ref>\n\nGaunilo [[Ontological argument#Gaunilo|criticised Anselm's argument]] by employing the same reasoning, via ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', to \"prove\" the existence of the mythical \"Lost Island\", the greatest or most perfect island: if the island of which we are thinking does not exist, it cannot be the greatest conceivable island, for, to be the greatest conceivable island, it would have to exist, as any existent island would be greater than an imaginary one.  This, of course, is merely a direct application of Anselm's own premise that existence is a perfection.  Since we can conceive of this greatest or most perfect island, it must, by Anselm's way of thinking, exist.  While this argument is absurd, Gaunilo claims that it is [[reductio ad absurdam|no more so]] than Anselm's.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nAnselm had no difficulty in rejecting this parody, because Gaunilo had described the Lost Island as \"an island more excellent than any other lands\".  Anselm correctly pointed out that nowhere had he had put forward the kind of argument which Gaunilo alleged, \"because the phrase 'greater than everything' does not have the same force for the purpose of proving that what is spoken of is in reality as [his own phrase] \"than which a greater cannot be conceived\" <Anselm's Reply V>. Because Gaunilo's phrase did not contain the words \"can be conceived\", his counter-argument cannot generate the contradiction from which Anselm concludes that something than which a greater cannot be conceived is in reality.\n\nPhilosophers often attempt to prove the [[ontological]] argument wrong by comparing Anselm's with Gaunilo's.\u00a0 The former runs:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n# God is that being than which no greater can be conceived.\n# It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.\n# If God does not exist, we can conceive of an even greater being, ''that is'' one that ''does'' exist.\n# Therefore, God must indeed exist in reality.\n\nGaunilo's parody runs along the same lines:\n\n# The Lost Island is that island than which no greater can be conceived.\n# It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.\n# If the Lost Island does not exist, one can conceive of an even greater island, that is one that does exist.\n# Therefore, the Lost Island exists in reality.\n\nIf one of these arguments is sound, it has been asserted, they must both be sound.  By Gaunilo's reckoning, however, one (and, therefore, the other, too) is unsound.  The Lost Island does not exist, so there is something wrong with the logic that proves that it does.  Because the argument proves true in one case that which is patently false (the Lost Island), it is fair to ask whether it may fairly be regarded as proving true the other case.\n\n==Criticisms==\nGaunilo's objection to the ontological argument has been criticised on several grounds. [[Reply to Gaunilo|Anselm's own reply]] was essentially that Gaunilo had missed his point: any ''other'' being's existence is derived from God's, unnecessary in itself, and nonamenable to his ontological argument which can only ever properly apply to the single greatest being of all beings. Indeed, while we can try and conceive of a perfect island, that island is yet greater if it creates other beings, whereupon it would no longer be an island as we can understand it. Similarly, [[Alvin Plantinga]] tendered a reply to Gaunilo's remonstrance by arguing that the concept of \"''that than which nothing greater can be conceived''\" is not applicable to an island, or any other object, in the special way that it is applicable to God.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Plantinga defends Anselm's proof by averring that it applies exclusively to Him. A [[necessary being]] is both existent and the greatest conceivable and greatest possible being.  Only God, as Anselm defines him, meets all of those criteria and can, therefore, be dubbed a necessary being.\n\nAnother criticism of Gaunilo's argument points out that, whereas God is that ''thing'' than which no greater can be conceived, Gaunilo's is that ''island'' than which no greater can be conceived.  Thus, while no island may exceed it in greatness, it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that some non-island could.  \"''Consequently,''\" wrote [[William L. Rowe]] in his summary of the polemic, \"''if we follow Anselm's reasoning exactly, it does not appear that we can derive an absurdity from the supposition that the island than which none greater is possible does not exist.''\"<ref>William L. Rowe: \"The Ontological Argument\" in Feinberg; Shafer-Landau: ''Reason & Responsibility'', p. 15.</ref>\n\nGaunilo's refutation is also criticized on the grounds that it misinterprets the argument set forth by Anselm. Richard Campbell contends that the argument criticized by Gaunilo is incomplete because it represents only one of three stages of a larger argument, one that is not meant to be read as a proof for God but rather as the basis for the following chapter. He argues that since Anselm himself says in Reply I that if something than which a greater cannot be thought exists, it cannot be thought not to exist, a defender of Gaunilo must allow that this island cannot be thought not to exist.  But in Proslogion III Anselm deduces that God exists from the premise that \"Whatever is other than You can be thought not to exist\".  Thus, altering Anselm's formula but adopting his premises, entails that the Lost Island both can and cannot be thought not to exist.  Since that is a contradiction, it follows that it is not legitimate to alter Anselm's formula.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Anselm's Arguments: A Vindication of his Proof of the Existence of God|last=Campbell|first=Richard|publisher=Brill|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=300\u2013324}}</ref>\n\n==Parallels==\nDavid and Marjorie Haight took a very similar tack with Anselm's proof attempt as did Gaunilo.<ref name=\"haight2004\">The Scandal of Reason: Or Shadow of God, David Frederick and Marjorie A. Haight, University Press of America, 2004</ref> However, whereas Gaunilo changed the target noun of Anselm's proof, \"God\", to an alternate noun that he felt was more obviously absurd, a \"Lost Island\", the Haights inverted the adjective in Anselm's reasoning.  Where Anselm used the word \"greater\" to define god into existence, the Haights point out that the logic can be inverted by replacing \"greater\" with \"worse\".  The statement then follows to a conclusion that the very most bad thing has to be an existent bad thing, because it would be worse for this bad thing to exist than to not exist, therefore it must exist in its absolute badness.  Therefore, the Devil must also exist, so long as Anselm's proof is held as consequential.\n\nBoth Gaunilo and the Haights arguments point out that there may be other nouns, and other bivalent adjectives that when conceived as an Anselm proof (in an extreme that demands existence) could also be argued to necessitate their existence as well.  For example, with cold or heat: Surely an absolutely cold (or hot) being that exists in reality is more absolutely cold (or hot) than one that only exists in imagination.  Therefore, it must indeed exist in reality.  And so on.  The Haights show that the word \"great\" may not be the only adjective that pushes for existence when conceived in the extreme, just as the phrase \"that God thing\" may not be the only noun interacting with \"great\" in this way, as Gaunilo observed.\n\n==The remainder of Gaunilo's text==\nGaunilo's treatise is divided into eight sections. The first seven of these sections are criticisms of Anselm's argument from the point of view of a rational non-believer. The last section (8) is simply praise for the remaining chapters of the Proslogion. The full title of Gaunilo's treatise is: ''What Someone in Behalf of the Fool Replies to these Arguments''.<ref>Gaunilo's name does not appear in early manuscripts.</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2014}} This means Gaunilo does not write as a fellow Christian who believes, rather, he pretends to be a rational non-believer. The scholarly debate has focused on section 6 (the Lost Island Refutation).

Hogg,\nAshgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, pg. 104.</ref>\n\nGaunilo [[Ontological argument#Gaunilo|criticised Anselm's argument]] by employing the same reasoning, via ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', to \"prove\" the existence of the mythical \"Lost Island\", the greatest or most perfect island: if the island of which we are thinking does not exist, it cannot be the greatest conceivable island, for, to be the greatest conceivable island, it would have to exist, as any existent island would be greater than an imaginary one.  This, of course, is merely a direct application of Anselm's own premise that existence is a perfection.  Since we can conceive of this greatest or most perfect island, it must, by Anselm's way of thinking, exist.  While this argument is absurd, Gaunilo claims that it is [[reductio ad absurdam|no more so]] than Anselm's.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nAnselm had no difficulty in rejecting this parody, because Gaunilo had described the Lost Island as \"an island more excellent than any other lands\".  Anselm correctly pointed out that nowhere had he had put forward the kind of argument which Gaunilo alleged, \"because the phrase 'greater than everything' does not have the same force for the purpose of proving that what is spoken of is in reality as [his own phrase] \"than which a greater cannot be conceived\" <Anselm's Reply V>. Because Gaunilo's phrase did not contain the words \"can be conceived\", his counter-argument cannot generate the contradiction from which Anselm concludes that something than which a greater cannot be conceived is in reality.   \n\n\nPhilosophers often attempt to prove the [[ontological]] argument wrong by comparing Anselm's with Gaunilo's.\u00a0 The former runs:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n# God is that being than which no greater can be conceived.\n# It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.\n# If God does not exist, we can conceive of an even greater being, ''that is'' one that ''does'' exist.\n# Therefore, God must indeed exist in reality.\n\nGaunilo's parody runs along the same lines:\n\n# The Lost Island is that island than which no greater can be conceived.\n# It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.\n# If the Lost Island does not exist, one can conceive of an even greater island, that is one that does exist.\n# Therefore, the Lost Island exists in reality.\n\nIf one of these arguments is sound, it has been asserted, they must both be sound.  By Gaunilo's reckoning, however, one (and, therefore, the other, too) is unsound.  The Lost Island does not exist, so there is something wrong with the logic that proves that it does.  Because the argument proves true in one case that which is patently false (the Lost Island), it is fair to ask whether it may fairly be regarded as proving true the other case.\n\n==Criticisms==\nGaunilo's objection to the ontological argument has been criticised on several grounds. [[Reply to Gaunilo|Anselm's own reply]] was essentially that Gaunilo had missed his point: any ''other'' being's existence is derived from God's, unnecessary in itself, and nonamenable to his ontological argument which can only ever properly apply to the single greatest being of all beings. Indeed, while we can try and conceive of a perfect island, that island is yet greater if it creates other beings, whereupon it would no longer be an island as we can understand it. Similarly, [[Alvin Plantinga]] tendered a reply to Gaunilo's remonstrance by arguing that the concept of \"''that than which nothing greater can be conceived''\" is not applicable to an island, or any other object, in the special way that it is applicable to God.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Plantinga defends Anselm's proof by averring that it applies exclusively to Him. A [[necessary being]] is both existent and the greatest conceivable and greatest possible being.  Only God, as Anselm defines him, meets all of those criteria and can, therefore, be dubbed a necessary being.\n\nAnother criticism of Gaunilo's argument points out that, whereas God is that ''thing'' than which no greater can be conceived, Gaunilo's is that ''island'' than which no greater can be conceived.  Thus, while no island may exceed it in greatness, it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that some non-island could.  \"''Consequently,''\" wrote [[William L. Rowe]] in his summary of the polemic, \"''if we follow Anselm's reasoning exactly, it does not appear that we can derive an absurdity from the supposition that the island than which none greater is possible does not exist.''\"<ref>William L. Rowe: \"The Ontological Argument\" in Feinberg; Shafer-Landau: ''Reason & Responsibility'', p. 15.</ref>\n\nGaunilo's refutation is also criticized on the grounds that it misinterprets the argument set forth by Anselm. Richard Campbell contends that the argument criticized by Gaunilo is incomplete because it represents only one of three stages of a larger argument, one that is not meant to be read as a proof for God but rather as the basis for the following chapter. He argues that since Anselm himself says in Reply I that if something than which a greater cannot be thought exists, it cannot be thought not to exist, a defender of Gaunilo must allow that this island cannot be thought not to exist.  But in Proslogion III Anselm deduces that God exists from the premise that \"Whatever is other than You can be thought not to exist\".  Thus, altering Anselm's formula but adopting his premises, entails that the Lost Island both can and cannot be thought not to exist.  Since that is a contradiction, it follows that it is not legitimate to alter Anselm's formula. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Anselm's Arguments: A Vindication of his Proof of the Existence of God|last=Campbell|first=Richard|publisher=Brill|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=300-324}}</ref>\n\n==Parallels==\nDavid and Marjorie Haight took a very similar tack with Anselm's proof attempt as did Gaunilo. <ref name=\"haight2004\">The Scandal of Reason: Or Shadow of God, David Frederick and Marjorie A. Haight, University Press of America, 2004</ref> However, whereas Gaunilo changed the target noun of Anselm's proof, \"God\", to an alternate noun that he felt was more obviously absurd, a \"Lost Island\", the Haights inverted the adjective in Anselm's reasoning.  Where Anselm used the word \"greater\" to define god into existence, the Haights point out that the logic can be inverted by replacing \"greater\" with \"worse\".  The statement then follows to a conclusion that the very most bad thing has to be an existent bad thing, because it would be worse for this bad thing to exist than to not exist, therefore it must exist in its absolute badness.  Therefore, the Devil must also exist, so long as Anselm's proof is held as consequential.\n\nBoth Gaunilo and the Haights arguments point out that there may be other nouns, and other bivalent adjectives that when conceived as an Anselm proof (in an extreme that demands existence) could also be argued to necessitate their existence as well.  For example, with cold or heat: Surely an absolutely cold (or hot) being that exists in reality is more absolutely cold (or hot) than one that only exists in imagination.  Therefore, it must indeed exist in reality.  And so on.  The Haights show that the word \"great\" may not be the only adjective that pushes for existence when conceived in the extreme, just as the phrase \"that God thing\" may not be the only noun interacting with \"great\" in this way, as Gaunilo observed.\n\n==The remainder of Gaunilo's text==\nGaunilo's treatise is divided into eight sections. The first seven of these sections are criticisms of Anselm's argument from the point of view of a rational non-believer. The last section (8) is simply praise for the remaining chapters of the Proslogion. The full title of Gaunilo's treatise is: ''What Someone in Behalf of the Fool Replies to these Arguments''.<ref>Gaunilo's name does not appear in early manuscripts.</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2014}} This means Gaunilo does not write as a fellow Christian who believes, rather, he pretends to be a rational non-believer. The scholarly debate has focused on section 6 (the Lost Island Refutation). Very few scholars<ref>See Thomas Losoncy and recently Miroslav Imbrisevic</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2014}} engage with the remaining sections of Gaunilo's text.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{citation |contribution=[[s:Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Anselm|Anselm]] |title=''[[s:Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Ninth Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 9th ed.]], [[s:Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Volume II|Vol.&nbsp;II]]'' |editor-last=Baynes |editor-first=Thomas Spencer |display-editors=0 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |location=New York |date=1878 |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |p=91\u201393 }}.\n*[[Joel Feinberg|Feinberg, Joel]]; [[Russ Shafer-Landau|Shafer-Landau, Russ]]: ''Reason & Responsibility: Readings in Some Basic Problems of Philosophy: Thirteenth Edition.''

It is the capital of [[B\u1eafc Giang Province]]. Its name, deriving from that of the Province [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]], means \"north of the river.\"  The location is very convenient for transportation: it is 50&nbsp;km north of Hanoi, in the middle position on major transportation routes (roads, international railway) connecting Hanoi with the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n City and \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng international border gate; B\u1eafc Giang is located in an important transportation hub. The [[Th\u01b0\u01a1ng River]] runs through the town's southern part heading for [[Haiphong]].\n\nAlthough the name of B\u1eafc Giang (\u5317\u6c5f \"North River\") Province is very old, established in its first form in 1466, there was historically no town of that name. The town was created out the old L\u00e1ng Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng District after independence.<ref>''B\u1eafc Giang th\u1ebf v\u00e0 l\u1ef1c m\u1edbi trong th\u1ebf k\u1ef7 XXI'' published C\u00f4ng ty c\u1ed5 ph\u1ea7n th\u00f4ng tin kinh t\u1ebf \u0111\u1ed1i ngo\u1ea1i 2002 - Page 21 \"B\u1eafc Giang Town was formerly called L\u00e1ng Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng District. After the victory of the war of resistance against the French colonialists, Vietnamese authorities had decided to set up B\u1eafc Giang Town.</ref> The Su\u1ed1i M\u1ee1 thermal springs area is 37&nbsp;km from the town centre.<ref>Minh tr\u1ecb L\u01b0u ''Historical remains & beautiful places of Hanoi and the surrounding area''  Page 268 2000 \"Su\u1ed1i M\u01a1 Relics is in Nghia Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng commune, L\u1ee5c Ng\u1ea1n district, 37 km from B\u1eafc Giang town. It is dedicated to God of the soil, [[Lady Lord of Forestry]] princess [[Qu\u1ebf M\u1ef5 N\u01b0\u01a1ng]], daughter of the 16th H\u00f9ng King.\"</ref> B\u1eafc Giang Peace Park was a sister city project with [[Madison, Wisconsin]], United States.<ref>Cumulative list of organizations described in section 170  Volume 2 - Page 1907 United States.

[[Vietnam]]. It is the capital of [[B\u1eafc Giang Province]]. Its name, deriving from that of the Province [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]], means \"north of the river.\"  The location is very convenient for transportation: it is 50&nbsp;km north of Hanoi, in the middle position on major transportation routes (roads, international railway) connecting Hanoi with the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n City and \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng international border gate; B\u1eafc Giang is located in an important transportation hub. The [[Th\u01b0\u01a1ng River]] runs through the town's southern part heading for [[Haiphong]].\n\nAlthough the name of B\u1eafc Giang (\u5317\u6c5f \"North River\") Province is very old, established in its first form in 1466, there was historically no town of that name. The town was created out the old L\u00e1ng Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng District after independence.<ref>''B\u1eafc Giang th\u1ebf v\u00e0 l\u1ef1c m\u1edbi trong th\u1ebf k\u1ef7 XXI'' published C\u00f4ng ty c\u1ed5 ph\u1ea7n th\u00f4ng tin kinh t\u1ebf \u0111\u1ed1i ngo\u1ea1i 2002 - Page 21 \"B\u1eafc Giang Town was formerly called L\u00e1ng Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng District.

The city has some small- and medium-sized industrial zones associated with large industrial zones such as Quang Ch\u00e2u, \u0110\u00ecnh Tr\u00e1m, V\u00e2n Trung and Song Kh\u00ea - N\u1ed9i Ho\u00e0ng. The emblem of the BG industry is the H\u00e0 B\u1eafc fertilizer factory, the first fertilizer plant in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2013, B\u1eafc Giang City maintained high and stable economic growth reaching 17.3%, with the GDP per capita reaching $3000. The economic structure has shifted positively: trade and services 45.2%; industry, handicraft - construction 51.3%; agriculture - fishery 3.5%. The city has developed diverse industries such as agricultural and forestry processing, mechanical, chemical, textile, electronic and construction materials. B\u1eafc Giang City is well known as one of the distribution centers for the transit of goods imported from China to Vietnam and vice versa. The service network has been developed strongly with large-scale supermarkets such as Big C B\u1eafc Giang, Co.opmart supermarket, B\u1eafc Giang Supermarket, Imexco Supermarket, Mediamart, V\u0103n Chi\u1ebfn appliances and electrics store.\n\n==Administrative subdivisions==\nThe city is subdivided to 16 [[Commune-level subdivisions (Vietnam)|commune-level subdivisions]], including the [[Ward

However, doctrinally Gaudapada's work is Vedantin, and not Buddhist.  {{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}}<ref name=trvmurti116/>{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=311}} The first three chapters of  Gaudapada's text have been influential in the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition.

Shankara in some texts, refers to Gaudapada as the \"teacher's teacher\" who knows the tradition of the Ved\u0101nta (samprad\u0101ya-vit). Assuming how long each lived and when, Gaudapada is estimated to have lived sometime in the 7th century CE.{{sfn|Potter|1981|p=103}} Alternatively, states Potter, the phrase \"teacher's teacher\" should not be taken literally, and more in the sense of another phrase he uses for Gaudapada, namely ''Paramaguru'' (highest teacher).{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=103}} He may have been the guru of Sankara's teacher, but was likely a more distant guru, states Michael Comans (aka [[Vasudevacharya]]).{{Sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=2, 163}}\n\nAnother estimate places him around the early 6th century.<ref name=iepgauda>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/gau\u1e0dapad/ Gaudapada], Devanathan Jagannathan, University of Toronto, IEP</ref>{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|pp=125-126}} This estimate is based on Buddhist literature, and particularly those of scholars Bhavaviveka, Santaraksita and Kamalasila who cite ''Gau\u1e0dapada k\u0101rik\u0101s''.<ref name=iepgauda/>{{Sfn|Michael Comans|2000|pp=45-46}} Bhavaviveka was a contemporary of [[Dharmapala of Nalanda|Dharmapala]], states Karl Potter, while Chinese texts and travel accounts place Dharmapala in the mid 6th century CE.<ref name=iepgauda/> Assuming the Buddhist and Chinese records are reliable, and for Bhavaviveka to have quoted ''Gau\u1e0dapada k\u0101rik\u0101s'', Gaudapada must have lived around 500 CE, or sometime in the first half of 6th century CE. But, it is certain that Gaudapada lived after the 4th century because he cites some Buddhist views of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and [[Asanga]], the latter of whom various accounts place in 4th century India.<ref name=iepgauda/>\n\n==Mandukya Karika==\n[[File:Gaudapada Mandukya Karika manuscript page sample i, Sanskrit, Devanagari script.jpg|thumb|left|The Mandukya Karika is an influential Vedanta text.

In other cases she is said to have built the mountains intentionally, to serve as her stepping stones. She carries a hammer for shaping the hills and valleys, and is said to be the mother of all the goddesses and gods.<ref name=\"Mackenzie\">Mackenzie, Donald Alexander (1917).    \"[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tsm/tsm04.htm Beira, Queen of Winter]\"  in ''Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend\".</ref>\n\nThe Cailleach displays several traits befitting the personification of winter: she herds [[deer]], she fights spring, and her staff freezes the ground.<ref name=\"Briggs2\">{{cite book |first=K.

Depending on local climate, the transfer of power between the winter goddess and the summer goddess is celebrated any time between [[Imbolc|L\u00e0 Fh\u00e8ill Br\u00ecghde]] (1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) at the latest, and the local festivals marking the arrival of the first signs of spring may be named after either the Cailleach or Br\u00ecghde.<ref name=\"McNeill\"/>\n\n[[Imbolc|L\u00e0 Fh\u00e8ill Br\u00ecghde]] is also the day the Cailleach gathers her firewood for the rest of the winter.

In other cases she is said to have built the mountains intentionally, to serve as her stepping stones. She carries a hammer for shaping the hills and valleys, and is said to be the mother of all the goddesses and gods.<ref name=\"Mackenzie\">Mackenzie, Donald Alexander (1917).    \"[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tsm/tsm04.htm Beira, Queen of Winter]\"  in ''Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend\".</ref>\n\nThe Cailleach displays several traits befitting the personification of winter: she herds [[deer]], she fights spring, and her staff freezes the ground.<ref name=\"Briggs2\">{{cite book |first=K.

Depending on local climate, the transfer of power between the winter goddess and the summer goddess is celebrated any time between [[Imbolc|L\u00e0 Fh\u00e8ill Br\u00ecghde]] (1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) at the latest, and the local festivals marking the arrival of the first signs of spring may be named after either the Cailleach or Br\u00ecghde.<ref name=\"McNeill\"/>\n\n[[Imbolc|L\u00e0 Fh\u00e8ill Br\u00ecghde]] is also the day the Cailleach gathers her firewood for the rest of the winter.
