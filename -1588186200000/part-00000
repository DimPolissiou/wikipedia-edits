The veracity of this claim is difficult to ascertain, though some recent ethnohistorians specialising in early Spanish/Nahua relations have discarded it as post-conquest mythicalisation.<ref>Restall 2003, chapter 6</ref>\n\nMuch of the idea of Cort\u00e9s being seen as a deity can be traced back to the Florentine Codex, written some 50 years after the conquest. In the codex's description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cort\u00e9s, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorial Nahuatl, a speech which as described verbatim in the codex (written by Sahag\u00fan's Tlatelolcan informants) included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as, \"You have graciously come on earth, you have graciously approached your water, your high place of Mexico, you have come down to your mat, your throne, which I have briefly kept for you, I who used to keep it for you,\" and, \"You have graciously arrived, you have known pain, you have known weariness, now come on earth, take your rest, enter into your palace, rest your limbs; may our lords come on earth.\" While some historians such as [[Warren H. Carroll]] consider this as evidence that Moctezuma was at least open to the possibility that the Spaniards were divinely sent based on the [[Quetzalcoatl]] legend, others such as Matthew Restall argue that Moctezuma politely offering his throne to Cort\u00e9s (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean, as politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority.<ref>Restall, 2003, p. 97</ref> Other parties have also propagated the idea that the Native Americans believed the conquistadors to be gods, most notably the historians of the [[Franciscan]] order such as [[Friar|Fray]] [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Mendieta]].<ref>Mart\u00ednez 1980</ref> [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]], who compiled the Florentine Codex, was also a Franciscan priest.\n\n===Indigenous accounts of omens and Moctezuma's beliefs===\n[[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] (1499\u20131590) includes in Book 12 of the [[Florentine Codex]] eight events said to have occurred prior to the arrival of the Spanish. These were purportedly interpreted as signs of a possible disaster, e.g. a comet, the burning of a temple, a crying ghostly woman, and others. Some speculate that the Aztecs were particularly susceptible to such ideas of doom and disaster because the particular year in which the Spanish arrived coincided with a \"tying of years\" ceremony at the end of a 52-year cycle in the Aztec calendar, which in Aztec belief was linked to changes, rebirth, and dangerous events. The belief of the Aztecs being rendered passive by their own superstition is referred to by Matthew Restall as part of \"The Myth of Native Desolation\" to which he dedicates chapter 6 in his book [[Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest]].<ref>Restall, 2003, chapter 6</ref> These legends are likely a part of the post-conquest rationalization by the Aztecs of their defeat, and serve to show Moctezuma as indecisive, vain, and superstitious, and ultimately the cause of the fall of the Aztec Empire.<ref name=\"Lockhart 1993, pp. 17\u201319\" />\n\nEthnohistorian [[Susan Gillespie]] has argued that the Nahua understanding of history as repeating itself in cycles also led to a subsequent rationalization of the events of the conquests. In this interpretation the description of Moctezuma, the final ruler of the Aztec Empire prior to the Spanish conquest, was tailored to fit the role of earlier rulers of ending dynasties\u2014for example Quetzalcoatl, the mythical last ruler of the [[Toltec]]s.<ref>Gillespie, 1989, Chapter 5.</ref> In any case it is within the realm of possibility that the description of Moctezuma in post-conquest sources was colored by his role as a monumental closing figure of Aztec history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Contact with the Spanish ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] -->\n{{See also|Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Fall of Tenochtitlan}}\n\n===First interactions with the Spanish===\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Monumento de Moctezuma y Hernan Cort\u00e9s.jpg|left|thumb|Meeting place of Moctezuma and Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]\n\nIn 1517, Moctezuma received the first reports of Europeans landing on the east coast of his empire; this was the expedition of [[Juan de Grijalva]] who had landed on [[San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], which although within [[Totonac]] territory was under the auspices of the Aztec Empire. Moctezuma ordered that he be kept informed of any new sightings of foreigners at the coast and posted extra watch guards to accomplish this.<ref>D\u00edaz del Castillo 1963: 220</ref>\n\n[[File:COM_V2_D091_2_The_swollen_tide_of_their_passions_broke_through_all_barriers_of_ancient_reverence.png|thumb|left|200px|The swollen tide of their passions broke through all barriers of ancient reverence 2]]\n\nWhen Cort\u00e9s arrived in 1519, Moctezuma was immediately informed and he sent emissaries to meet the newcomers; one of them known to be an Aztec noble named Tentlil in the Nahuatl language but referred to in the writings of Cort\u00e9s and Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo as \"Tendile\". As the Spaniards approached Tenochtitlan they made an alliance with the [[Tlaxcaltec]]a, who were enemies of the Aztec Triple Alliance, and they helped instigate revolt in many towns under Aztec dominion. Moctezuma was aware of this and he sent gifts to the Spaniards, probably in order to show his superiority to the Spaniards and Tlaxcalteca.<ref>Restall, Matthew. ''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest''. [[Oxford University Press]] (2003), {{ISBN|0-19-516077-0}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 1519, Moctezuma met Cort\u00e9s on the causeway leading into Tenochtitlan and the two leaders exchanged gifts. Moctezuma gave Cort\u00e9s the gift of an Aztec calendar, one disc of crafted gold and another of silver. Cort\u00e9s later melted these down for their monetary value.<ref>D\u00edaz del Castillo 1963: 216\u201319</ref>\n\nAccording to Cortes, Moctezuma immediately volunteered to cede his entire realm to Charles V, King of Spain. Though some indigenous accounts written in the 1550s partly supported his words, it is still unbelievable for several reasons. As Aztec rulers spoke an overly polite language that needed translation for his subjects to understand, it is difficult to find out what Moctezuma really said. According to an indigenous account, he said to Cortes: \"You have come to sit on your seat of authority, which I have kept for a while for you, where I have been in charge for you, for your agents the rulers...\"However, these words might be a polite expression that was meant to convey the opposite meaning, which was common in Nahua culture. What Moctezuma really meant could be to assert his own stature and multigenerational legitimacy. Also, according to the Spanish law, the king had no right to demand that foreign peoples become his subjects, but he had every right to bring rebels to heel. Therefore, to give the Spanish the necessary legitimacy to wage war against the indigenous people, Cortes might just have said what the Spanish king needed to hear.<ref>Townsend, Camilla.

Moctezuma continued to govern his empire and even undertook conquests of new territory during the Spaniards' stay at Tenochtitlan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nAt some time during that period, Moctezuma became a prisoner in his own house. Exactly why this happened is not clear from the extant sources. The Aztec nobility reportedly became increasingly displeased with the large Spanish army staying in Tenochtitlan, and Moctezuma told Cort\u00e9s that it would be best if they left. Shortly thereafter, Cort\u00e9s left to fight [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]. During his absence, tensions between Spaniards and Aztecs exploded into the [[Massacre in the Great Temple]], and Moctezuma became a hostage used by the Spaniards to ensure their security.<ref group=\"N.B.\">See the account of Moctezuma's captivity, as given in D\u00edaz del Castillo (1963, pp.&nbsp;245\u2013299).</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:The Florentine Codex- Moctezuma's Death and Cremation .tif|thumb|left|Death and cremation of Moctezuma as depicted in the [[Florentine Codex]], Book 12]]\nIn the subsequent battles with the Spaniards after Cort\u00e9s' return, Moctezuma was killed. The details of his death are unknown, with different versions of his demise given by different sources.\n\nIn his ''Historia'', [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] states that on 1 July 1520, the Spanish forced Moctezuma to appear on the balcony of his palace, appealing to his countrymen to retreat. Four leaders of the Aztec army met with Moctezuma to talk, urging their countrymen to cease their constant firing upon the stronghold for a time. D\u00edaz states:\n\n\"Many of the Mexican Chieftains and Captains knew him well and at once ordered their people to be silent and not to discharge darts, stones or arrows, and four of them reached a spot where Montezuma could speak to them.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=D\u00edaz|first1=Bernal|editor1-last=Carrasco|editor1-first=Dav\u00edd|title=The History of the Conquest of New Spain|date=2008|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-4287-4|page=222|url=https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1479413/files/57622696/download|accessdate=22 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nD\u00edaz alleges that the Aztecs informed Moctezuma that a relative of his had risen to the throne and ordered their attack to continue until all of the Spanish were annihilated, but expressed remorse at Moctezuma's captivity and stated that they intended to revere him even more if they could rescue him. Regardless of the earlier orders to hold fire, however, the discussion between Moctezuma and the Aztec leaders was immediately followed by an outbreak of violence. The Aztecs, disgusted by the actions of their leader, renounced Moctezuma and named Cuitlahuac in his place. In an effort to pacify his people, and undoubtedly pressured by the Spanish, Moctezuma was struck dead by a rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Montezuma/|title=Montezuma|last=Cartwright|first=Mark|date=October 10, 2013|website=www.ancient.eu|access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref> Bernal D\u00edaz gives this account:\n\n\"They had hardly finished this speech when suddenly such a shower of stones and darts were discharged that (our men who were shielding him having neglected for a moment their duty, because they saw how the attack ceased while he spoke to them) he was hit by three stones, one on the head, another on the arm and another on the leg, and although they begged him to have the wounds dressed and to take food, and spoke kind words to him about it, he would not.

In Book 12 of the twelve-volume [[Florentine Codex]], the account in Spanish and Nahuatl is accompanied by illustrations by natives. One is of the death of Moctezuma II, which the indigenous assert was due to the Spaniards. According to the Codex, the bodies of Moctezuma and [[Itzquauhtzin]] were cast out of the Palace by the Spanish; the body of Moctezuma was gathered up and cremated at [[Copulco]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Spaniards were forced to flee the city and they took refuge in Tlaxcala, and signed a treaty with them to conquer Tenochtitlan, offering to the Tlaxcalans freedom from any kind of tribute and the control of Tenochtitlan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nardo |first1=Don |title=The Spanish Conquistadors |date=2009 |publisher=Lucent Books |page=57}}</ref>\n\nMoctezuma was then succeeded by his brother [[Cuitl\u00e1huac]], who died shortly after during a [[smallpox]] epidemic. He was succeeded by his adolescent nephew, [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]]. During the siege of the city, the sons of Moctezuma were murdered by the Aztecs, possibly because they wanted to surrender. By the following year, the Aztec empire had fallen to an army of Spanish and their Native American allies, primarily [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcala]]ns who were traditional enemies of the Aztecs.\n\nFollowing the conquest, Moctezuma's daughter, Techichpotzin (or Tecuichpoch), became known as [[Isabel Moctezuma]].

In his first description of Moctezuma, D\u00edaz del Castillo writes:\n\n{{quote|The Great Montezuma was about forty years old, of good height, well proportioned, spare and slight, and not very dark, though of the usual Indian complexion.

His prose is characterized by simple descriptions and explanations, along with frequent personal addresses to the [[King]]. In his Second Letter, Cort\u00e9s describes his first [[wikt:encounter|encounter]] with Moctezuma thus:<blockquote>\nMoctezuma {{sic}} came to greet us and with him some two hundred lords, all barefoot and dressed in a different costume, but also very rich in their way and more so than the others. They came in two columns, pressed very close to the walls of the street, which is very wide and beautiful and so straight that you can see from one end to the other. Moctezuma came down the middle of this street with two chiefs, one on his right hand and the other on his left.

The veracity of this claim is difficult to ascertain, though some recent ethnohistorians specialising in early Spanish/Nahua relations have discarded it as post-conquest mythicalisation.<ref>Restall 2003, chapter 6</ref>\n\nMuch of the idea of Cort\u00e9s being seen as a deity can be traced back to the Florentine Codex, written some 50 years after the conquest. In the codex's description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cort\u00e9s, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorial Nahuatl, a speech which as described verbatim in the codex (written by Sahag\u00fan's Tlatelolcan informants) included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as, \"You have graciously come on earth, you have graciously approached your water, your high place of Mexico, you have come down to your mat, your throne, which I have briefly kept for you, I who used to keep it for you,\" and, \"You have graciously arrived, you have known pain, you have known weariness, now come on earth, take your rest, enter into your palace, rest your limbs; may our lords come on earth.\" While some historians such as [[Warren H. Carroll]] consider this as evidence that Moctezuma was at least open to the possibility that the Spaniards were divinely sent based on the [[Quetzalcoatl]] legend, others such as Matthew Restall argue that Moctezuma politely offering his throne to Cort\u00e9s (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean, as politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority.<ref>Restall, 2003, p. 97</ref> Other parties have also propagated the idea that the Native Americans believed the conquistadors to be gods, most notably the historians of the [[Franciscan]] order such as [[Friar|Fray]] [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Mendieta]].<ref>Mart\u00ednez 1980</ref> [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]], who compiled the Florentine Codex, was also a Franciscan priest.\n\n===Indigenous accounts of omens and Moctezuma's beliefs===\n[[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] (1499\u20131590) includes in Book 12 of the [[Florentine Codex]] eight events said to have occurred prior to the arrival of the Spanish. These were purportedly interpreted as signs of a possible disaster, e.g. a comet, the burning of a temple, a crying ghostly woman, and others. Some speculate that the Aztecs were particularly susceptible to such ideas of doom and disaster because the particular year in which the Spanish arrived coincided with a \"tying of years\" ceremony at the end of a 52-year cycle in the Aztec calendar, which in Aztec belief was linked to changes, rebirth, and dangerous events. The belief of the Aztecs being rendered passive by their own superstition is referred to by Matthew Restall as part of \"The Myth of Native Desolation\" to which he dedicates chapter 6 in his book [[Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest]].<ref>Restall, 2003, chapter 6</ref> These legends are likely a part of the post-conquest rationalization by the Aztecs of their defeat, and serve to show Moctezuma as indecisive, vain, and superstitious, and ultimately the cause of the fall of the Aztec Empire.<ref name=\"Lockhart 1993, pp. 17\u201319\" />\n\nEthnohistorian [[Susan Gillespie]] has argued that the Nahua understanding of history as repeating itself in cycles also led to a subsequent rationalization of the events of the conquests. In this interpretation the description of Moctezuma, the final ruler of the Aztec Empire prior to the Spanish conquest, was tailored to fit the role of earlier rulers of ending dynasties\u2014for example Quetzalcoatl, the mythical last ruler of the [[Toltec]]s.<ref>Gillespie, 1989, Chapter 5.</ref> In any case it is within the realm of possibility that the description of Moctezuma in post-conquest sources was colored by his role as a monumental closing figure of Aztec history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Contact with the Spanish ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] -->\n{{See also|Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Fall of Tenochtitlan}}\n\n===First interactions with the Spanish===\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Monumento de Moctezuma y Hernan Cort\u00e9s.jpg|left|thumb|Meeting place of Moctezuma and Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]\n\nIn 1517, Moctezuma received the first reports of Europeans landing on the east coast of his empire; this was the expedition of [[Juan de Grijalva]] who had landed on [[San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], which although within [[Totonac]] territory was under the auspices of the Aztec Empire. Moctezuma ordered that he be kept informed of any new sightings of foreigners at the coast and posted extra watch guards to accomplish this.<ref>D\u00edaz del Castillo 1963: 220</ref>\n\n[[File:COM_V2_D091_2_The_swollen_tide_of_their_passions_broke_through_all_barriers_of_ancient_reverence.png|thumb|left|200px|The swollen tide of their passions broke through all barriers of ancient reverence 2]]\n\nWhen Cort\u00e9s arrived in 1519, Moctezuma was immediately informed and he sent emissaries to meet the newcomers; one of them known to be an Aztec noble named Tentlil in the Nahuatl language but referred to in the writings of Cort\u00e9s and Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo as \"Tendile\". As the Spaniards approached Tenochtitlan they made an alliance with the [[Tlaxcaltec]]a, who were enemies of the Aztec Triple Alliance, and they helped instigate revolt in many towns under Aztec dominion. Moctezuma was aware of this and he sent gifts to the Spaniards, probably in order to show his superiority to the Spaniards and Tlaxcalteca.<ref>Restall, Matthew. ''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest''. [[Oxford University Press]] (2003), {{ISBN|0-19-516077-0}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 1519, Moctezuma met Cort\u00e9s on the causeway leading into Tenochtitlan and the two leaders exchanged gifts. Moctezuma gave Cort\u00e9s the gift of an Aztec calendar, one disc of crafted gold and another of silver. Cort\u00e9s later melted these down for their monetary value.<ref>D\u00edaz del Castillo 1963: 216\u201319</ref>\n\nAccording to Cortes, Moctezuma immediately volunteered to cede his entire realm to Charles V, King of Spain. Though some indigenous accounts written in the 1550s partly supported his words, it is still unbelievable for several reasons. As Aztec rulers spoke an overly polite language that needed translation for his subjects to understand, it is difficult to find out what Moctezuma really said. According to an indigenous account, he said to Cortes: \"You have come to sit on your seat of authority, which I have kept for a while for you, where I have been in charge for you, for your agents the rulers...\"However, these words might be a polite expression that was meant to convey the opposite meaning, which was common in Nahua culture. What Moctezuma really meant could be to assert his own stature and multigenerational legitimacy. Also, according to the Spanish law, the king had no right to demand that foreign peoples become his subjects, but he had every right to bring rebels to heel. Therefore, to give the Spanish the necessary legitimacy to wage war against the indigenous people, Cortes might just have said what the Spanish king needed to hear.<ref>Townsend, Camilla.

Exactly why this happened is not clear from the extant sources. The Aztec nobility reportedly became increasingly displeased with the large Spanish army staying in Tenochtitlan, and Moctezuma told Cort\u00e9s that it would be best if they left. Shortly thereafter, Cort\u00e9s left to fight [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]. During his absence, tensions between Spaniards and Aztecs exploded into the [[Massacre in the Great Temple]], and Moctezuma became a hostage used by the Spaniards to ensure their security.<ref group=\"N.B.\">See the account of Moctezuma's captivity, as given in D\u00edaz del Castillo (1963, pp.&nbsp;245\u2013299).</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:The Florentine Codex- Moctezuma's Death and Cremation .tif|thumb|left|Death and cremation of Moctezuma as depicted in the [[Florentine Codex]], Book 12]]\nIn the subsequent battles with the Spaniards after Cort\u00e9s' return, Moctezuma was killed.

Four leaders of the Aztec army met with Moctezuma to talk, urging their countrymen to cease their constant firing upon the stronghold for a time. D\u00edaz states:\n\n\"Many of the Mexican Chieftains and Captains knew him well and at once ordered their people to be silent and not to discharge darts, stones or arrows, and four of them reached a spot where Montezuma could speak to them.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=D\u00edaz|first1=Bernal|editor1-last=Carrasco|editor1-first=Dav\u00edd|title=The History of the Conquest of New Spain|date=2008|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-4287-4|page=222|url=https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1479413/files/57622696/download|accessdate=22 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nD\u00edaz alleges that the Aztecs informed Moctezuma that a relative of his had risen to the throne and ordered their attack to continue until all of the Spanish were annihilated, but expressed remorse at Moctezuma's captivity and stated that they intended to revere him even more if they could rescue him. Regardless of the earlier orders to hold fire, however, the discussion between Moctezuma and the Aztec leaders was immediately followed by an outbreak of violence. The Aztecs, disgusted by the actions of their leader, renounced Moctezuma and named Cuitlahuac in his place. In an effort to pacify his people, and undoubtedly pressured by the Spanish, Moctezuma was struck dead by a rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Montezuma/|title=Montezuma|last=Cartwright|first=Mark|date=October 10, 2013|website=www.ancient.eu|access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref> Bernal D\u00edaz gives this account:\n\n\"They had hardly finished this speech when suddenly such a shower of stones and darts were discharged that (our men who were shielding him having neglected for a moment their duty, because they saw how the attack ceased while he spoke to them) he was hit by three stones, one on the head, another on the arm and another on the leg, and although they begged him to have the wounds dressed and to take food, and spoke kind words to him about it, he would not.

In Book 12 of the twelve-volume [[Florentine Codex]], the account in Spanish and Nahuatl is accompanied by illustrations by natives. One is of the death of Moctezuma II, which the indigenous assert was due to the Spaniards. According to the Codex, the bodies of Moctezuma and [[Itzquauhtzin]] were cast out of the Palace by the Spanish; the body of Moctezuma was gathered up and cremated at [[Copulco]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Spaniards were forced to flee the city and they took refuge in Tlaxcala, and signed a treaty with them to conquer Tenochtitlan, offering to the Tlaxcalans freedom from any kind of tribute and the control of Tenochtitlan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nardo |first1=Don |title=The Spanish Conquistadors |date=2009 |publisher=Lucent Books |page=57}}</ref>\n\nMoctezuma was then succeeded by his brother [[Cuitl\u00e1huac]], who died shortly after during a [[smallpox]] epidemic. He was succeeded by his adolescent nephew, [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]]. During the siege of the city, the sons of Moctezuma were murdered by the Aztecs, possibly because they wanted to surrender. By the following year, the Aztec empire had fallen to an army of Spanish and their Native American allies, primarily [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcala]]ns who were traditional enemies of the Aztecs.\n\nFollowing the conquest, Moctezuma's daughter, Techichpotzin (or Tecuichpoch), became known as [[Isabel Moctezuma]]. She was given a large estate by Cort\u00e9s, who also fathered a child by her, [[Leonor Cort\u00e9s Moctezuma]].<ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555''.

In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") and the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}} after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and by befriending civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his [[pacifist]] ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]] as an adult and [[K\u014dki Miyata]] as a child. For the English dub, [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] voices him as an adult and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. \n\nCritics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response; while some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch were praised for their performances, though critics favored Onosaka.\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Yasuhiro Nightow 20110630 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Yasuhiro Nightow created Vash the Stampede.|alt=A black haired Japanese man wearing glasses.]]\n\nVash was created by ''[[Trigun]]'' [[manga]] author [[Yasuhiro Nightow]] with the character's name being original creation in contrast to others that were references to bands.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |title=Anime Expo 2009 |publisher=[[Anime Expo]] |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150426/http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> Nightow who aimed to give him a serious personality with a childish side.

In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") and the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}} after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and by befriending civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his [[pacifist]] ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]] as an adult and [[K\u014dki Miyata]] as a child. For the English dub, [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] voices him as an adult and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. \n\nCritics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response; while some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch were praised for their performances, though critics favored Onosaka.\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Yasuhiro Nightow 20110630 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Yasuhiro Nightow created Vash the Stampede.|alt=A black haired Japanese man wearing glasses.]]\n\nVash was created by ''[[Trigun]]'' [[manga]] author [[Yasuhiro Nightow]] with the character's name being original creation in contrast to others that were references to bands.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |title=Anime Expo 2009 |publisher=[[Anime Expo]] |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150426/http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> Nightow who aimed to give him a serious personality with a childish side.

An acquired [[language disorder]], it is classified by intact auditory comprehension, coherent (yet [[paraphasia|paraphasic]]) [[speech production]], but poor [[speech repetition]]. They are fully capable of understanding what they are hearing, but fail to encode phonological information for production. This deficit is load-sensitive as the person shows significant difficulty repeating phrases, particularly as the phrases increase in length and complexity and as they stumble over words they are attempting to pronounce.<ref name=\"asha.org\">Conduction Aphasia.

Aphasic people are still able to comprehend speech because the lesion does not disrupt the ventral stream pathway.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n\nConduction aphasics will show relatively well-preserved auditory comprehension, which may even be completely functional. All cases are individualized and unique to their own extent. Speech production will be fluent, grammatically, and syntactically correct.  Intonation and articulation will also be maintaned.

These tests are capable of identifying conduction aphasia with relative accuracy.<ref name=Kohn1992p40/> The [[Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination]] (BDAE) and the [[Western Aphasia Battery]] (WAB) are two commonly used test batteries for diagnosing conduction aphasia. These examinations involve a set of tests, which include asking person to name pictures, read printed words, count aloud, and repeat words and non-words (such as ''shwazel'').  Neuro-imaging should also be used to look for a stroke, tumor, infection, or another pathology in the setting of conduction aphasia. This can be done through a CT or MRI or the brain; these are the first imaging modality of choice.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\n\nThere is no standard treatment for aphasia. However, speech and language therapy are typically used as a treatment. There are no medical or surgical treatments. Treatment for aphasias is generally individualized, focusing on specific language and communication improvements, and regular exercise with communication tasks. Regular therapy for conduction aphasics has been shown to result in steady improvement on the [[Western Aphasia Battery]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0269215507078452 |pmid=17981853 |title=The rate and extent of improvement with therapy from the different types of aphasia in the first year after stroke |journal=Clinical Rehabilitation |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=941\u20139 |year=2016 |last1=Bakheit |first1=A.M.O |last2=Shaw |first2=S |last3=Carrington |first3=S |last4=Griffiths |first4=S }}</ref>  The Western Aphasia Battery assesses neurological disorders to discern the degree and type of aphasia present.

These examinations involve a set of tests, which include asking person to name pictures, read printed words, count aloud, and repeat words and non-words (such as ''shwazel'').  Neuro-imaging should also be used to look for a stroke, tumor, infection, or another pathology in the setting of conduction aphasia. This can be done through a CT or MRI or the brain; these are the first imaging modality of choice.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\n\nThere is no standard treatment for aphasia. However, speech and language therapy are typically used as a treatment. There are no medical or surgical treatments.

It is most known for its role in the [[Malayan Emergency|Malayan Emergency.]] .\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nIn April 1930 the [[South Seas Communist Party]] was dissolved and was replaced by the Communist Party of Malaya.<ref>O'Ballance, p.23.</ref> While its primary responsibility was [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and Singapore, the party was also active in [[Thailand]] and the Dutch East Indies, which did not then have their own Communist parties.\n\n===Growth===\nThe party operated as an illegal organisation under British colonial rule. In June 1931, many party leaders were arrested after a [[Comintern]] courier was intercepted by the police, sending the party into disarray. Information extracted from the courier indicated at this point there were 1,500 members and 10,000 sympathisers.<ref>O'Ballance p.24</ref>\n\nDespite this setback, the MCP gained influence in the trade union movement and organised several strikes, most notably at the [[Batu Arang]] coal mine in 1935. They also set up workers' committees at some workplaces. These committees, and the strikes, were promptly crushed by troops and police. Many ethnic Chinese strikers were deported to China, where they were often executed by the Chinese Nationalist government as Communists.<ref>O'Ballance p 25</ref>\n\nAfter Japan invaded China in 1937, there was a rapprochement between the Malayan [[Guomindang]] and Communists, paralleling that in China. Under the wing of the Guomindang, the MCP was able to operate more easily. Anti-Japanese sentiment among Malayan Chinese gave the party with a great opportunity to recruit members and raise funds under the banner of defence of China.<ref>O,Ballance, p 28.</ref>\n\nAt this time, the party was infiltrated by an apparent British agent, [[Lai Teck]], who became Secretary-General in April 1939. Despite this severe security breach, the Party continued to operate effectively. By mid-1939 it claimed about 40,000 members, about half in Singapore.\n\n===Structure===\nThe MCP was headed by a Central Executive Committee of twelve to fifteen members. About six of these were appointed to the Political Bureau ([[Politburo]]) which ran the party when the C.E.C was not in session. Each State had State Central Executive Committee and was in turn subdivided into several Districts. The smallest unit of organisation was the Party cell, which typically consisted of the members from one workplace or village. Large [[Party Congress]]es were held on an occasional basis.\n\n===World War II===\nOn 8 December 1941, the [[Japanese Empire]] invaded Malaya. The British colonial authorities now accepted the MCP's standing offer of military co-operation. On 15 December, all left-wing political prisoners were released.\n\nFrom 20 December the British military began to train party members in guerilla warfare at the hastily established 101st Special Training School (101st STS) in Singapore. About 165 MCP members were trained before the British defences collapsed. These fighters, scantily armed and equipped by the hard-pressed British, hurriedly dispersed and attempted to harass the occupying army.\n\nJust before Singapore fell to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, the party began organising armed resistance in the state of [[Johore]]. Soon four armed groups, which became known as 'Regiments', were formed, with 101st STS trainees serving as nuclei. In March this force was dubbed the [[Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA) and began sabotage and ambushes against the Japanese. The Japanese responded with reprisals against Chinese civilians. These reprisals, coupled with increasing economic hardship, caused large numbers of Malayan Chinese to flee the cities. They became squatters at the forest margins, where they became the main source of recruits, food, and other assistance for the MPAJA. The MPAJA consolidated this support by providing protection.\n\nO'Ballance estimates that in mid-1942 the regimental strengths were about 100 in the first Regiment, 160 in the 2nd, 360 in the 3rd, and 250 in the 4th.<ref>P. 44.</ref> At this time a 5th, 6th, and 7th Regiment were formed. This army, which included women, was conceived as both a military and political force, along Maoist lines.\n\nWhen Singapore fell, [[Lai Teck]] was arrested by the Japanese and became their agent. On 1 September 1942, acting on his information, the Japanese launched a dawn raid on a secret conference of more than 100 MCP and MPAJA leaders at the [[Batu Caves]] just north of [[Kuala Lumpur]], killing most. The loss of personnel forced the MPAJA to abandon its political commissar system, and the military commanders became the heads of the regiments.<ref>O'Ballance, p 49.</ref> Following this setback the MPAJA avoided engagements and concentrated on consolidation, amassing 4,500 soldiers by Spring 1943.<ref>O'Ballance, p 50.</ref>\n\nFrom May 1943, British commandos from [[Force 136]] infiltrated Malaya and made contact with the guerillas. Early in 1944 an agreement was reached whereby the MPAJA would accept some direction from the Allied South East Asia Command (SEAC) and the Allies would give the MPAJA weapons and supplies. It was not until the spring of 1945, however, that significant amounts of material began to arrive by air drop.<ref>Cheah,pp 74, 5; Short, p 24.</ref>\n\n===The war's aftermath===\nJapan's surrender on 15 August 1945 caught the combatants in Malaya by surprise. The first British contingent of reoccupation troops did not arrive until 3 September; Singapore was reoccupied only on the 8th. The Japanese garrison withdrew from the countryside, leaving a power vacuum that was filled by the MPAJA. In many places, especially Chinese areas, they were greeted as heroes as they emerged from the forest.\n\nThe British recognised the MPAJA's authority, paying its soldiers for the role in the reoccupation. The guerillas, meanwhile, seized Japanese arms and recruited freely, forming an 8th Regiment and lifting their armed strength over 6,000.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 61\">O'Ballance, p 61.</ref> At the same time they launched reprisals against collaborators in the Malay police force and the civilian population<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 61\"/> and began to forcibly raise funds.<ref>See Cheah, pp 252, 253, 261, 262.</ref>\n\nMany in the rank and file advocated revolution.<ref>O'Ballance, pp 62, 3.</ref> The cautious approach which was favoured by [[Lai Teck]] and a majority of the leadership prevailed\u2014a decision which was later viewed as a major missed opportunity.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 63\">O'Ballance, p 63.</ref>\n\nOn 12 September the [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] (BMA) was installed at Kuala Lumpur.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 63\"/> Later that year MPAJA reluctantly agreed to disband. Weapons were handed in at ceremonies where the wartime role of the army was praised.<ref>O'Ballance, p. 65.</ref> Six thousand eight-hundred soldiers were officially disbanded, but a proportion of weapons were withheld, particularly handguns.<ref>Shortp 36.</ref> The party was still not legal but able to operate without repression.\n\nThe MCP adopted a 'National Front' policy, building a broad coalition to work for national independence within legal means. Due to bad economic conditions, the BMA was immediately faced with strikes and demonstrations in which the Communists played an active part. Several were put down by armed force and leaders banished. The MCP also exerted influence through parliamentary parties such as the [[Malayan Democratic Union]] (MDU) and the [[Malay Nationalist Party]] (MNP).<ref>Cheah, p248.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, amid a discontent with the leadership's cautious line, an investigation commenced into rumours of [[Lai Teck]]'s treachery.<ref>Short, p. 39.</ref> Before he could be questioned in March 1947, Lai Teck fled the country with party funds.<ref>Short, p 39</ref> Badly shaken, the Central Executive Committee kept the defection secret for a year while they struggled to come to terms with it.<ref>O'Ballance, p 73, Short,p 41.</ref> The 26-year-old [[Chin Peng]] was chosen as the new Secretary General. A senior officer in the MPAJA 5th Regiment in Perak, he had been the party's principal liaison with [[Force 136]]. The party's stance became more resolutely anti-British.\n\n===Malayan Emergency===\n{{main|Malayan Emergency}}\n[[File:CPM's office before the Malayan Emergency.jpg|thumb|The Party's office before the Emergency.|200px]]Amid a rising atmosphere of tension, the government outlawed the burgeoning trade union federations on 12 June 1948. Then on 16 June they declared a [[state of emergency]] after three European planters were murdered by Communists in [[Perak]] state. The police were given sweeping powers of arrest, and punishments including the death penalty could be administered without an ordinary trial.\n\nIn the two weeks following hundreds of MCP members were arrested, and the party was declared illegal on 23 July. Party militants regrouped in the jungle as the Malayan Peoples' Anti-British Army (MPABA), many ex-MPAJA personnel. The initial commander, [[Lau Yew]], was killed in action on 16 July. [[Chin Peng]] narrowly escaped arrest and rejoined his comrades with difficulty.\n\nDuring this period the MCP also engaged in intimidation, including assassination, of civilians with the aim of coercing material aid, information, and silence. This policy contributed to a loss in popular support and was repudiated by the CEC in September 1951.\n\nOn 1 February 1949 the MPABA changed its name to '[[Malayan Peoples' Liberation Army]]' (MPLA) and The party began to campaign for a Peoples' Democratic Republic of Malaya, which included Singapore.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 89\">O'Ballance, p 89.</ref>\n\nThe MPLA had a General Headquarters controlled by a Central Military Committee which consisted of the politburo and some of the MPLA's regimental commanders and political officers. The most influential members of the politburo were [[Chin Peng]], [[Yeung Kwo]] and [[Lau Lee]].<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 89\"/> At this point the army had about 4000 soldiers, about 10% women. It was divided into ten Regiments, nine of which were predominantly Chinese and one of which was composed mostly of Malays and Indians. The latter was successfully eliminated by the British who wished to confine the insurgency to the Chinese community.<ref>O'Ballance, p 100; Short, pp 208, 209.</ref>\n\nA civilian organisation called the [[Min Yuen]] supported the MPLA, collecting supplies and information.<ref>O'Ballance, p 92.</ref>\n\nThe MPLA lived in jungle or forest camps similar to\u2014or even the same as\u2014to those which the MPAJA had used.<ref name=\"P 104\">P 104.</ref> By mid 1950 they, with the help of the Min Yuen, had acquired uniforms. These were of either khaki or jungle green British pattern.\"<ref>O'Ballance, pp 105, 6.</ref> The MPAJA and MPLA usually wore three stars on their caps, signifying the three races of Malaya.\n\nRoad or rail ambushes were favoured by the guerrillas, averaging about 17 per month from September 1949 to February 1950, and 56 per month from then until September 1950, peaking at 100 in the latter month.<ref>Short, pp 206, 211, 12(Short, p 211.)</ref>\n\nTo prevent peasants, particularly squatters, from aiding the guerrillas, the British commenced relocation, which became a major component of British strategy under the [[Briggs' Plan]] of 1950. By the mid-1950s about 500,000 people (roughly 10% of Malaya's population) had been moved into compounds, termed 'New Villages', which were surrounded by high barbed wire fences and guarded by police. On mines and estates, employees did not face relocation but merely 'regroupment' into guarded compounds on site. About 650,000 people were regrouped in this manner.\n\nIn addition, in June 1951, a general food-control program called 'Operation Starvation' was instituted. In 'food restricted areas', eating was only permitted at home, not at cafes and restaurants or workplaces. Shop keepers had to keep strict account of all food sold, and canned goods had to be punctured at time of sale to necessitate their being used promptly.<ref>O'Ballance, pp 112, 121.</ref> Widespread burning of villages suspected of Communist sympathies was also common in the early years.<ref>Short, pp 110, 153,4 163\u20138.</ref>\n\nAs a military strategy, these restrictive measures were highly successful. By 1953 the MPLA was often short of food and its numbers declined.<ref>O'Ballance, p 136, Short, p 350. Coates, ''Suppressing Insurgency'', p 55.</ref> Faced with failure to establish any 'Liberated Areas', MCP renewed its work with trade unions and political parties.<ref>O'Ballance, pp 112, 113, 140, 141.</ref> The MPLA, for its part, began to increasingly rely on Malaya's aboriginal population for support. Internment of Aborigines was abandoned after mass deaths, and the government instead adopted strategy of offering the aborigines' aid and building forts in aborigine territory.<ref>Sandhu, pp 166, 7.</ref>\n\nIn July 1955 Malaya's first general elections took place, with [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] becoming Chief Minister.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 150\">O'Ballance, p 150.</ref> One of his first acts was to declare a partial amnesty.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 150\"/> The amnesty remained in place until 8 February 1956 but resulted in only 73 surrenders.<ref>O'Ballance, p 154.</ref>\n\nOn 24 September 1955 [[Chin Peng]] wrote to Rahman offering to negotiate peace. This was accepted and on 17 October two government representatives, Too Joon Hing, an Assistant Minister of Education, and I.S. Wylie, the Deputy Commissioner of the Federation police, met Chin Peng and another member of the MCP Central Executive Committee at [[Klian Intan]].<ref>O'Ballance, p 152.</ref> Two further meetings followed in November.\n\nOn 24 December the MCP released a new 'Eight Point Program' which called for an end to the Emergency Regulations, a cessation of hostilities, reform of Malaya's political system, democratic rights, support for world peace, and attention to other matters including education, health, welfare, and industrial production.\n\nThe negotiations culminated in the [[Baling]] meeting on 28 and 29 December 1955. Representing the Government were [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], [[Chief Minister of Singapore]], and [[Tan Cheng Lock|Sir Cheng Lock Tan]], leader of the [[Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA). For the MCP were Chin Peng Chen Tian, and Abdul Rashid bin Maidin. Chin Peng wanted legal recognition of the MCP and a return to the pre-conflict situation. The Government demanded the dissolution of the MCP, and the talks broke down.\n\nIn 1956 Chin Peng wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to resume negotiations. This was rejected by Rahman in a broadcast on 2 April.\n\nIn April 1957, Hor Lung, a Politburo member in charge of the Southern operations of the MPLA since 1953, was bribed to surrender to the security forces.<ref>O'Ballance, p 160.</ref>\n\nBy July 1957, about 30,000 square miles (approximately 78,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) out of Malaya's total area of 50,850 square miles (approximately 130,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) had been declared by the government as 'White Areas' \u2013 areas where the MPLA had essentially been eliminated and the Emergency Regulations withdrawn.<ref>O'Ballance, p 158.</ref> In August 1957, Kuala Lumpur and district were declared 'White'. By mid 1958 the MPLA existed mainly in Perak and the Southern part of Johore.<ref>O'Ballance, p 161.</ref> By early 1959 the MPLA was active only around the Thai border.\n\nMeanwhile, on 31 August 1957, Malaya became independent from Britain. Tunku Abdul Rahman became Prime Minister. The Director of Operations against the insurrection, however, remained a British General, namely [[James Cassels (British Army officer)|Lieutenant-General Archibald Cassels]].\n\nOn 31 July 1960 the government formally declared that the 'Emergency' was over. However, Emergency restrictions remained in place in the area near the Thailand border.\n\n===Post-1960 period===\n{{main|Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)}}\nIn the mid 1960s the [[US State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 2000.<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H..

(Mar. 1968), pp. 122.</ref>\n\nThe Communist guerrilla force, with a strength of about 500, [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)|continued to subsist]] on either side of the Thailand border. Meanwhile, [[Chin Peng]] and other cadre in China had limited contact with the jungle bases. From 1969 they launched a radio station in [[Hunan]] called \"Suara Revolusi Malaya\" (Voice of the Malayan Revolution), broadcasting to supporters in Malaysia and Singapore. This was shut down in 1981 at the request of [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 450, 457\u2013460.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1969, in response to the intensification of the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China, the party stepped up armed struggle. In 1970, however, the bases in Thailand were convulsed by the trials and executions of supposed spies. Two breakaway factions formed which condemned the purge. Chin Peng subsequently denied involvement and rehabilitated his accused comrades.<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 466\u2013469,499.</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the CPM finally laid down its arms. On 2 December, at the town of [[Had Yai]] in Southern Thailand, Chin Peng, Rashid Maidin, and Abdullah C. D. met with representatives of the Malaysian and Thai governments. Separate [[Peace Agreement of Hat Yai 1989|peace agreements]] were signed between the CPM and both governments.\n\n==MCP manifestos==\n{{Incomplete list|date=September 2019}}\nFrom time to time the MCP released policy statements or manifestos to the public.\n\n* 1940.

It was founded in 1930 and laid down its arms in 1989. It is most known for its role in the [[Malayan Emergency]]. It also contributed to the independence of Malaya, in which this subject is still a taboo and is systematically erased and hidden from the public due to political interests of the dominating parties within Malaysia.<ref>https://www.newmandala.org/chin-peng-an-obituary/</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nIn April 1930 the [[South Seas Communist Party]] was dissolved and was replaced by the Communist Party of Malaya.<ref>O'Ballance, p.23.</ref> While its primary responsibility was [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and Singapore, the party was also active in [[Thailand]] and the Dutch East Indies, which did not then have their own Communist parties.\n\n===Growth===\nThe party operated as an illegal organisation under British colonial rule. In June 1931, many party leaders were arrested after a [[Comintern]] courier was intercepted by the police, sending the party into disarray. Information extracted from the courier indicated at this point there were 1,500 members and 10,000 sympathisers.<ref>O'Ballance p.24</ref>\n\nDespite this setback, the MCP gained influence in the trade union movement and organised several strikes, most notably at the [[Batu Arang]] coal mine in 1935. They also set up workers' committees at some workplaces. These committees, and the strikes, were promptly crushed by troops and police. Many ethnic Chinese strikers were deported to China, where they were often executed by the Chinese Nationalist government as Communists.<ref>O'Ballance p 25</ref>\n\nAfter Japan invaded China in 1937, there was a rapprochement between the Malayan [[Guomindang]] and Communists, paralleling that in China. Under the wing of the Guomindang, the MCP was able to operate more easily. Anti-Japanese sentiment among Malayan Chinese gave the party with a great opportunity to recruit members and raise funds under the banner of defence of China.<ref>O,Ballance, p 28.</ref>\n\nAt this time, the party was infiltrated by an apparent British agent, [[Lai Teck]], who became Secretary-General in April 1939. Despite this severe security breach, the Party continued to operate effectively. By mid-1939 it claimed about 40,000 members, about half in Singapore.\n\n===Structure===\nThe MCP was headed by a Central Executive Committee of twelve to fifteen members. About six of these were appointed to the Political Bureau ([[Politburo]]) which ran the party when the C.E.C was not in session. Each State had State Central Executive Committee and was in turn subdivided into several Districts. The smallest unit of organisation was the Party cell, which typically consisted of the members from one workplace or village. Large [[Party Congress]]es were held on an occasional basis.\n\n===World War II===\nOn 8 December 1941, the [[Japanese Empire]] invaded Malaya. The British colonial authorities now accepted the MCP's standing offer of military co-operation. On 15 December, all left-wing political prisoners were released.\n\nFrom 20 December the British military began to train party members in guerilla warfare at the hastily established 101st Special Training School (101st STS) in Singapore. About 165 MCP members were trained before the British defences collapsed. These fighters, scantily armed and equipped by the hard-pressed British, hurriedly dispersed and attempted to harass the occupying army.\n\nJust before Singapore fell to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, the party began organising armed resistance in the state of [[Johore]]. Soon four armed groups, which became known as 'Regiments', were formed, with 101st STS trainees serving as nuclei. In March this force was dubbed the [[Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA) and began sabotage and ambushes against the Japanese. The Japanese responded with reprisals against Chinese civilians. These reprisals, coupled with increasing economic hardship, caused large numbers of Malayan Chinese to flee the cities. They became squatters at the forest margins, where they became the main source of recruits, food, and other assistance for the MPAJA. The MPAJA consolidated this support by providing protection.\n\nO'Ballance estimates that in mid-1942 the regimental strengths were about 100 in the first Regiment, 160 in the 2nd, 360 in the 3rd, and 250 in the 4th.<ref>P. 44.</ref> At this time a 5th, 6th, and 7th Regiment were formed. This army, which included women, was conceived as both a military and political force, along Maoist lines.\n\nWhen Singapore fell, [[Lai Teck]] was arrested by the Japanese and became their agent. On 1 September 1942, acting on his information, the Japanese launched a dawn raid on a secret conference of more than 100 MCP and MPAJA leaders at the [[Batu Caves]] just north of [[Kuala Lumpur]], killing most. The loss of personnel forced the MPAJA to abandon its political commissar system, and the military commanders became the heads of the regiments.<ref>O'Ballance, p 49.</ref> Following this setback the MPAJA avoided engagements and concentrated on consolidation, amassing 4,500 soldiers by Spring 1943.<ref>O'Ballance, p 50.</ref>\n\nFrom May 1943, British commandos from [[Force 136]] infiltrated Malaya and made contact with the guerillas. Early in 1944 an agreement was reached whereby the MPAJA would accept some direction from the Allied South East Asia Command (SEAC) and the Allies would give the MPAJA weapons and supplies. It was not until the spring of 1945, however, that significant amounts of material began to arrive by air drop.<ref>Cheah,pp 74, 5; Short, p 24.</ref>\n\n===The war's aftermath===\nJapan's surrender on 15 August 1945 caught the combatants in Malaya by surprise. The first British contingent of reoccupation troops did not arrive until 3 September; Singapore was reoccupied only on the 8th. The Japanese garrison withdrew from the countryside, leaving a power vacuum that was filled by the MPAJA. In many places, especially Chinese areas, they were greeted as heroes as they emerged from the forest.\n\nThe British recognised the MPAJA's authority, paying its soldiers for the role in the reoccupation. The guerillas, meanwhile, seized Japanese arms and recruited freely, forming an 8th Regiment and lifting their armed strength over 6,000.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 61\">O'Ballance, p 61.</ref> At the same time they launched reprisals against collaborators in the Malay police force and the civilian population<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 61\"/> and began to forcibly raise funds.<ref>See Cheah, pp 252, 253, 261, 262.</ref>\n\nMany in the rank and file advocated revolution.<ref>O'Ballance, pp 62, 3.</ref> The cautious approach which was favoured by [[Lai Teck]] and a majority of the leadership prevailed\u2014a decision which was later viewed as a major missed opportunity.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 63\">O'Ballance, p 63.</ref>\n\nOn 12 September the [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] (BMA) was installed at Kuala Lumpur.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 63\"/> Later that year MPAJA reluctantly agreed to disband. Weapons were handed in at ceremonies where the wartime role of the army was praised.<ref>O'Ballance, p. 65.</ref> Six thousand eight-hundred soldiers were officially disbanded, but a proportion of weapons were withheld, particularly handguns.<ref>Shortp 36.</ref> The party was still not legal but able to operate without repression.\n\nThe MCP adopted a 'National Front' policy, building a broad coalition to work for national independence within legal means. Due to bad economic conditions, the BMA was immediately faced with strikes and demonstrations in which the Communists played an active part. Several were put down by armed force and leaders banished. The MCP also exerted influence through parliamentary parties such as the [[Malayan Democratic Union]] (MDU) and the [[Malay Nationalist Party]] (MNP).<ref>Cheah, p248.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, amid a discontent with the leadership's cautious line, an investigation commenced into rumours of [[Lai Teck]]'s treachery.<ref>Short, p. 39.</ref> Before he could be questioned in March 1947, Lai Teck fled the country with party funds.<ref>Short, p 39</ref> Badly shaken, the Central Executive Committee kept the defection secret for a year while they struggled to come to terms with it.<ref>O'Ballance, p 73, Short,p 41.</ref> The 26-year-old [[Chin Peng]] was chosen as the new Secretary General. A senior officer in the MPAJA 5th Regiment in Perak, he had been the party's principal liaison with [[Force 136]]. The party's stance became more resolutely anti-British.\n\n===Malayan Emergency===\n{{main|Malayan Emergency}}\n[[File:CPM's office before the Malayan Emergency.jpg|thumb|The Party's office before the Emergency.|200px]]Amid a rising atmosphere of tension, the government outlawed the burgeoning trade union federations on 12 June 1948. Then on 16 June they declared a [[state of emergency]] after three European planters were murdered by Communists in [[Perak]] state. The police were given sweeping powers of arrest, and punishments including the death penalty could be administered without an ordinary trial.\n\nIn the two weeks following hundreds of MCP members were arrested, and the party was declared illegal on 23 July. Party militants regrouped in the jungle as the Malayan Peoples' Anti-British Army (MPABA), many ex-MPAJA personnel. The initial commander, [[Lau Yew]], was killed in action on 16 July. [[Chin Peng]] narrowly escaped arrest and rejoined his comrades with difficulty.\n\nDuring this period the MCP also engaged in intimidation, including assassination, of civilians with the aim of coercing material aid, information, and silence. This policy contributed to a loss in popular support and was repudiated by the CEC in September 1951.\n\nOn 1 February 1949 the MPABA changed its name to '[[Malayan Peoples' Liberation Army]]' (MPLA) and The party began to campaign for a Peoples' Democratic Republic of Malaya, which included Singapore.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 89\">O'Ballance, p 89.</ref>\n\nThe MPLA had a General Headquarters controlled by a Central Military Committee which consisted of the politburo and some of the MPLA's regimental commanders and political officers. The most influential members of the politburo were [[Chin Peng]], [[Yeung Kwo]] and [[Lau Lee]].<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 89\"/> At this point the army had about 4000 soldiers, about 10% women. It was divided into ten Regiments, nine of which were predominantly Chinese and one of which was composed mostly of Malays and Indians. The latter was successfully eliminated by the British who wished to confine the insurgency to the Chinese community.<ref>O'Ballance, p 100; Short, pp 208, 209.</ref>\n\nA civilian organisation called the [[Min Yuen]] supported the MPLA, collecting supplies and information.<ref>O'Ballance, p 92.</ref>\n\nThe MPLA lived in jungle or forest camps similar to\u2014or even the same as\u2014to those which the MPAJA had used.<ref name=\"P 104\">P 104.</ref> By mid 1950 they, with the help of the Min Yuen, had acquired uniforms. These were of either khaki or jungle green British pattern.\"<ref>O'Ballance, pp 105, 6.</ref> The MPAJA and MPLA usually wore three stars on their caps, signifying the three races of Malaya.\n\nRoad or rail ambushes were favoured by the guerrillas, averaging about 17 per month from September 1949 to February 1950, and 56 per month from then until September 1950, peaking at 100 in the latter month.<ref>Short, pp 206, 211, 12(Short, p 211.)</ref>\n\nTo prevent peasants, particularly squatters, from aiding the guerrillas, the British commenced relocation, which became a major component of British strategy under the [[Briggs' Plan]] of 1950. By the mid-1950s about 500,000 people (roughly 10% of Malaya's population) had been moved into compounds, termed 'New Villages', which were surrounded by high barbed wire fences and guarded by police. On mines and estates, employees did not face relocation but merely 'regroupment' into guarded compounds on site. About 650,000 people were regrouped in this manner.\n\nIn addition, in June 1951, a general food-control program called 'Operation Starvation' was instituted. In 'food restricted areas', eating was only permitted at home, not at cafes and restaurants or workplaces. Shop keepers had to keep strict account of all food sold, and canned goods had to be punctured at time of sale to necessitate their being used promptly.<ref>O'Ballance, pp 112, 121.</ref> Widespread burning of villages suspected of Communist sympathies was also common in the early years.<ref>Short, pp 110, 153,4 163\u20138.</ref>\n\nAs a military strategy, these restrictive measures were highly successful. By 1953 the MPLA was often short of food and its numbers declined.<ref>O'Ballance, p 136, Short, p 350. Coates, ''Suppressing Insurgency'', p 55.</ref> Faced with failure to establish any 'Liberated Areas', MCP renewed its work with trade unions and political parties.<ref>O'Ballance, pp 112, 113, 140, 141.</ref> The MPLA, for its part, began to increasingly rely on Malaya's aboriginal population for support. Internment of Aborigines was abandoned after mass deaths, and the government instead adopted strategy of offering the aborigines' aid and building forts in aborigine territory.<ref>Sandhu, pp 166, 7.</ref>\n\nIn July 1955 Malaya's first general elections took place, with [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] becoming Chief Minister.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 150\">O'Ballance, p 150.</ref> One of his first acts was to declare a partial amnesty.<ref name=\"O'Ballance, p 150\"/> The amnesty remained in place until 8 February 1956 but resulted in only 73 surrenders.<ref>O'Ballance, p 154.</ref>\n\nOn 24 September 1955 [[Chin Peng]] wrote to Rahman offering to negotiate peace. This was accepted and on 17 October two government representatives, Too Joon Hing, an Assistant Minister of Education, and I.S. Wylie, the Deputy Commissioner of the Federation police, met Chin Peng and another member of the MCP Central Executive Committee at [[Klian Intan]].<ref>O'Ballance, p 152.</ref> Two further meetings followed in November.\n\nOn 24 December the MCP released a new 'Eight Point Program' which called for an end to the Emergency Regulations, a cessation of hostilities, reform of Malaya's political system, democratic rights, support for world peace, and attention to other matters including education, health, welfare, and industrial production.\n\nThe negotiations culminated in the [[Baling]] meeting on 28 and 29 December 1955. Representing the Government were [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], [[Chief Minister of Singapore]], and [[Tan Cheng Lock|Sir Cheng Lock Tan]], leader of the [[Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA). For the MCP were Chin Peng Chen Tian, and Abdul Rashid bin Maidin. Chin Peng wanted legal recognition of the MCP and a return to the pre-conflict situation. The Government demanded the dissolution of the MCP, and the talks broke down.\n\nIn 1956 Chin Peng wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to resume negotiations. This was rejected by Rahman in a broadcast on 2 April.\n\nIn April 1957, Hor Lung, a Politburo member in charge of the Southern operations of the MPLA since 1953, was bribed to surrender to the security forces.<ref>O'Ballance, p 160.</ref>\n\nBy July 1957, about 30,000 square miles (approximately 78,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) out of Malaya's total area of 50,850 square miles (approximately 130,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) had been declared by the government as 'White Areas' \u2013 areas where the MPLA had essentially been eliminated and the Emergency Regulations withdrawn.<ref>O'Ballance, p 158.</ref> In August 1957, Kuala Lumpur and district were declared 'White'. By mid 1958 the MPLA existed mainly in Perak and the Southern part of Johore.<ref>O'Ballance, p 161.</ref> By early 1959 the MPLA was active only around the Thai border.\n\nMeanwhile, on 31 August 1957, Malaya became independent from Britain. Tunku Abdul Rahman became Prime Minister. The Director of Operations against the insurrection, however, remained a British General, namely [[James Cassels (British Army officer)|Lieutenant-General Archibald Cassels]].\n\nOn 31 July 1960 the government formally declared that the 'Emergency' was over. However, Emergency restrictions remained in place in the area near the Thailand border.\n\n===Post-1960 period===\n{{main|Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)}}\nIn the mid 1960s the [[US State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 2000.<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H..

(Mar. 1968), pp. 122.</ref>\n\nThe Communist guerrilla force, with a strength of about 500, [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)|continued to subsist]] on either side of the Thailand border. Meanwhile, [[Chin Peng]] and other cadre in China had limited contact with the jungle bases. From 1969 they launched a radio station in [[Hunan]] called \"Suara Revolusi Malaya\" (Voice of the Malayan Revolution), broadcasting to supporters in Malaysia and Singapore. This was shut down in 1981 at the request of [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 450, 457\u2013460.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1969, in response to the intensification of the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China, the party stepped up armed struggle. In 1970, however, the bases in Thailand were convulsed by the trials and executions of supposed spies. Two breakaway factions formed which condemned the purge. Chin Peng subsequently denied involvement and rehabilitated his accused comrades.<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 466\u2013469,499.</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the CPM finally laid down its arms. On 2 December, at the town of [[Had Yai]] in Southern Thailand, Chin Peng, Rashid Maidin, and Abdullah C. D. met with representatives of the Malaysian and Thai governments. Separate [[Peace Agreement of Hat Yai 1989|peace agreements]] were signed between the CPM and both governments.\n\n==MCP manifestos==\n{{Incomplete list|date=September 2019}}\nFrom time to time the MCP released policy statements or manifestos to the public.\n\n* 1940.
