In 1848, Exbrayat established the rule that no holds below the waist were to be allowed; neither were painful holds or torsions that would hurt the opponent. \"Flat hand wrestling\" or \"French wrestling\" (as the style became known) developed all throughout Europe and became a popular sport.

But on the continent of [[Europe]], the style was highly promoted. Almost all the continental European capital cities hosted international Greco-Roman tournaments in the 19th century, with much prize money given to the place winners. For example, the [[Czar]] of Russia paid 500 francs for wrestlers to train and compete in his tournament, with 5,000 francs awarded as a prize to the tournament winner.

In 1900, he won professional tournaments in Moscow and St. Petersburg and a series of international tournaments after that. After defeating Tom Jenkins (from the United States) in both freestyle and Greco-Roman matches in England, Georg Hackenschmidt wrestled exclusively freestyle in order to compete better against English, Australian, and American opponents. Winning more than 2,000 victories in Greco-Roman and freestyle, Hackenschmidt served as the [[physical education]] adviser to the [[House of Lords]] after his retirement.<ref name=PoliakoffGR1195>\"Wrestling, Greco-Roman\" by Michael B.

Body slams, choke-holds, and head-butting was allowed, and even caustic substances were used to weaken the opponent. By the end of the 19th century, gouging with the nails, punching, and violently slamming the arms together around the opponent's stomach were forbidden. Greco-Roman matches were also famous for their length. Professionally, it was not uncommon for there to be matches lasting two or three hours. William Muldoon's bout with [[Clarence Whistler]] at the Terrace Garden Theater in New York lasted eight hours before ending in a draw. Even in the 1912 Olympics, a match between [[Anders Ahlgren]] of Sweden and [[Ivar Boehling]] of Finland lasted for nine hours before a draw was called and both wrestlers awarded the silver medal. The [[United World Wrestling|International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF)]] took over the regulation of Greco-Roman wrestling in 1921. Since then matches have been dramatically cut short, and today all movements that put the life or limb of the wrestler in jeopardy are forbidden.<ref name=\"PoliakoffGR1196\">\"Wrestling, Greco-Roman\" by Michael B.

For the Olympic Games, all World Championships, and World Cups, the mat has to be new. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a 1.5 meter border of the same thickness known as the \"protection area\". Inside the nine meter in diameter circle is a red band of one meter in width that is on the outer edge of the circle and is known as the \"red zone\". The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the \"passivity zone\". Inside the red zone is the \"central wrestling area\" which is seven meters in diameter. In the middle of the central wrestling area is the \"central circle\", which is one meter in diameter. The central circle is surrounded by a band 10 centimeters wide and is divided in half by a red line eight centimeters in width. The diagonally opposite corners of the mat are marked with the wrestlers' colors, red and blue.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 8-9\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nFor competition in the [[Olympic Games]], the World Championships, and the Continental Championships, the mat is installed on a platform no greater than 1.1 meters in height. If the mat lies on a podium and the protection margin (covering and free space around the mat) does not reach two meters, then the sides of the podium are covered with 45\u00b0 (degree) inclined panels. In all cases, the color of the protection area is different from the color of the mat.<ref name=FILAIWR9>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 9\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n* A \"[[Wrestling singlet|singlet]]\" is a one-piece wrestling garment made of [[spandex]] that should provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler.

One wrestler usually competes in a red singlet and the other in a blue singlet.<ref name=\"FILAIWR9\" />\n* A special pair of \"[[Wrestling shoes|shoes]]\" is worn by the wrestler to increase his mobility and flexibility.

In Greco-Roman wrestling, a jury (or team) of three officials ([[referee]]s) is used. The referee controls the action in the center, blowing the whistle to start and stop the action, and supervises the scoring of holds and infractions. The judge sits at the side of the mat, keeps score, and occasionally gives his approval when needed by the referee for various decisions. The mat chairman sits at the scoring table, keeps time, is responsible for declaring technical superiority, and supervises the work of the referee and judge. To call a fall, two of the three officials must agree (usually, the referee and either the judge or the mat chairman).<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 22-26\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Period format===\nIn Greco-Roman and freestyle, the format is now two three-minute periods. Before each match, each wrestler's name is called, and the wrestler takes his place at the corner of the mat assigned to his color. The referee then calls them to his side at the center of the mat, shakes hands with them, inspects their apparel, and checks for any perspiration, oily or greasy substances, and any other infractions. The two wrestlers then greet each other, shake hands, and the referee blows his whistle to start the period.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 27-28\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nA wrestler wins the match when he has won two out of three periods. For example, if one competitor were to win the first period 1-0 and the second period 1-0, the match would be over. However, if the other competitor were to win the second period, then a third and deciding period would result. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in period termination. One side effect of this format is that it is possible for the losing wrestler to outscore the winner. For example, periods may be scored 3-2, 0-4, 1-0, leading to a total score of 4-6 but a win for the wrestler scoring fewer points.<ref name=FILAIWR27,30>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 27, 30\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nEach Greco-Roman period is broken up into a phase for wrestling from the neutral position and a maximum of two par terre (ground wrestling) phases. During the wrestling phase from the neutral position, both wrestlers compete for takedowns and points for 60 seconds as usual. At the end of the first minute, in general, the wrestler who has scored the most points will receive the advantage in an Olympic lift from an open par terre position on the other wrestler. This position is known as \"the Clinch\". If neither wrestler at this point has any points, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a red-colored side and a blue-colored side. The wrestler who won the colored disk toss will receive the advantage in the Olympic lift.\n\nThe wrestler who lost the colored disk toss then places his hands and knees in the center circle, with the hands and knees at least 20 centimeters apart and the distance between the hands a maximum of 30 centimeters. The arms of that wrestler would be stretched out, the feet would not be crossed, and the thighs would be stretched out forming a 90-degree angle with the mat. The wrestler who won the colored disk toss would then be allowed to step beside the wrestler on the bottom, not touching him with his legs. If the wrestler who won the colored disk toss wished, he could place one knee on the mat. The top wrestler would then wrap his hands and arms around the bottom wrestler's waist and execute the Olympic lift (called an upside-down belt hold) at the beginning of the first 30 seconds. The bottom wrestler could then attempt to defend himself.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 44-46\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nAt the end of first thirty seconds, the clinch position is reversed with the other wrestler receiving the Olympic lift, and the period continuing for the remaining 30 seconds. The period is decided by who accumulated the most points during both standing and ground phases. During each ground phase, if the top wrestler cannot score, the other wrestler is awarded one point. In the case of no scoring moves being executed during either ground phase the score will be 1-1, and in this case generally the wrestler to score last will be awarded the period.<ref name=FILAIWR4446>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 30-31, 44-46\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nWhen the period (or match) has concluded, the referee stands at the center of the mat facing the officials' table. Both wrestlers then come, shake hands, and stand on either side of the referee to await the decision. The referee then proclaims the winner by raising the winner's hand. At the end of the match, each wrestler then shakes hands with the referee and returns to shake hands with his opponent's coach.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 29\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Match scoring===\nIn Greco-Roman wrestling, as well as in freestyle wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of explosive action and risk. For example, when one wrestler performs a grand amplitude throw that brings his opponent into the danger position, he is awarded the greatest number of points that can be scored in one instance. Also, a wrestler who takes the risk to briefly roll on the mat (with his shoulders in contact with the mat) could give a certain number of points to his opponent. Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways:\n* '''Takedown''' (2 to 5 points): A wrestler is awarded points for a takedown when the wrestler gains control over his opponent on the mat from a neutral position (when the wrestler is on his feet). At least three points of contact have to be controlled on the mat (e.g. two arms and one knee; two knees and one arm or the head; or two arms and the head).<ref name=FILAIWR3637>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 36-37\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n::(5 points) - Five points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler brings his opponent off of the mat and controls him so that his feet go directly above his head) either from the standing or ''par terre'' position into a direct and immediate danger position.<ref name=FILAIWR37>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 37\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n::(4 points) - Generally, four points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a grand amplitude throw that does not bring his opponent in a direct and immediate danger position or for a takedown in which a wrestler's opponent is taken from his feet or his stomach to his back or side (a throw of short amplitude) so that he is in the danger position.<ref name=\"FILAIWR37\" />\n::(2 point) - Two points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a wrestler taking his opponent from his feet to his stomach or side such that his back or shoulders are not exposed to the mat.<ref name=FILAIWR36>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 36\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n* '''Reversal''' (1 point): A wrestler is awarded one point for a reversal when the wrestler gains control over his opponent from a defensive position (when the wrestler is being controlled by his opponent).<ref name=\"FILAIWR36\" />\n* '''Exposure''' also called the \"Danger Position\" (2 or 3 points): A wrestler is awarded points for exposure when the wrestler exposes his opponent's back to the mat for several seconds.

Criteria for exposure or the danger position is met when 1) a wrestler's opponent is in a bridge position to avoid being pinned, 2) a wrestler's opponent is on one or both elbows with his back to the mat and avoids getting pinned, 3) a wrestler holds one of his opponent's shoulders to the mat and the other shoulder at an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), 4) a wrestler's opponent is in an \"instantaneous fall\" position (where both of his shoulders are on the mat for less than one second), or 5) the wrestler's opponent rolls on his shoulders.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 35\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref> A wrestler in the danger position allows his opponent to score two points.

Other infractions (e.g. fleeing a hold or the mat, striking the opponent, acting with brutality or intent to injure, and using illegal holds) are penalized by an award of either one or two points, a \"caution\", and a choice of position to the opponent.<ref name=\"FILAIWR3637\" />\n* '''Out-of-Bounds''' (1 point): Whenever a wrestler places his foot in the protection area, the match is stopped, and one point is awarded to his opponent.<ref name=\"FILAIWR36\" />\n\nClassification points are also awarded in an international wrestling tournament, which give most points to the winner and in some cases, one point to the loser depending on the outcome of the match and how the victory was attained.

Lifting skills are essential, as seen here.]]\nA match can be won in the following ways:\n* '''Win by fall''': The object of the wrestling match is to attain victory by what is known as the fall. A fall, also known as a [[pin (amateur wrestling)|pin]], occurs when one wrestler holds both of his opponents' shoulders on the mat simultaneously. In Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, the two shoulders of the defensive wrestler must be held long enough for the referee to \"observe the total control of the fall\" (usually ranging from one half-second to about one or two seconds). Then either the judge or the mat chairman concurs with the referee that a fall is made; if the referee does not indicate a fall, and the fall is valid, the judge and the mat chairman can concur together and announce the fall. A fall ends the match entirely regardless of when it occurs.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 41\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref> In the United States, for the Kids freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling division (wrestlers ages 8 to 14) in competitions sponsored by [[USA Wrestling]], it is specified that a fall must be held for two seconds.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling, modified for USA Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 41, 72\n  | publisher = [[USA Wrestling|USAW]]\n  | date = 2009-02-01\n  | url = http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 2009-03-19\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140702035901/http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf\n  | archive-date = 2014-07-02\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref>\n* '''Win by technical superiority''' (also called \"[[technical fall]]\"):  If a fall is not secured to end the match, a wrestler can win a period simply by points. If one wrestler gains an eight-point lead over his opponent at any break in continuous action, he is declared the winner of the match by technical superiority.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 27, 28, 41\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n* '''Win by decision''': If neither wrestler achieves either a fall or technical superiority, the wrestler who scored more points during the match is declared the winner. If the score is tied, the winner is determined by certain criteria. First, the number of cautions given to each wrestler for penalties; next, the value of points gained (that is, whether a wrestler gained points based on a two-, four-, or five-point move); and finally, the last scored technical point are taken into account to determine the winner. Generally, the wrestler who scored the last technical point will be awarded the period.<ref name=\"FILAIWR4446\"/>\n* '''Win by default''': If one wrestler is unable to continue participating for any reason, or fails to show up on the mat after his name was called three times before the match begins, his opponent is declared the winner of the match by default, forfeit, or withdrawal as the case may be.<ref name=\"FILAIWR27,30\" />\n* '''Win by injury''': If one wrestler is injured and unable to continue, the other wrestler is declared the winner. This is also referred to as a \"medical forfeit\" or \"injury default\". The term also encompasses situations where wrestlers become ill, take too many injury time-outs, or bleed uncontrollably. In the event a wrestler is injured by his opponent's illegal maneuver and cannot continue, the wrestler at fault is disqualified.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 30, 52-53\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n* '''Win by disqualification''': If a wrestler is assessed three \"cautions\" for breaking the rules, he is disqualified. Under other circumstances, such as flagrant brutality or gross disrespect for officials, the match will be ended immediately and the offending wrestler ejected from the tournament.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 31, 50\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Team scoring in tournaments===\nIn an international wrestling tournament, teams enter one wrestler at each weight class and score points based on the individual performances. For example, if a wrestler at the 60&nbsp;kg weight class finishes in first place, then his team will receive 10 points. If he were to finish in tenth place, then the team would only receive one. At the end of the tournament, each team's score is tallied, and the teams are then placed first, second, third, etc.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 31-32\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Team competition===\nA '''team competition''' or '''dual meet''' is a meeting between (typically two) teams in which individual wrestlers at a given weight class compete against each other. A team receives one point for each victory in a weight class regardless of the outcome. The team that scores the most points at the end of the matches wins the team competition. If there are two sets of competitions with one team winning the ''home'' competition and one winning the ''away'' competition, a third competition may take place to determine the winner for ranking purposes, or the ranking may take place by assessing in order: 1) the most victories by adding the points of the two matches; 2) the most points by fall, default, forfeit, or disqualification; 3) the most matches won by technical superiority; 4) the most periods won by technical superiority; 5) the most technical points won in all the competition; 6) the least technical points won in all the competition. This works similarly when more than two teams are involved in this predicament.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 32-33\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n* [[Amateur wrestling]]\n* [[Bundesliga (wrestling)|Professional Greco-Roman wrestling in Germany]]\n* [[Collegiate wrestling]]\n* [[Folk wrestling]]\n* [[Freestyle wrestling]]\n* [[List of World and Olympic Champions in Greco-Roman wrestling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web| last =International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles| title =Greco-Roman Wrestling| publisher =FILA| url =http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=36| accessdate =2008-10-28| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110711000658/http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=36| archivedate =2011-07-11}}\n*{{cite web\n  | last = International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work =\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n*{{cite web\n  | last = [[USA Wrestling]]\n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling, modified for USA Wrestling\n  | work = \n  | publisher = [[USA Wrestling|USAW]]\n  | date = 2009-02-01\n  | url = http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 2009-03-19\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140702035901/http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf\n  | archive-date = 2014-07-02\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Poliakoff\n  | first = Michael\n  | author-link = Michael B.

The 18th century work ''Gymnastics for Youth'' by [[Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths|Johann Friedrich Guts Muths]] described a form of schoolboy wrestling called \"orthopale\" (used by [[Plato]] to describe the standing part of wrestling) that did not mention any lower-body holds.<ref name=\"PoliakoffGR1194\"/> Real ancient wrestling was quite different;<ref>[http://judo4mma.com/greekwrestling/ancient%20greek%20submission%20wrestling.pdf Greek Wrestling Research Article]</ref> see [[Greek wrestling]].<ref name=\"FILAGrecoRomanPage\" />\n[[Image:GrecoRomanWrestling2.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Even on the mat, a Greco-Roman wrestler must still find ways to turn his opponent's shoulders to the mat for a fall without using the legs.]]\n\nThe British never really enjoyed Greco-Roman wrestling in comparison to its less restrictive counterpart, [[freestyle wrestling|freestyle]], and neither did the Americans, despite the efforts of [[William Muldoon]] (a successful New York barroom freestyle wrestler who served in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and learned the style in France) to promote it in the United States after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

In 1900, he won professional tournaments in Moscow and St. Petersburg and a series of international tournaments after that. After defeating Tom Jenkins (from the United States) in both freestyle and Greco-Roman matches in England, Georg Hackenschmidt wrestled exclusively freestyle in order to compete better against English, Australian, and American opponents. Winning more than 2,000 victories in Greco-Roman and freestyle, Hackenschmidt served as the [[physical education]] adviser to the [[House of Lords]] after his retirement.<ref name=PoliakoffGR1195>\"Wrestling, Greco-Roman\" by Michael B.

Body slams, choke-holds, and head-butting was allowed, and even caustic substances were used to weaken the opponent. By the end of the 19th century, gouging with the nails, punching, and violently slamming the arms together around the opponent's stomach were forbidden. Greco-Roman matches were also famous for their length. Professionally, it was not uncommon for there to be matches lasting two or three hours. William Muldoon's bout with [[Clarence Whistler]] at the Terrace Garden Theater in New York lasted eight hours before ending in a draw. Even in the 1912 Olympics, a match between [[Anders Ahlgren]] of Sweden and [[Ivar Boehling]] of Finland lasted for nine hours before a draw was called and both wrestlers awarded the silver medal. The [[United World Wrestling|International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF)]] took over the regulation of Greco-Roman wrestling in 1921. Since then matches have been dramatically cut short, and today all movements that put the life or limb of the wrestler in jeopardy are forbidden.<ref name=\"PoliakoffGR1196\">\"Wrestling, Greco-Roman\" by Michael B.

The repechage round begins with the wrestlers who lost to the two finalists at the lowest level of competition in the elimination round.

For the Olympic Games, all World Championships, and World Cups, the mat has to be new. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a 1.5 meter border of the same thickness known as the \"protection area\". Inside the nine meter in diameter circle is a red band of one meter in width that is on the outer edge of the circle and is known as the \"red zone\". The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the \"passivity zone\". Inside the red zone is the \"central wrestling area\" which is seven meters in diameter. In the middle of the central wrestling area is the \"central circle\", which is one meter in diameter. The central circle is surrounded by a band 10 centimeters wide and is divided in half by a red line eight centimeters in width. The diagonally opposite corners of the mat are marked with the wrestlers' colors, red and blue.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 8-9\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nFor competition in the [[Olympic Games]], the World Championships, and the Continental Championships, the mat is installed on a platform no greater than 1.1 meters in height. If the mat lies on a podium and the protection margin (covering and free space around the mat) does not reach two meters, then the sides of the podium are covered with 45\u00b0 (degree) inclined panels.

One wrestler usually competes in a red singlet and the other in a blue singlet.<ref name=\"FILAIWR9\" />\n* A special pair of \"[[Wrestling shoes|shoes]]\" is worn by the wrestler to increase his mobility and flexibility.

In Greco-Roman wrestling, a jury (or team) of three officials ([[referee]]s) is used. The referee controls the action in the center, blowing the whistle to start and stop the action, and supervises the scoring of holds and infractions. The judge sits at the side of the mat, keeps score, and occasionally gives his approval when needed by the referee for various decisions. The mat chairman sits at the scoring table, keeps time, is responsible for declaring technical superiority, and supervises the work of the referee and judge. To call a fall, two of the three officials must agree (usually, the referee and either the judge or the mat chairman).<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 22-26\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Period format===\nIn Greco-Roman and freestyle, the format is now two three-minute periods. Before each match, each wrestler's name is called, and the wrestler takes his place at the corner of the mat assigned to his color. The referee then calls them to his side at the center of the mat, shakes hands with them, inspects their apparel, and checks for any perspiration, oily or greasy substances, and any other infractions. The two wrestlers then greet each other, shake hands, and the referee blows his whistle to start the period.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 27-28\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nA wrestler wins the match when he has won two out of three periods. For example, if one competitor were to win the first period 1-0 and the second period 1-0, the match would be over. However, if the other competitor were to win the second period, then a third and deciding period would result. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in period termination. One side effect of this format is that it is possible for the losing wrestler to outscore the winner. For example, periods may be scored 3-2, 0-4, 1-0, leading to a total score of 4-6 but a win for the wrestler scoring fewer points.<ref name=FILAIWR27,30>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 27, 30\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nEach Greco-Roman period is broken up into a phase for wrestling from the neutral position and a maximum of two par terre (ground wrestling) phases. During the wrestling phase from the neutral position, both wrestlers compete for takedowns and points for 60 seconds as usual. At the end of the first minute, in general, the wrestler who has scored the most points will receive the advantage in an Olympic lift from an open par terre position on the other wrestler. This position is known as \"the Clinch\". If neither wrestler at this point has any points, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a red-colored side and a blue-colored side. The wrestler who won the colored disk toss will receive the advantage in the Olympic lift.\n\nThe wrestler who lost the colored disk toss then places his hands and knees in the center circle, with the hands and knees at least 20 centimeters apart and the distance between the hands a maximum of 30 centimeters. The arms of that wrestler would be stretched out, the feet would not be crossed, and the thighs would be stretched out forming a 90-degree angle with the mat. The wrestler who won the colored disk toss would then be allowed to step beside the wrestler on the bottom, not touching him with his legs. If the wrestler who won the colored disk toss wished, he could place one knee on the mat. The top wrestler would then wrap his hands and arms around the bottom wrestler's waist and execute the Olympic lift (called an upside-down belt hold) at the beginning of the first 30 seconds. The bottom wrestler could then attempt to defend himself.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 44-46\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nAt the end of first thirty seconds, the clinch position is reversed with the other wrestler receiving the Olympic lift, and the period continuing for the remaining 30 seconds. The period is decided by who accumulated the most points during both standing and ground phases. During each ground phase, if the top wrestler cannot score, the other wrestler is awarded one point. In the case of no scoring moves being executed during either ground phase the score will be 1-1, and in this case generally the wrestler to score last will be awarded the period.<ref name=FILAIWR4446>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 30-31, 44-46\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nWhen the period (or match) has concluded, the referee stands at the center of the mat facing the officials' table.

For example, when one wrestler performs a grand amplitude throw that brings his opponent into the danger position, he is awarded the greatest number of points that can be scored in one instance. Also, a wrestler who takes the risk to briefly roll on the mat (with his shoulders in contact with the mat) could give a certain number of points to his opponent. Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways:\n* '''Takedown''' (2 to 5 points): A wrestler is awarded points for a takedown when the wrestler gains control over his opponent on the mat from a neutral position (when the wrestler is on his feet). At least three points of contact have to be controlled on the mat (e.g. two arms and one knee; two knees and one arm or the head; or two arms and the head).<ref name=FILAIWR3637>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 36-37\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n::(5 points) - Five points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler brings his opponent off of the mat and controls him so that his feet go directly above his head) either from the standing or ''par terre'' position into a direct and immediate danger position.<ref name=FILAIWR37>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 37\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n::(4 points) - Generally, four points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a grand amplitude throw that does not bring his opponent in a direct and immediate danger position or for a takedown in which a wrestler's opponent is taken from his feet or his stomach to his back or side (a throw of short amplitude) so that he is in the danger position.<ref name=\"FILAIWR37\" />\n::(2 point) - Two points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a wrestler taking his opponent from his feet to his stomach or side such that his back or shoulders are not exposed to the mat.<ref name=FILAIWR36>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 36\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n* '''Reversal''' (1 point): A wrestler is awarded one point for a reversal when the wrestler gains control over his opponent from a defensive position (when the wrestler is being controlled by his opponent).<ref name=\"FILAIWR36\" />\n* '''Exposure''' also called the \"Danger Position\" (2 or 3 points): A wrestler is awarded points for exposure when the wrestler exposes his opponent's back to the mat for several seconds. Points for exposure are also awarded if a wrestler's back is to the mat but the wrestler is not pinned. Criteria for exposure or the danger position is met when 1) a wrestler's opponent is in a bridge position to avoid being pinned, 2) a wrestler's opponent is on one or both elbows with his back to the mat and avoids getting pinned, 3) a wrestler holds one of his opponent's shoulders to the mat and the other shoulder at an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), 4) a wrestler's opponent is in an \"instantaneous fall\" position (where both of his shoulders are on the mat for less than one second), or 5) the wrestler's opponent rolls on his shoulders.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 35\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref> A wrestler in the danger position allows his opponent to score two points. An additional \"hold-down point\" may be earned by maintaining the exposure continuously for five seconds.<ref name=\"FILAIWR3637\" />\n* '''Penalty''' (1 or 2 points): Under the 2004\u20132005 changes to the international styles, a wrestler whose opponent takes an injury time-out receives one point unless the injured wrestler is bleeding. Other infractions (e.g. fleeing a hold or the mat, striking the opponent, acting with brutality or intent to injure, and using illegal holds) are penalized by an award of either one or two points, a \"caution\", and a choice of position to the opponent.<ref name=\"FILAIWR3637\" />\n* '''Out-of-Bounds''' (1 point): Whenever a wrestler places his foot in the protection area, the match is stopped, and one point is awarded to his opponent.<ref name=\"FILAIWR36\" />\n\nClassification points are also awarded in an international wrestling tournament, which give most points to the winner and in some cases, one point to the loser depending on the outcome of the match and how the victory was attained.

A fall, also known as a [[pin (amateur wrestling)|pin]], occurs when one wrestler holds both of his opponents' shoulders on the mat simultaneously. In Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, the two shoulders of the defensive wrestler must be held long enough for the referee to \"observe the total control of the fall\" (usually ranging from one half-second to about one or two seconds). Then either the judge or the mat chairman concurs with the referee that a fall is made; if the referee does not indicate a fall, and the fall is valid, the judge and the mat chairman can concur together and announce the fall. A fall ends the match entirely regardless of when it occurs.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = p. 41\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref> In the United States, for the Kids freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling division (wrestlers ages 8 to 14) in competitions sponsored by [[USA Wrestling]], it is specified that a fall must be held for two seconds.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling, modified for USA Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 41, 72\n  | publisher = [[USA Wrestling|USAW]]\n  | date = 2009-02-01\n  | url = http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 2009-03-19\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140702035901/http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf\n  | archive-date = 2014-07-02\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref>\n* '''Win by technical superiority''' (also called \"[[technical fall]]\"):  If a fall is not secured to end the match, a wrestler can win a period simply by points. If one wrestler gains an eight-point lead over his opponent at any break in continuous action, he is declared the winner of the match by technical superiority.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 27, 28, 41\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n* '''Win by decision''': If neither wrestler achieves either a fall or technical superiority, the wrestler who scored more points during the match is declared the winner. If the score is tied, the winner is determined by certain criteria. First, the number of cautions given to each wrestler for penalties; next, the value of points gained (that is, whether a wrestler gained points based on a two-, four-, or five-point move); and finally, the last scored technical point are taken into account to determine the winner. Generally, the wrestler who scored the last technical point will be awarded the period.<ref name=\"FILAIWR4446\"/>\n* '''Win by default''': If one wrestler is unable to continue participating for any reason, or fails to show up on the mat after his name was called three times before the match begins, his opponent is declared the winner of the match by default, forfeit, or withdrawal as the case may be.<ref name=\"FILAIWR27,30\" />\n* '''Win by injury''': If one wrestler is injured and unable to continue, the other wrestler is declared the winner. This is also referred to as a \"medical forfeit\" or \"injury default\". The term also encompasses situations where wrestlers become ill, take too many injury time-outs, or bleed uncontrollably. In the event a wrestler is injured by his opponent's illegal maneuver and cannot continue, the wrestler at fault is disqualified.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 30, 52-53\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n* '''Win by disqualification''': If a wrestler is assessed three \"cautions\" for breaking the rules, he is disqualified. Under other circumstances, such as flagrant brutality or gross disrespect for officials, the match will be ended immediately and the offending wrestler ejected from the tournament.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 31, 50\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Team scoring in tournaments===\nIn an international wrestling tournament, teams enter one wrestler at each weight class and score points based on the individual performances. For example, if a wrestler at the 60&nbsp;kg weight class finishes in first place, then his team will receive 10 points. If he were to finish in tenth place, then the team would only receive one. At the end of the tournament, each team's score is tallied, and the teams are then placed first, second, third, etc.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 31-32\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Team competition===\nA '''team competition''' or '''dual meet''' is a meeting between (typically two) teams in which individual wrestlers at a given weight class compete against each other. A team receives one point for each victory in a weight class regardless of the outcome. The team that scores the most points at the end of the matches wins the team competition. If there are two sets of competitions with one team winning the ''home'' competition and one winning the ''away'' competition, a third competition may take place to determine the winner for ranking purposes, or the ranking may take place by assessing in order: 1) the most victories by adding the points of the two matches; 2) the most points by fall, default, forfeit, or disqualification; 3) the most matches won by technical superiority; 4) the most periods won by technical superiority; 5) the most technical points won in all the competition; 6) the least technical points won in all the competition. This works similarly when more than two teams are involved in this predicament.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work = pp. 32-33\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n* [[Amateur wrestling]]\n* [[Bundesliga (wrestling)|Professional Greco-Roman wrestling in Germany]]\n* [[Collegiate wrestling]]\n* [[Folk wrestling]]\n* [[Freestyle wrestling]]\n* [[List of World and Olympic Champions in Greco-Roman wrestling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web| last =International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles| title =Greco-Roman Wrestling| publisher =FILA| url =http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=36| accessdate =2008-10-28| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110711000658/http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=36| archivedate =2011-07-11}}\n*{{cite web\n  | last = International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling\n  | work =\n  | publisher = FILA\n  | date = 2006-12-01\n  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}\n*{{cite web\n  | last = [[USA Wrestling]]\n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling, modified for USA Wrestling\n  | work = \n  | publisher = [[USA Wrestling|USAW]]\n  | date = 2009-02-01\n  | url = http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 2009-03-19\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140702035901/http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf\n  | archive-date = 2014-07-02\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Poliakoff\n  | first = Michael\n  | author-link = Michael B.

The [[Service for Poland's Victory|first elements]] of the Underground State were established in the final days of the [[Invasion of Poland|German and Soviet invasion of Poland]], in late September 1939. The Underground State was perceived by supporters as a legal continuation of the pre-war [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]] (and its institutions) that waged an armed struggle against the country's occupying powers: [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Underground State encompassed not only military resistance, one of the largest in the world,{{Ref label|b|b|none}} but also civilian structures, such as education, culture and social services.\n\nAlthough the Underground State enjoyed broad support throughout much of the war, it was not supported or recognized by the far left (communists). The nationalists from the [[National Radical Camp Falanga]] and [[National Radical Camp ABC]] opposed the German occupation of Poland and the two movements were quickly replaced by the [[Konfederacja Narodu]], a part of the Polish\nUnderground State which also included most members of the pre-war far-right. Influence of the communists eventually declined amid military reversals (most notably, the failure of the [[Warsaw Uprising]]) and the growing hostility of the USSR. The Soviet Union had created an alternative, puppet government in 1944 (the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]]) and ensured it formed the basis of [[Provisional Government of National Unity|the post-war government in Poland]]. During the Soviet-backed communist takeover of Poland at the end of the war, many Underground State members were prosecuted [[Trial of the Sixteen|as alleged traitors]] and died in captivity. [[Western betrayal|Abandoned]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], finding it impossible to negotiate with the Soviets, and wishing to avoid a civil war, the key institutions of the Underground State dissolved themselves in the first half of 1945.\n\nUltimately, hundreds of thousands of people were directly involved with various agencies of the Underground State ([[Armia Krajowa#Membership|the estimates for membership in Armia Krajowa]] alone are often given at approaching half a million people), and they were quietly supported by millions of Polish citizens. The rationale behind the creation of the secret civilian authority drew on the fact that the German and Soviet occupation of Poland was illegal. Hence, all institutions created by the occupying powers were considered illegal, and parallel Polish underground institutions were set up in accordance with [[Polish law]]. The scale of the Underground State was also inadvertently aided by the actions of the occupiers, whose attempts to destroy the Polish state, nation, and its culture, including  most importantly [[genocide|genocidal policies]] that targeted Polish citizens, fuelled popular support for the Polish resistance movement and  its development.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] era, research on the Underground State was curtailed by Polish communist officials, who instead emphasized the role that [[Armia Ludowa|communist partisans]] played in the anti-Nazi resistance. Hence, until recently, the bulk of research done on this topic was carried out by Polish scholars living in exile.\n\n==History==\n\n===1939\u20131940: Formation===\nIn many respects, the history of the Polish Underground State mirrors that of the Polish non-communist resistance in general. The Underground State traces its origins to the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski, SZP) organization, which was founded on 27 September 1939, one day before the [[siege of Warsaw (1939)|surrender of the Polish capital of Warsaw]], at a time when the Polish defeat in the [[German invasion of Poland]] (accompanied by the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet one]]) appeared inevitable.<ref name=\"Salm25\"/><ref name=\"Gar221\"/> SZP founder General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] received orders from Polish [[Commander-in-Chief]] Marshal [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] to organize and carry out the struggle in occupied Poland.<ref name=Gar221/><ref name=\"Salm26-27\"/> Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski decided that the organization he was creating needed to move beyond a strictly military format; and in line with the traditions of the underground [[Polish National Government (January Uprising)|19th-century Polish National Government]] and [[World War I]]-era [[Polish Military Organization]], it would need to encompass various aspects of civilian life.<ref name=\"Salm27\"/> Hence, the SZP, in contact with (and subordinate to) the [[Polish Government in Exile]], envisioned itself not only as an armed resistance organization, but also as a vehicle through which the Polish state continued to administer its occupied territories.<ref name=\"Salm30-31\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[April Constitution of Poland|Polish Constitution]], President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]], interned in [[Romania]] after the Polish government evacuated itself from Poland on 17 September, resigned and appointed General [[Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski]] as his successor; unpopular with the French government, Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski was replaced by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz]] on 29 September.<ref name=\"Stachura2004\"/><ref name=\"BiskupskiPula2010-141\"/><ref name=\"Lerski1996-Mosc\"/> General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], a long-term opponent of the [[Sanacja]] regime who resided in France and had the support of the French government, would become the Polish Commander-in-Chief (on 28 September) and Poland's [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] (on 30 September).<ref name=\"BiskupskiPula2010-141\"/><ref name=Gar222/><ref name=\"Keegan2002\"/> This government was quickly recognized by France and the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Gar223\"/> Raczkiewicz, described as \"weak and indecisive\", held relatively little influence compared to charismatic Sikorski.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anita Pra\u017cmowska|title=Britain and Poland, 1939\u20131943: the betrayed ally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4J2c4jEhjYC&pg=PA10|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48385-8|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nDue to political differences among factions in the Polish exile government, and in particular, SZP ties to the Sanacja regime which dominated the Polish government since mid-1920s, the SZP was reorganized into the [[Union of Armed Struggle]] (Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ) on 13 November 1939.<ref name=Gar223/><ref name=\"Salm31-33\"/> Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported that move, aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja regime, and supported the formation of the [[Main Political Council]] (G\u0142\u00f3wna Rada Polityczna, GRP).<ref name=\"Gar222\"/> Sikorski named General [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] the head of the ZWZ and Colonel [[Stefan Rowecki]] was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone.

the development of the organization's civilian structure was taken in late February 1940, when the ZWZ established its local version of the National Council, the [[Political Consultative Committee]] (Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy, PKP).<ref name=\"Salm33-36\"/><ref name=\"Gar224\"/> The structures in occupied Poland maintained close communication with the government in exile, through radio

developments of 1940 was the creation of the office of [[Government Delegation for Poland]] (Delegatura Rz\u0105du na Kraj), with [[Cyryl Ratajski]] (nominated on 3 December) as the first [[List of

control over the military.<ref name=\"Gar225-226\"/> The Delegation was to oversee the military, and recreate the civilian administration.<ref name=Gar225-226/>\n\nAs early as 1940, the Underground State's civilian arm was actively supporting [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground education]];<ref name=\"Salm37\"/> it then set out to develop [[social security]], information (propaganda) and [[Directorate of Civil Resistance|justice]] networks.<ref name=\"Salm42\"/><ref name=\"Salm44\"/><ref name=\"Salm46\"/>\n\n===1941\u20131943: Growth===\nBy 1942, most of the differences between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled.<ref name=\"Salm45-46\"/> By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the [[Home Political Representation]] (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served as the basis of the [[Council of National Unity]] (Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944.<ref name=\"Salm44-45\"/> The Council, headed by [[Kazimierz Pu\u017cak]], was seen as the Underground State's parliament.<ref name=\"Kersten1991\"/> Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into [[Armia Krajowa]] (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942.<ref name=\"Salm45\"/> ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, [[Tadeusz Komorowski]] and [[Leopold Okulicki]].<ref name=\"MNK\"/>\n{{Polish statehood}}\n\nIn August 1943 and March 1944, the Polish Underground State announced its long-term plan, which was partly designed to undercut the attractiveness of some of the communists' proposals.<ref name=\"Salm47\"/> The communists, in their increasingly radical ''What We Fight For'' declarations (from March and November 1943), were proposing the creation of a heavily socialist or even [[communist state]], denouncing capitalism, which they equated to slavery.<ref name=\"Korbo\u0144ski1981\"/> They demanded [[nationalization]] of most if not all of the economy, introduction of [[central planning]],<ref name=\"Korbo\u0144ski1981\"/><ref name=\"Buszko1983\"/> The Underground State's declaration ''What the Polish Nation is Fighting For'' declared the reconstruction of Poland as a democratic parliamentary state as its goal, guaranteeing full equality to the minorities, as well as full [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion]], and freedom of political activity.<ref name=\"Kersten1991\"/><ref name=Gar246/> The plan also called for the creation of a Central European federal union, without domination by any single state.<ref name=\"Gar246\"/> In the economic sector, [[planned economy]] would be endorsed, by embracing the socialist and [[Christian Democrat]] principles, such as [[redistribution of wealth|income redistribution]], aiming at a reduction of [[economic inequality]].<ref name=\"Kersten1991\"/><ref name=\"Kersten1991-2\"/> The plan promised [[land reform]], nationalization of the industrial base, demands for territorial compensation from Germany, and re-establishment of the country's pre-1939 eastern border.<ref name=\"Salm47\"/> According to the plan, the country's Eastern borders, as delineated by the 1921 Treaty of Riga, would be kept while in the north and west compensation would be sought from  German territories.<ref name=Gar246/> Thus, the main differences between the Underground State and the communists, in terms of politics, were not rooted in radical economic and social reforms, which both sides advocated, but rather in their divergent positions on such issues as national sovereignty, borders, and Polish-Soviet relations.<ref name=\"Salm47\"/> The program was criticized by the nationalist factions, for being too socialist, and not \"Christian\" enough.<ref name=\"Kersten1991-2\"/>\n\nThe Underground State achieved its zenith of influence in early 1944.<ref name=\"Salm47\"/> In April, the Polish government in exile recognized the administrative structure of the Delegate's Office as the Temporary Governmental Administration.<ref name=\"Salm48\"/> This was when the Delegate officially became recognized as the Deputy Prime Minister, and the [[Council of Ministers at Home]] (Krajowa Rada Ministr\u00f3w, KRM) was created.<ref name=Gar234/> The Underground State however declined sharply in the aftermath of the nationwide uprising, [[Operation Tempest]], initiated in the Spring of 1944.<ref name=\"Salm48-49\"/> In addition to the costly and eventually unsuccessful [[Warsaw Uprising]] part of the Operation Tempest, the hostile attitude of the [[Soviet Union]] and its puppet Polish government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego, PKWN) towards the non-communist resistance loyal to the Polish government in exile proved to be disastrous.<ref name=\"Salm48-49\"/> The Underground State assumed that the Polish resistance would aid the advancing Soviet forces, and AK commanders and representatives of the administrative authority would assume the role of legitimate hosts.<ref name=Ostasz/> Instead, the Soviets commonly surrounded, disarmed and arrested the Underground's military authority members and its civilian representatives, instituting their own administrative structures instead.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/><ref name=\"Gar245\"/> In early July 1944, even as the AK resistance continued its struggle against the Germans, the Underground State was forced to order the AK and its administrative structure to remain in hiding from the Soviets, due to continued arrests and reprisals experienced by those who revealed themselves.<ref name=Ostasz/>\n\n===1944\u20131945: Decline and dissolution===\nEvents taking place in 1943 significantly weakened the Polish government in exile. A rift developed between Poland and the Soviet Union, an increasingly important ally for the West, particularly after the revelation of the [[Katyn massacre]] in 1943 (on 13 April), followed by the breaking-off of diplomatic relations with Poland by the Soviets (on 21 April). The subsequent death (on 4 July) of the charismatic General Sikorski, succeeded by less influential [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] as the Prime Minister, and General Sosnkowski as the Commander-in-Chief, contributed to the decline.<ref name=\"Pra\u017cmowska1995\">{{cite book|author=Anita Pra\u017cmowska|title=Britain and Poland, 1939\u20131943: the betrayed ally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4J2c4jEhjYC&pg=PA184|accessdate=28 March 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48385-8|page=184}}</ref><ref name=\"Gar243\"/><ref name=\"Alterman2005\"/><ref name=\"Dallas2006\"/><ref name=\"Lerski1996\"/><ref name=\"Pra\u017cmowska1995-3\">{{cite book|author=Anita Pra\u017cmowska|title=Britain and Poland, 1939\u20131943: the betrayed ally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4J2c4jEhjYC&pg=PA191|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48385-8|page=191}}</ref> No representative of the Polish government was invited to the [[Tehran Conference]] (28 November 28 \u2013 1 December 1943) or the [[Yalta Conference]] (4\u201311 February 1945), the two crucial events in which the Western Allies and the Soviet Union discussed the shape of the post-war world and decided on the fate of Poland, assigning it to the Soviet [[sphere of influence]].<ref name=Ostasz/><ref name=\"Biskupski2000\"/> In Teheran, neither [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] nor [[Franklin D.

Three departments were dedicated to war-related issues: the Department for Elimination of the Consequences of War, the Department for Public Works and Reconstruction, and the Department for Information and the Press; the other departments mirrored pre-war Polish ministries (e.g., Department of Post Offices and Telegraphs, or Department of the Treasury).<ref name=\"Salm75\"/> The Delegate's Office was divided into departments,<ref name=Gar226/><!--initially 20,--> 14 of which existed toward the end of the war; the full list included: the Presidential Department, the Department of Internal Affairs, Justice Department, Employment and Social Welfare Department, Agriculture Department, Treasury Department, Trade and Industry Department, Postal and Telegraph Services Department, the Department for Elimination  of the Consequences of War, Transport Department, Information and the Press, Department of Public Works and Reconstruction, Department of Education and Culture and the Department of National Defence.<ref name=Ostasz/>\n\nOn the geographical division level, the Delegation had local offices, dividing Polish territories into 16 [[voivodeships]], each under an underground [[voivode]], further divided into [[powiat]]s headed by [[starosta]]s, and with separate municipal bodies.<ref name=Ostasz/> In early 1944, the Delegation employed some 15,000 people in its administration; those were primarily older people, as the younger ones were recruited for the military side of the operations.<ref name=Ostasz/>\n\n===Military===\n{{Further|Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej|Armia Krajowa}}\n[[File:Armia krajowa 1 en.png|thumb|right|100|alt=See caption|Regional organization of Armia Krajowa in 1944]]\nThe military arm of the Polish Underground State consisted primarily of various branches of the Armia Krajowa (AK) and, until 1942, the [[Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej|Union of Armed Struggle]]. This arm of the state was designed to prepare the Polish society for a future fight for the country's liberation.

The [[Service for Poland's Victory|first elements]] of the Underground State were established in the final days of the [[Invasion of Poland|German and Soviet invasion of Poland]], in late September 1939. The Underground State was perceived by supporters as a legal continuation of the pre-war [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]] (and its institutions) that waged an armed struggle against the country's occupying powers: [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Underground State encompassed not only military resistance, one of the largest in the world,{{Ref label|b|b|none}} but also civilian structures, such as education, culture and social services.\n\nAlthough the Underground State enjoyed broad support throughout much of the war, it was not supported or recognized by the far left (communists). The nationalists from the [[National Radical Camp Falanga]] and [[National Radical Camp ABC]] opposed the German occupation of Poland and the two movements were quickly replaced by the [[Konfederacja Narodu]], a part of the Polish\nUnderground State which also included most members of the pre-war far-right. Influence of the communists eventually declined amid military reversals (most notably, the failure of the [[Warsaw Uprising]]) and the growing hostility of the USSR. The Soviet Union had created an alternative, puppet government in 1944 (the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]]) and ensured it formed the basis of [[Provisional Government of National Unity|the post-war government in Poland]]. During the Soviet-backed communist takeover of Poland at the end of the war, many Underground State members were prosecuted [[Trial of the Sixteen|as alleged traitors]] and died in captivity. [[Western betrayal|Abandoned]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], finding it impossible to negotiate with the Soviets, and wishing to avoid a civil war, the key institutions of the Underground State dissolved themselves in the first half of 1945.\n\nUltimately, hundreds of thousands of people were directly involved with various agencies of the Underground State ([[Armia Krajowa#Membership|the estimates for membership in Armia Krajowa]] alone are often given at approaching half a million people), and they were quietly supported by millions of Polish citizens. The rationale behind the creation of the secret civilian authority drew on the fact that the German and Soviet occupation of Poland was illegal. Hence, all institutions created by the occupying powers were considered illegal, and parallel Polish underground institutions were set up in accordance with [[Polish law]]. The scale of the Underground State was also inadvertently aided by the actions of the occupiers, whose attempts to destroy the Polish state, nation, and its culture, including  most importantly [[genocide|genocidal policies]] that targeted Polish citizens, fuelled popular support for the Polish resistance movement and  its development.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] era, research on the Underground State was curtailed by Polish communist officials, who instead emphasized the role that [[Armia Ludowa|communist partisans]] played in the anti-Nazi resistance. Hence, until recently, the bulk of research done on this topic was carried out by Polish scholars living in exile.\n\n==History==\n\n===1939\u20131940: Formation===\nIn many respects, the history of the Polish Underground State mirrors that of the Polish non-communist resistance in general. The Underground State traces its origins to the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski, SZP) organization, which was founded on 27 September 1939, one day before the [[siege of Warsaw (1939)|surrender of the Polish capital of Warsaw]], at a time when the Polish defeat in the [[German invasion of Poland]] (accompanied by the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet one]]) appeared inevitable.<ref name=\"Salm25\"/><ref name=\"Gar221\"/> SZP founder General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] received orders from Polish [[Commander-in-Chief]] Marshal [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] to organize and carry out the struggle in occupied Poland.<ref name=Gar221/><ref name=\"Salm26-27\"/> Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski decided that the organization he was creating needed to move beyond a strictly military format; and in line with the traditions of the underground [[Polish National Government (January Uprising)|19th-century Polish National Government]] and [[World War I]]-era [[Polish Military Organization]], it would need to encompass various aspects of civilian life.<ref name=\"Salm27\"/> Hence, the SZP, in contact with (and subordinate to) the [[Polish Government in Exile]], envisioned itself not only as an armed resistance organization, but also as a vehicle through which the Polish state continued to administer its occupied territories.<ref name=\"Salm30-31\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[April Constitution of Poland|Polish Constitution]], President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]], interned in [[Romania]] after the Polish government evacuated itself from Poland on 17 September, resigned and appointed General [[Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski]] as his successor; unpopular with the French government, Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski was replaced by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz]] on 29 September.<ref name=\"Stachura2004\"/><ref name=\"BiskupskiPula2010-141\"/><ref name=\"Lerski1996-Mosc\"/> General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], a long-term opponent of the [[Sanacja]] regime who resided in France and had the support of the French government, would become the Polish Commander-in-Chief (on 28 September) and Poland's [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] (on 30 September).<ref name=\"BiskupskiPula2010-141\"/><ref name=Gar222/><ref name=\"Keegan2002\"/> This government was quickly recognized by France and the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Gar223\"/> Raczkiewicz, described as \"weak and indecisive\", held relatively little influence compared to charismatic Sikorski.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anita Pra\u017cmowska|title=Britain and Poland, 1939\u20131943: the betrayed ally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4J2c4jEhjYC&pg=PA10|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48385-8|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nDue to political differences among factions in the Polish exile government, and in particular, SZP ties to the Sanacja regime which dominated the Polish government since mid-1920s, the SZP was reorganized into the [[Union of Armed Struggle]] (Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ) on 13 November 1939.<ref name=Gar223/><ref name=\"Salm31-33\"/> Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported that move, aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja regime, and supported the formation of the [[Main Political Council]] (G\u0142\u00f3wna Rada Polityczna, GRP).<ref name=\"Gar222\"/> Sikorski named General [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] the head of the ZWZ and Colonel [[Stefan Rowecki]] was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski became the commander of the ZWZ Soviet zone, but was arrested in March 1940 by the Soviets when attempting to cross the new German-Soviet border.<ref name=Gar223/> In June Sikorski appointed [[Stefan Rowecki|Rowecki]] as the commander of both zones.<ref name=Gar223/>\n\n[[File:Wladyslaw Sikorski 2.jpg|thumb|[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], Polish commander in chief and prime minister during World War II]]\nGiven that the ZWZ focused on military aspects of the struggle, its civilian dimension was less clearly defined and developed more slowly\u2014a situation exacerbated by the complex political discussions that were then unfolding between politicians in occupied Poland and the [[government in exile]] (first located in Paris, and after the [[fall of France]], in London).<ref name=Gar222/><ref name=\"Salm33-36\"/><ref name=\"Salm39\"/> Sikorski's government opted for a much more democratic procedure then the less democratic prewar Sanacja regime.<ref name=\"BiskupskiPula2010-141\"/><ref name=\"BiskupskiPula2010-142\"/><ref name=\"BiskupskiPula2010-15\"/> The [[National Council of Poland|National Council]] (Rada Narodowa) was formed by the government in exile in December 1939, including representatives from different Polish political factions.<ref name=\"BiskupskiPula2010-141\"/> Meanwhile, in occupied Poland, a major step toward the development of the organization's civilian structure was taken in late February 1940, when the ZWZ established its local version of the National Council, the [[Political Consultative Committee]] (Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy, PKP).<ref name=\"Salm33-36\"/><ref name=\"Gar224\"/> The structures in occupied Poland maintained close communication with the government in exile, through radio communications and \"hundreds, if not thousands\" of couriers, such as [[Jan Karski]].<ref name=\"Koskodan2009\"/><ref name=\"Struk2011\"/><ref name=\"Struk2004\"/> One of the most significant developments of 1940 was the creation of the office of [[Government Delegation for Poland]] (Delegatura Rz\u0105du na Kraj), with [[Cyryl Ratajski]] (nominated on 3 December) as the first [[List of Government Delegates for Poland|Delegate]]; this event marked the official beginning of the Underground State (Ratajski would be followed by [[Jan Pieka\u0142kiewicz]], [[Jan Stanis\u0142aw Jankowski]] and [[Stefan Korbo\u0144ski]]).<ref name=\"Salm37\"/><ref name=Ostasz/> The post of the Delegate could be seen as equivalent to that of a Deputy Prime Minister (particularly since the legislation of 1944).<ref name=Ostasz/><ref name=\"Gar234\"/> Unlike the GRP and PKP, which operated alongside the military structures but had no influence over them, the Delegation had budgetary control over the military.<ref name=\"Gar225-226\"/> The Delegation was to oversee the military, and recreate the civilian administration.<ref name=Gar225-226/>\n\nAs early as 1940, the Underground State's civilian arm was actively supporting [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground education]];<ref name=\"Salm37\"/> it then set out to develop [[social security]], information (propaganda) and [[Directorate of Civil Resistance|justice]] networks.<ref name=\"Salm42\"/><ref name=\"Salm44\"/><ref name=\"Salm46\"/>\n\n===1941\u20131943: Growth===\nBy 1942, most of the differences between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled.<ref name=\"Salm45-46\"/> By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the [[Home Political Representation]] (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served as the basis of the [[Council of National Unity]] (Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944.<ref name=\"Salm44-45\"/> The Council, headed by [[Kazimierz Pu\u017cak]], was seen as the Underground State's parliament.<ref name=\"Kersten1991\"/> Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into [[Armia Krajowa]] (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942.<ref name=\"Salm45\"/> ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, [[Tadeusz Komorowski]] and [[Leopold Okulicki]].<ref name=\"MNK\"/>\n{{Polish statehood}}\n\nIn August 1943 and March 1944, the Polish Underground State announced its long-term plan, which was partly designed to undercut the attractiveness of some of the communists' proposals.<ref name=\"Salm47\"/> The communists, in their increasingly radical ''What We Fight For'' declarations (from March and November 1943), were proposing the creation of a heavily socialist or even [[communist state]], denouncing capitalism, which they equated to slavery.<ref name=\"Korbo\u0144ski1981\"/> They demanded [[nationalization]] of most if not all of the economy, introduction of [[central planning]],<ref name=\"Korbo\u0144ski1981\"/><ref name=\"Buszko1983\"/> The Underground State's declaration ''What the Polish Nation is Fighting For'' declared the reconstruction of Poland as a democratic parliamentary state as its goal, guaranteeing full equality to the minorities, as well as full [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion]], and freedom of political activity.<ref name=\"Kersten1991\"/><ref name=Gar246/> The plan also called for the creation of a Central European federal union, without domination by any single state.<ref name=\"Gar246\"/> In the economic sector, [[planned economy]] would be endorsed, by embracing the socialist and [[Christian Democrat]] principles, such as [[redistribution of wealth|income redistribution]], aiming at a reduction of [[economic inequality]].<ref name=\"Kersten1991\"/><ref name=\"Kersten1991-2\"/> The plan promised [[land reform]], nationalization of the industrial base, demands for territorial compensation from Germany, and re-establishment of the country's pre-1939 eastern border.<ref name=\"Salm47\"/> According to the plan, the country's Eastern borders, as delineated by the 1921 Treaty of Riga, would be kept while in the north and west compensation would be sought from  German territories.<ref name=Gar246/> Thus, the main differences between the Underground State and the communists, in terms of politics, were not rooted in radical economic and social reforms, which both sides advocated, but rather in their divergent positions on such issues as national sovereignty, borders, and Polish-Soviet relations.<ref name=\"Salm47\"/> The program was criticized by the nationalist factions, for being too socialist, and not \"Christian\" enough.<ref name=\"Kersten1991-2\"/>\n\nThe Underground State achieved its zenith of influence in early 1944.<ref name=\"Salm47\"/> In April, the Polish government in exile recognized the administrative structure of the Delegate's Office as the Temporary Governmental Administration.<ref name=\"Salm48\"/> This was when the Delegate officially became recognized as the Deputy Prime Minister, and the [[Council of Ministers at Home]] (Krajowa Rada Ministr\u00f3w, KRM) was created.<ref name=Gar234/> The Underground State however declined sharply in the aftermath of the nationwide uprising, [[Operation Tempest]], initiated in the Spring of 1944.<ref name=\"Salm48-49\"/> In addition to the costly and eventually unsuccessful [[Warsaw Uprising]] part of the Operation Tempest, the hostile attitude of the [[Soviet Union]] and its puppet Polish government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego, PKWN) towards the non-communist resistance loyal to the Polish government in exile proved to be disastrous.<ref name=\"Salm48-49\"/> The Underground State assumed that the Polish resistance would aid the advancing Soviet forces, and AK commanders and representatives of the administrative authority would assume the role of legitimate hosts.<ref name=Ostasz/> Instead, the Soviets commonly surrounded, disarmed and arrested the Underground's military authority members and its civilian representatives, instituting their own administrative structures instead.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/><ref name=\"Gar245\"/> In early July 1944, even as the AK resistance continued its struggle against the Germans, the Underground State was forced to order the AK and its administrative structure to remain in hiding from the Soviets, due to continued arrests and reprisals experienced by those who revealed themselves.<ref name=Ostasz/>\n\n===1944\u20131945: Decline and dissolution===\nEvents taking place in 1943 significantly weakened the Polish government in exile. A rift developed between Poland and the Soviet Union, an increasingly important ally for the West, particularly after the revelation of the [[Katyn massacre]] in 1943 (on 13 April), followed by the breaking-off of diplomatic relations with Poland by the Soviets (on 21 April). The subsequent death (on 4 July) of the charismatic General Sikorski, succeeded by less influential [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] as the Prime Minister, and General Sosnkowski as the Commander-in-Chief, contributed to the decline.<ref name=\"Pra\u017cmowska1995\">{{cite book|author=Anita Pra\u017cmowska|title=Britain and Poland, 1939\u20131943: the betrayed ally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4J2c4jEhjYC&pg=PA184|accessdate=28 March 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48385-8|page=184}}</ref><ref name=\"Gar243\"/><ref name=\"Alterman2005\"/><ref name=\"Dallas2006\"/><ref name=\"Lerski1996\"/><ref name=\"Pra\u017cmowska1995-3\">{{cite book|author=Anita Pra\u017cmowska|title=Britain and Poland, 1939\u20131943: the betrayed ally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4J2c4jEhjYC&pg=PA191|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48385-8|page=191}}</ref> No representative of the Polish government was invited to the [[Tehran Conference]] (28 November 28 \u2013 1 December 1943) or the [[Yalta Conference]] (4\u201311 February 1945), the two crucial events in which the Western Allies and the Soviet Union discussed the shape of the post-war world and decided on the fate of Poland, assigning it to the Soviet [[sphere of influence]].<ref name=Ostasz/><ref name=\"Biskupski2000\"/> In Teheran, neither [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] nor [[Franklin D.

Three departments were dedicated to war-related issues: the Department for Elimination of the Consequences of War, the Department for Public Works and Reconstruction, and the Department for Information and the Press; the other departments mirrored pre-war Polish ministries (e.g., Department of Post Offices and Telegraphs, or Department of the Treasury).<ref name=\"Salm75\"/> The Delegate's Office was divided into departments,<ref name=Gar226/><!--initially 20,--> 14 of which existed toward the end of the war; the full list included: the Presidential Department, the Department of Internal Affairs, Justice Department, Employment and Social Welfare Department, Agriculture Department, Treasury Department, Trade and Industry Department, Postal and Telegraph Services Department, the Department for Elimination  of the Consequences of War, Transport Department, Information and the Press, Department of Public Works and Reconstruction, Department of Education and Culture and the Department of National Defence.<ref name=Ostasz/>\n\nOn the geographical division level, the Delegation had local offices, dividing Polish territories into 16 [[voivodeships]], each under an underground [[voivode]], further divided into [[powiat]]s headed by [[starosta]]s, and with separate municipal bodies.<ref name=Ostasz/> In early 1944, the Delegation employed some 15,000 people in its administration; those were primarily older people, as the younger ones were recruited for the military side of the operations.<ref name=Ostasz/>\n\n===Military===\n{{Further|Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej|Armia Krajowa}}\n[[File:Armia krajowa 1 en.png|thumb|right|100|alt=See caption|Regional organization of Armia Krajowa in 1944]]\nThe military arm of the Polish Underground State consisted primarily of various branches of the Armia Krajowa (AK) and, until 1942, the [[Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej|Union of Armed Struggle]]. This arm of the state was designed to prepare the Polish society for a future fight for the country's liberation.
