Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG01\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG02\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]].<ref name=\"RG19\">Roche, (2005)</ref> The Miguelite-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.<ref name=\"RG03\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG04\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]].<ref name=\"RG05\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG06\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG07\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG08\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.<ref name=\"RG09\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG10\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelites fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelites fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to [[Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelites fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelites fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros.<ref name=\"RG11\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG12\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelites prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.<ref name=\"RG15\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG16\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|restored Portuguese parliament]]. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|parliamentary]] seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.<ref name=\"RG17\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG18\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n== Order of

Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelist ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Liberal and Miguelist armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelist army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.<ref name=\"RG15\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG16\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|restored Portuguese parliament]]. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|parliamentary]] seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.<ref name=\"RG17\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG18\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n== Order of

He was [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench]] from 1756 to 1788. Murray had already been created '''Baron Mansfield''', in the County of Nottingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1756, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. The two earldoms were created with different remainders. The 1776 earldom was created with remainder to Louisa Murray (n\u00e9e Cathcart), Viscountess Stormont (daughter of [[Charles Schaw Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart]]), second wife of his nephew [[David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield|David Murray, 7th Viscount of Stormont]], while the 1792 earldom, referring to a fictitious Mansfield in Middlesex to differentiate it from the first earldom,<ref>''The Complete Peerage'', vol. viii, p. 388, footnote (d)</ref> was created with remainder to his nephew the Viscount of Stormont.\n\nLord Mansfield was childless and on his death in 1793, the barony became extinct. He was succeeded in the 1776 earldom according to the special remainder by his nephew's wife Louisa, the second Countess, and in the 1792 earldom according to the special remainder by his nephew Lord Stormont, who became the second Earl. The latter was a noted politician in his own right and served as [[Lord Justice General]], [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]] and [[Lord President of the Council]]. He was succeeded by his and the Countess of Mansfield's son, the third Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was [[Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire]]. On his death, the title passed to his son, the fourth Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was a [[Tory]] politician and served as a [[Lord of the Treasury]] from 1834 to 1835 in the [[Tory Government 1834-1835|first administration]] of [[Sir Robert Peel]]. In 1843, he succeeded his grandmother the Countess of Mansfield (who had outlived her husband by forty-seven years) and became in addition the third Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation.\n\nHe was succeeded by his grandson, the fifth and fourth Earl. He was the eldest son of William David Murray, Viscount of Stormont. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth and fifth Earl. His son, the seventh and sixth Earl, represented [[Perth (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Perthshire]]. The [[William Murray, 8th Earl of Mansfield|eighth and seventh Earl of Mansfield]] held office in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as a [[Minister of State]] at the [[Scottish Office]] from 1979 to 1983, and at the [[Northern Ireland Office]] from 1983 to 1984. The titles are presently held by his elder son, the ninth Earl of Mansfield of the 1792 creation and the eighth Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation.

He was succeeded by his and the Countess of Mansfield's son, the third Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was [[Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire]]. On his death, the title passed to his son, the fourth Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was a [[Tory]] politician and served as a [[Lord of the Treasury]] from 1834 to 1835 in the [[Tory Government 1834-1835|first administration]] of [[Sir Robert Peel]]. In 1843, he succeeded his grandmother the Countess of Mansfield (who had outlived her husband by forty-seven years) and became in addition the third Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation.\n\nHe was succeeded by his grandson, the fifth and fourth Earl. He was the eldest son of William David Murray, Viscount of Stormont. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth and fifth Earl. His son, the seventh and sixth Earl, represented [[Perth (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Perthshire]]. The [[William Murray, 8th Earl of Mansfield|eighth and seventh Earl of Mansfield]] held office in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as a [[Minister of State]] at the [[Scottish Office]] from 1979 to 1983, and at the [[Northern Ireland Office]] from 1983 to 1984. The titles are presently held by his elder son, the ninth Earl of Mansfield of the 1792 creation and the eighth Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation. He is also the fifteenth [[Viscount of Stormont]], the fifteenth Lord Scone and the thirteenth [[Lord Balvaird]].\n\nThe family seat is [[Scone Palace]], near [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], [[Perthshire]].

It was founded in 1950 by members of the [[Churches of Christ]].\n\n==History==\nOklahoma Christian University was originally named '''Central Christian College'''. It opened as a two-year college in 1950 with 97 students in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma|Bartlesville]] on the {{convert|152|acre}} former estate of Henry Vernon \"H.V.\" Foster, a prominent oil businessman. L.R. Wilson was the college's first president, having founded [[Florida College|Florida Christian College]] four years before. Harold Fletcher, who became an OC emeritus professor of music, was the first faculty member hired for the new college. James O. Baird became the school's second president in 1954. Soon after, plans were made to move the campus to Oklahoma City. Groundbreaking occurred on {{convert|200|acre}} the far north edge of Oklahoma City in 1957 and the university was relocated in 1958. It was renamed '''Oklahoma Christian College''' in 1959 and began offering the [[bachelor's degree]], with its first senior class graduating in 1962. Full [[School accreditation|accreditation]] was obtained from the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1965. \n\nIn the 1990s, the school restructured its academic departments into separate colleges and the name of the institution was changed initially to '''Oklahoma Christian University of Science and Arts''' before being truncated to \"Oklahoma Christian University\". In 1981, OC became the sponsor of ''[[The Christian Chronicle]]''.\n\nIn 2020, a recruiter for the university visited [[Harding Charter Preparatory High School|Harding Charter Preparatory]] in [[Oklahoma City]] and forced the high school students to line up by the color of their skin, from \"darkest to lightest skin complexion\". He then told the students to shuffle again, \"nappiest hair in the back and straighter hair in the front\". The university fired the recruiter shortly afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yager |first1=Peyton |title=College recruiter fired after lining students by skin color & hair texture at metro high school |url=https://kfor.com/news/local/college-recruiter-fired-after-lining-students-by-skin-color-hair-texture-at-metro-high-school/ |publisher=Oklahoma's News 4 |accessdate=15 March 2020 |date=28 February 2020}}</ref> \n\n==Technology==\nIn August 2001, OC became one of the few college campuses in the US, and the only in the state, to provide a campus-wide [[wireless Internet]] service and a personal [[laptop computer]] to every full-time student.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/1111.wss | title=Colleges, Universities And K-12 Give Mobile Computing A+ As Schools Flock To IBM For Wireless ThinkPad Computers |publisher=IBM |date= |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> In 2008, Oklahoma Christian University began providing [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[MacBook]] to all full-time students and faculty. Included with each MacBook was the choice of an [[iPhone]] or an [[iPod touch]]. Beginning with the fall 2010 semester, students also had the option of choosing an [[iPad]] for an additional charge. OC now provides innovative information technology support for a \"Bring Your Own Device\" model. In 2013, OC's mobile computing program was honored as an Apple Distinguished Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsok.com/article/3762031/oklahoma-christian-university-named-apple-distinguished-program | title=Oklahoma Christian University Named Apple Distinguished Program |publisher= |website=newsok.com |date= |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nAll [[bachelor's degree]]s at OC require the completion of at least 126 semester hours. Not less than 30 hours must be earned in courses numbered 3000 or above, including at least 10 hours in the major field. Bachelor's degrees require completion of a core curriculum of 60 semester hour consisting of \"Basic Skills\" (14 hours), Bible (16 hours), \"Basic Perspectives\" (27 hours) and a 3-hour senior [[philosophy]] seminar<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155431/http://www.oc.edu/academics/documents/Catalog2010-11.pdf ]</ref>\n\nThe university offers an honors program for highly motivated and skilled students. Honors program participants must have a high school GPA of 3.5 or higher, a minimum score on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] of 28 or [[SAT]] of 1250, evidence of writing skills, and be selected by interview.\n\nThrough its Office of International Studies, OC offers semester-long study programs in [[Europe]], based in the university's Das Millicanhaus in [[Vienna, Austria]]. OC also has shorter study abroad options in [[Asia]] and [[Honduras]], plus additional options through the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU).\n\n===Faculty===\nOC employs 92 full-time faculty members, more than 70 percent of whom hold a terminal degree in their respective fields. The undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio is 14-to-1. 84 percent of classes contain fewer than 30 students.<ref name=\"oc.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oc.edu/about/universityprofile.aspx |title=University Profile  |publisher=Oklahoma Christian University |date= |accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Presidents====\n* L.

Prior to this, in 2012, Oklahoma Christian joined the [[NCAA]] Division II [[Heartland Conference]] as part of its candidacy for full membership in NCAA Division II. OC also joined the National Christian College Athletic Association in 2012. The Eagles and Lady Eagles field varsity teams in [[baseball]], men's and women's [[basketball]], men's and women's  [[cross country running|cross country]], men's and women's  [[golf]], men's and women's  [[soccer]], [[softball]], men's and women's [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], men's and women's  [[track and field]] and women's [[volleyball]].\n\n==Campus==\nOklahoma Christian University is located {{convert|2|miles}} west of U.S. [[Interstate 35]] just south of the north Oklahoma City suburb of [[Edmond, Oklahoma|Edmond]]. While it is widely believed to be inside Edmond city limits, the campus is actually in Oklahoma City. The {{convert|240|acre}} campus is bounded by East Memorial Road to the south, Smiling Hills Boulevard to the north, S. Boulevard/N. Eastern Avenue to the west, and Benson Road and N. Bryant Road to the east. The main entrance to the campus is on Memorial Road and is marked by a large pond with a fountain. The campus contains more than 30 major buildings, with the majority built in an [[International style (architecture)|International]] and [[Mid-Century modern]]-influenced architectural style, unified through the use of red brick with light-colored stone ornamentations.\n\nThe main entrance leads directly to the center of the campus. Prominently located in this area is the Williams-Branch Center for Biblical Studies (1987), which contains Scott Chapel. Directly north of Scott Chapel is the Mabee Learning Center (1966), which houses the Tom & Ada Beam Library, the Honors Program and the Department of Language and Literature. The Beam Library contains more than 110,000 books and media, almost 30,000 electronic books and access to more than 8,000 [[periodicals]] in electronic or print format. Located between the Williams-Branch Center and the library's front entrance is the Thelma Gaylord Forum (1987), a heavily landscaped public space and [[amphitheatre]] intended as a relaxing study area and a site for outdoor performances and events.\n\nEast of the Mabee Learning Center are four of OC's earliest buildings, dating from 1959. Benson Hall housed the business office for many years, but returned to its original use as the main administrative building in 2013. Cogswell-Alexander Hall contains the registrar's office and information technology offices. Gaylord Hall is the site of the admissions and financial aid offices. Vose Hall contains science laboratoriess and classrooms. These buildings center around the university's original [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] and fountain. North of the original quadrangle is the Davisson American Heritage (DAH) Building (1970), which houses the Department of History and Political Science, the Department of  Psychology and Family Studies and the School of Education. North of DAH is the Noble Science Wing (2011) and Herold Science Hall, site of OC's student undergraduate research program, {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and the Prince Engineering Center (1988), is the location of OC's School of [[Engineering]] and its [[ABET]]-certified mechanical, electrical and computer Engineering programs.\n\nLocated east of the main entrance is the 1,268-seat Baugh Auditorium, the main campus venue for performances and convocations. McIntosh Conservatory, an open meeting and performance space, links Baugh Auditorium with the Garvey Center (1978), consisting of Mabee Hall and Kresge Hall. Contained within the buildings are the Mabee Communications Center and the Fletcher Center for Music. Included in these areas are classroom, offices and studios for OC's Communications and Music departments. Also contained within this complex is the 275-seat Judd Theatre, designed for thrust or [[proscenium theatre]] productions, and the 190-seat Adams Recital Hall, an elegant and traditional space for solo and small group music performances.\n\nEast of Baugh Auditorium is the Harvey Business Center (1980), housing the School of Business Administration and OC's Information Technology Services. Also in this area of campus is the building originally designed for \"Enterprise Square USA\",  an interactive museum dedicated to the promotion of American citizenship and free enterprise which operated from 1982 to 2002. OC's alumni and advancement offices currently operate out of this facility.\n\nThe areas on the west side of the campus are largely devoted to student residences and recreation. The Gaylord University Center (1976/1997) contains the cafeteria, a snack bar, bookstore, health center, recreation areas and the Student Life and Student Government Association offices. North of the Gaylord University Center is the Payne Athletic Center (1970), site of a campus fitness facility, [[Olympic-size swimming pool]], the Physical Education and Athletics Department offices and the \"Eagles' Nest\" gymnasium \u2013 OC's home court for basketball competitions. In 2007, ''The Oklahoman'' named the Eagles' Nest as one of the top-100 athletic venues in state history.\n\nSome of the newest additions to the campus lie between these buildings and the dormitories to the west. Lawson Commons, an outdoor mall area, contains McGraw Pavilion, a unique covered outdoor event space, and the Freede Centennial Tower, a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} clock tower that stands as a focal point on campus and commemorates the 2007 Oklahoma state [[centennial]]. In October 2009, the campus received a gift of more than 1,300 trees in five varieties through a partnership between the Tree Bank Foundation and the [[Apache Foundation]] that were planted across the campus.\n\nIn 2013, OC opened the Boker-Wedel Eagle Trail, a 5&nbsp;km path around the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmondsun.com/local/x1400166280/OCs-Eagle-Trail-takes-flight|title=Edmond Sun}}</ref> The side-by-side asphalt and crushed granite running paths span a distance of 3.1 miles around the campus and have lighting, landscaping and security phones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oc.edu/organizations/team-oc/documents/Eagle-Trail-Map.pdf|title = Trail Map|publisher=Oklahoma Christian University}}</ref> The trail connects with the growing Edmond running trails system and will eventually connect with the Oklahoma City running trails system.\n\nIn April 2016, the university unveiled Hartman Place, a scripture garden and waterfall to be used as a place of devotion and reflection. One of the features of Hartman Place is a space designated for students to write, using chalk on slate, remembrances of loved ones they have lost.\n\nOC provides almost 1,800 on-campus living spaces in 11 residence halls and nine apartment complexes. Dormitories are located on the western end of the campus. Apartment complexes, available to upperclass and married students, are located across Benson Road on the east end of campus\n\nThe northern-most portions of the campus contain outdoor venues for soccer, softball  (Tom Heath Field at Lawson Plaza), track and field (Vaughn Track), baseball (Dobson Field) and intramural sports.\n\n==OC policies==\nThe university is guided by six \"defining values\": Faith, Scholarship, Integrity, Stewardship, Liberty and Leadership.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oc.edu/services/handbook/documents/2010-2011StudentHandbook.pdf |title=Student Handbook |publisher=Oklahoma Christian University |date= |accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> OC retains a commitment to traditional biblical principles as expressed through the \"Oklahoma Christian Covenant\", which emphasizes that the \"values and behavior of this Christian community are derived from the Bible\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The covenant is described by the university as:\n\n{{quote|not a creed demanding strict belief in its veracity and inerrancy, and it is not merely an ideal to which we aspire; rather, it is a personal commitment that while we are members of this community, we will abide by the principles and ideals set forth in the covenant.

It was founded in 1950 by members of the [[Churches of Christ]].\n\n==History==\nOklahoma Christian University was originally named '''Central Christian College'''. It opened as a two-year college in 1950 with 97 students in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma|Bartlesville]] on the {{convert|152|acre}} former estate of Henry Vernon \"H.V.\" Foster, a prominent oil businessman. L.R. Wilson was the college's first president, having founded [[Florida College|Florida Christian College]] four years before. Harold Fletcher, who became an OC emeritus professor of music, was the first faculty member hired for the new college. James O. Baird became the school's second president in 1954. Soon after, plans were made to move the campus to Oklahoma City. Groundbreaking occurred on {{convert|200|acre}} the far north edge of Oklahoma City in 1957 and the university was relocated in 1958. It was renamed '''Oklahoma Christian College''' in 1959 and began offering the [[bachelor's degree]], with its first senior class graduating in 1962. Full [[School accreditation|accreditation]] was obtained from the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1965. \n\nIn the 1990s, the school restructured its academic departments into separate colleges and the name of the institution was changed initially to '''Oklahoma Christian University of Science and Arts''' before being truncated to \"Oklahoma Christian University\". In 1981, OC became the sponsor of ''[[The Christian Chronicle]]''.\n\nIn 2020, a recruiter for the university visited [[Harding Charter Preparatory High School|Harding Charter Preparatory]] in [[Oklahoma City]] and forced the high school students to line up by the color of their skin, from \"darkest to lightest skin complexion\". He then told the students to shuffle again, \"nappiest hair in the back and straighter hair in the front\". The university fired the recruiter shortly afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yager |first1=Peyton |title=College recruiter fired after lining students by skin color & hair texture at metro high school |url=https://kfor.com/news/local/college-recruiter-fired-after-lining-students-by-skin-color-hair-texture-at-metro-high-school/ |publisher=Oklahoma's News 4 |accessdate=15 March 2020 |date=28 February 2020}}</ref> \n\n==Technology==\nIn August 2001, OC became one of the few college campuses in the US, and the only in the state, to provide a campus-wide [[wireless Internet]] service and a personal [[laptop computer]] to every full-time student.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/1111.wss | title=Colleges, Universities And K-12 Give Mobile Computing A+ As Schools Flock To IBM For Wireless ThinkPad Computers |publisher=IBM |date= |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> In 2008, Oklahoma Christian University began providing [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[MacBook]] to all full-time students and faculty. Included with each MacBook was the choice of an [[iPhone]] or an [[iPod touch]]. Beginning with the fall 2010 semester, students also had the option of choosing an [[iPad]] for an additional charge. OC now provides innovative information technology support for a \"Bring Your Own Device\" model. In 2013, OC's mobile computing program was honored as an Apple Distinguished Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsok.com/article/3762031/oklahoma-christian-university-named-apple-distinguished-program | title=Oklahoma Christian University Named Apple Distinguished Program |publisher= |website=newsok.com |date= |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nAll [[bachelor's degree]]s at OC require the completion of at least 126 semester hours. Not less than 30 hours must be earned in courses numbered 3000 or above, including at least 10 hours in the major field. Bachelor's degrees require completion of a core curriculum of 60 semester hour consisting of \"Basic Skills\" (14 hours), Bible (16 hours), \"Basic Perspectives\" (27 hours) and a 3-hour senior [[philosophy]] seminar<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155431/http://www.oc.edu/academics/documents/Catalog2010-11.pdf ]</ref>\n\nThe university offers an honors program for highly motivated and skilled students. Honors program participants must have a high school GPA of 3.5 or higher, a minimum score on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] of 28 or [[SAT]] of 1250, evidence of writing skills, and be selected by interview.\n\nThrough its Office of International Studies, OC offers semester-long study programs in [[Europe]], based in the university's Das Millicanhaus in [[Vienna, Austria]]. OC also has shorter study abroad options in [[Asia]] and [[Honduras]], plus additional options through the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU).\n\n===Faculty===\nOC employs 92 full-time faculty members, more than 70 percent of whom hold a terminal degree in their respective fields. The undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio is 14-to-1. 84 percent of classes contain fewer than 30 students.<ref name=\"oc.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oc.edu/about/universityprofile.aspx |title=University Profile  |publisher=Oklahoma Christian University |date= |accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Presidents====\n* L.

Prior to this, in 2012, Oklahoma Christian joined the [[NCAA]] Division II [[Heartland Conference]] as part of its candidacy for full membership in NCAA Division II. OC also joined the National Christian College Athletic Association in 2012. The Eagles and Lady Eagles field varsity teams in [[baseball]], men's and women's [[basketball]], men's and women's  [[cross country running|cross country]], men's and women's  [[golf]], men's and women's  [[soccer]], [[softball]], men's and women's [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], men's and women's  [[track and field]] and women's [[volleyball]].\n\n==Campus==\nOklahoma Christian University is located {{convert|2|miles}} west of U.S. [[Interstate 35]] just south of the north Oklahoma City suburb of [[Edmond, Oklahoma|Edmond]]. While it is widely believed to be inside Edmond city limits, the campus is actually in Oklahoma City. The {{convert|240|acre}} campus is bounded by East Memorial Road to the south, Smiling Hills Boulevard to the north, S. Boulevard/N. Eastern Avenue to the west, and Benson Road and N. Bryant Road to the east. The main entrance to the campus is on Memorial Road and is marked by a large pond with a fountain. The campus contains more than 30 major buildings, with the majority built in an [[International style (architecture)|International]] and [[Mid-Century modern]]-influenced architectural style, unified through the use of red brick with light-colored stone ornamentations.\n\nThe main entrance leads directly to the center of the campus. Prominently located in this area is the Williams-Branch Center for Biblical Studies (1987), which contains Scott Chapel. Directly north of Scott Chapel is the Mabee Learning Center (1966), which houses the Tom & Ada Beam Library, the Honors Program and the Department of Language and Literature. The Beam Library contains more than 110,000 books and media, almost 30,000 electronic books and access to more than 8,000 [[periodicals]] in electronic or print format. Located between the Williams-Branch Center and the library's front entrance is the Thelma Gaylord Forum (1987), a heavily landscaped public space and [[amphitheatre]] intended as a relaxing study area and a site for outdoor performances and events.\n\nEast of the Mabee Learning Center are four of OC's earliest buildings, dating from 1959. Benson Hall housed the business office for many years, but returned to its original use as the main administrative building in 2013. Cogswell-Alexander Hall contains the registrar's office and information technology offices. Gaylord Hall is the site of the admissions and financial aid offices. Vose Hall contains science laboratoriess and classrooms. These buildings center around the university's original [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] and fountain. North of the original quadrangle is the Davisson American Heritage (DAH) Building (1970), which houses the Department of History and Political Science, the Department of  Psychology and Family Studies and the School of Education. North of DAH is the Noble Science Wing (2011) and Herold Science Hall, site of OC's student undergraduate research program, {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and the Prince Engineering Center (1988), is the location of OC's School of [[Engineering]] and its [[ABET]]-certified mechanical, electrical and computer Engineering programs.\n\nLocated east of the main entrance is the 1,268-seat Baugh Auditorium, the main campus venue for performances and convocations. McIntosh Conservatory, an open meeting and performance space, links Baugh Auditorium with the Garvey Center (1978), consisting of Mabee Hall and Kresge Hall. Contained within the buildings are the Mabee Communications Center and the Fletcher Center for Music. Included in these areas are classroom, offices and studios for OC's Communications and Music departments. Also contained within this complex is the 275-seat Judd Theatre, designed for thrust or [[proscenium theatre]] productions, and the 190-seat Adams Recital Hall, an elegant and traditional space for solo and small group music performances.\n\nEast of Baugh Auditorium is the Harvey Business Center (1980), housing the School of Business Administration and OC's Information Technology Services. Also in this area of campus is the building originally designed for \"Enterprise Square USA\",  an interactive museum dedicated to the promotion of American citizenship and free enterprise which operated from 1982 to 2002. OC's alumni and advancement offices currently operate out of this facility.\n\nThe areas on the west side of the campus are largely devoted to student residences and recreation. The Gaylord University Center (1976/1997) contains the cafeteria, a snack bar, bookstore, health center, recreation areas and the Student Life and Student Government Association offices. North of the Gaylord University Center is the Payne Athletic Center (1970), site of a campus fitness facility, [[Olympic-size swimming pool]], the Physical Education and Athletics Department offices and the \"Eagles' Nest\" gymnasium \u2013 OC's home court for basketball competitions. In 2007, ''The Oklahoman'' named the Eagles' Nest as one of the top-100 athletic venues in state history.\n\nSome of the newest additions to the campus lie between these buildings and the dormitories to the west. Lawson Commons, an outdoor mall area, contains McGraw Pavilion, a unique covered outdoor event space, and the Freede Centennial Tower, a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} clock tower that stands as a focal point on campus and commemorates the 2007 Oklahoma state [[centennial]]. In October 2009, the campus received a gift of more than 1,300 trees in five varieties through a partnership between the Tree Bank Foundation and the [[Apache Foundation]] that were planted across the campus.\n\nIn 2013, OC opened the Boker-Wedel Eagle Trail, a 5&nbsp;km path around the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmondsun.com/local/x1400166280/OCs-Eagle-Trail-takes-flight|title=Edmond Sun}}</ref> The side-by-side asphalt and crushed granite running paths span a distance of 3.1 miles around the campus and have lighting, landscaping and security phones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oc.edu/organizations/team-oc/documents/Eagle-Trail-Map.pdf|title = Trail Map|publisher=Oklahoma Christian University}}</ref> The trail connects with the growing Edmond running trails system and will eventually connect with the Oklahoma City running trails system.\n\nIn April 2016, the university unveiled Hartman Place, a scripture garden and waterfall to be used as a place of devotion and reflection. One of the features of Hartman Place is a space designated for students to write, using chalk on slate, remembrances of loved ones they have lost.\n\nOC provides almost 1,800 on-campus living spaces in 11 residence halls and nine apartment complexes. Dormitories are located on the western end of the campus. Apartment complexes, available to upperclass and married students, are located across Benson Road on the east end of campus\n\nThe northern-most portions of the campus contain outdoor venues for soccer, softball  (Tom Heath Field at Lawson Plaza), track and field (Vaughn Track), baseball (Dobson Field) and intramural sports.\n\n==OC policies==\nThe university is guided by six \"defining values\": Faith, Scholarship, Integrity, Stewardship, Liberty and Leadership.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oc.edu/services/handbook/documents/2010-2011StudentHandbook.pdf |title=Student Handbook |publisher=Oklahoma Christian University |date= |accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> OC retains a commitment to traditional biblical principles as expressed through the \"Oklahoma Christian Covenant\", which emphasizes that the \"values and behavior of this Christian community are derived from the Bible\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The covenant is described by the university as:\n\n{{quote|not a creed demanding strict belief in its veracity and inerrancy, and it is not merely an ideal to which we aspire; rather, it is a personal commitment that while we are members of this community, we will abide by the principles and ideals set forth in the covenant.

The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was inactivated as part of the phaseout of the Titan I ICBM on 25 March 1965.\n\nThe squadron was first activated during [[World War II]] as the '''568th Bombardment Squadron'''.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the [[European Theater of Operations]], where it participated in the [[strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|strategic bombing campaign against Germany]].  It was twice awarded the [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] for its actions in combat.  After [[V-E Day]], the squadron returned to the United States, where it was inactivated in August 1945.
