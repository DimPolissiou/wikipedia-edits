His deep understanding of the Qur'an, Hadith, Fiqah and Tasawwuf made him highly knowledgeable scholar at an early age.\n\nSince he believed that an emphasis of the Quranic teachings was made vital to Muslims, he translated Arabic Qur'an into Persian. Few Muslims spoke Arabic and so the Qur'an had not been widely studied previously. Some ''clerics'' criticised Shah Walliullah, but his work proved very popular. In addition to translating the [[Quran]], Shah Walliullah wrote 51 books in Persian and Arabic. Amongst the most famous were ''Hujjat Allah al-Baligha'' and ''Izalah al Khifa''.\n\nHis writings bought him great fame and prestige and enabled him to have influence in other areas too. One of his most important contributions to the Muslim community was his organisation of opposition to the [[Maratha Empire]], who had captured large parts of India which belonged to the [[Mughal Empire]] before and had reduced the Mughal emperor to a mere puppet. It was partly his influence which helped to persuade [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]] of Afghanistan to intervene. He joined forces with local Muslim leaders and defeated the Marathas at The [[Battle of Panipat in 1761]].\n\nHe felt a debt to the Sufis for spreading Islam throughout India. He also appreciated Sufi spirituality. Waliullah built a bridge between Sufis and the Ulama (Islamic scholars).<ref>K.J.

His deep understanding of the Qur'an, Hadith, Fiqah and Tasawwuf made him highly knowledgeable scholar at an early age.\n\nSince he believed that an emphasis of the Quranic teachings was made vital to Muslims, he translated Arabic Qur'an into Persian. Few Muslims spoke Arabic and so the Qur'an had not been widely studied previously. Some ''clerics'' criticised Shah Walliullah, but his work proved very popular. In addition to translating the [[Quran]], Shah Walliullah wrote 51 books in Persian and Arabic. Amongst the most famous were ''Hujjat Allah al-Baligha'' and ''Izalah al Khifa''.\n\nHis writings bought him great fame and prestige and enabled him to have influence in other areas too. One of his most important contributions to the Muslim community was his organisation of opposition to the [[Maratha Empire]], who had captured large parts of India which belonged to the [[Mughal Empire]] before and had reduced the Mughal emperor to a mere puppet. It was partly his influence which helped to persuade [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]] of Afghanistan to intervene. He joined forces with local Muslim leaders and defeated the Marathas at The [[Battle of Panipat in 1761]].\n\nHe felt a debt to the Sufis for spreading Islam throughout India. He also appreciated Sufi spirituality. Waliullah built a bridge between Sufis and the Ulama (Islamic scholars).<ref>K.J.

During the first siege, a [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] force of around 1,300 men led by [[Edward Hungerford (Roundhead)|Sir Edward Hungerford]] attacked the castle, which was the home of [[Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], a prominent [[Catholic]] and [[Cavaliers|Royalist]]. Arundell was absent, fighting for [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] at the time of the attack, and the defence was led by his wife, [[Lady Blanche Arundell]], in command of 25 soldiers. The siege was started on 2 May, and lasted for a week before the Parliamentarians forced Lady Arundell to surrender on 8 May. The Parliamentarians garrisoned the castle with 75 men, led by Colonel [[Edmund Ludlow]].\n\n[[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], the son of Thomas and Blanche, brought a Royalist force to reclaim the castle, and by November 1643, a tight [[blockade]] had been established. The castle was well-provisioned, and it was only when the Royalists exploded [[Tunnel warfare|mines]] under the walls, creating large holes in the defences, that they forced the castle's surrender. The damage to the castle left it uninhabitable, and over 100 years later, the [[Arundell family]] commissioned [[New Wardour Castle]] to be built nearby.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Arundell family]] were prominent [[Catholics]]; [[Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour]] was in and out of royal favour, was arrested in 1580 for what was described by his biographer Andrew J. Hopper as \"his catholic zeal\", and later for accepting the title of [[Count of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1595. He was also suspected of involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], an attempt by dissident Catholics to assassinate [[James I of England|King James]].{{sfn|Hopper|2009}} His son, [[Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour|Thomas Arundell]] (later the second [[Baron Arundell of Wardour]], from 1639) married [[Lady Blanche Arundell|Lady Blanche Somerset]], herself daughter of [[Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester]], who was described by the historian Stephen Manganiello as a \"stiff papist\".{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|pp=566\u2013567}} Arundell's support of [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] led to an arrest warrant being issued for him by [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in November 1641,{{sfn|Hopper|2009}} and at the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]], he raised a cavalry regiment in support of the [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] cause, and left [[Wardour Castle]] to fight for the King.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n===Wardour Castle===\n{{main|Wardour Castle}}\nWardour Castle is located in southwest [[Wiltshire]] between the villages of [[Donhead St Andrew]] and [[Tisbury, Wiltshire|Tisbury]], around {{convert|15|miles}} west of [[Salisbury]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/old-wardour-castle/directions/ |title=Directions to Old Wardour Castle |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref> It was built in the late 14th century, by the 5th [[Baron Lovel]],{{sfn|Wright|2004}} and bought by the Arundell family in the 1540s.{{sfn|Stanton|2009}} The castle was subsequently confiscated by the Crown, and then bought back in 1570 by Sir [[Matthew Arundell]],{{sfn|Blazeski|2017}} who oversaw its conversion to more of a [[English country house|stately home]], work that made it less defensible.{{sfn|Wright|2004}} Despite these modifications, the castle remained a significant fortification, and was described by the 17th century [[antiquarian]] [[John Aubrey]] as being \"very strongly built of freestone\".{{sfn|Aubrey|1847|p=99}} The castle's defences were strengthened during the early stages of the Civil War.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n==First siege==\n[[File:Blanche Arundell.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Lady Blanche Arundell]] held the castle for the Royalist cause in her husband's absence.]] \nOn 2 May 1643, [[Edward Hungerford (Roundhead)|Sir Edward Hungerford]], the Parliamentarian commander-in-chief for the county of Wiltshire,{{sfn|Wroughton|2008}} arrived at Wardour Castle and ordered its surrender, as it was claimed to be a known refuge of Royalists (described contemporarily as \"cavaliers and malignants\").{{sfn|Lodge|1840|p=1}} Lady Arundell refused, responding that \"she knew her duty and absolutely refused to deliver up the castle; she had a command from her lord to keep it, and she would obey his command\".{{sfn|Riley|2018|p=101}} Hungerford, finding that the castle was stronger than he had expected, added reinforcements to his force: troops out of [[Somerset]] commanded by Colonel [[William Strode (of Barrington)|William Strode]]. The combined force numbered around 1,300 men: in comparison, the castle housed around 55 people, only 25 of whom were able fighters. Alongside Lady Arundell, who was aged 60, was her daughter-in-law ([[Cicely Compton, Lady Arundell of Wardour|Cicely]]) with her three young children, and around fifty servants, including the guards and soldiers.{{sfn|Lodge|1840|p=2}}\n\nThe castle was besieged for six days. Accounts from Royalists and Parliamentarians vary on the effectiveness of the siege: [[Bruno Ryves]], a Royalist propagandist, described that due to attacks which continued throughout day and night, the castle inhabitants were \"so distracted between hunger and want of rest, that when the hand endeavoured to administer food, surprised with sleep it forgot its employment, the morsels falling from their hands\".{{sfn|Wright|2004}} In contrast, the Parliamentarian officer [[Edmund Ludlow]] wrote that when he arrived on 8 May, little damage had been done to the house other than to one of the chimneys.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\nOn the day of Ludlow's arrival, the Parliamentarians blew up two or three barrels of gunpowder under one of the castle walls, where there was an opening \"for the conveying away of filth\", and destroyed part of the wall.{{sfn|Wright|2004}} Lady Arundell initially rejected the terms of surrender offered, which gave quarter to the women and children, but not the men. However, when the Parliamentarians threatened to mine the other wall, and to launch fireballs in through their broken windows, she relented.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}\n\nAfter their capture of the castle, the Parliamentarians ransacked it, causing around \u00a3100,000 worth of damage.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}{{efn|Approximately [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1643|r=\u22126}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms.

The women had been allowed to keep six servants, but otherwise only had the clothes they were wearing.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}} From Shaftesbury they were transferred to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]. Lady Arundell was released shortly thereafter. During her incarceration, her husband had been killed in the [[Battle of Stratton]], and she sought the protection of the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]], a Royalist commander. Lady Arundell's grandchildren were held until May 1644, when they were released in a prisoner exchange for the children of a Parliamentarian.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n==Second siege==\n[[File:Edmund Ludlow.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Edmund Ludlow]] held the castle for the Parliamentarians during the second siege.]]\nLudlow was appointed as the governor of Wardour Castle, and garrisoned the castle with 75 men,{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|pp=566\u2013567}} comprising his own cavalry troop and a company of infantry led by Captain Bean, from Hungerford's men.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}} The first challenge to the castle was posed by the [[James Ley, 3rd Earl of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]], who had men posted at [[Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington|Lord Cottington]]'s house in nearby [[Fonthill Gifford]]. Hungerford's cavalry drove Marlborough's men from the area.{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} Ludlow prepared for a potential blockade by removing the siege works his army had built around the castle, and sinking a well within it.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}}\n\nIn a 1944 article in ''[[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine]]'', the historian H. F.

During the first siege, a [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] force of around 1,300 men led by [[Edward Hungerford (Roundhead)|Sir Edward Hungerford]] attacked the castle, which was the home of [[Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], a prominent [[Catholic]] and [[Cavaliers|Royalist]]. Arundell was absent, fighting for [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] at the time of the attack, and the defence was led by his wife, [[Lady Blanche Arundell]], in command of 25 soldiers. The siege was started on 2 May, and lasted for a week before the Parliamentarians forced Lady Arundell to surrender on 8 May. The Parliamentarians garrisoned the castle with 75 men, led by Colonel [[Edmund Ludlow]].\n\n[[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], the son of Thomas and Blanche, brought a Royalist force to reclaim the castle, and by November 1643, a tight [[blockade]] had been established. The castle was well-provisioned, and it was only when the Royalists exploded [[Tunnel warfare|mines]] under the walls, creating large holes in the defences, that they forced the castle's surrender. The damage to the castle left it uninhabitable, and over 100 years later, the [[Arundell family]] commissioned [[New Wardour Castle]] to be built nearby.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Arundell family]] were prominent [[Catholics]]; [[Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour]] was in and out of royal favour, was arrested in 1580 for what was described by his biographer Andrew J. Hopper as \"his catholic zeal\", and later for accepting the title of [[Count of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1595. He was also suspected of involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], an attempt by dissident Catholics to assassinate [[James I of England|King James]].{{sfn|Hopper|2009}} His son, [[Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour|Thomas Arundell]] (later the second [[Baron Arundell of Wardour]], from 1639) married [[Lady Blanche Arundell|Lady Blanche Somerset]], herself daughter of [[Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester]], who was described by the historian Stephen Manganiello as a \"stiff papist\".{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|pp=566\u2013567}} Arundell's support of [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] led to an arrest warrant being issued for him by [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in November 1641,{{sfn|Hopper|2009}} and at the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]], he raised a cavalry regiment in support of the [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] cause, and left [[Wardour Castle]] to fight for the King.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n===Wardour Castle===\n{{main|Wardour Castle}}\nWardour Castle is located in southwest [[Wiltshire]] between the villages of [[Donhead St Andrew]] and [[Tisbury, Wiltshire|Tisbury]], around {{convert|15|miles}} west of [[Salisbury]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/old-wardour-castle/directions/ |title=Directions to Old Wardour Castle |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdat=11 April 2020}}</ref> It was built in the late 14th century, by the 5th [[Baron Lovel]],{{sfn|Wright|2004}} and bought by the Arundell family in the 1540s.{{sfn|Stanton|2009}} The castle was subsequently confiscated by the Crown, and then bought back in 1570 by Sir [[Matthew Arundell]],{{sfn|Blazeski|2017}} who oversaw its conversion to more of a [[English country house|stately home]], work that made it less defensible.{{sfn|Wright|2004}} Despite these modifications, the castle remained a significant fortification, and was described by the 17th century [[antiquarian]] [[John Aubrey]] as being \"very strongly built of freestone\".{{sfn|Aubrey|1847|p=99}} The castle's defences were strengthened during the early stages of the Civil War.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n==First siege==\n[[File:Blanche Arundell.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Lady Blanche Arundell]] held the castle for the Royalist cause in her husband's absence.]] \nOn 2 May 1643, [[Edward Hungerford (Roundhead)|Sir Edward Hungerford]], the Parliamentarian commander-in-chief for the county of Wiltshire,{{sfn|Wroughton|2008}} arrived at Wardour Castle and ordered its surrender, as it was claimed to be a known refuge of Royalists (described contemporarily as \"cavaliers and malignants\").{{sfn|Lodge|1840|p=1}} Lady Arundell refused, responding that \"she knew her duty and absolutely refused to deliver up the castle; she had a command from her lord to keep it, and she would obey his command\".{{sfn|Riley|2018|p=101}} Hungerford, finding that the castle was stronger than he had expected, added reinforcements to his force: troops out of [[Somerset]] commanded by Colonel [[William Strode (of Barrington)|William Strode]]. The combined force numbered around 1,300 men: in comparison, the castle housed around 55 people, only 25 of whom were able fighters. Alongside Lady Arundell, who was aged 60, was her daughter-in-law ([[Cicely Compton, Lady Arundell of Wardour|Cicely]]) with her three young children, and around fifty servants, including the guards and soldiers.{{sfn|Lodge|1840|p=2}}\n\nThe castle was besieged for six days. Accounts from Royalists and Parliamentarians vary on the effectiveness of the siege: [[Bruno Ryves]], a Royalist propagandist, described that due to attacks which continued throughout day and night, the castle inhabitants were \"so distracted between hunger and want of rest, that when the hand endeavoured to administer food, surprised with sleep it forgot its employment, the morsels falling from their hands\".{{sfn|Wright|2004}} In contrast, the Parliamentarian officer [[Edmund Ludlow]] wrote that when he arrived on 8 May, little damage had been done to the house other than to one of the chimneys.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\nOn the day of Ludlow's arrival, the Parliamentarians blew up two or three barrels of gunpowder under one of the castle walls, where there was an opening \"for the conveying away of filth\", and destroyed part of the wall.{{sfn|Wright|2004}} Lady Arundell initially rejected the terms of surrender offered, which gave quarter to the women and children, but not the men. However, when the Parliamentarians threatened to mine the other wall, and to launch fireballs in through their broken windows, she relented.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}\n\nAfter their capture of the castle, the Parliamentarians ransacked it, causing around \u00a3100,000 worth of damage.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}{{efn|Approximately [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1643|r=\u22126}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms.

The women had been allowed to keep six servants, but otherwise only had the clothes they were wearing.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}} From Shaftesbury they were transferred to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]. Lady Arundell was released shortly thereafter. During her incarceration, her husband had been killed in the [[Battle of Stratton]], and she sought the protection of the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]], a Royalist commander.

They provided generous terms: quarter without distinction and civil usage for all, a speedy exchange, and not to be transported to [[Oxford]].{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Scars of Many an Age (10104333193).jpg|thumb|right|Wardour Castle was slighted after the Civil War]]\nDespite the terms agreed, two of the soldiers taken prisoner from the garrison were arrested and executed as Royalist deserters, and Ludlow was taken to Oxford, where he was imprisoned.{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}} He was quickly exchanged, and by July 1644 he had returned to Wiltshire as [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire|High Sheriff]], and a colonel under Sir [[William Waller]].{{sfn|Firth|Worden|2006}}\n\nLord Arundell had reclaimed his family home but it was no longer habitable,{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=50}} and he subsequently had it [[slighted]] to prevent further use as a garrison, moving the family home to [[Breamore]] in Hampshire.{{sfn|Sherlock|2009}} A mansion was built near Wardour Castle, dubbed [[New Wardour Castle]], between 1770 and 1776 by [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1000507 |desc=Wardour Castle and Old Wardour Castle |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof00aubruoft |title=The natural history of Wiltshire |last=Aubrey |first=John |authorlink=John Aubrey |year=1847 |publisher=Wiltshire Topographical Society |location=London |oclc=697583041 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Chettle |first=H.
