Surya]] making his directorial debut and was produced by S. S. Chakravarthy under production company Nic Arts. The film stars [[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]] in a double role with [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] and [[Jyothika]] in the lead roles. [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]], [[Sujitha]], and  [[Pandu (actor)|Pandu]] in supporting roles. A modern-day fictional adaptation of the legend of [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] from the ''[[Ramayana]]'', it tells the story of Deva and Shiva, two [[identical twin]] brothers, with Deva being deaf and dumb. When Shiva marries his sweetheart Priya, Deva becomes obsessed with and lusts for Priya.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.rediff.com/movies/2000/mar/23ajith.htm|title=rediff.com, Movies: Ajith comes a full circle|website=m.rediff.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sify.com/movies/when-tamil-films-did-away-with-iannan-thambi-paasami--imagegallery-kollywood-ocgrycbcichsi.html|title=When Tamil films did away with annan-thambi paasam|website=Sify}}</ref>\n\nSurya who was assisting Vasanth in ''[[Aasai]]'' (1995) approached Ajith to do a film under his direction if he had a good script.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lqvROpDRBbA|title=Ajith noted Surya's grit during the sh sh Aasai}}</ref> Simran was selected as the lead actress after attempts to sign Keerthi Reddy and Roja had failed. The soundtrack was composed by Deva and lyrics were written by Vairamuthu with songs like \"Oh Sona\" and \"April Madhathil\" becoming popular. The cinematography was handled by Jeeva while the editing was done by the duo of [[B. Lenin]] and [[V. T. Vijayan]].\n\nThe film was released on 30 April 1999 to positive reviews from critics for direction of S. J. Suryah along with the performances of Ajith and Simran. The film became a commercial success at box-office. Ajith earned his first [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor \u2013 Tamil|Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] with this film.\n\n== Plot ==\nDeva and Shiva (both played by [[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]]) are twins. Deva, the elder, is deaf and mute; but he is a genius, an expert at lip-reading, and the head of a successful advertising company. Shiva loves and trusts his brother. Priya ([[Simran (actress)|Simran]]) wants to marry someone who is an ex-smoker, ex-drunkard, and who got ditched by a girl but is pining for her. Learning this, Shiva, with the help of his friend Vicky ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]), invents an old romance between him and Sona ([[Jyothika]]), and finds his way into Priya's heart.\n\nMeanwhile, Deva chances upon Priya and lusts for her. His obsession continues even after his brother marries the girl of his dreams, and he devises various means of getting close to Priya and keeping Shiva and her separated. Some of the methods Deva uses to woo Priya are masochistic (wounding his hand by the running car engine to stop the couple's first night) and psychotic (trying to kill his brother in so many ways).\n\nPriya realises the not-so-honorable intentions Deva has towards her, but Shiva refuses to believe her and has full faith in his brother. He even goes as far as to take Priya to a psychiatrist. To get away from it all, Shiva and Priya go on a long-delayed honeymoon, but Deva shows up there, too. Shiva watches Deva kissing Priya's photo and realizes that she was right all along. While Shiva is away, Priya has to take care of Deva. Deva beats Shiva mercilessly, packs the unconscious Shiva in a gunny bag, and throws him in a lorry.\n\nDeva disguises himself as Shiva and tries to seduce Priya. Priya comes to know that he is Deva and escapes from him before shooting him with her revolver. Deva falls in the pool, and when Shiva comes, she narrates the whole incident to him. Suddenly, Deva comes back to life, but Shiva immediately kills him with the revolver. Deva's soul talks about his inability to express his feeling as he was mute. His grave with lots of flowers grown on it is shown.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]] as Deva and Shiva, the twin brothers{{efn|Ajith Kumar is credited as \"Ajith\" in the film.}}\n* [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] as Priya\n* [[Jyothika]] as Meena (Sona)\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Vicky, salesman and Shiva's friend\n* [[Sujitha]] as Sheela, Deva and Shiva's sister\n* Radha Bai as Deva and Shiva's grandmother\n* Rathan as Priya's father\n* [[N.

Surya]] making his directorial debut and was produced by S. S. Chakravarthy under production company Nic Arts. The film stars [[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]] in a double role with [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] and [[Jyothika]] in the lead roles. [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]], [[Sujitha]], and  [[Pandu (actor)|Pandu]] in supporting roles. A modern-day fictional adaptation of the legend of [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] from the ''[[Ramayana]]'', it tells the story of Deva and Shiva, two [[identical twin]] brothers, with Deva being deaf and dumb. When Shiva marries his sweetheart Priya, Deva becomes obsessed with and lusts for Priya.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.rediff.com/movies/2000/mar/23ajith.htm|title=rediff.com, Movies: Ajith comes a full circle|website=m.rediff.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sify.com/movies/when-tamil-films-did-away-with-iannan-thambi-paasami--imagegallery-kollywood-ocgrycbcichsi.html|title=When Tamil films did away with annan-thambi paasam|website=Sify}}</ref>\n\nSurya who was assisting Vasanth in ''[[Aasai]]'' (1995) approached Ajith to do a film under his direction if he had a good script.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lqvROpDRBbA|title=Ajith noted Surya's grit during the sh sh Aasai}}</ref> Simran was selected as the lead actress after attempts to sign Keerthi Reddy and Roja had failed. The soundtrack was composed by Deva and lyrics were written by Vairamuthu with songs like \"Oh Sona\" and \"April Madhathil\" becoming popular. The cinematography was handled by Jeeva while the editing was done by the duo of [[B. Lenin]] and [[V. T. Vijayan]].\n\nThe film was released on 30 April 1999 to positive reviews from critics for direction of S. J. Suryah along with the performances of Ajith and Simran. The film became a commercial success at box-office. Ajith earned his first [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor \u2013 Tamil|Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] with this film.\n\n== Plot ==\nDeva and Shiva (both played by [[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]]) are twins. Deva, the elder, is deaf and mute; but he is a genius, an expert at lip-reading, and the head of a successful advertising company. Shiva loves and trusts his brother. Priya ([[Simran (actress)|Simran]]) wants to marry someone who is an ex-smoker, ex-drunkard, and who got ditched by a girl but is pining for her. Learning this, Shiva, with the help of his friend Vicky ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]), invents an old romance between him and Sona ([[Jyothika]]), and finds his way into Priya's heart.\n\nMeanwhile, Deva chances upon Priya and lusts for her. His obsession continues even after his brother marries the girl of his dreams, and he devises various means of getting close to Priya and keeping Shiva and her separated. Some of the methods Deva uses to woo Priya are masochistic (wounding his hand by the running car engine to stop the couple's first night) and psychotic (trying to kill his brother in so many ways).\n\nPriya realises the not-so-honorable intentions Deva has towards her, but Shiva refuses to believe her and has full faith in his brother. He even goes as far as to take Priya to a psychiatrist. To get away from it all, Shiva and Priya go on a long-delayed honeymoon, but Deva shows up there too. Shiva watches Deva kissing Priya's photo and realizes that she was right all along. While Shiva is away, Priya has to take care of Deva. Deva beats Shiva mercilessly, packs the unconscious Shiva in a gunny bag, and throws him in a lorry.\n\nDeva disguises himself as Shiva and tries to seduce Priya. Priya comes to know that he is Deva and escapes from him before shooting him with her revolver. Deva falls in the pool, and when Shiva comes, she narrates the whole incident to him. Suddenly, Deva comes back to life, but Shiva immediately kills him with the revolver. Deva's soul talks about his inability to express his feeling as he was mute. His grave with lots of flowers grown on it is shown.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]] as Deva and Shiva, the twin brothers{{efn|Ajith Kumar is credited as \"Ajith\" in the film.}}\n* [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] as Priya\n* [[Jyothika]] as Meena (Sona)\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Vicky, salesman and Shiva's friend\n* [[Sujitha]] as Sheela, Deva and Shiva's sister\n* Radha Bai as Deva and Shiva's grandmother\n* Rathan as Priya's father\n* [[N.

Mathematical symbols can designate numbers ([[Constant (mathematics)|constants]]), [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[Bracket (mathematics)|brackets]], punctuation, and grouping to help determine [[order of operations]], and other aspects of [[syntax (logic)|logical syntax]]. Hi sisters\n\nMany authors distinguish an expression from a formula, the former denoting a mathematical object, and the latter denoting a statement about mathematical objects.{{cn|date=October 2019}} For example, <math>8x-5</math> is an expression, while <math>8x-5 \\geq 5x-8</math> is a formula. However, in modern mathematics, and in particular in [[computer algebra]], formulas are viewed as expressions that can be evaluated to ''true'' or ''false'', depending on the values that are given to the variables occurring in the expressions. For example <math>8x-5 \\geq 5x-8</math> takes the value ''false'' if {{mvar|x}} is given a value less than \u20131, and the value ''true'' otherwise.\n\n==Examples==\n\nThe use of expressions ranges from the simple:\n\n::<math>0+0</math>\n\n::<math>8x-5</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;([[linear polynomial]])\n\n::<math>7{{x}^{2}}+4x-10</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;([[quadratic polynomial]])\n\n::<math>\\frac{x-1}{{{x}^{2}}+12}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;([[rational fraction]])\n\nto the complex: \n\n::<math>f(a)+\\sum_{k=1}^n\\left.\\frac{1}{k!}\\frac{d^k}{dt^k}\\right|_{t=0}f(u(t)) + \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-t)^n }{n!} \\frac{d^{n+1}}{dt^{n+1}} f(u(t))\\, dt.</math>\n\n==Syntax versus semantics==\n\n===Syntax===\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nAn expression is a syntactic construct, it must be [[Well-formed formula|well-formed]]: the allowed [[operator (mathematics)|operators]] must have the correct number of inputs in the correct places, the characters that make up these inputs must be valid, have a clear [[order of operations]], etc. Strings of symbols that violate the rules of syntax are not well-formed and are not valid mathematical expressions.\n\nFor example, in the usual notation of [[arithmetic]], the expression ''1 + 2 \u00d7 3'' is well-formed, but the following expression is not:\n\n:<math>\\times4)x+,/y</math>.\n\n===Semantics===\n{{Main|Semantics|Formal semantics (logic)}}\n\nSemantics is the study of meaning. Formal semantics is about attaching meaning to expressions.\n\nIn [[algebra]], an expression may be used to designate a value, which might depend on values assigned to [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s occurring in the expression. The determination of this value depends on the [[semantics]] attached to the symbols of the expression.  The choice of semantics depends on the context of the expression.  The same syntactic expression ''1 + 2 \u00d7 3'' can have different values (mathematically 7, but also 9), depending on the [[order of operations]] implied by the context (See [[Order of operation#Calculators|Order of operations:Calculators]]).\n\nThe semantic rules may declare that certain expressions do not designate any value (for instance when they involve division by 0); such expressions are said to have an undefined value, but they are well-formed expressions nonetheless. In general the meaning of expressions is not limited to designating values; for instance, an expression might designate a condition, or an [[equation]] that is to be solved, or it can be viewed as an object in its own right that can be manipulated according to certain rules. Certain expressions that designate a value simultaneously express a condition that is assumed to hold, for instance those involving the operator <math>\\oplus</math> to designate an internal [[direct sum]].\n\n===Formal languages and lambda calculus===\n{{Main|Formal language|Lambda calculus}}\n\nFormal languages allow [[Formal system|formalizing]] the concept of well-formed expressions.\n\nIn the 1930s, a new type of expressions, called [[lambda expressions]], were introduced by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Stephen Kleene]] for formalizing [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and their evaluation. They form the basis for [[lambda calculus]], a [[formal system]] used in [[mathematical logic]] and the [[Programming language theory|theory of programming languages]].\n\nThe equivalence of two lambda expressions is [[decision problem|undecidable]]. This is also the case for the expressions representing real numbers, which are built from the integers by using the arithmetical operations, the logarithm and the exponential ([[Richardson's theorem]]).\n\n==Variables==\n\nMany mathematical expressions include [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. Any variable can be classified as being either a [[free variable]] or a [[bound variable]].\n\nFor a given combination of values for the free variables, an expression may be evaluated, although for some combinations of values of the free variables, the value of the expression may be undefined. Thus an expression represents a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose inputs are the values assigned to the free variables and whose output is the resulting value of the expression.{{cn|date=October 2014}}\n\nFor example, the expression\n:<math> x/y </math>\n\nevaluated for ''x'' = 10, ''y'' = 5, will give 2; but it is [[Division by zero|undefined]] for ''y'' = 0.\n\nThe evaluation of an expression is dependent on the definition of the mathematical operators and on the system of values that is its context.\n\nTwo expressions are said to be equivalent if, for each combination of values for the free variables, they have the same output, i.e., they represent the same function.

It concerns the ownership of the country's [[foreshore]] and [[seabed]], with many [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] groups claiming that M\u0101ori have a [[Aboriginal title|rightful claim to title]]. These claims are based around historical possession and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. On 18 November 2004, the New Zealand Parliament passed a law which deems the title to be held by the Crown. This law, the [[Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004]], was enacted on 24 November 2004. Some sections of the Act came into force on 17 January 2005.

On 19 June 2003, New Zealand's Court of Appeal ruled in ''[[Ngati Apa v Attorney-General]]'', amongst other matters, that:\n\n# \"The definition of 'land' in Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 did not necessarily exclude foreshore and seabed\";<ref>Attorney-General v Ngati Apa [2003] 3 NZLR 643 at 2</ref>\n# \"The title vested in the Crown was radical title which was not inconsistent with native title\";<ref>Attorney-General v Ngati Apa [2003] 3 NZLR 643 at 3</ref>\n# Various Acts had influence over but did not extinguish property rights;\n# The Maori Land Court had jurisdiction to determine \"an investigation of the title to the land ... under s 132 and an order determining the relative interests of the owners of the land\".<ref>Attorney-General v Ngati Apa [2003] 3 NZLR 643 at 96</ref>\n\n=== ''In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach'' ===\n{{See also|In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach}}\nThe Court of Appeal overturned a line of precedent dating back to the 1877 decision in ''[[Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington]]'', and affirmed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in the 1963 ''[[In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach|Ninety Mile Beach]]'' decision. These early decisions held that because of circumstances unique to New Zealand, M\u0101ori land ties were so weak that they could be extinguished through such indirect routes as unrelated phrases in legislation or through the Native (now M\u0101ori) Land Court\u2019s investigation of dry land adjoining the foreshore.\n\nIn its ruling, the Court of Appeal found that \"native property rights are not to be extinguished by a side wind.... The need for 'clear and plain' extinguishment is well established and is not met in this case. In the ''Ninety-Mile Beach'' case, the Court did not recognise that principle of interpretation\".<ref>Attorney-General v Ngati Apa [2003] 3 NZLR 643 at 154</ref> The ruling was foreshadowed by academic work during the late 1980s and 1990s, which argued that the ''Ninety Mile Beach'' case was wrongly decided.<ref>(see, in particular, [[Paul McHugh]] \"Aboriginal title in New Zealand courts\" (1984), 2 University of Canterbury Law Review  235\u2013265 and \"The legal status of M\u0101ori fishing rights in tidal water\" (1984), 14 Victoria University of Wellington Law Review  247-7 and Boast, \"In Re Ninety Mile Beach Revisited: The Native Land Court and the Foreshore in New Zealand Legal History\" (1993) 23 VUWLR 145)</ref>\n\n===Initial responses===\nThe ruling granted only the right to pursue establishing an interest. Experts such as [[Paul McHugh]] of Cambridge University stated that this was unlikely to result in full exclusive ownership, however these assurances were not strong enough to counter the perception that the door was now open for M\u0101ori to claim title to the entire coastline of New Zealand through the [[M\u0101ori Land Court]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}. The prospect of a successful claim was reported as having created considerable hostility in many sectors of society as New Zealand has a strong tradition of public access to beaches and waterways and this was perceived as being under threat. The [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], [[Helen Clark]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], announced that the government would legislate to ensure public ownership of the foreshore and seabed.\n\nAt the same time, however, the government was strongly attacked by the opposition [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], led by [[Don Brash]]. In sharp contrast to Te Ope Mana a Tai, the National Party claimed that the government's proposals were too favourable towards M\u0101ori. While the government's plan did indeed vest ownership in the state, they also incorporated provision for M\u0101ori to be consulted over matters relating to the foreshore and seabed. The National Party claimed that M\u0101ori were to be given too much control, and that the government was giving rights to M\u0101ori over and above those possessed by other New Zealanders.\n\nOnce the Government's policy framework was released, the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] held an urgent inquiry into the government policy. The hearing took place over six days in late January 2004, and a report was issued four weeks later. The tribunal issued a report that was highly critical of the Crown\u2019s approach.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, \"Report on the Crown's Foreshore and Seabed Policy\" WAI 1071 (2004).</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boast|first=Richard|date=2011|title=Foreshore and Seabed, Again|url=|journal=NZJPIL|volume=9|pages=|via=}}</ref> The Government response was equally sharp and critical, accusing the tribunal of \u2018implicitly\u2019 rejecting the principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. The Attorney-General, taking a more middle ground, conceded that the policy was prima facie discriminatory, but concluded that this infringement was \"demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society\" under section 5 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.<ref>Attorney-General, \"Report on the Foreshore and Seabed Bill\" (2004) at [56]</ref> The Human Rights Commission took another view, arguing that the legislation was discriminatory and not justified by section 5.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boast|first=Richard|date=2005|title=Foreshore and Seabed|url=|journal=LexisNexis|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Ongoing debate==\n[[Image:Forshore and Seabed Hikoi.JPG|thumb|right|320px|The hikoi on Cambridge Terrace, heading to Parliament.]]\nAlthough under attack from both sides, the government chose to press forward with its legislation, asserting that what it called its \"middle way\" was the only means of satisfactorily resolving the controversy. Criticism of the government, both from M\u0101ori and from opposition parties, continued to intensify, and the government began to lose ground in [[opinion poll]]s.\n\nOn 27 January 2004, National Party leader [[Don Brash]] delivered [[Orewa speech|a speech at Orewa]] that was highly critical of the government's policy towards M\u0101ori. Brash said that the government was showing strong favouritism to M\u0101ori, both in the foreshore and seabed debate and in many other areas of government policy. Brash's speech was condemned both by the government and by many M\u0101ori groups, but met with widespread approval from many other sectors of New Zealand society. This support was boosted by the successful \u2018iwi/Kiwi\u2019 billboard campaign which followed Brash\u2019s speech. These billboards framed the foreshore debate as the Labour Party\u2019s attempt to restrict public access to beaches, while the National Party would protect this aspect of the \u2018Kiwi way of life\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Suszko|first=Abby|date=2015|title=One Law for All: Contrasting Visions of Equality and Rights in the New Zealand Foreshore and Seabed Debate.|url=|journal=Law & History|volume=2|pages=60\u201388|via=HeinOnline}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, an opinion poll put the National Party ahead of the Labour Party for the first time in over 18 months.\n\nThe government was also facing serious internal debate over its proposed legislation. Many of the party's M\u0101ori MPs were deeply unhappy with the government's plans, and raised the possibility of breaking ranks to oppose the legislation in Parliament. This left the government unsure of whether it had a sufficient number of votes to pass its legislation through Parliament. In theory, the government had a narrow majority willing to support its proposed bill, with Labour, the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressives]], and [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]] all prepared to vote in favour. If two of Labour's M\u0101ori MPs were to vote against the bill, however, it would fail. Moreover, any attempt to make the bill more favourable to these MPs would risk losing the support of United Future.\n\nOn 8 April 2004, it was announced that the centrist-nationalist [[New Zealand First]] party would give its support to the legislation. New Zealand First's price for this support was that ownership of the seabed and foreshore would be vested solely in [[the Crown]], ending the concept of \"[[public domain]]\" (vesting ownership in the public at large rather than in the state) that United Future had promoted. United Future withdrew its support for the legislation, but New Zealand First provided sufficient votes to make this irrelevant. It is believed that Helen Clark preferred United Future's \"public domain\", and this was acknowledged by United Future leader [[Peter Dunne]], but United Future could not provide enough votes to guarantee the bill's passage, forcing Labour to seek support elsewhere.\n\nOne of the strongest critics of the bill within the Labour Party was [[Tariana Turia]], a junior minister. Turia indicated on a number of occasions that she might vote against the government's bill, but for a considerable time refused to give a final decision. It was made clear that voting against a government bill was \"incompatible\" with serving as a minister, and that doing so would result in Turia's dismissal from that role. Turia was encouraged to either abstain or simply be absent when the vote was taken. On 30 April, however, Turia announced that she would vote against the legislation, and would resign (effective 17 May 2004) from the Labour Party to contest a [[by-election]] in her electorate. She was dismissed from her ministerial post by the Prime Minister the same day. Another Labour MP, [[Nanaia Mahuta]], eventually decided that she would also vote against the bill, but chose not to leave the Labour Party. Mahuta had no ministerial post to be dismissed from.\n\n[[Image:Hikoi-foreshore.jpg|400px|thumb|right|The hikoi at the New Zealand Parliament.]]\nOn 5 May 2004, a [[hikoi]] (a long walk or march \u2014 in this case, a protest march) arrived in [[Wellington]]. It had begun in [[Northland Region|Northland]] thirteen days earlier, picking up supporters as they drove to the capital. The hikoi, which some estimated to contain fifteen thousand people by the time it reached Parliament, strongly opposed the government's plans, and was highly supportive of Tariana Turia's decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0610/S00280.htm|title=Loss and Grief \u2013 Uncensored |author=Dr Pita Sharples |work= Speech to the National Association of Loss and Grief Conference |publisher=The Maori Party|date=16 October 2006|accessdate=2 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nTuria and her allies, believing that the time was right for an independent M\u0101ori political vehicle, established a new [[M\u0101ori Party]]. Many of Turia's supporters, such as [[Mana Motuhake (political party)|Mana Motuhake]] leader [[Willie Jackson (politician)|Willie Jackson]] and M\u0101ori academic [[Pita Sharples]], claimed that M\u0101ori who formerly supported Labour would flock to the new party en masse. On the other hand, other commentators pointed to a poor track record for M\u0101ori parties in the past, and said that it would be difficult to unite diverse M\u0101ori opinion into a single group.\n\nOn 18 November 2004, [[Tim Selwyn]] put an axe through a window of the electorate office of Helen Clark, an act he described as a protest against Helen Clark's handling of the issue.\n\n==Legislation==\nOn 18 November 2004, the Labour/Progressive government passed the Foreshore and Seabed Act, which declared that the land in question was owned by the Crown. M\u0101ori can, however, apply for \"guardianship\" of certain areas. The Act was highly contentious.\n\n[[Image:Hikoi 011.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Green Party MPs at the hikoi/protest with a banner reading \"Honour The [[Treaty of Waitangi|Treaty]]\".]]\nThe government's foreshore and seabed bill passed its [[first reading|first vote]] in Parliament on 7 May 2004, backed by Labour, the Progressives, and New Zealand First. The National Party opposed the bill, saying that it gave too much control to M\u0101ori, United Future opposed it due to the removal of the public domain concept and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] opposed it on the grounds of the legislation being retrospective, that it was a denial of property rights (in this case M\u0101ori property rights), and that it was an unwarranted incursion by the Crown into areas that were specifically [[Tikanga M\u0101ori]] [http://www.act.org.nz/media?keys=foreshore+and+seabed&taxonomy_terms%5B%5D=&taxonomy_operator=1&form_token=5c137dc8f0e74b9bfb3480e7f19efca6&form_type=search&form_id=trip_search_page#act=/search//node/26303]. The [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]], another party in Parliament to take a position similar to that of the M\u0101ori protesters, also voted against the bill, saying that it overrode M\u0101ori rights and offered no guarantee that the land would not later be sold. Tariana Turia and Nanaia Mahuta both voted against the bill. The final vote tally was 65 in favour and 55 against. The [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]], told Parliament that the bill \"safeguards the seabed and foreshore for everyone\", protecting the rights of both M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori. Opposition to the bill remained strong, however, and protests and criticism continued as the government's legislation progressed.\n\nThe bill's passage through its first vote meant that it was then considered by a special select committee of Parliament, which heard public submissions on the matter. The select committee having allowed six months for submissions, reported back to the parliament in November that they had been unable to agree on a position and were therefore reporting back the bill with no recommendations whatsoever. The bill, slightly amended by the Government itself, passed its [[second reading|second vote]] on 17 November 2004 by the same margin as in the first vote. It was then considered by a Committee of the House (with Parliament sitting under urgency). It finally received its [[third reading|third vote]] on 18 November 2004. The final vote tally was 66 in favour and 54 against \u2014 Nanaia Mahuta, who had previously voted against, this time voted in favour.\n\nOn 15 December, the legislation was modified slightly after it was realised that as it was written, the Act [[nationalisation|nationalised]] all council-owned land reclaimed from the sea. This includes areas such as [[Auckland]]'s [[Point Britomart|Britomart]] and [[Wellington]]'s waterfront. This was not part of the intention of the act.\n\nThe [[United Nations]] [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], after being asked by [[Ng\u0101i Tahu|Te Runanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu]] to consider the legislation, issued a [http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CERD.C.DEC.NZL.1.En?Opendocument report] on 12 March 2005 stating that the foreshore and seabed legislation discriminates against M\u0101ori by extinguishing the possibility of establishing M\u0101ori customary title over the foreshore and seabed, and by not providing a means of redress. Tariana Turia and the M\u0101ori Party claimed this as a significant victory, although the report has not prompted any change in government policy.\n\n==Situation following the controversy==\nThe foreshore and seabed issue, as part of the larger race relations debate, was one of the most significant points of contention in New Zealand politics at the time, and remains a significant issue for many people. The Labour government's popularity was severely damaged by the affair, although subsequent polls showed that it recovered its support and Labour was elected for a third term in September 2005.\n\nWhile the Act was widely criticised by M\u0101ori, some [[iwi]] have chosen to negotiate agreement within the bounds of the Act. The first agreement made through the act was ratified by Ngati Porou and the Crown in October 2008 (see [[#First foreshore and seabed agreement signed|below]]).\n\n===Special Rapporteur===\nIn November 2005, following government criticism of the report issued by the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (UNCERD), [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] Professor Stavenhagen, a Mexican researcher who reports to UNCERD, arrived in New Zealand at the invitation of the Government.  He attended four [[Hui (M\u0101ori assembly)|hui]] and heard severe criticism of the government.  He also met with Deputy Prime Minister, Dr [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]] who crafted the foreshore law. While the Foreshore and Seabed issue was central to his visit, discussions also related to [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|Treaty of Waitangi settlements]], and economic, social and cultural rights generally. On 25 November 2005 he issued a statement which noted that \u201c[w]hile the standard of living of the M\u0101ori of New Zealand has improved and is better than that of indigenous peoples in poorer countries, there is widespread concern that the gap in social and economic conditions is actually growing larger and an increasing proportion of M\u0101ori are being left behind\u201d.  His [http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/srnzmarch06.pdf final report] was completed in March 2006.  It was highly critical of the Government in a number of areas, including the Foreshore and Seabed Act, which it recommended should be repealed or significantly amended.  The Government response to this further criticism was again negative describing Professor Stavenhagen's report as [http://www.beehive.govt.nz/ViewDocument.aspx?DocumentID=25366 \"disappointing, unbalanced and narrow\".]\n\n===Member's bill===\nIn October 2006, Tariana Turia introduced a [[member's bill]] designed to repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act.<ref name=repeal>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/b/9/2/b92242e6d05747f5987db5c56ee0ef50.htm|title=Foreshore and Seabed Repeal Bill|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|date=12 October 2006|accessdate=25 October 2006}}</ref> In recreating the legal status before the Foreshore and Seabed Act was passed, however, the bill is reported to vest ownership of the foreshore and seabed in the Crown.

These claims are based around historical possession and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. On 18 November 2004, the New Zealand Parliament passed a law which deems the title to be held by the Crown. This law, the [[Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004]], was enacted on 24 November 2004. Some sections of the Act came into force on 17 January 2005.

The hearing took place over six days in late January 2004, and a report was issued four weeks later. The tribunal issued a report that was highly critical of the Crown\u2019s approach.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, \"Report on the Crown's Foreshore and Seabed Policy\" WAI 1071 (2004).</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boast|first=Richard|date=2011|title=Foreshore and Seabed, Again|url=|journal=NZJPIL|volume=9|pages=|via=}}</ref> The Government response was equally sharp and critical, accusing the tribunal of \u2018implicitly\u2019 rejecting the principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

Criticism of the government, both from M\u0101ori and from opposition parties, continued to intensify, and the government began to lose ground in [[opinion poll]]s.\n\nOn 27 January 2004, National Party leader [[Don Brash]] delivered [[Orewa speech|a speech at Orewa]] that was highly critical of the government's policy towards M\u0101ori. Brash said that the government was showing strong favouritism to M\u0101ori, both in the foreshore and seabed debate and in many other areas of government policy. Brash's speech was condemned both by the government and by many M\u0101ori groups, but met with widespread approval from many other sectors of New Zealand society. This support was boosted by the successful \u2018iwi/Kiwi\u2019 billboard campaign which followed Brash\u2019s speech. These billboards framed the foreshore debate as the Labour Party\u2019s attempt to restrict public access to beaches, while the National Party would protect this aspect of the \u2018Kiwi way of life\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Suszko|first=Abby|date=2015|title=One Law for All: Contrasting Visions of Equality and Rights in the New Zealand Foreshore and Seabed Debate.|url=|journal=Law & History|volume=2|pages=60\u201388|via=HeinOnline}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, an opinion poll put the National Party ahead of the Labour Party for the first time in over 18 months.\n\nThe government was also facing serious internal debate over its proposed legislation. Many of the party's M\u0101ori MPs were deeply unhappy with the government's plans, and raised the possibility of breaking ranks to oppose the legislation in Parliament. This left the government unsure of whether it had a sufficient number of votes to pass its legislation through Parliament. In theory, the government had a narrow majority willing to support its proposed bill, with Labour, the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressives]], and [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]] all prepared to vote in favour. If two of Labour's M\u0101ori MPs were to vote against the bill, however, it would fail. Moreover, any attempt to make the bill more favourable to these MPs would risk losing the support of United Future.\n\nOn 8 April 2004, it was announced that the centrist-nationalist [[New Zealand First]] party would give its support to the legislation. New Zealand First's price for this support was that ownership of the seabed and foreshore would be vested solely in [[the Crown]], ending the concept of \"[[public domain]]\" (vesting ownership in the public at large rather than in the state) that United Future had promoted. United Future withdrew its support for the legislation, but New Zealand First provided sufficient votes to make this irrelevant. It is believed that Helen Clark preferred United Future's \"public domain\", and this was acknowledged by United Future leader [[Peter Dunne]], but United Future could not provide enough votes to guarantee the bill's passage, forcing Labour to seek support elsewhere.\n\nOne of the strongest critics of the bill within the Labour Party was [[Tariana Turia]], a junior minister. Turia indicated on a number of occasions that she might vote against the government's bill, but for a considerable time refused to give a final decision. It was made clear that voting against a government bill was \"incompatible\" with serving as a minister, and that doing so would result in Turia's dismissal from that role. Turia was encouraged to either abstain or simply be absent when the vote was taken. On 30 April, however, Turia announced that she would vote against the legislation, and would resign (effective 17 May 2004) from the Labour Party to contest a [[by-election]] in her electorate. She was dismissed from her ministerial post by the Prime Minister the same day. Another Labour MP, [[Nanaia Mahuta]], eventually decided that she would also vote against the bill, but chose not to leave the Labour Party. Mahuta had no ministerial post to be dismissed from.\n\n[[Image:Hikoi-foreshore.jpg|400px|thumb|right|The hikoi at the New Zealand Parliament.]]\nOn 5 May 2004, a [[hikoi]] (a long walk or march \u2014 in this case, a protest march) arrived in [[Wellington]]. It had begun in [[Northland Region|Northland]] thirteen days earlier, picking up supporters as they drove to the capital. The hikoi, which some estimated to contain fifteen thousand people by the time it reached Parliament, strongly opposed the government's plans, and was highly supportive of Tariana Turia's decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0610/S00280.htm|title=Loss and Grief \u2013 Uncensored |author=Dr Pita Sharples |work= Speech to the National Association of Loss and Grief Conference |publisher=The Maori Party|date=16 October 2006|accessdate=2 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nTuria and her allies, believing that the time was right for an independent M\u0101ori political vehicle, established a new [[M\u0101ori Party]]. Many of Turia's supporters, such as [[Mana Motuhake (political party)|Mana Motuhake]] leader [[Willie Jackson (politician)|Willie Jackson]] and M\u0101ori academic [[Pita Sharples]], claimed that M\u0101ori who formerly supported Labour would flock to the new party en masse. On the other hand, other commentators pointed to a poor track record for M\u0101ori parties in the past, and said that it would be difficult to unite diverse M\u0101ori opinion into a single group.\n\nOn 18 November 2004, [[Tim Selwyn]] put an axe through a window of the electorate office of Helen Clark, an act he described as a protest against Helen Clark's handling of the issue.\n\n==Legislation==\nOn 18 November 2004, the Labour/Progressive government passed the Foreshore and Seabed Act, which declared that the land in question was owned by the Crown. M\u0101ori can, however, apply for \"guardianship\" of certain areas. The Act was highly contentious.\n\n[[Image:Hikoi 011.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Green Party MPs at the hikoi/protest with a banner reading \"Honour The [[Treaty of Waitangi|Treaty]]\".]]\nThe government's foreshore and seabed bill passed its [[first reading|first vote]] in Parliament on 7 May 2004, backed by Labour, the Progressives, and New Zealand First. The National Party opposed the bill, saying that it gave too much control to M\u0101ori, United Future opposed it due to the removal of the public domain concept and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] opposed it on the grounds of the legislation being retrospective, that it was a denial of property rights (in this case M\u0101ori property rights), and that it was an unwarranted incursion by the Crown into areas that were specifically [[Tikanga M\u0101ori]] [http://www.act.org.nz/media?keys=foreshore+and+seabed&taxonomy_terms%5B%5D=&taxonomy_operator=1&form_token=5c137dc8f0e74b9bfb3480e7f19efca6&form_type=search&form_id=trip_search_page#act=/search//node/26303]. The [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]], another party in Parliament to take a position similar to that of the M\u0101ori protesters, also voted against the bill, saying that it overrode M\u0101ori rights and offered no guarantee that the land would not later be sold. Tariana Turia and Nanaia Mahuta both voted against the bill. The final vote tally was 65 in favour and 55 against. The [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]], told Parliament that the bill \"safeguards the seabed and foreshore for everyone\", protecting the rights of both M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori. Opposition to the bill remained strong, however, and protests and criticism continued as the government's legislation progressed.\n\nThe bill's passage through its first vote meant that it was then considered by a special select committee of Parliament, which heard public submissions on the matter. The select committee having allowed six months for submissions, reported back to the parliament in November that they had been unable to agree on a position and were therefore reporting back the bill with no recommendations whatsoever. The bill, slightly amended by the Government itself, passed its [[second reading|second vote]] on 17 November 2004 by the same margin as in the first vote. It was then considered by a Committee of the House (with Parliament sitting under urgency). It finally received its [[third reading|third vote]] on 18 November 2004. The final vote tally was 66 in favour and 54 against \u2014 Nanaia Mahuta, who had previously voted against, this time voted in favour.\n\nOn 15 December, the legislation was modified slightly after it was realised that as it was written, the Act [[nationalisation|nationalised]] all council-owned land reclaimed from the sea. This includes areas such as [[Auckland]]'s [[Point Britomart|Britomart]] and [[Wellington]]'s waterfront. This was not part of the intention of the act.\n\nThe [[United Nations]] [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], after being asked by [[Ng\u0101i Tahu|Te Runanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu]] to consider the legislation, issued a [http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CERD.C.DEC.NZL.1.En?Opendocument report] on 12 March 2005 stating that the foreshore and seabed legislation discriminates against M\u0101ori by extinguishing the possibility of establishing M\u0101ori customary title over the foreshore and seabed, and by not providing a means of redress. Tariana Turia and the M\u0101ori Party claimed this as a significant victory, although the report has not prompted any change in government policy.\n\n==Situation following the controversy==\nThe foreshore and seabed issue, as part of the larger race relations debate, was one of the most significant points of contention in New Zealand politics at the time, and remains a significant issue for many people. The Labour government's popularity was severely damaged by the affair, although subsequent polls showed that it recovered its support and Labour was elected for a third term in September 2005.\n\nWhile the Act was widely criticised by M\u0101ori, some [[iwi]] have chosen to negotiate agreement within the bounds of the Act. The first agreement made through the act was ratified by Ngati Porou and the Crown in October 2008 (see [[#First foreshore and seabed agreement signed|below]]).\n\n===Special Rapporteur===\nIn November 2005, following government criticism of the report issued by the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (UNCERD), [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] Professor Stavenhagen, a Mexican researcher who reports to UNCERD, arrived in New Zealand at the invitation of the Government.  He attended four [[Hui (M\u0101ori assembly)|hui]] and heard severe criticism of the government.  He also met with Deputy Prime Minister, Dr [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]] who crafted the foreshore law. While the Foreshore and Seabed issue was central to his visit, discussions also related to [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|Treaty of Waitangi settlements]], and economic, social and cultural rights generally. On 25 November 2005 he issued a statement which noted that \u201c[w]hile the standard of living of the M\u0101ori of New Zealand has improved and is better than that of indigenous peoples in poorer countries, there is widespread concern that the gap in social and economic conditions is actually growing larger and an increasing proportion of M\u0101ori are being left behind\u201d.  His [http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/srnzmarch06.pdf final report] was completed in March 2006.  It was highly critical of the Government in a number of areas, including the Foreshore and Seabed Act, which it recommended should be repealed or significantly amended.  The Government response to this further criticism was again negative describing Professor Stavenhagen's report as [http://www.beehive.govt.nz/ViewDocument.aspx?DocumentID=25366 \"disappointing, unbalanced and narrow\".]\n\n===Member's bill===\nIn October 2006, Tariana Turia introduced a [[member's bill]] designed to repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act.<ref name=repeal>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/b/9/2/b92242e6d05747f5987db5c56ee0ef50.htm|title=Foreshore and Seabed Repeal Bill|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|date=12 October 2006|accessdate=25 October 2006}}</ref> In recreating the legal status before the Foreshore and Seabed Act was passed, however, the bill is reported to vest ownership of the foreshore and seabed in the Crown.

Mike Brown is well known as \u201c The Flirt Of The Quins Dressing Room\u201d, this is because he was caught masturbating vigorously before the 2016 home match against Exeter, he apologised to any fans who saw it but said he could not help him self as the \u201cthe temptation was too much when he saw Adam Jones\u2019 hairy nipples and I looked down and had a throbbing boner\u201d.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in Southampton, he was educated at [[Wyvern College, Salisbury|Wyvern College]], until aged 15 when he moved to [[Peter Symonds College]].

player who plays [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] for [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] and the [[England national rugby union team|England rugby team]]. Brown joined the Harlequins senior team in 2005, having had previous youth career spells at [[Salisbury RFC|Salisbury]] and Melksham, and began playing for the England first team two years later. \n\nDuring his career, he has won three [[Six Nations Championship]] titles with England and one [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] title with Harlequins.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in Southampton, he was educated at [[Wyvern College, Salisbury|Wyvern College]], until aged 15 when he moved to [[Peter Symonds College]]. Having mainly played [[Association football|football]] and little rugby, he initially wanted to play [[fly half]]. Under the coaching of Mike Marchant, he changed position to fullback. This brought him to the attention of [[Salisbury RFC]], where he moved to age 18, before a short stint at Melksham RFC.<ref>http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/13744669.England_s_Mike_Brown_s_gratitude_to_Hampshire_college_ahead_of_Rugby_World_Cup/</ref>\n\n==Club career==\nHe made his First XV debut for Quins during the 2005/06 season, scoring a try on debut in the pre-season friendly against [[London Irish]] on 12 August 2005. He was part of the England Under 21 team that won the 2006 Six Nations [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] and also competed in the Under 21 World Championships later that year. Brown was discovered  by Welsh rugby scout Craig Presdee-Salathiel, who contacted his friend Harlequins chairman David Morgan regarding Brown.\n\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, although still in a part of Harlequins' Academy side, he established himself as first choice full back. A standout season by Brown resulted in him collecting 9 tries, earning him a place on the Sky Sports Dream Team.\n\nMike had a successful 2010\u201311 season with Quins, culminating in winning the Amlin Challenge cup, beating Munster at Thomand Park on the way to the final against Stade Francais. This form continued into the 2011/12 Aviva Premiership season, resulting in a call up to the EPS squad. He started for Harlequins in their [[2011\u201312 English Premiership (rugby union)|2011\u201312 Premiership]] final victory over [[Leicester Tigers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/18154802|title=Harlequins 30\u201323 Leicester|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the start of the 2019/2020 season, while still an active player, one of the bars at Harlequins\u2019 home ground ([[The Stoop]]) was renamed in Brown\u2019s honour.\n\n==International career==\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, although still in a part of Harlequins' Academy side, he was capped by the [[England Saxons]] in the first two matches of the year.\n\n[[File:m-brown.jpg |thumb|180px|left|Brown playing for England, 2018]]\n\nBrown got selected for the [[2007 England rugby union tour of South Africa]].
