Under the watchful eyes of 2800 spectators, CAA had the ball on Newton's 5 yard line, with 35 seconds to go.  First, second, and third down went by with no gain for the Chicago AA Eleven.  With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player, Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n===October 29: CAA at MIT===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs MIT\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= MIT Engineers\n|V1=24|V2=22\n|H1=0|H2=0\n|Date= October 29, 1895\n|Location= Cambridge, MA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3:30pm\n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (two 20 minute halves)\n|Attendance= 500\n|Weather=\n|Referee= F.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49479526/chicago-wins-at-boston-athletic/|title=Chicago Wins at Boston.

It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.  Chicago lost that contest 10 to 12, but was the first opponent of the season to scored double digits against the Quakers.\n\n===November 1st: CAA at Penn===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs Penn\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= Penn Quakers\n|V1=0|V2=4\n|H1=4|H2=8\n|Date= November 1, 1895\n|Location= Franklin Field, Philadelphia, PA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3pm\n|ElapsedTime= \n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee= \n|Umpire= \n|Injured= \n|Linesmen= \n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nCAA played rough, dirty in the eyes of some, as they lost to the superior university team of Pennsylvania, 4 to 12. CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49479948/info-on-penn-caa-game/|title=Info on Penn-CAA game|date=1895-10-31|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/pennsylvania/1895-schedule.html|title=1895 Pennsylvania Quakers Schedule and Results|website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49481159/piled-up-points-chicago-a-a-had-easy/|title=PILED UP POINTS Chicago A.

Hadden had the best performance of the day for Chicago as Right Tackle, while Slater also played well against the Jersey men.  \n\n\n\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Under the watchful eyes of 2800 spectators, CAA had the ball on Newton's 5 yard line, with 35 seconds to go.  First, second, and third down went by with no gain for the Chicago AA Eleven.  With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player, Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n===October 29: CAA at MIT===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs MIT\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= MIT Engineers\n|V1=24|V2=22\n|H1=0|H2=0\n|Date= October 29, 1895\n|Location= Cambridge, MA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3:30pm\n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (two 20 minute halves)\n|Attendance= 500\n|Weather=\n|Referee= F.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49479526/chicago-wins-at-boston-athletic/|title=Chicago Wins at Boston.

It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.  Chicago lost that contest 10 to 12, but was the first opponent of the season to scored double digits against the Quakers.\n\n===November 1st: CAA at Penn===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs Penn\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= Penn Quakers\n|V1=0|V2=4\n|H1=4|H2=8\n|Date= November 1, 1895\n|Location= Franklin Field, Philadelphia, PA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3pm\n|ElapsedTime= \n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee= \n|Umpire= \n|Injured= \n|Linesmen= \n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nCAA played rough, dirty in the eyes of some, as they lost to the superior university team of Pennsylvania, 4 to 12. CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49479948/info-on-penn-caa-game/|title=Info on Penn-CAA game|date=1895-10-31|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/pennsylvania/1895-schedule.html|title=1895 Pennsylvania Quakers Schedule and Results|website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49481159/piled-up-points-chicago-a-a-had-easy/|title=PILED UP POINTS Chicago A.

Hadden had the best performance of the day for Chicago as Right Tackle, while Slater also played well against the Jersey men.  \n\n\n\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

But most of their rice lands were either seriously damaged or totally lost due to the landslides, mud piles, and by the killer quakes in 1990 and 1992. They get most of their rice now from Bangued, while other mountain municipalities supplied some of the rice needs of some nearby lowland municipalities.\n\nRehabilitation have been on the communal facilities such as roads, trails, irrigation systems, footbridges and rice fields by the Masadiit Farmers Cooperative Inc. (MFCI) with the fund amounting to {{Philippine peso|2,903 million}} from the Presidential Management Staff and by the Inter NGO Disaster Relief Services (INDRS) with the fund amounting {{Dollar sign|CAD|lk=on}}292,516.00, {{Philippine peso|7 million}} from [[Oxfam]].\n\n==Transportation==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016|small=y}}\n\nBoliney is situated {{convert|62|km}} from the capital town of [[Bangued, Abra|Bangued]], and can be reached by road which was completed in 1974. Prior to this, it was accessible only by hiking a {{convert|24|km|adj=on}} long mountain trail.\n\nAfter 1974, the road was extended by about {{convert|14|km}} before reaching Danac, the farthest barangay.

Liddell then rushed in with knees and straight rights and knocked Overeem out at the end of the first round. \n\nIn the next round, Liddell was eliminated by fan-favorite [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson]]. In the first round of his fight with Jackson, Liddell landed shots as he found his distance but Jackson countered with powerful strikes, rocking Liddell numerous times. In the second round, Jackson continued to out-land Liddell with big punches, but could not finish him. Later in the second round a visibly exhausted Liddell was taken down and received a barrage of punches from the ground. His corner threw in the towel, giving Jackson the upset victory.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Ortiz=====\n{{See also|Chuck Liddell vs. Tito Ortiz}}\nReturning to the UFC, Liddell was once again in contention for the light heavyweight title, preparing for a match with former champion Tito Ortiz. Eventually, after Ortiz lost the title to Randy Couture, the two would meet in a highly anticipated bout at ''[[UFC 47]]'' on April 2, 2004, in Las Vegas, Nevada. After most of the first round was spent feeling each other out, Liddell threw a few punches and a kick which was blocked by Ortiz, with Ortiz slapping himself on the head, taunting Liddell. \n\nWhen the round ended Ortiz pushed referee [[Big John McCarthy|\"Big\" John McCarthy]] out of his way, into Liddell, and the pair exchanged words. Shortly after the second round started, Liddell landed a flurry of punches that dropped Ortiz and led to a TKO victory. Ortiz has since stated that Liddell's thumb made contact with his eye, causing him momentarily to see \"nothing but black\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/fighting/2006/12/ortiz_looks_to_continue_challe.html |title=Ortiz looks to continue challenger trend |first=Jared |last=Barnes |work=Blogs.chron.com |date=December 20, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> Since ''[[UFC 47]]'', the bad blood between both fighters remained, with Ortiz repeatedly stating that he wanted \"his\" title belt back. Despite the tension, Ortiz and Liddell would not fight again for two and a half years.\n\n====Continued success====\n=====''The Ultimate Fighter''=====\nIn early 2005, Liddell was a coach on the inaugural season of ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'', [[Spike TV]]'s reality show which featured fighters competing for a UFC contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/chuck-liddell/person/314316/summary.html|title=Chuck Liddell: Summary|work=TV.com|date=May 26, 2007|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe coached Team Liddell, while then [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]] [[Randy Couture]] coached Team Couture. The series was a success for both Spike TV and the UFC. Both of the winners of the show, [[Diego Sanchez]] and [[Forrest Griffin]], were members of Team Liddell and went on to have very successful careers in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-kotc-and-k-1-salary-breakdown|title=UFC, KOTC, and K-1 Salary breakdown|work=MMAWeekly.com|date=August 11, 2005|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture II=====\nOn April 16, 2005, at ''[[UFC 52]]'', Liddell fought Randy Couture, again for the light heavyweight title. Couture moved in for a punch, Liddell countered with a big right hand to the temple of Couture, knocking him out cold, making him the new [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]].\n[[File:ChuckLiddell.png|thumb|150 px|left|Liddell in 2007]]\n\n=====Liddell vs. Horn II=====\nLiddell was scheduled to defend his new title against longtime veteran [[Jeremy Horn]], at ''[[UFC 54]]'', a matchup the UFC claimed was demanded by long-time fans of the sport since Horn had given Liddell his first loss.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sherdog.com|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Chuck-Liddell-192|title=Fight Finder - Chuck \"Iceman\" Liddell's Mixed Martial Arts Statistics|work=Sherdog.com|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> Throughout the bout, Liddell dominated with aggressive punches, causing [[Knockout#Knockdown|knockdown]]s in several rounds. Liddell's defensive [[wrestling]] ability, especially his [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawl]], stifled the bulk of Horn's offense, which was centered on [[grappling]] and [[submission wrestling]]. \n\nLiddell eventually won the fight via TKO in 2:46 minutes of the fourth round after Horn informed the referee that he could not see. He had been hit with a right punch to the eye causing him to bleed from his eye as well as his nose. Liddell had successfully defended his title and, in the process, avenged two of his three career losses.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture III=====\nOn February 4, 2006, at ''[[UFC 57]]'', Liddell faced [[Randy Couture]] in a rubber match, After an action packed first round, Liddell landed a big punch to Couture's face causing him to bleed, Couture bounced back with a take down of Liddell, but he was able to get up right away. Later in the second round as Couture moved in Liddell countered similar to in the second fight at [[UFC 52]] knocking Couture out, defeating Couture for the second time via knockout in Las Vegas, Nevada, to retain the light heavyweight championship belt. After the fight, Couture announced his retirement from mixed martial arts.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Sobral II=====\nIn his next defense, at ''[[UFC 62]]'' on August 26, 2006, Liddell would beat [[Renato Sobral|Renato \"Babalu\" Sobral]], who he had defeated nearly three years prior. Seconds after the fight started Sobral came running forward throwing punches. Liddell, moving backwards, was landing big punches, and a right uppercut ended the fight at 1:35 of the first round. It was announced during ''[[UFC 61]]'' that, were he to defeat Sobral, Liddell would face off against [[List of Pride champions|PRIDE Middleweight Champion]] [[Wanderlei Silva]]. The fight failed to materialize due to the competing promotions' inability to reach an agreement. UFC president [[Dana White]] attributed this to Silva's subsequent knockout loss to [[Mirko Filipovi\u0107]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/fighting/2006/09/liddellsilva_on_the_shelf_for.html |first=Jared |last=Barnes |title=Liddell-Silva on the shelf for now |work=Blogs.chron.com |date=September 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Ortiz II=====\nIn what was the most financially successful UFC event up to that point, Liddell fought a rematch with [[Tito Ortiz]] at ''[[UFC 66]]'', which took place on December 30, 2006. Liddell's takedown defense neutralized Ortiz's wrestling ability, forcing Ortiz to stand up with a known striker. Although Ortiz did take Liddell down at one point in the fight, Liddell went on to defeat Ortiz via TKO in the third round to defend his light heavyweight championship successfully for a fourth time. It was later revealed that Liddell had torn his [[medial collateral ligament|MCL]] prior to the fight. He had also popped the tendon out on the middle finger on his left hand during the fight itself.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=18257\n|title=UFC Post-show Notes\n|last=Meltzer\n|first=Dave\n|authorlink=Dave Meltzer\n|work=[[Wrestling Observer|The Wrestling Observer]] website\n|date=December 31, 2006\n|accessdate=June 28, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\n====Title loss and decline====\n\n=====Liddell vs. Jackson II=====\nIn his fifth defense, Liddell would lose the title at ''[[UFC 71]]'' on May 26, 2007, in a rematch with [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson]]. Liddell was knocked down by a right hook less than two minutes into the first round and was unable to defend himself against Jackson's strikes on the ground, resulting in a knockout victory for Jackson. After the loss, Liddell was widely criticized after reports indicated he had been seen in night clubs the week before the event.

After a dominant first round for Liddell, Jardine started to land low [[leg kick]]s continuously, while Liddell was unable to time his strikes against the unorthodox southpaw. Liddell lost a close split decision, making it the first time he had suffered consecutive losses in his career.<ref> https://www.espn.com/extra/mma/news/story?id=3032272 </ref><ref name = \"Sherdog_wins_losses\"/> Liddell stated he wanted a rematch and claimed he had never taken Jardine seriously.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Silva=====\nOn October 23, 2007, White announced that a matchup between Liddell and [[Wanderlei Silva]] would finally take place at [[UFC 79]].

Both fighters were awarded \"Fight of the Night\" honors.

Despite being a heavy underdog in his opponent's home country, Liddell dominated the [[vale tudo]] fighter on the feet, and won via decision. After a technical submission loss to top contender [[Jeremy Horn]] shortly after, Liddell began establishing his reputation as a top contender with dominant victories over [[Kevin Randleman]], [[Murilo Bustamante]], [[Vitor Belfort]], [[Amar Suloev]], [[Jeff Monson]], [[Renato Sobral]] and [[Tito Ortiz]]. Liddell was also the first UFC fighter to fight in [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]], where he represented the organization against fellow kickboxer [[Guy Mezger]], knocking him unconscious.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmaweekly.com/iceman-looking-for-the-final-revenge-2|title=Iceman Looking for the Final Revenge|last=Gobetz|first=Mitch|work=MMAWeekly.com|date=May 23, 2007|accessdate=September 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture=====\n{{See also|Randy Couture vs. Chuck Liddell}}\nBy 2002, Liddell was considered the #1 contender for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship, with growing popularity and support from his fans. The UFC tried to arrange a title bout with then-champion [[Tito Ortiz]], but Ortiz cited scheduling conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling101.com/101/article/JoeR/293|title=UFC 47 Profile: Tito Ortiz|first=Joe|last=Reilly|work=Wrestling101.com|date=March 9, 2004|accessdate=January 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302050932/http://www.wrestling101.com/101/article/JoeR/293/|archive-date=March 2, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nTo force Ortiz's hand, they created an interim light heavyweight championship and matched Liddell with [[Greco-Roman]] wrestler and former heavyweight champion \"The Natural\" [[Randy Couture]] at ''[[UFC 43]]''. Couture neutralized Liddell's hooks with straight punches and eventually began taking \"The Iceman\" down at will. Couture eventually gained full [[Mount (grappling)|mount]] and forced a referee stoppage due to a barrage of punches.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n=====Pride Grand Prix Tournament against Overeem/Jackson=====\nAfter his defeat to Couture, Liddell entered the [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]] 2003 Middleweight Grand Prix tournament as the official [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] representative. Liddell defeated [[Muay Thai]] specialist [[Alistair Overeem]] in the [[2003 in Pride FC#Pride Total Elimination 2003|first round of the tournament]]. In the action-packed bout, Liddell was getting out-landed by the taller, quicker and more technical striking of Overeem; later in the round Liddell landed an overhand punch to the head of Overeem, sending him staggering into the ropes. Liddell then rushed in with knees and straight rights and knocked Overeem out at the end of the first round. \n\nIn the next round, Liddell was eliminated by fan-favorite [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson]]. In the first round of his fight with Jackson, Liddell landed shots as he found his distance but Jackson countered with powerful strikes, rocking Liddell numerous times. In the second round, Jackson continued to out-land Liddell with big punches, but could not finish him. Later in the second round a visibly exhausted Liddell was taken down and received a barrage of punches from the ground. His corner threw in the towel, giving Jackson the upset victory.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Ortiz=====\n{{See also|Chuck Liddell vs. Tito Ortiz}}\nReturning to the UFC, Liddell was once again in contention for the light heavyweight title, preparing for a match with former champion Tito Ortiz. Eventually, after Ortiz lost the title to Randy Couture, the two would meet in a highly anticipated bout at ''[[UFC 47]]'' on April 2, 2004, in Las Vegas, Nevada. After most of the first round was spent feeling each other out, Liddell threw a few punches and a kick which was blocked by Ortiz, with Ortiz slapping himself on the head, taunting Liddell. \n\nWhen the round ended Ortiz pushed referee [[Big John McCarthy|\"Big\" John McCarthy]] out of his way, into Liddell, and the pair exchanged words. Shortly after the second round started, Liddell landed a flurry of punches that dropped Ortiz and led to a TKO victory. Ortiz has since stated that Liddell's thumb made contact with his eye, causing him momentarily to see \"nothing but black\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/fighting/2006/12/ortiz_looks_to_continue_challe.html |title=Ortiz looks to continue challenger trend |first=Jared |last=Barnes |work=Blogs.chron.com |date=December 20, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> Since ''[[UFC 47]]'', the bad blood between both fighters remained, with Ortiz repeatedly stating that he wanted \"his\" title belt back. Despite the tension, Ortiz and Liddell would not fight again for two and a half years.\n\n====Continued success====\n=====''The Ultimate Fighter''=====\nIn early 2005, Liddell was a coach on the inaugural season of ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'', [[Spike TV]]'s reality show which featured fighters competing for a UFC contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/chuck-liddell/person/314316/summary.html|title=Chuck Liddell: Summary|work=TV.com|date=May 26, 2007|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe coached Team Liddell, while then [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]] [[Randy Couture]] coached Team Couture. The series was a success for both Spike TV and the UFC. Both of the winners of the show, [[Diego Sanchez]] and [[Forrest Griffin]], were members of Team Liddell and went on to have very successful careers in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-kotc-and-k-1-salary-breakdown|title=UFC, KOTC, and K-1 Salary breakdown|work=MMAWeekly.com|date=August 11, 2005|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture II=====\nOn April 16, 2005, at ''[[UFC 52]]'', Liddell fought Randy Couture, again for the light heavyweight title. Couture moved in for a punch, Liddell countered with a big right hand to the temple of Couture, knocking him out cold, making him the new [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]].\n[[File:ChuckLiddell.png|thumb|150 px|left|Liddell in 2007]]\n\n=====Liddell vs. Horn II=====\nLiddell was scheduled to defend his new title against longtime veteran [[Jeremy Horn]], at ''[[UFC 54]]'', a matchup the UFC claimed was demanded by long-time fans of the sport since Horn had given Liddell his first loss.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sherdog.com|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Chuck-Liddell-192|title=Fight Finder - Chuck \"Iceman\" Liddell's Mixed Martial Arts Statistics|work=Sherdog.com|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> Throughout the bout, Liddell dominated with aggressive punches, causing [[Knockout#Knockdown|knockdown]]s in several rounds. Liddell's defensive [[wrestling]] ability, especially his [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawl]], stifled the bulk of Horn's offense, which was centered on [[grappling]] and [[submission wrestling]]. \n\nLiddell eventually won the fight via TKO in 2:46 minutes of the fourth round after Horn informed the referee that he could not see. He had been hit with a right punch to the eye causing him to bleed from his eye as well as his nose. Liddell had successfully defended his title and, in the process, avenged two of his three career losses.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Couture III=====\nOn February 4, 2006, at ''[[UFC 57]]'', Liddell faced [[Randy Couture]] in a rubber match, After an action packed first round, Liddell landed a big punch to Couture's face causing him to bleed, Couture bounced back with a take down of Liddell, but he was able to get up right away. Later in the second round as Couture moved in Liddell countered similar to in the second fight at [[UFC 52]] knocking Couture out, defeating Couture for the second time via knockout in Las Vegas, Nevada, to retain the light heavyweight championship belt. After the fight, Couture announced his retirement from mixed martial arts.\n\n=====Liddell vs. Sobral II=====\nIn his next defense, at ''[[UFC 62]]'' on August 26, 2006, Liddell would beat [[Renato Sobral|Renato \"Babalu\" Sobral]], who he had defeated nearly three years prior. Seconds after the fight started Sobral came running forward throwing punches. Liddell, moving backwards, was landing big punches, and a right uppercut ended the fight at 1:35 of the first round. It was announced during ''[[UFC 61]]'' that, were he to defeat Sobral, Liddell would face off against [[List of Pride champions|PRIDE Middleweight Champion]] [[Wanderlei Silva]]. The fight failed to materialize due to the competing promotions' inability to reach an agreement. UFC president [[Dana White]] attributed this to Silva's subsequent knockout loss to [[Mirko Filipovi\u0107]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/fighting/2006/09/liddellsilva_on_the_shelf_for.html |first=Jared |last=Barnes |title=Liddell-Silva on the shelf for now |work=Blogs.chron.com |date=September 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=====Liddell vs. Ortiz II=====\nIn what was the most financially successful UFC event up to that point, Liddell fought a rematch with [[Tito Ortiz]] at ''[[UFC 66]]'', which took place on December 30, 2006. Liddell's takedown defense neutralized Ortiz's wrestling ability, forcing Ortiz to stand up with a known striker. Although Ortiz did take Liddell down at one point in the fight, Liddell went on to defeat Ortiz via TKO in the third round to defend his light heavyweight championship successfully for a fourth time. It was later revealed that Liddell had torn his [[medial collateral ligament|MCL]] prior to the fight. He had also popped the tendon out on the middle finger on his left hand during the fight itself.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=18257\n|title=UFC Post-show Notes\n|last=Meltzer\n|first=Dave\n|authorlink=Dave Meltzer\n|work=[[Wrestling Observer|The Wrestling Observer]] website\n|date=December 31, 2006\n|accessdate=June 28, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\n====Title loss and decline====\n\n=====Liddell vs. Jackson II=====\nIn his fifth defense, Liddell would lose the title at ''[[UFC 71]]'' on May 26, 2007, in a rematch with [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson]]. Liddell was knocked down by a right hook less than two minutes into the first round and was unable to defend himself against Jackson's strikes on the ground, resulting in a knockout victory for Jackson.

His first appearance was in the [[Nintendo 64]] game ''D\u014dbutsu no Mori'', released in Europe and North America on the [[GameCube]] as ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]''. Mr. Resetti is a [[Mole (animal)|mole]] whose role in the series is to remind players to save before quitting the game, and to give a lecture if they do not. Mr. Resetti has received mixed critical reception.\n\n==Development and concept==\nDuring play testing of ''Animal Crossing'', players would [[Reset (computing)|reset]] the game and turn the [[system time]] backwards to make the daily stock at [[Tom Nook]]'s store change. In order to prevent this, the development team implemented Mr. Resetti, in hopes that players who want to cheat would be deterred due to the long speeches. If a player resets the game enough, Mr. Resetti will want the player to type out sentences such as \"I am stupid.\" and \"I stink.\" Contrary to popular belief, Mr. Resetti does not delete the player's saved file if that player keeps resetting the game. Mr. Resetti's English dialogue in ''Animal Crossing'' was written by Nintendo Treehouse team member Tim O'Leary, who intended the character to speak with a deep [[New York City English|Bronx accent]] to complement the character's [[Kansai dialect|Osaka accent]] in the original Japanese.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200310/N03.1010.1805.22997.htm |title=Interview: Bill Trinen Of Nintendo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031205115536/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200310/N03.1010.1805.22997.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2003 |date=October 10, 2003 |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> He is designed to make the player believe he knows them and is yelling directly at them, and the European ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk|Let's Go to the City]]'' manual warns that young children may find Mr. Resetti's authoritative tone of voice disturbing.<ref name=\"kotaku\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5106112/nintendo-animal-crossings-resetti-may-be-disturbing-to-young-children |title=Nintendo: Animal Crossing's Resetti \"May Be Disturbing To Young Children\" |website=[[Kotaku]] |author=Luke Plunkett |date=Dec 10, 2008 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\nMr. Resetti's role in the ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' series is to advise the player to remember to save before quitting the game.

His first appearance was in the [[Nintendo 64]] game ''D\u014dbutsu no Mori'', released in Europe and North America on the [[GameCube]] as ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]''. Mr. Resetti is a [[Mole (animal)|mole]] whose role in the series is to remind players to save before quitting the game, and to give a lecture if they do not. Mr. Resetti has received mixed critical reception.\n\n==Development and concept==\nDuring play testing of ''Animal Crossing'', players would [[Reset (computing)|reset]] the game and turn the [[system time]] backwards to make the daily stock at [[Tom Nook]]'s store change. In order to prevent this, the development team implemented Mr. Resetti, in hopes that players who want to cheat would be deterred due to the long speeches. If a player resets the game enough, Mr. Resetti will want the player to type out sentences such as \"I am stupid.\" and \"I stink.\" Contrary to popular belief, Mr. Resetti does not delete the player's saved file if that player keeps resetting the game. Mr. Resetti's English dialogue in ''Animal Crossing'' was written by Nintendo Treehouse team member Tim O'Leary, who intended the character to speak with a deep [[New York City English|Bronx accent]] to complement the character's [[Kansai dialect|Osaka accent]] in the original Japanese.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200310/N03.1010.1805.22997.htm |title=Interview: Bill Trinen Of Nintendo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031205115536/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200310/N03.1010.1805.22997.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2003 |date=October 10, 2003 |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> He is designed to make the player believe he knows them and is yelling directly at them, and the European ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk|Let's Go to the City]]'' manual warns that young children may find Mr. Resetti's authoritative tone of voice disturbing.<ref name=\"kotaku\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5106112/nintendo-animal-crossings-resetti-may-be-disturbing-to-young-children |title=Nintendo: Animal Crossing's Resetti \"May Be Disturbing To Young Children\" |website=[[Kotaku]] |author=Luke Plunkett |date=Dec 10, 2008 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\nMr. Resetti's role in the ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' series is to advise the player to remember to save before quitting the game.
