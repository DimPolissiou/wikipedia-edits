Optical storage, [[read-only memory|read-only]] CD-ROM followed by writeable CD and later read-only or writeable DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] players, became common in laptops early in the 2000s.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Compaqarmada7800.jpg|thumb|[[Compaq]] Armada laptop from the late 1990s]]\n[[File:Macbook Air.jpg|thumb|Apple [[MacBook Air]], an ultraportable laptop weighing under {{convert|3.0|lb|kg|2|abbr=on}}]]\n[[File:ThinkPad X220.jpg|thumb|[[Lenovo]]'s [[ThinkPad]] business laptop, originally an [[IBM]] product]]\n\n[[File:Asus Transformer Pad TF701T Tablet and Keyboard Dock.png|thumb|[[ASUS Transformer|Asus Transformer Pad]], a hybrid tablet, powered by [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Operating system|OS]]]]\n[[File:Microsoft Surface Pro 3 with Type Cover.jpg|thumb|[[Microsoft Surface Pro 3]], 2-in-1 detachable]]\n[[File:Alienware.JPG|thumb|[[Alienware]] gaming laptop]]\n[[Image:Toughbook-cf-m34 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Toughbook|Panasonic Toughbook]] CF-M34, a rugged laptop/subnotebook]]\n\nSince the introduction of portable computers during the late 1970s, their form has changed significantly, [[spawning]] a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses.  Except where there is a distinct legal [[trademark]] around a term (notably [[Ultrabook]]), there are rarely hard distinctions between these classes and their usage has varied over time and between different sources.\n\n===Traditional laptop===\nThe form of the traditional laptop computer is a clamshell, with a screen on one of its inner sides and a keyboard on the opposite, facing the screen. It can be easily folded to conserve space while traveling. The screen and keyboard are inaccessible while closed. Devices of this form are commonly called a 'traditional laptop' or notebook, particularly if they have a screen size of 11 to 17 inches measured diagonally and run a full-featured operating system like [[Windows 10]], [[macOS]], or [[GNU]]/[[Linux_kernel|Linux]]. Traditional laptops are the most common form of laptops, although [[Chromebook]]s, Ultrabooks, convertibles and 2-in-1s (described below) are becoming more common, with similar performance being achieved in their more portable or affordable forms.\n\n===Subnotebook===\n{{Main|Subnotebook}}\n\nA ''subnotebook'' or an ''ultraportable'', is a laptop designed and marketed with an emphasis on portability (small size, low weight, and often longer battery life). Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred.

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. These include [[Asus Transformer|Asus's Transformer Pad]] devices, examples of [[hybrid tablet|hybrids]] with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.\n\n===Desktop replacement===\n{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}\n{{See also|Gaming computer#Gaming laptop computers}}\n\nA desktop-replacement laptop is a class of large device which is not intended primarily for mobile use. These devices are bulkier and not as portable as other laptops, and are intended for use as compact and transportable alternatives to a desktop computer.<ref name=\"types_cnet\">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7602_7-1016082-2.html |title=Laptop Buying Guide |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. }}</ref> Desktop replacements are larger and typically heavier than other classes of laptops.

In the past, some laptops in this class used a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance for the same price at the expense of battery life, although this practice has largely died out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html |title=Desktop notebooks stake their claim |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |date=8 January 2003 }}</ref> The names ''Media Center Laptops'' and ''Gaming Laptops'' are used to describe specialized notebook computers, often overlapping with the desktop replacement form factor.<ref name=\"types_pcmag\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2311016,00.asp |title= Types of Laptops: How Do You Compute |accessdate=7 November 2008 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. |date=18 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Rugged laptop===\n{{Main|Rugged computer}}\n\nA rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are usually designed from scratch, rather than adapted from regular consumer laptop models. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/rugged-laptop.html |title=Rugged Laptop: Choices, Pointers &amp; Specs of Buying Rugged Laptops |accessdate=27 November 2008 |publisher=Linux-on-laptops.com}}</ref> and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.\n\nThe design features found in rugged laptops include a rubber sheeting under the keyboard keys, sealed port and connector covers, passive cooling, very bright displays easily readable in daylight, cases and frames made of lightweight magnesium alloys that are much stronger than plastics found in commercial laptops, and solid-state storage devices or hard disk drives that are shock mounted to withstand constant vibrations. Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] and adapted to mobile use, although desktop systems increasingly use the same smaller, lower-power parts which were originally developed for mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D\u00e9 specialist voor smartphone, tablet en laptop reparaties|title=Laptop reparatie|url=https://www.smart-repair.nl/laptop/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Smartrepair Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Almere en Utrecht|agency=www.smart-repair.nl|date=4 January 2013|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable, with the exception of components which can be detached, such as a battery or CD/CDR/DVD drive. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large \"tower\" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new [[motherboard]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and other components can be added. In a very compact laptop, such as laplets, there may be no upgradeable components at all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+3+Teardown/26595|website=iFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]], and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards and inability to upgrade components.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Building Blocks Platform,|url=http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516184350/http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2006|publisher=Intel|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following sections summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts.<ref name=\"parts-kate\">{{cite web |title = What Makes Laptops Work&nbsp;\u2013 The Laptop Motherboard |url = http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/laptopstabletpcs/tp/laptopmotherboards.htm |author = Catherine Roseberry |publisher = About.com |accessdate =15 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Display===\nInternally, a display is an LCD panel which could be CCFL or LED [[Backlight|backlit]] which interfaces to the laptop using the [[LVDS]] protocol, while externally, it can be a glossy screen or a matte screen. Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor.

The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters. [[Google]], with its updated version of [[Chromebook Pixel]], shows a similar transition trend towards USB-C, although keeping older USB Type-A ports for a better compatibility with older devices.<ref name=ChromebookPixel_2015>{{cite web|title=Chromebook Pixel|url=https://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel/|website=google.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Although being common until the end of the 2000s decade, [[Ethernet]] network port are rarely found on modern laptops, due to widespread use of [[wireless network]]ing, such as [[Wi-Fi]]. [[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use.

However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops. One study found that a laptop is three times more likely to break during the first year of use than a desktop.<ref>{{cite web| title = Gartner: Notebook PCs still prone to hardware failure| date = 27 June 2006| publisher = IDG News Service / ITWorld| url = http://www.itworld.com/060627notebookpc| accessdate =27 November 2008}}</ref> To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a lint-free or [[microfiber]] cloth for the LCD screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft. Setting one's laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterwards), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186235/how-to-secure-your-computer-with-a-bios-or-uefi-password/|title=How to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186881/hard-disk-passwords-explained-should-you-set-one-to-secure-your-files/|title=Hard Disk Passwords Explained: Should You Set One to Secure Your Files?|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref> Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them,<ref>[http://www.intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html#.UP2bUFSzBJN#ixzz2Ucm2oKSg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040557/http://intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html|date=6 June 2013}}, Ponemon Institute, The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem, September 2010</ref> however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.

Hardware specifications, such as the processor speed and memory capacity, significantly vary between different types, makes, models and [[price point]]s.\n\nDesign elements, [[form factor (design)|form factor]] and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on intended use. Examples of specialized models of laptops include [[rugged computer|rugged notebooks]] for use in construction or [[military applications]], as well as [[cost of goods sold|low production cost]] laptops such as those from the [[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC) organization, which incorporate features like [[solar power|solar charging]] and semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers. [[Portable computer]]s, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small [[niche market]], mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or for traveling sales representatives. As the portable computers evolved into the modern laptop, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.<ref name=NPD>{{cite web|title=U.S. Commercial Channel Computing Device Sales Set to End 2013 with Double-Digit Growth, According to NPD|url=https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/u-s-commercial-channel-computing-device-sales-set-to-end-2013-with-double-digit-growth-according-to-npd/|website=NPD Group|accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Terminology variants==\nThe terms ''laptop'' and ''notebook'' are used interchangeably to describe a portable computer in English, although in some parts of the world one or the other may be preferred.  There is some question as to the original etymology and specificity of either term\u2014the term ''laptop'' appears to have been coined in the early 1980s to describe a mobile computer which could be used on one's lap, and to distinguish these devices from earlier, much heavier, [[portable computers]] (informally called \"luggables\"). The term \"notebook\" appears to have gained currency somewhat later as manufacturers started producing even smaller portable devices, further reducing their weight and size and incorporating a display roughly the size of [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] paper; these were marketed as ''notebooks'' to distinguish them from bulkier laptops.<ref name=Buzzle>{{cite web|last1=Naik|first1=Abhijit|title=Notebook Vs.

Hard drives started to be used in portables, encouraged by the introduction of 3.5\" drives in the late 1980s, and became common in laptops starting with the introduction of 2.5\" and smaller drives around 1990; capacities have typically lagged behind physically larger desktop drives. Optical storage, [[read-only memory|read-only]] CD-ROM followed by writeable CD and later read-only or writeable DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] players, became common in laptops early in the 2000s.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Compaqarmada7800.jpg|thumb|[[Compaq]] Armada laptop from the late 1990s]]\n[[File:Macbook Air.jpg|thumb|Apple [[MacBook Air]], an ultraportable laptop weighing under {{convert|3.0|lb|kg|2|abbr=on}}]]\n[[File:ThinkPad X220.jpg|thumb|[[Lenovo]]'s [[ThinkPad]] business laptop, originally an [[IBM]] product]]\n\n[[File:Asus Transformer Pad TF701T Tablet and Keyboard Dock.png|thumb|[[ASUS Transformer|Asus Transformer Pad]], a hybrid tablet, powered by [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Operating system|OS]]]]\n[[File:Microsoft Surface Pro 3 with Type Cover.jpg|thumb|[[Microsoft Surface Pro 3]], 2-in-1 detachable]]\n[[File:Alienware.JPG|thumb|[[Alienware]] gaming laptop]]\n[[Image:Toughbook-cf-m34 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Toughbook|Panasonic Toughbook]] CF-M34, a rugged laptop/subnotebook]]\n\nSince the introduction of portable computers during the late 1970s, their form has changed significantly, [[spawning]] a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses.  Except where there is a distinct legal [[trademark]] around a term (notably [[Ultrabook]]), there are rarely hard distinctions between these classes and their usage has varied over time and between different sources.\n\n===Traditional laptop===\nThe form of the traditional laptop computer is a clamshell, with a screen on one of its inner sides and a keyboard on the opposite, facing the screen. It can be easily folded to conserve space while traveling. The screen and keyboard are inaccessible while closed. Devices of this form are commonly called a 'traditional laptop' or notebook, particularly if they have a screen size of 11 to 17 inches measured diagonally and run a full-featured operating system like [[Windows 10]], [[macOS]], or [[GNU]]/[[Linux_kernel|Linux]]. Traditional laptops are the most common form of laptops, although [[Chromebook]]s, Ultrabooks, convertibles and 2-in-1s (described below) are becoming more common, with similar performance being achieved in their more portable or affordable forms.\n\n===Subnotebook===\n{{Main|Subnotebook}}\n\nA ''subnotebook'' or an ''ultraportable'', is a laptop designed and marketed with an emphasis on portability (small size, low weight, and often longer battery life). Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred.

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. These include [[Asus Transformer|Asus's Transformer Pad]] devices, examples of [[hybrid tablet|hybrids]] with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.\n\n===Desktop replacement===\n{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}\n{{See also|Gaming computer#Gaming laptop computers}}\n\nA desktop-replacement laptop is a class of large device which is not intended primarily for mobile use. These devices are bulkier and not as portable as other laptops, and are intended for use as compact and transportable alternatives to a desktop computer.<ref name=\"types_cnet\">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7602_7-1016082-2.html |title=Laptop Buying Guide |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. }}</ref> Desktop replacements are larger and typically heavier than other classes of laptops.

Rugged laptops are usually designed from scratch, rather than adapted from regular consumer laptop models. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/rugged-laptop.html |title=Rugged Laptop: Choices, Pointers &amp; Specs of Buying Rugged Laptops |accessdate=27 November 2008 |publisher=Linux-on-laptops.com}}</ref> and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.\n\nThe design features found in rugged laptops include a rubber sheeting under the keyboard keys, sealed port and connector covers, passive cooling, very bright displays easily readable in daylight, cases and frames made of lightweight magnesium alloys that are much stronger than plastics found in commercial laptops, and solid-state storage devices or hard disk drives that are shock mounted to withstand constant vibrations. Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] and adapted to mobile use, although desktop systems increasingly use the same smaller, lower-power parts which were originally developed for mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D\u00e9 specialist voor smartphone, tablet en laptop reparaties|title=Laptop reparatie|url=https://www.smart-repair.nl/laptop/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Smartrepair Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Almere en Utrecht|agency=www.smart-repair.nl|date=4 January 2013|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable, with the exception of components which can be detached, such as a battery or CD/CDR/DVD drive. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large \"tower\" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new [[motherboard]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and other components can be added.

Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor. SSDs have a higher data transfer rate, lower power consumption, lower failure rate, and a larger capacity<ref name=\"behardware 2011\">BeHardware reported lower retailer return rates for SSDs than HDDs between April and October 2010. {{cite web | url=http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | title=Components returns rates | date=6 May 2011 | publisher=BeHardware | first=Marc | last=Prieur | accessdate=10 February 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214142908/http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | archive-date=14 February 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>A 2011 study by [[Intel]] on the use of 45,000 SSDs reported an annualized failure rate of 0.61% for SSDs, compared with 4.85% for HDDs. {{cite web | url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/it-management/intel-it/intel-it-validating-reliability-of-intel-solid-state-drives-brief.html | title=Validating the Reliability of Intel\u00ae Solid-State Drives |publisher=Intel|date=July 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"behardware 2012\">{{cite web | url = http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | publisher = BeHardware | title = Components returns rates (7) | first = Marc | last = Prieur | date = 16 November 2012 | accessdate = 25 August 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809033951/http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | archive-date = 9 August 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Samsung 16TB SSD is the World's Largest Hard Drive|url = http://petapixel.com/2015/08/15/samsung-16tb-ssd-is-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/|website = PetaPixel|accessdate = 20 September 2015}}</ref> compared to HDDs. However, HDDs have a significantly lower cost.\n\nMost laptops can contain a single 2.5-inch drive, but a small number of laptops with a screen wider than 15 inches can house two drives. Some laptops support a hybrid mode, combining a 2.5-inch drive, typically a spacious HDD for data, with an mSATA or M.2 SDD drive, typically having less capacity, but a significantly faster read/write speed. The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters.

[[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use.

However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.\n\n=====Neck and spine=====\nA laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a [[Docking station#Computer stands|computer stand]].\n\n=====Possible effect on fertility=====\nA study by [[State University of New York]] researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap, potentially putting [[sperm count]] at risk. The study, which included roughly two dozen men between the ages of 21 and 35, found that the sitting position required to balance a laptop can increase scrotum temperature by as much as {{convert|2.1|C-change|0}}.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops. One study found that a laptop is three times more likely to break during the first year of use than a desktop.<ref>{{cite web| title = Gartner: Notebook PCs still prone to hardware failure| date = 27 June 2006| publisher = IDG News Service / ITWorld| url = http://www.itworld.com/060627notebookpc| accessdate =27 November 2008}}</ref> To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a lint-free or [[microfiber]] cloth for the LCD screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.  The data destruction process ensures that all information or data that has been stored on a laptops hard drive can never be retrieved again.

The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on.

With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years.

Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for [[Equity (finance)|equity]], or an ownership stake, in those companies. Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky [[Startup company|start-ups]] in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful. Because [[Startup company|startups]] face high uncertainty,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmitt|first=Antje|last2=Rosing|first2=Kathrin|last3=Zhang|first3=Stephen X.|last4=Leatherbee|first4=Michael|date=2017-09-21|title=A Dynamic Model of Entrepreneurial Uncertainty and Business Opportunity Identification: Exploration as a Mediator and Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy as a Moderator|journal=Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice|volume=42|issue=6|language=en|pages=835\u2013859|doi=10.1177/1042258717721482|issn=1042-2587}}</ref> VC investments have high rates of failure. The start-ups are usually based on an [[innovation|innovative technology]] or [[business model]] and they are usually from the [[high technology]] industries, such as [[information technology]] (IT), [[clean technology]] or [[biotechnology]].\n[[File:Startup Financing Cycle.png|thumb|right|400px|A financing diagram illustrating how [[start-up company|start-up companies]] are typically financed.

Then, if the firm can survive through the \"[[:wikt:valley of death|valley of death]]\"\u2013the period where the firm is trying to develop on a \"shoestring\" budget\u2013the firm can seek venture capital financing.]]\n\nThe typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial \"[[seed funding]]\" round. The first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the [[Series A round]]. Venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a [[Profit (economics)|return]] through an eventual \"exit\" event, such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) or doing a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisition]] (also known as a \"trade sale\") of the company. Alternatively, an exit may come about via the [[private equity secondary market]].\n\nIn addition to [[angel investing]], [[equity crowdfunding]] and other [[seed funding]] options, venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise [[capital (economics)|capital]] in the [[public market]]s and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a [[loan|bank loan]] or complete a [[debt|debt offering]]. In exchange for the high [[Financial risk|risk]] that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and early-stage companies, venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions, in addition to a significant portion of the companies' ownership (and consequently value). Start-ups like [[Uber]], [[Airbnb]], [[Flipkart]], [[Xiaomi]] & [[Didi Chuxing]] are highly valued startups, commonly known as unicorns, where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these early-stage firms; they also often provide strategic advice to the firm's executives on its [[business model]] and marketing strategies.\n\nVenture capital is also a way in which the [[Private sector|private]] and [[public sector]]s can construct an institution that systematically creates [[business network]]s for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop. This institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance, technical expertise, [[mentoring]], talent acquisition, strategic partnership, marketing \"know-how\", and [[business model]]s. Once integrated into the business network, these firms are more likely to succeed, as they become \"nodes\" in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain.<ref>Article: The New Argonauts, Global Search And Local Institution Building.

The [[Wallenberg family|Wallenbergs]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], [[Whitney family|Whitneys]], [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], and [[Warburg family|Warburgs]] were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century. In 1938, [[Laurance S. Rockefeller]] helped finance the creation of both [[Eastern Air Lines]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]], and the Rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies. [[Eric M. Warburg]] founded [[E.M. Warburg & Co.]] in 1938, which would ultimately become [[Warburg Pincus]], with investments in both [[leveraged buyouts]] and venture capital. The [[Wallenberg family]] started [[Investor AB]] in 1916 in Sweden and were early investors in several Swedish companies such as [[ABB]], [[Atlas Copco]], [[Ericsson]], etc. in the first half of the 20th century. ([[History of private equity and venture capital|History of venture capital]])\n\n===Origins of modern private equity===\nBefore [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945), money orders (originally known as \"development capital\") remained primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families.

More often than not, these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic, medical, or data-processing technology.

Rockefeller]], the fourth of [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.|John D. Rockefeller's]] six children, as a way to allow other Rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments.\n\nIt was also in the 1960s that the common form of [[private equity fund]], still in use today, emerged. [[Private equity firm]]s organized [[limited partnership]]s to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as [[general partner]] and the investors, who were passive [[limited partners]], put up the capital. The compensation structure, still in use today, also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of 1.0\u20132.5% and a [[carried interest]] typically representing up to 20% of the profits of the partnership.\n\nThe growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] in 1972. Located in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park, CA]], Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many [[semiconductor]] companies based in the [[Santa Clara Valley]] as well as early [[computer]] firms using their devices and programming and service companies.{{NoteTag|In 1971, a series of articles entitled \"Silicon Valley USA\" were published in the [[Electronic News]], a weekly trade publication, giving rise to the use of the term [[Silicon Valley]].}}\n\nThroughout the 1970s, a group of private equity firms, focused primarily on venture capital investments, would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms. In 1973, with the number of new venture capital firms increasing, leading venture capitalists formed the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). The NVCA was to serve as the [[industry trade group]] for the venture capital industry.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nvca.org/ |title = Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730052236/http://www.nvca.org/ |archivedate=July 30, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} Official website of the National Venture Capital Association, the largest trade association for the venture capital industry.</ref> Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund.\n\nIt was not until 1978 that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year, as the industry raised approximately $750 million. With the passage of the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) in 1974, corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in [[privately held]] companies. In 1978, the US Labor Department relaxed certain restrictions of the ERISA, under the \"[[prudent man rule]]\"{{NoteTag|The \"prudent man rule\" is a [[fiduciary responsibility]] of investment managers under ERISA. Under the original application, each investment was expected to adhere to risk standards on its own merits, limiting the ability of investment managers to make any investments deemed potentially risky.  Under the revised 1978 interpretation, the concept of portfolio diversification of risk, measuring risk at the aggregate portfolio level rather than the investment level to satisfy fiduciary standards would also be accepted.}}, thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists.\n\n===1980s===\nThe public successes of the venture capital industry in the 1970s and early 1980s (e.g., [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Genentech]]) gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms. From just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade, there were over 650 firms by the end of the 1980s, each searching for the next major \"home run.\"  The number of firms multiplied, and the capital managed by these firms increased from $3 billion to $31 billion over the course of the decade.<ref name=VCVigor>POLLACK, ANDREW.  \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D61E3CF93BA35753C1A96F948260 Venture Capital Loses Its Vigor].\"  [[New York Times]], October 8, 1989.</ref>\n\nThe growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns, and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time.  In addition to the increased competition among firms, several other factors affected returns. The market for initial public offerings cooled in the mid-1980s before collapsing after the stock market crash in 1987, and foreign corporations, particularly from [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], flooded early-stage companies with capital.<ref name=\"VCVigor\"/>\n\nIn response to the changing conditions, corporations that had sponsored in-house venture investment arms, including [[General Electric]] and [[Paine Webber]] either sold off or closed these venture capital units.  Additionally, venture capital units within [[Chemical Banking|Chemical Bank]] and [[Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company|Continental Illinois National Bank]], among others, began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies.

Growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, increasing from $3 billion in 1983 to just over $4 billion more than a decade later in 1994.\n\nAfter a shakeout of venture capital managers, the more successful firms retrenched, focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments.  Results would begin to turn very attractive, successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the 1990s. [[Yale School of Management]] Professor [[Andrew Metrick]] refers to these first 15 years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in 1980 as the \"pre-boom period\" in anticipation of the boom that would begin in 1995 and last through the bursting of the [[Internet bubble]] in 2000.<ref>Metrick, Andrew.  ''Venture Capital and the Finance of Innovation.''  John Wiley & Sons, 2007. p.12</ref>\n\nThe late 1990s were a boom time for venture capital, as firms on [[Sand Hill Road]] in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] and [[Silicon Valley]] benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent Internet and other computer technologies. Initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance, and venture firms were reaping large returns.\n\n===Private equity crash===\n[[File:Nasdaq2.png|thumb|280px|The technology-heavy [[NASDAQ Composite]] index peaked at 5,048 in March 2000 reflecting the high point of the dot-com bubble.]]\nThe [[Nasdaq]] crash and technology slump that started in March 2000 shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed. Over the next two years, many venture firms had been forced to write-off large proportions of their investments, and many funds were significantly \"[[Under water (loan)|under water]]\" (the values of the fund's investments were below the amount of capital invested). Venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds, and, in numerous instances, investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the [[private equity secondary market|secondary market]].

As a percentage of GDP, venture investment was 0.058% in 1994, peaked at 1.087% (nearly 19 times the 1994 level) in 2000 and ranged from 0.164% to 0.182% in 2003 and 2004. The revival of an [[Internet]]-driven environment in 2004 through 2007 helped to revive the venture capital environment. However, as a percentage of the overall private equity market, venture capital has still not reached its mid-1990s level, let alone its peak in 2000.\n\nVenture capital funds, which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in 2000 (the height of the [[dot-com bubble]]), raised only $25.1 billion in 2006, a 2% decline from 2005 and a significant decline from its peak.<ref>Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst as referenced in Taub, Stephen.  {{cite web |url=http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/8537972/c_8519925?f=home_todayinfinance |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614003624/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/8537972/c_8519925?f=home_todayinfinance |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} Record Year for Private Equity Fundraising.

This return is generally earned when the venture capitalist \"exits\" by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner.\n\nVenture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in, with a Stanford survey of venture capitalists revealing that 100 companies were considered for every company receiving financing.\n<ref>{{Cite news|title=How Do Venture Capitalists Make Decisions?|work=Stanford University Graduate School of Business Research Paper|df=mdy-all|ssrn = 2801385}}</ref> Ventures receiving financing must demonstrate an excellent management team, a large potential market, and most importantly high growth potential, as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame (typically 3\u20137 years) that venture capitalists expect.\n\nBecause investments are [[Market liquidity|illiquid]] and require the extended time frame to harvest, venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed [[due diligence]] prior to investment. Venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest, in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] stage when [[Valuation (finance)|valuations]] are favourable. Venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the company's development:<ref>[http://www.banknetindia.com/finance/vcapital.htm Investment philosophy of VCs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612195436/http://www.banknetindia.com/finance/vcapital.htm |date=June 12, 2008 }}.</ref>\n* [[Business idea|Idea generation]];\n* [[Startup company|Start-up]];\n* [[Ramp up]]; and\n* [[Exit strategy#In business|Exit]]\n\nBecause there are no public exchanges listing their securities, private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways, including warm referrals from the investors' trusted sources and other business contacts; investor conferences and symposia; and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in face-to-face meetings, including a variant known as \"Speed Venturing\", which is akin to speed-dating for capital, where the investor decides within 10 minutes whether he wants a follow-up meeting. In addition, some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/10100885.stm Cash-strapped entrepreneurs get creative, BBC News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521154619/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/10100885.stm |date=May 21, 2010 }}.</ref>There are also many contests that have sprung up to get investors, by competing with [https://www.rrgraphdesign.com/blog/ideas-to-hook-up-right-venture-capital-with-presentation-pitch-deck/ Pitch Deck] with broader classification of criteria (technology, education, and even social).\n\nThis need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies, and most suitable for businesses having large up-front [[capital requirement]]s, which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt. That is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software, and other intellectual property, whose value is unproven. In turn, this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fast-growing [[high tech|technology]] and [[life sciences]] or [[biotechnology]] fields.\n\nIf a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan, a good management team, investment and passion from the founders, a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle, and target minimum returns in excess of 40% per year, it will find it easier to raise venture capital.\n\n===Financing stages===\nThere are typically six stages of [[venture round]] financing offered in Venture Capital, that roughly correspond to these stages of a company's development.<ref>''Corporate Finance'', 8th Edition.  Ross, Westerfield, Jaffe. McGraw-Hill publishing, 2008.</ref>\n* [[Seed money|Seed funding]]: The earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea, often provided by [[angel investor]]s. [[Equity crowdfunding]] is also emerging as an option for seed funding.\n* Start-up: Early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development\n* Growth  ([[Series A round]]): Early sales and manufacturing funds. This is typically where VCs come in. Series A can be thought of as the first institutional round. Subsequent investment rounds are called Series B, Series C and so on. This is where most companies will have the most growth.\n* Second-Round: [[Working capital]] for early stage companies that are selling product, but not yet turning a profit. This can also be called Series B round and so on.\n* Expansion: Also called [[Mezzanine capital|Mezzanine financing]], this is expansion money for a newly profitable company\n* Exit of venture capitalist: VCs can exit through secondary sale or an IPO or an acquisition. Early stage VCs may exit in later rounds when new investors (VCs or Private Equity investors) buy the shares of existing investors. Sometimes a company very close to an IPO may allow some VCs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the IPO.\n* Bridge Financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full VC rounds. The objective is to raise smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate.\n\nBetween the first round and the fourth round, venture-backed companies may also seek to take [[venture debt]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://bootlaw.com/2010/06/14/up-up-and-away-should-you-be-thinking-about-venture-debt/ |title = Bootlaw&nbsp;\u2013 Essential law for startups and emerging tech businesses&nbsp;\u2013 Up, Up and Away.

A venture capital fund refers to a [[Investment fund|pooled investment]] vehicle (in the United States, often an [[Limited partnership|LP]] or [[Limited liability company|LLC]]) that primarily invests the [[financial capital]] of third-party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard [[capital market]]s or [[loan|bank loans]]. These funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm, which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds (scientists, researchers), business training and/or deep industry experience.\n\nA core skill within VC is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage. By definition, VCs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage, thus adding skills as well as capital, thereby differentiating VC from buy-out private equity, which typically invest in companies with proven revenue, and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns. Inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of one's investment in a given startup company. As a consequence, most venture capital investments are done in a pool format, where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies. By investing in the pool format, the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm.\n[[File:Venture Capital Fund Diagram.png|500px|thumb|right|Diagram of the structure of a generic venture capital fund]]\n\n===Structure===\nVenture capital firms are typically structured as [[partnerships]], the [[general partners]] of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised. Venture capital firms in the United States may also be structured as [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]], in which case the firm's managers are known as managing members.  Investors in venture capital funds are known as [[limited partner]]s. This constituency comprises both high-net-worth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital, such as state and private [[pension fund]]s, university [[financial endowment]]s, foundations, [[insurance]] companies, and [[Collective investment scheme|pooled investment]] vehicles, called [[Fund of funds|funds of funds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280083626|title=The interplay of track record and trustworthiness in venture capital fundraising|author=Andreas Kuckertz|date=December 1, 2015|work=ResearchGate|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927114350/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/280083626_The_interplay_of_track_record_and_trustworthiness_in_venture_capital_fundraising|archivedate=September 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Types===\nVenture capitalist firms differ in their motivations<ref>R\u00f6hm, P., K\u00f6hn, A., Kuckertz, A. and Dehnen, H.

Journal of Business Economics. [[doi:10.1007/s11573-017-0857-5]]</ref> and approaches. There are multiple factors, and each firm is different.\n\nVenture capital funds are generally three in types:\n1. Angel investors \n2. Financial VCs \n3. Strategic VCs\n\nSome of the factors that influence VC decisions include:\n* Business situation: Some VCs tend to invest in new, disruptive ideas, or fledgling companies. Others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow.\n* Some invest solely in certain industries.\n* Some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally.\n* VC expectations can often vary. Some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth. The amount of help a VC provides can vary from one firm to the next.\n\n===Roles===\nWithin the venture capital industry, the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as \"venture capitalists\" or \"VCs\".  Typical career backgrounds vary, but, broadly speaking, venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background.  Venture capitalists with an operational background ([[operating partner]]) tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants.  Venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have [[investment banking]] or other [[corporate finance]] experience.\n\nAlthough the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm, other positions at venture capital firms include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Role\n|-\n|General Partners or GPs\n|They run the Venture Capital firm and make the investment decisions on behalf of the fund. GPs typically put in personal capital up to 1-2% of the VC Fund size to show their commitment to the LPs.\n|-\n|Venture partners\n|Venture partners are expected to source potential investment opportunities (\"bring in deals\") and typically are compensated only for those deals with which they are involved.\n|-\n|Principal\n|This is a mid-level investment professional position, and often considered a \"partner-track\" position.  Principals will have been promoted from a senior associate position or who have commensurate experience in another field, such as [[investment banking]], [[management consulting]], or a market of particular interest to the strategy of the venture capital firm.\n|-\n|Associate\n|This is typically the most junior apprentice position within a venture capital firm.  After a few successful years, an associate may move up to the \"senior associate\" position and potentially principal and beyond.  Associates will often have worked for 1\u20132 years in another field, such as [[investment banking]] or [[management consulting]].\n|-\n|Entrepreneur-in-residence\n|Entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs) are experts in a particular industry sector (e.g., biotechnology or social media) and perform [[due diligence]] on potential deals. EIRs are hired by venture capital firms temporarily (six to 18 months) and are expected to develop and pitch startup ideas to their host firm, although neither party is bound to work with each other. Some EIRs move on to executive positions within a portfolio company.\n|}\n\n===Structure of the funds===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nMost [[private equity fund|venture capital funds]] have a fixed life of 10 years, with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity.  The investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years, after which the focus is managing and making follow-on investments in an existing portfolio.  This model was pioneered by successful funds in [[Silicon Valley]] through the 1980s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance, and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product.\n\nIn such a fund, the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently \"called down\" by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments. There are substantial penalties for a limited partner (or investor) that fails to participate in a [[capital call]].\n\nIt can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund. At the time when all of the money has been raised, the fund is said to be closed, and the 10-year lifetime begins.  Some funds have partial closes when one half (or some other amount) of the fund has been raised. The [[vintage year]] generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify VC funds for comparison.\n\nFrom investors' point of view, funds can be: (1) [[private equity fund|traditional]]\u2014where all the investors invest with equal terms; or (2) [[asymmetric fund|asymmetric]]\u2014where different investors have different terms. Typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where there's an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors.\n\n===Compensation===\n{{Main|Carried interest}}\nVenture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and [[carried interest]] (often referred to as a \"two and 20\" arrangement):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Payment\n!Implementation\n|-\n|Management fees\n|an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations.<ref name=calpersdictionary>[http://www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=/investments/assets/equities/aim/pe-glossary.xml Private equity industry dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505124540/http://www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=%2Finvestments%2Fassets%2Fequities%2Faim%2Fpe-glossary.xml |date=May 5, 2008 }}. [[CalPERS]] Alternative Investment Program</ref>  In a typical venture capital fund, the general partners receive an annual management fee equal to up to 2% of the committed capital.\n|-\n|Carried interest\n|a share of the profits of the fund (typically 20%), paid to the private equity fund's management company as a performance incentive.  The remaining 80% of the profits are paid to the fund's investors<ref name=\"calpersdictionary\"/>  Strong limited partner interest in top-tier venture firms has led to a general trend toward terms more favorable to the venture partnership, and certain groups are able to command carried interest of 25\u201330% on their funds.\n|}\n\nBecause a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life, larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time; doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged.  Smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts; by the time the fund cashes out, an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending, whom the general partners may not know well, and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know.\n\n===Alternatives===\nBecause of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments, many entrepreneurs seek [[seed funding]] from [[angel investors]], who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities, or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur. Additionally, entrepreneurs may seek alternative financing, such as [[revenue-based financing]], to avoid giving up equity ownership in the business.\n\nFurthermore, many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a [[start-up company]] otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology and/or market potential for its product or services. To achieve this, or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven, many start-ups seek to self-finance [[sweat equity]] until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or [[angel investors]]. This practice is called \"[[bootstrapping (business)|bootstrapping]]\".\n\n[[Equity crowdfunding]] is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital. Traditional [[crowdfunding]] is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations. While such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity, it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs, now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost. Some [[equity crowdfunding]] models are also being applied specifically for startup funding, such as those listed at [[Comparison of crowd funding services]]. One of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional VC model. The traditional VCs are shifting their focus to later-stage investments, and [[return on investment]] of many VC funds have been low or negative.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web |url = https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/grow-vc-launches-aiming-to-become-the-kiva-for-tech-startups/ |title = Grow VC launches, aiming to become the Kiva for tech startups |publisher = Eu.techcrunch.com |date = February 15, 2010 |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120530064252/http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/grow-vc-launches-aiming-to-become-the-kiva-for-tech-startups/ |archivedate = May 30, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn Europe and India, [[Media for equity]] is a partial alternative to venture capital funding.

Good examples would include asset-intensive extractive industries such as mining, or manufacturing industries. Offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts, which seek to use securitization in structuring hybrid multi-market transactions via an SPV ([[special purpose vehicle]]): a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing.\n\nIn addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks, groups have emerged, which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://growvc.com |title = Grow Venture Community |publisher = Growvc.com |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209014634/http://www.growvc.com/ |archivedate = February 9, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLaw firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it.<ref>{{cite web |last = Austin |first = Scott |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703453804575479650072184066 |title = \"Law Firms Offer Discounts, Play Matchmaker,\" The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 9, 2010 |publisher = Online.wsj.com |date = September 9, 2010 |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150115040929/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703453804575479650072184066 |archivedate = January 15, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOther forms include [[venture resources]] that seek to provide non-monetary support to launch a new venture.\n\n==Societal impact==\n\nVenture capital is also associated with job creation (accounting for 2% of US GDP),<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nvca.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=255&Itemid=103 |title = Venture Impact: The Economic Importance of Venture-Backed Companies to the U.S. Economy |publisher = National Venture Capital Association |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140630170428/http://www.nvca.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=255&Itemid=103 |archivedate = June 30, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> the [[knowledge economy]], and used as a proxy measure of [[innovation]] within an economic sector or geography.

An enhanced 35% refundable tax credit of available to certain (i.e. small) Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs). Because the CCPC rules require a minimum of 50% Canadian ownership in the company performing R&D, foreign investors who would like to benefit from the larger 35% tax credit must accept minority position in the company, which might not be desirable.

The South African Government and Revenue Service is following the international trend of using tax-efficient vehicles to propel economic growth and job creation through venture capital. Section 12 J of the ''Income Tax Act'' was updated to include venture capital. Companies are allowed to use a tax-efficient structure similar to VCTs in the UK.  Despite the above structure, the government needs to adjust its regulation around [[intellectual property]], exchange control and other legislation to ensure that Venture capital succeeds.\n\nCurrently, there are not many venture capital funds in operation and it is a small community; however, the number of venture funds are steadily increasing with new incentives slowly coming in from government. Funds are difficult to come by and due to the limited funding, companies are more likely to receive funding if they can demonstrate initial sales or traction and the potential for significant growth.  The majority of the venture capital in Sub-Saharan Africa is centered on South Africa and Kenya.\n\n==Confidential information==\nUnlike [[public company|public companies]], information regarding an entrepreneur's business is typically confidential and proprietary.  As part of the [[due diligence]] process, most venture capitalists will require significant detail with respect to a company's business plan.  Entrepreneurs must remain vigilant about sharing information with venture capitalists that are investors in their competitors.  Most venture capitalists treat information confidentially, but as a matter of business practice, they do not typically enter into [[Non Disclosure Agreement]]s because of the potential liability issues those agreements entail.

Then, if the firm can survive through the \"[[:wikt:valley of death|valley of death]]\"\u2013the period where the firm is trying to develop on a \"shoestring\" budget\u2013the firm can seek venture capital financing.]]\n\nThe typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial \"[[seed funding]]\" round. The first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the [[Series A round]]. Venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a [[Profit (economics)|return]] through an eventual \"exit\" event, such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) or doing a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisition]] (also known as a \"trade sale\") of the company. Alternatively, an exit may come about via the [[private equity secondary market]].\n\nIn addition to [[angel investing]], [[equity crowdfunding]] and other [[seed funding]] options, venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise [[capital (economics)|capital]] in the [[public market]]s and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a [[loan|bank loan]] or complete a [[debt|debt offering]]. In exchange for the high [[Financial risk|risk]] that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and early-stage companies, venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions, in addition to a significant portion of the companies' ownership (and consequently value). Start-ups like [[Uber]], [[Airbnb]], [[Flipkart]], [[Xiaomi]] & [[Didi Chuxing]] are highly valued startups, commonly known as unicorns, where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these early-stage firms; they also often provide strategic advice to the firm's executives on its [[business model]] and marketing strategies.\n\nVenture capital is also a way in which the [[Private sector|private]] and [[public sector]]s can construct an institution that systematically creates [[business network]]s for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop. This institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance, technical expertise, [[mentoring]], talent acquisition, strategic partnership, marketing \"know-how\", and [[business model]]s. Once integrated into the business network, these firms are more likely to succeed, as they become \"nodes\" in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain.<ref>Article: The New Argonauts, Global Search And Local Institution Building.

Rockefeller]], the fourth of [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.|John D.

[[Private equity firm]]s organized [[limited partnership]]s to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as [[general partner]] and the investors, who were passive [[limited partners]], put up the capital. The compensation structure, still in use today, also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of 1.0\u20132.5% and a [[carried interest]] typically representing up to 20% of the profits of the partnership.\n\nThe growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] in 1972. Located in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park, CA]], Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many [[semiconductor]] companies based in the [[Santa Clara Valley]] as well as early [[computer]] firms using their devices and programming and service companies.{{NoteTag|In 1971, a series of articles entitled \"Silicon Valley USA\" were published in the [[Electronic News]], a weekly trade publication, giving rise to the use of the term [[Silicon Valley]].}}\n\nThroughout the 1970s, a group of private equity firms, focused primarily on venture capital investments, would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms. In 1973, with the number of new venture capital firms increasing, leading venture capitalists formed the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). The NVCA was to serve as the [[industry trade group]] for the venture capital industry.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nvca.org/ |title = Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730052236/http://www.nvca.org/ |archivedate=July 30, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} Official website of the National Venture Capital Association, the largest trade association for the venture capital industry.</ref> Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund.\n\nIt was not until 1978 that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year, as the industry raised approximately $750 million. With the passage of the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) in 1974, corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in [[privately held]] companies. In 1978, the US Labor Department relaxed certain restrictions of the ERISA, under the \"[[prudent man rule]]\"{{NoteTag|The \"prudent man rule\" is a [[fiduciary responsibility]] of investment managers under ERISA. Under the original application, each investment was expected to adhere to risk standards on its own merits, limiting the ability of investment managers to make any investments deemed potentially risky.  Under the revised 1978 interpretation, the concept of portfolio diversification of risk, measuring risk at the aggregate portfolio level rather than the investment level to satisfy fiduciary standards would also be accepted.}}, thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists.\n\n===1980s===\nThe public successes of the venture capital industry in the 1970s and early 1980s (e.g., [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Genentech]]) gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms. From just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade, there were over 650 firms by the end of the 1980s, each searching for the next major \"home run.\"  The number of firms multiplied, and the capital managed by these firms increased from $3 billion to $31 billion over the course of the decade.<ref name=VCVigor>POLLACK, ANDREW.  \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D61E3CF93BA35753C1A96F948260 Venture Capital Loses Its Vigor].\"  [[New York Times]], October 8, 1989.</ref>\n\nThe growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns, and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time.  In addition to the increased competition among firms, several other factors affected returns. The market for initial public offerings cooled in the mid-1980s before collapsing after the stock market crash in 1987, and foreign corporations, particularly from [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], flooded early-stage companies with capital.<ref name=\"VCVigor\"/>\n\nIn response to the changing conditions, corporations that had sponsored in-house venture investment arms, including [[General Electric]] and [[Paine Webber]] either sold off or closed these venture capital units.  Additionally, venture capital units within [[Chemical Banking|Chemical Bank]] and [[Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company|Continental Illinois National Bank]], among others, began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies.

Growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, increasing from $3 billion in 1983 to just over $4 billion more than a decade later in 1994.\n\nAfter a shakeout of venture capital managers, the more successful firms retrenched, focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments.  Results would begin to turn very attractive, successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the 1990s. [[Yale School of Management]] Professor [[Andrew Metrick]] refers to these first 15 years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in 1980 as the \"pre-boom period\" in anticipation of the boom that would begin in 1995 and last through the bursting of the [[Internet bubble]] in 2000.<ref>Metrick, Andrew.  ''Venture Capital and the Finance of Innovation.''  John Wiley & Sons, 2007. p.12</ref>\n\nThe late 1990s were a boom time for venture capital, as firms on [[Sand Hill Road]] in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] and [[Silicon Valley]] benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent Internet and other computer technologies. Initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance, and venture firms were reaping large returns.\n\n===Private equity crash===\n[[File:Nasdaq2.png|thumb|280px|The technology-heavy [[NASDAQ Composite]] index peaked at 5,048 in March 2000 reflecting the high point of the dot-com bubble.]]\nThe [[Nasdaq]] crash and technology slump that started in March 2000 shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed. Over the next two years, many venture firms had been forced to write-off large proportions of their investments, and many funds were significantly \"[[Under water (loan)|under water]]\" (the values of the fund's investments were below the amount of capital invested). Venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds, and, in numerous instances, investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the [[private equity secondary market|secondary market]]. By mid-2003, the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its 2001 capacity. Nevertheless, [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PricewaterhouseCoopers']] MoneyTree Survey<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pwcmoneytree.com/moneytree/index.jsp |title = MoneyTree Survey |publisher = Pwcmoneytree.com |date = February 21, 2007 |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070614161950/http://www.pwcmoneytree.com/moneytree/index.jsp |archivedate = June 14, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> shows that total venture capital investments held steady at 2003 levels through the second quarter of 2005.\n\nAlthough the post-boom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in 2000, they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from 1980 through 1995. As a percentage of GDP, venture investment was 0.058% in 1994, peaked at 1.087% (nearly 19 times the 1994 level) in 2000 and ranged from 0.164% to 0.182% in 2003 and 2004. The revival of an [[Internet]]-driven environment in 2004 through 2007 helped to revive the venture capital environment. However, as a percentage of the overall private equity market, venture capital has still not reached its mid-1990s level, let alone its peak in 2000.\n\nVenture capital funds, which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in 2000 (the height of the [[dot-com bubble]]), raised only $25.1 billion in 2006, a 2% decline from 2005 and a significant decline from its peak.<ref>Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst as referenced in Taub, Stephen.  {{cite web |url=http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/8537972/c_8519925?f=home_todayinfinance |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614003624/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/8537972/c_8519925?f=home_todayinfinance |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} Record Year for Private Equity Fundraising.  CFO.com, January 11, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Funding==\nObtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan. Lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business. Venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business. The return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business. This return is generally earned when the venture capitalist \"exits\" by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner.\n\nVenture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in, with a Stanford survey of venture capitalists revealing that 100 companies were considered for every company receiving financing.\n<ref>{{Cite news|title=How Do Venture Capitalists Make Decisions?|work=Stanford University Graduate School of Business Research Paper|df=mdy-all|ssrn = 2801385}}</ref> Ventures receiving financing must demonstrate an excellent management team, a large potential market, and most importantly high growth potential, as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame (typically 3\u20137 years) that venture capitalists expect.\n\nBecause investments are [[Market liquidity|illiquid]] and require the extended time frame to harvest, venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed [[due diligence]] prior to investment. Venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest, in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] stage when [[Valuation (finance)|valuations]] are favourable. Venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the company's development:<ref>[http://www.banknetindia.com/finance/vcapital.htm Investment philosophy of VCs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612195436/http://www.banknetindia.com/finance/vcapital.htm |date=June 12, 2008 }}.</ref>\n* [[Business idea|Idea generation]];\n* [[Startup company|Start-up]];\n* [[Ramp up]]; and\n* [[Exit strategy#In business|Exit]]\n\nBecause there are no public exchanges listing their securities, private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways, including warm referrals from the investors' trusted sources and other business contacts; investor conferences and symposia; and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in face-to-face meetings, including a variant known as \"Speed Venturing\", which is akin to speed-dating for capital, where the investor decides within 10 minutes whether he wants a follow-up meeting. In addition, some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/10100885.stm Cash-strapped entrepreneurs get creative, BBC News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521154619/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/10100885.stm |date=May 21, 2010 }}.</ref>\n\nThis need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies, and most suitable for businesses having large up-front [[capital requirement]]s, which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt. That is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software, and other intellectual property, whose value is unproven. In turn, this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fast-growing [[high tech|technology]] and [[life sciences]] or [[biotechnology]] fields.\n\nIf a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan, a good management team, investment and passion from the founders, a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle, and target minimum returns in excess of 40% per year, it will find it easier to raise venture capital.\n\n===Financing stages===\nThere are typically six stages of [[venture round]] financing offered in Venture Capital, that roughly correspond to these stages of a company's development.<ref>''Corporate Finance'', 8th Edition.  Ross, Westerfield, Jaffe. McGraw-Hill publishing, 2008.</ref>\n* [[Seed money|Seed funding]]: The earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea, often provided by [[angel investor]]s. [[Equity crowdfunding]] is also emerging as an option for seed funding.\n* Start-up: Early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development\n* Growth  ([[Series A round]]): Early sales and manufacturing funds. This is typically where VCs come in. Series A can be thought of as the first institutional round. Subsequent investment rounds are called Series B, Series C and so on. This is where most companies will have the most growth.\n* Second-Round: [[Working capital]] for early stage companies that are selling product, but not yet turning a profit. This can also be called Series B round and so on.\n* Expansion: Also called [[Mezzanine capital|Mezzanine financing]], this is expansion money for a newly profitable company\n* Exit of venture capitalist: VCs can exit through secondary sale or an IPO or an acquisition. Early stage VCs may exit in later rounds when new investors (VCs or Private Equity investors) buy the shares of existing investors. Sometimes a company very close to an IPO may allow some VCs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the IPO.\n* Bridge Financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full VC rounds. The objective is to raise smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate.\n\nBetween the first round and the fourth round, venture-backed companies may also seek to take [[venture debt]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://bootlaw.com/2010/06/14/up-up-and-away-should-you-be-thinking-about-venture-debt/ |title = Bootlaw&nbsp;\u2013 Essential law for startups and emerging tech businesses&nbsp;\u2013 Up, Up and Away.

A venture capital fund refers to a [[Investment fund|pooled investment]] vehicle (in the United States, often an [[Limited partnership|LP]] or [[Limited liability company|LLC]]) that primarily invests the [[financial capital]] of third-party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard [[capital market]]s or [[loan|bank loans]]. These funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm, which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds (scientists, researchers), business training and/or deep industry experience.\n\nA core skill within VC is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage. By definition, VCs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage, thus adding skills as well as capital, thereby differentiating VC from buy-out private equity, which typically invest in companies with proven revenue, and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns. Inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of one's investment in a given startup company. As a consequence, most venture capital investments are done in a pool format, where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies. By investing in the pool format, the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm.\n[[File:Venture Capital Fund Diagram.png|500px|thumb|right|Diagram of the structure of a generic venture capital fund]]\n\n===Structure===\nVenture capital firms are typically structured as [[partnerships]], the [[general partners]] of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised. Venture capital firms in the United States may also be structured as [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]], in which case the firm's managers are known as managing members.  Investors in venture capital funds are known as [[limited partner]]s. This constituency comprises both high-net-worth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital, such as state and private [[pension fund]]s, university [[financial endowment]]s, foundations, [[insurance]] companies, and [[Collective investment scheme|pooled investment]] vehicles, called [[Fund of funds|funds of funds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280083626|title=The interplay of track record and trustworthiness in venture capital fundraising|author=Andreas Kuckertz|date=December 1, 2015|work=ResearchGate|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927114350/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/280083626_The_interplay_of_track_record_and_trustworthiness_in_venture_capital_fundraising|archivedate=September 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Types===\nVenture capitalist firms differ in their motivations<ref>R\u00f6hm, P., K\u00f6hn, A., Kuckertz, A. and Dehnen, H.

Journal of Business Economics. [[doi:10.1007/s11573-017-0857-5]]</ref> and approaches. There are multiple factors, and each firm is different.\n\nVenture capital funds are generally three in types:\n1. Angel investors \n2. Financial VCs \n3. Strategic VCs\n\nSome of the factors that influence VC decisions include:\n* Business situation: Some VCs tend to invest in new, disruptive ideas, or fledgling companies. Others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow.\n* Some invest solely in certain industries.\n* Some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally.\n* VC expectations can often vary. Some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth. The amount of help a VC provides can vary from one firm to the next.\n\n===Roles===\nWithin the venture capital industry, the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as \"venture capitalists\" or \"VCs\".  Typical career backgrounds vary, but, broadly speaking, venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background.  Venture capitalists with an operational background ([[operating partner]]) tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants.  Venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have [[investment banking]] or other [[corporate finance]] experience.\n\nAlthough the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm, other positions at venture capital firms include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Role\n|-\n|General Partners or GPs\n|They run the Venture Capital firm and make the investment decisions on behalf of the fund. GPs typically put in personal capital up to 1-2% of the VC Fund size to show their commitment to the LPs.\n|-\n|Venture partners\n|Venture partners are expected to source potential investment opportunities (\"bring in deals\") and typically are compensated only for those deals with which they are involved.\n|-\n|Principal\n|This is a mid-level investment professional position, and often considered a \"partner-track\" position.  Principals will have been promoted from a senior associate position or who have commensurate experience in another field, such as [[investment banking]], [[management consulting]], or a market of particular interest to the strategy of the venture capital firm.\n|-\n|Associate\n|This is typically the most junior apprentice position within a venture capital firm.  After a few successful years, an associate may move up to the \"senior associate\" position and potentially principal and beyond.  Associates will often have worked for 1\u20132 years in another field, such as [[investment banking]] or [[management consulting]].\n|-\n|Entrepreneur-in-residence\n|Entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs) are experts in a particular industry sector (e.g., biotechnology or social media) and perform [[due diligence]] on potential deals. EIRs are hired by venture capital firms temporarily (six to 18 months) and are expected to develop and pitch startup ideas to their host firm, although neither party is bound to work with each other. Some EIRs move on to executive positions within a portfolio company.\n|}\n\n===Structure of the funds===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nMost [[private equity fund|venture capital funds]] have a fixed life of 10 years, with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity.  The investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years, after which the focus is managing and making follow-on investments in an existing portfolio.  This model was pioneered by successful funds in [[Silicon Valley]] through the 1980s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance, and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product.\n\nIn such a fund, the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently \"called down\" by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments. There are substantial penalties for a limited partner (or investor) that fails to participate in a [[capital call]].\n\nIt can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund. At the time when all of the money has been raised, the fund is said to be closed, and the 10-year lifetime begins.  Some funds have partial closes when one half (or some other amount) of the fund has been raised. The [[vintage year]] generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify VC funds for comparison.\n\nFrom investors' point of view, funds can be: (1) [[private equity fund|traditional]]\u2014where all the investors invest with equal terms; or (2) [[asymmetric fund|asymmetric]]\u2014where different investors have different terms. Typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where there's an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors.\n\n===Compensation===\n{{Main|Carried interest}}\nVenture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and [[carried interest]] (often referred to as a \"two and 20\" arrangement):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Payment\n!Implementation\n|-\n|Management fees\n|an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations.<ref name=calpersdictionary>[http://www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=/investments/assets/equities/aim/pe-glossary.xml Private equity industry dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505124540/http://www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=%2Finvestments%2Fassets%2Fequities%2Faim%2Fpe-glossary.xml |date=May 5, 2008 }}. [[CalPERS]] Alternative Investment Program</ref>  In a typical venture capital fund, the general partners receive an annual management fee equal to up to 2% of the committed capital.\n|-\n|Carried interest\n|a share of the profits of the fund (typically 20%), paid to the private equity fund's management company as a performance incentive.  The remaining 80% of the profits are paid to the fund's investors<ref name=\"calpersdictionary\"/>  Strong limited partner interest in top-tier venture firms has led to a general trend toward terms more favorable to the venture partnership, and certain groups are able to command carried interest of 25\u201330% on their funds.\n|}\n\nBecause a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life, larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time; doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged.  Smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts; by the time the fund cashes out, an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending, whom the general partners may not know well, and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know.\n\n===Alternatives===\nBecause of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments, many entrepreneurs seek [[seed funding]] from [[angel investors]], who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities, or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur. Additionally, entrepreneurs may seek alternative financing, such as [[revenue-based financing]], to avoid giving up equity ownership in the business.\n\nFurthermore, many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a [[start-up company]] otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology and/or market potential for its product or services. To achieve this, or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven, many start-ups seek to self-finance [[sweat equity]] until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or [[angel investors]]. This practice is called \"[[bootstrapping (business)|bootstrapping]]\".\n\n[[Equity crowdfunding]] is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital. Traditional [[crowdfunding]] is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations. While such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity, it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs, now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost. Some [[equity crowdfunding]] models are also being applied specifically for startup funding, such as those listed at [[Comparison of crowd funding services]]. One of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional VC model. The traditional VCs are shifting their focus to later-stage investments, and [[return on investment]] of many VC funds have been low or negative.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web |url = https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/grow-vc-launches-aiming-to-become-the-kiva-for-tech-startups/ |title = Grow VC launches, aiming to become the Kiva for tech startups |publisher = Eu.techcrunch.com |date = February 15, 2010 |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120530064252/http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/grow-vc-launches-aiming-to-become-the-kiva-for-tech-startups/ |archivedate = May 30, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn Europe and India, [[Media for equity]] is a partial alternative to venture capital funding. Media for equity investors are able to supply start-ups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity. In Europe, an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment; their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding, mergers and acquisition, or other exit strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sollertis-strategy.com/index.html|title=Sollertis Strategy - Adventure Capitalist and Consulting Organisation|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229162850/http://www.sollertis-strategy.com/index.html|archivedate=December 29, 2014|df=mdy-all|access-date=December 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn industries where assets can be [[Securitization|securitized]] effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of [[foreclosure]], businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth. Good examples would include asset-intensive extractive industries such as mining, or manufacturing industries. Offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts, which seek to use securitization in structuring hybrid multi-market transactions via an SPV ([[special purpose vehicle]]): a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing.\n\nIn addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks, groups have emerged, which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://growvc.com |title = Grow Venture Community |publisher = Growvc.com |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209014634/http://www.growvc.com/ |archivedate = February 9, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLaw firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it.<ref>{{cite web |last = Austin |first = Scott |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703453804575479650072184066 |title = \"Law Firms Offer Discounts, Play Matchmaker,\" The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 9, 2010 |publisher = Online.wsj.com |date = September 9, 2010 |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150115040929/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703453804575479650072184066 |archivedate = January 15, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOther forms include [[venture resources]] that seek to provide non-monetary support to launch a new venture.\n\n==Societal impact==\n\nVenture capital is also associated with job creation (accounting for 2% of US GDP),<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nvca.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=255&Itemid=103 |title = Venture Impact: The Economic Importance of Venture-Backed Companies to the U.S. Economy |publisher = National Venture Capital Association |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140630170428/http://www.nvca.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=255&Itemid=103 |archivedate = June 30, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> the [[knowledge economy]], and used as a proxy measure of [[innovation]] within an economic sector or geography.

In terms of deals by sector, fintech remains the most active industry with 17% of the deals made, followed by e-commerce at 12%, and delivery and transport at 8%.\n\nThe report also notes that a total of 130 institutions invested in MENA-based startups in H1 2019, 30% of which were headquartered outside the MENA, demonstrating international appetite for investments in the region. 15 startup exits have been recorded in H1 2019, with [[Careem]]\u2019s $3.1 billion acquisition by [[Uber]] being the first unicorn exit in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/business/banking/careem-proves-unicorns-grow-in-deserts-too-1.62947464|title=Careem proves unicorns grow in deserts too|website=gulfnews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> Other notable exits include Souq.com exit to [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] in 2017 for $650 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/amazon-to-acquire-souq-a-middle-east-clone-once-valued-at-1b-for-650m/|title=Amazon to acquire Souq, a Middle East clone once valued at $1B, for $650M|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref>\n\n===Sub-Saharan Africa===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nThe Southern African venture capital industry is developing. The South African Government and Revenue Service is following the international trend of using tax-efficient vehicles to propel economic growth and job creation through venture capital. Section 12 J of the ''Income Tax Act'' was updated to include venture capital. Companies are allowed to use a tax-efficient structure similar to VCTs in the UK.  Despite the above structure, the government needs to adjust its regulation around [[intellectual property]], exchange control and other legislation to ensure that Venture capital succeeds.\n\nCurrently, there are not many venture capital funds in operation and it is a small community; however, the number of venture funds are steadily increasing with new incentives slowly coming in from government. Funds are difficult to come by and due to the limited funding, companies are more likely to receive funding if they can demonstrate initial sales or traction and the potential for significant growth.  The majority of the venture capital in Sub-Saharan Africa is centered on South Africa and Kenya.\n\n==Confidential information==\nUnlike [[public company|public companies]], information regarding an entrepreneur's business is typically confidential and proprietary.  As part of the [[due diligence]] process, most venture capitalists will require significant detail with respect to a company's business plan.  Entrepreneurs must remain vigilant about sharing information with venture capitalists that are investors in their competitors.  Most venture capitalists treat information confidentially, but as a matter of business practice, they do not typically enter into [[Non Disclosure Agreement]]s because of the potential liability issues those agreements entail.  Entrepreneurs are typically well advised to protect truly proprietary intellectual property.\n\n[[Limited partners]] of venture capital firms typically have access only to limited amounts of information with respect to the individual portfolio companies in which they are invested and are typically bound by confidentiality provisions in the fund's [[limited partnership|limited partnership agreement]].\n\n==Governmental regulations==\nThere are several strict guidelines regulating those that deal in venture capital.  Namely, they are not allowed to advertise or solicit business in any form as per the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] guidelines.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/general-solicitation-small-entity-compliance-guide.htm |title = Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation and General Advertising in Rule 506 and Rule 144A Offerings |publisher = [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |accessdate = August 20, 2014 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140925115247/http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/general-solicitation-small-entity-compliance-guide.htm |archivedate = September 25, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===In books===\n* [[Mark Coggins]]' novel ''Vulture Capital'' (2002) features a venture capitalist protagonist who investigates the disappearance of the chief scientist in a biotech firm in which he has invested.
