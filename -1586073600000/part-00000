In [[Northern Europe]] these dials generally used the 12-hour [[numbering scheme]] in [[Roman numerals]], but showed both ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' periods in sequence. This is known as the double-XII system, and can be seen on many surviving clock faces, such as those at [[Wells Cathedral clock|Wells]] and [[Exeter Cathedral#Clock|Exeter]].\n\nElsewhere in Europe, numbering was more likely to be based on the 24-hour system (I to XXIV). The 12-hour clock was used throughout the British empire.\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, the 12-hour analog dial and time system gradually became established as standard throughout Northern Europe for general public use. The 24-hour analog dial was reserved for more specialized applications, such as [[astronomical clock]]s and chronometers.\n\nMost analog clocks and watches today use the 12-hour dial, on which the shorter hour hand rotates once every 12 hours and twice in one day. Some analog clock dials have an inner ring of numbers along with the standard 1-to-12 numbered ring.  The number 12 is paired either with a 00 or a 24, while the numbers 1 through 11 are paired with the numbers 13 through 23, respectively. This modification allows the clock to also be read in [[24-hour notation]]. This kind of 12-hour clock can be found in countries where the 24-hour clock is preferred.\n\n===Use by country===\n{{Main|Date and time representation by country}}\n[[File:Westclox Big Ben.jpg|thumb|right|Typical [[Clock#Analog clocks|analogue 12-hour clock]]]]\nIn several countries the 12-hour clock is the dominant written and spoken system of time, predominantly in nations that were part of the former British Empire, for example, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] (excluding [[Date and time notation in Canada#Time notation in French|Quebec]]), [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Malaysia]], [[Malta]] and others follow this convention as well such as [[Egypt]], [[Mexico]] and the former American colony of the [[Philippines]]. In most countries, however, the [[24-hour clock]] is the standard system used, especially in writing. Some nations in Europe and Latin America use a combination of the two, preferring the 12-hour system in colloquial speech but using the 24-hour system in written form and in formal contexts.\n\nThe 12-hour clock in speech often uses phrases such as '' ... in the morning, ... in the afternoon, ... in the evening,'' and ''...at night''. ''Rider's British Merlin'' almanac for 1795 and a similar almanac for 1773 published in London used them.<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4881611 National Library of Australia catalogue entry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522172644/http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4881611 |date=22 May 2013 }} for ''Rider's British merlin: for the year of Our Lord God 1795''</ref> Other than English-speaking countries, the terms ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' are seldom used and often unknown.\n\n===Computer support===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. Most operating systems, including [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], activate the 12-hour notation by default for a limited number of language and region settings. This behavior can be changed by the user, such as with the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system \"Region and Language\" settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/customize-how-time-is-displayed-in-windows/|title=How to customize how the time is displayed in Windows|author=Lawrence Abrams|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=26 October 2013|publisher=Bleeping Computer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029183705/http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/customize-how-time-is-displayed-in-windows/|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Abbreviations==\n\n[[File:Digital-clock-alarm.jpg|thumb|Typical [[digital clock|digital]] 12-hour alarm clock indicating ''p.m.'' with a dot to the left of the hour]]The [[Latin]] abbreviations ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' (often written \"am\" and \"pm\", \"AM\" and \"PM\", or \"A.M.\" and \"P.M.\") are used in [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref>Diccionario panhisp\u00e1nico de dudas, [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=hora2 HORA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024649/http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=hora2 |date=20 July 2011 }} {{in lang|es}}</ref> The equivalents in [[Greek language|Greek]] are {{lang|el|\u03c0.\u03bc.}} and {{lang|el|\u03bc.\u03bc.}}, respectively, and in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dd9.\u0dc0.}} ({{transl|si|''pe.va.''}}) for {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dd4}} ({{transl|si|''peravaru''}}, {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb}} {{transl|si|''pera''}} \u2013 fore, pre) and {{lang|si|\u0db4.\u0dc0.}} ({{transl|si|''pa.va.''}}) for {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dd4}} ({{transl|si|''pasvaru''}}, {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dda}} {{transl|si|''pass\u0113''}} \u2013 after, post). However, noon is rarely abbreviated in any of these languages, noon normally being written in full. In Portuguese, there are two official options and many other used, for example, using 21:45: 21h45 or 21h45min (official ones) or 21:45 or 9:45&nbsp;p.m. In [[Irish language|Irish]], ''a.m.'' and ''i.n.'' are used, standing for ''ar maidin'' (\"in the morning\") and ''iarn\u00f3in'' (\"afternoon\") respectively.\n\nMost other languages lack formal abbreviations for \"before noon\" and \"after noon\", and their users use the 12-hour clock only orally and informally.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} However, in many languages, such as Russian and Hebrew, informal designations are used, such as \"9 in the morning\" or \"3 in the night\".\n\nWhen abbreviations and phrases are omitted, one may rely on sentence context and societal norms to reduce ambiguity. For example, if one commutes to work at \"9:00\", 9:00&nbsp;a.m. may be implied, but if a [[social dance]] is scheduled to begin at \"9:00\", it may begin at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Related conventions==\n\n===Typography===\nThe terms \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\" are abbreviations of the Latin ''ante meridiem'' (before midday) and ''post meridiem'' (after midday). Depending on the [[style guide]] referenced, the abbreviations \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\" are variously written in [[small capital]]s (\"{{smallcaps|am}}\" and \"{{smallcaps|pm}}\"), [[uppercase]] letters without a [[Period (punctuation)|period]] (\"AM\" and \"PM\"), uppercase letters with [[Periods.|periods]], or [[lowercase]] letters (\"am\" and \"pm\" or, more commonly, \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\").\n\nSome stylebooks suggest the use of a space between the number and the a.m. or p.m. abbreviation.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Style guides recommend not using a.m. and p.m. without a time preceding it,<ref>Hacker, Diana, A Writer's Reference, six edition, Bedford, St Martin's, Boston, 2007, section M4-c, p.308.</ref> although doing so can be advantageous when describing an event that always happens before or after noon.\n\nThe hour/minute separator [[Date and time representation by country|varies between countries]]: some use a colon, others use a [[period (punctuation)|period]] (full stop), and still others use the letter h. In many instances using the 24-hour clock, there is no separator between hours and minutes (0800, read as written, i.e. \"oh-eight-hundred\").{{who|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Encoding====\nIn Unicode, there exist symbols for:\n: \"a.m.\" {{unichar\n| 33C2\n| <!-- Unicode name -->\n| ulink =\n| image =\n| size  = 150%\n| html  =\n}} and\n: \"p.m.\" {{unichar\n| 33D8\n| <!-- Unicode name -->\n| ulink =\n| image =\n| size  = 150%\n| html  = }}.\n\nThey are meant to be used only with [[CJK characters|Chinese-Japanese-Korean]] character sets, as they take up exactly the same space as one CJK character.\n\n===Informal speech and rounding off===\nIn speaking, it is common to round the time to the nearest five minutes and/or express the time as the past (or to) the closest hour; for example, \"five past five\" (5:05). Minutes ''past'' the hour means those minutes are added to the hour; \"ten past five\" means 5:10. Minutes ''to, 'til'' and ''of'' the hour mean those minutes are subtracted; \"ten of five\", \"ten 'til five\", and \"ten to five\" all mean 4:50.\n\nFifteen minutes is often called a ''quarter hour'', and thirty minutes is a ''half hour''. For example, 5:15 can be phrased \"(a) quarter past five\" or \"five-fifteen\"; 5:30 can be \"half past five\", \"five-thirty\" or simply \"half five\". The time 8:45 may be spoken as \"eight forty-five\" or \"(a) quarter to nine\".<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary,'' 3rd ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1992). s.v. usage note at end of \"quarter\" entry.</ref>\n\nInstead of meaning 5:30, the \"half five\" expression is sometimes used to mean 4:30, or \"half-way to five\", especially for regions such as the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] and other areas that have been particularly [[German America|influenced by German culture]]. This meaning follows the pattern choices of many Germanic and [[Slavic languages]], including [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], as well as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\nMoreover, in situations where the relevant hour is obvious or has been recently mentioned, a speaker might omit the hour and just say \"quarter to (the hour)\", \"half past\" or \"ten 'til\" to avoid an elaborate sentence in informal conversations. These forms are often commonly used in television and radio broadcasts that cover multiple time zones at one-hour intervals.<ref>{{Cite magazine|magazine=TVTimes|date=21\u201327 May 1983|url=http://forums.doyouremember.co.uk/threads/8061-TVTimes-magazine-21-27-May-1983-part1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018072904/http://forums.doyouremember.co.uk/threads/8061-TVTimes-magazine-21-27-May-1983-part1|archive-date=18 October 2012|url-status=live |title=TVTimes magazine 21-27 May 1983 part1 |accessdate=8 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn describing a vague time of day, a speaker might say the phrase \"seven-thirty, eight\" to mean sometime around 7:30 or 8:00. Such phrasing can be misinterpreted for a specific time of day (here 7:38), especially by a listener not expecting an estimation. The phrase \"''about'' seven-thirty ''or'' eight\" clarifies this.\n\nSome more ambiguous phrasing might be avoided. Within five minutes of the hour, the phrase \"five of seven\" (6:55) can be heard \"five-oh-seven\" (5:07). \"Five ''to'' seven\" or even \"six fifty-five\" clarifies this.\n\n===Formal speech and times to the minute===\n{{redirect|O'clock|the o'clock watch|O bag}}\nMinutes may be expressed as an exact number of minutes past the hour specifying the time of day (e.g., 6:32&nbsp;p.m. is \"six thirty-two\"). Additionally, when expressing the time using the \"past (after)\" or \"to (before)\" formula, it is conventional to choose the number of minutes below 30 (e.g., 6:32&nbsp;p.m. is conventionally \"twenty-eight minutes to seven\" rather than \"thirty-two minutes past six\").\n\nIn spoken English, full hours are often represented by the numbered hour followed by ''o'clock'' (10:00 as ''ten o'clock'', 2:00 as ''two o'clock''). This may be followed by the \"a.m.\" or \"p.m.\" designator, though phrases such as ''in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening,'' or ''at night'' more commonly follow analog-style terms such as ''o'clock, half past three,'' and ''quarter to four.

This eventually evolved into the two 12-hour periods which are used today, starting at midnight (a.m.) and noon (p.m.).

In [[Northern Europe]] these dials generally used the 12-hour [[numbering scheme]] in [[Roman numerals]], but showed both ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' periods in sequence. This is known as the double-XII system, and can be seen on many surviving clock faces, such as those at [[Wells Cathedral clock|Wells]] and [[Exeter Cathedral#Clock|Exeter]].\n\nElsewhere in Europe, numbering was more likely to be based on the 24-hour system (I to XXIV). The 12-hour clock was used throughout the British empire.\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, the 12-hour analog dial and time system gradually became established as standard throughout Northern Europe for general public use. The 24-hour analog dial was reserved for more specialized applications, such as [[astronomical clock]]s and chronometers.\n\nMost analog clocks and watches today use the 12-hour dial, on which the shorter hour hand rotates once every 12 hours and twice in one day. Some analog clock dials have an inner ring of numbers along with the standard 1-to-12 numbered ring.  The number 12 is paired either with a 00 or a 24, while the numbers 1 through 11 are paired with the numbers 13 through 23, respectively. This modification allows the clock to also be read in [[24-hour notation]]. This kind of 12-hour clock can be found in countries where the 24-hour clock is preferred.\n\n===Use by country===\n{{Main|Date and time representation by country}}\n[[File:Westclox Big Ben.jpg|thumb|right|Typical [[Clock#Analog clocks|analogue 12-hour clock]]]]\nIn several countries the 12-hour clock is the dominant written and spoken system of time, predominantly in nations that were part of the former British Empire, for example, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] (excluding [[Date and time notation in Canada#Time notation in French|Quebec]]), [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Malaysia]], [[Malta]] and others follow this convention as well such as [[Egypt]], [[Mexico]] and the former American colony of the [[Philippines]]. In most countries, however, the [[24-hour clock]] is the standard system used, especially in writing. Some nations in Europe and Latin America use a combination of the two, preferring the 12-hour system in colloquial speech but using the 24-hour system in written form and in formal contexts.\n\nThe 12-hour clock in speech often uses phrases such as '' ... in the morning, ... in the afternoon, ... in the evening,'' and ''...at night''. ''Rider's British Merlin'' almanac for 1795 and a similar almanac for 1773 published in London used them.<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4881611 National Library of Australia catalogue entry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522172644/http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4881611 |date=22 May 2013 }} for ''Rider's British merlin: for the year of Our Lord God 1795''</ref> Other than English-speaking countries, the terms ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' are seldom used and often unknown.\n\n===Computer support===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. Most operating systems, including [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], activate the 12-hour notation by default for a limited number of language and region settings. This behavior can be changed by the user, such as with the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system \"Region and Language\" settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/customize-how-time-is-displayed-in-windows/|title=How to customize how the time is displayed in Windows|author=Lawrence Abrams|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=26 October 2013|publisher=Bleeping Computer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029183705/http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/customize-how-time-is-displayed-in-windows/|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Abbreviations==\n\n[[File:Digital-clock-alarm.jpg|thumb|Typical [[digital clock|digital]] 12-hour alarm clock indicating ''p.m.'' with a dot to the left of the hour]]The [[Latin]] abbreviations ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' (often written \"am\" and \"pm\", \"AM\" and \"PM\", or \"A.M.\" and \"P.M.\") are used in [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref>Diccionario panhisp\u00e1nico de dudas, [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=hora2 HORA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024649/http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=hora2 |date=20 July 2011 }} {{in lang|es}}</ref> The equivalents in [[Greek language|Greek]] are {{lang|el|\u03c0.\u03bc.}} and {{lang|el|\u03bc.\u03bc.}}, respectively, and in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dd9.\u0dc0.}} ({{transl|si|''pe.va.''}}) for {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dd4}} ({{transl|si|''peravaru''}}, {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb}} {{transl|si|''pera''}} \u2013 fore, pre) and {{lang|si|\u0db4.\u0dc0.}} ({{transl|si|''pa.va.''}}) for {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dd4}} ({{transl|si|''pasvaru''}}, {{lang|si|\u0db4\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dda}} {{transl|si|''pass\u0113''}} \u2013 after, post). However, noon is rarely abbreviated in any of these languages, noon normally being written in full. In Portuguese, there are two official options and many other used, for example, using 21:45: 21h45 or 21h45min (official ones) or 21:45 or 9:45&nbsp;p.m. In [[Irish language|Irish]], ''a.m.'' and ''i.n.'' are used, standing for ''ar maidin'' (\"in the morning\") and ''iarn\u00f3in'' (\"afternoon\") respectively.\n\nMost other languages lack formal abbreviations for \"before noon\" and \"after noon\", and their users use the 12-hour clock only orally and informally.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} However, in many languages, such as Russian and Hebrew, informal designations are used, such as \"9 in the morning\" or \"3 in the night\".\n\nWhen abbreviations and phrases are omitted, one may rely on sentence context and societal norms to reduce ambiguity. For example, if one commutes to work at \"9:00\", 9:00&nbsp;a.m. may be implied, but if a [[social dance]] is scheduled to begin at \"9:00\", it may begin at 9:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Related conventions==\n\n===Typography===\nThe terms \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\" are abbreviations of the Latin ''ante meridiem'' (before midday) and ''post meridiem'' (after midday).

In many instances using the 24-hour clock, there is no separator between hours and minutes (0800, read as written, i.e. \"oh-eight-hundred\").{{who|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Encoding====\nIn Unicode, there exist symbols for:\n: \"a.m.\" {{unichar\n| 33C2\n| <!-- Unicode name -->\n| ulink =\n| image =\n| size  = 150%\n| html  =\n}} and\n: \"p.m.\" {{unichar\n| 33D8\n| <!-- Unicode name -->\n| ulink =\n| image =\n| size  = 150%\n| html  = }}.\n\nThey are meant to be used only with [[CJK characters|Chinese-Japanese-Korean]] character sets, as they take up exactly the same space as one CJK character.\n\n===Informal speech and rounding off===\nIn speaking, it is common to round the time to the nearest five minutes and/or express the time as the past (or to) the closest hour; for example, \"five past five\" (5:05). Minutes ''past'' the hour means those minutes are added to the hour; \"ten past five\" means 5:10. Minutes ''to, 'til'' and ''of'' the hour mean those minutes are subtracted; \"ten of five\", \"ten 'til five\", and \"ten to five\" all mean 4:50.\n\nFifteen minutes is often called a ''quarter hour'', and thirty minutes is a ''half hour''. For example, 5:15 can be phrased \"(a) quarter past five\" or \"five-fifteen\"; 5:30 can be \"half past five\", \"five-thirty\" or simply \"half five\". The time 8:45 may be spoken as \"eight forty-five\" or \"(a) quarter to nine\".<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary,'' 3rd ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1992). s.v. usage note at end of \"quarter\" entry.</ref>\n\nInstead of meaning 5:30, the \"half five\" expression is sometimes used to mean 4:30, or \"half-way to five\", especially for regions such as the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] and other areas that have been particularly [[German America|influenced by German culture]]. This meaning follows the pattern choices of many Germanic and [[Slavic languages]], including [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], as well as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\nMoreover, in situations where the relevant hour is obvious or has been recently mentioned, a speaker might omit the hour and just say \"quarter to (the hour)\", \"half past\" or \"ten 'til\" to avoid an elaborate sentence in informal conversations. These forms are often commonly used in television and radio broadcasts that cover multiple time zones at one-hour intervals.<ref>{{Cite magazine|magazine=TVTimes|date=21\u201327 May 1983|url=http://forums.doyouremember.co.uk/threads/8061-TVTimes-magazine-21-27-May-1983-part1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018072904/http://forums.doyouremember.co.uk/threads/8061-TVTimes-magazine-21-27-May-1983-part1|archive-date=18 October 2012|url-status=live |title=TVTimes magazine 21-27 May 1983 part1 |accessdate=8 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn describing a vague time of day, a speaker might say the phrase \"seven-thirty, eight\" to mean sometime around 7:30 or 8:00. Such phrasing can be misinterpreted for a specific time of day (here 7:38), especially by a listener not expecting an estimation. The phrase \"''about'' seven-thirty ''or'' eight\" clarifies this.\n\nSome more ambiguous phrasing might be avoided. Within five minutes of the hour, the phrase \"five of seven\" (6:55) can be heard \"five-oh-seven\" (5:07). \"Five ''to'' seven\" or even \"six fifty-five\" clarifies this.\n\n===Formal speech and times to the minute===\n{{redirect|O'clock|the o'clock watch|O bag}}\nMinutes may be expressed as an exact number of minutes past the hour specifying the time of day (e.g., 6:32&nbsp;p.m. is \"six thirty-two\"). Additionally, when expressing the time using the \"past (after)\" or \"to (before)\" formula, it is conventional to choose the number of minutes below 30 (e.g., 6:32&nbsp;p.m. is conventionally \"twenty-eight minutes to seven\" rather than \"thirty-two minutes past six\").\n\nIn spoken English, full hours are often represented by the numbered hour followed by ''o'clock'' (10:00 as ''ten o'clock'', 2:00 as ''two o'clock''). This may be followed by the \"a.m.\" or \"p.m.\" designator, though phrases such as ''in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening,'' or ''at night'' more commonly follow analog-style terms such as ''o'clock, half past three,'' and ''quarter to four. O'clock'' itself may be omitted, telling a time as ''four a.m.'' or ''four p.m.'' Minutes \":01\" to \":09\" are usually pronounced as ''oh one'' to ''oh nine'' (''nought'' or ''zero'' can also be used instead of ''oh''). Minutes \":10\" to \":59\" are pronounced as their usual number-words. For instance, 6:02&nbsp;a.m. can be pronounced ''six oh two a.m.'' whereas 6:32&nbsp;a.m. could be told as ''six thirty-two a.m.''\n\n==Confusion at noon and midnight==\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 95%; width: 35em\"\n|+ Time according to various conventions\n|-\n!Device or [[style guide|style]]||[[Midnight]]<br /><small>Start of day</small>||[[Noon]]||Midnight<br /><small>End of day</small>\n|-\n|Written 24-hour time,<br /> [[ISO 8601]]||00:00||12:00||24:00\n|-\n| Digital watches || 12:00&nbsp;AM || 12:00&nbsp;PM || \n|-\n|[[United States Government Publishing Office|U.S. Government Publishing Office (1953)]]<ref name=\"GPO1953\">{{cite web |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-GP-6eda8715b8f5cb1d8514325b97334d4f/pdf/GOVPUB-GP-6eda8715b8f5cb1d8514325b97334d4f.pdf |pages=152, 267 |title=United States Government Printing Office Style Manual |date=January 1953 |website=govinfo |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office |access-date=5 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905161607/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-GP-6eda8715b8f5cb1d8514325b97334d4f/pdf/GOVPUB-GP-6eda8715b8f5cb1d8514325b97334d4f.pdf |archive-date=5 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>||midnight{{efn|name=startend|These styles are ambiguous with respect to whether midnight is at the start or end of each day.}}||noon<br />12&nbsp;o'clock&nbsp;noon<br />12&nbsp;m.||midnight<br />12:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|-\n|U.S. Government Publishing Office (2000)<ref name=\"GPO2000\">{{cite web |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2000/pdf/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2000.pdf |title=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual |at=page 156 |website=govinfo |date=2000 |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office |access-date=5 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905160112/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2000/pdf/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2000.pdf |archive-date=5 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>||&nbsp;<br />midnight{{efn|name=startend}}||12&nbsp;a.m.<br />noon||12&nbsp;p.m.<br />midnight{{efn|name=startend}}\n|-\n|U.S. Government Publishing Office (2008)<ref name=\"GPO2008\">{{cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/pdf/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008.pdf|title=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual|page=271|website=govinfo|date=2008|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|access-date=5 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412235057/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/pdf/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008.pdf|archive-date=12 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>||12&nbsp;a.m.<br />12&nbsp;midnight{{efn|name=startend}}||12&nbsp;p.m.<br />12&nbsp;noon||&nbsp;<br />12&nbsp;midnight{{efn|name=startend}}\n|-\n|Japanese legal convention{{dubious|date=November 2015}}<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u5348\u524d\uff11\uff12\u6642\uff1f \u5348\u5f8c\uff10\u6642\uff1f |trans-title=12 AM? or 0 PM? |url=http://jjy.nict.go.jp/QandA/FAQ/12am-or-0pm-J.html |date=15 February 1989 |website=[[National Institute of Information and Communications Technology]] |language=Japanese |access-date=24 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606032129/http://jjy.nict.go.jp/QandA/FAQ/12am-or-0pm-J.html |archive-date=6 June 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>||0:00&nbsp;a.m.||12:00&nbsp;a.m.||12:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|-\n|Chicago Manual of Style<ref name=\"chicago\">{{cite book|title = Chicago Manual of Style | at = paragraph 9.38 | edition = 17th | date = 2017 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | quote = Although noon can be expressed as 12:00 m.

The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]] to cement Chiang's legitimacy.

Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\n\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth.

Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"{{lang|zh-hans|\u8d21\u7f0e}}\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court.

A number of huge [[department stores]] such as [[Zhongyang Shangchang]] sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing.

In the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the city was the official [[imperial examination]] center ([[Jiangnan Examination Hall]]) for the [[Jiangnan]] region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\n\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Pekinguniversitykunqu4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kunqu]]]]\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the [[Qianxian Dance Company]], [[Nanjing Dance Company]], [[Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute]] and [[Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company]] among others.\n\n[[Jiangsu Province Kun Opera]] is one of the best theaters for [[Kunqu]], China's oldest stage art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.com.cn/chinese/zhuanti/153379.htm=|title=A brief introduction to Jiangsu Province Kunqu Theater}}</ref>\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe.

However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked [[Yuan Shikai]] to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of [[Puyi]], the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\n\nIn 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the [[Nanking decade]]. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]] to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of [[Zhejiang]] and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n[[File:Crossing river by Gate of China01.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese soldiers entering the walled city of Nanjing through the [[Gate of China, Nanjing|Gate of China]]]]\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital.

Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing.<ref>{{lang|zh-hant|\u6e05\u4e7e\u9686\u3001\u5609\u6176\u5e74\u9593\uff0c\u6c5f\u5be7\u7e54\u6a5f\u5728\u56db\u842c\u53f0\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6e05\u5149\u7dd2\u5341\u4e8c\u5e74\u4e8c\u6708\u5341\u516d\u65e5\u300a\u7533\u5831\u300b\uff1a\"\uff08\u5357\u4eac\uff09\u57ce\u5ec2\u5167\u5916\u7dde\u6a5f\u7e3d\u6578\u5e38\u4e94\u842c\u6709\u5947\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u70ba\u751f\u7522\u8005\u9054\u4e8c\u5341\u842c\u4eba\u3002\"}}</ref> Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526}}) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as [[dragon robe]]s. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"{{lang|zh-hans|\u8d21\u7f0e}}\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02}}, the market sells [[wangjin]]), Guyilang ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4f30\u8863\u5eca}}, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6cb9\u574a\u6865}}, the bridge near an oil mill).\n\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing.

However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n===Modern times===\n[[File:Nanjing Xinjiekou Skyline.jpg|thumb|left|[[Xinjiekou, Nanjing]]]]\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge [[department stores]] such as [[Zhongyang Shangchang]] sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the [[service industry]], .\n\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned [[heavy industry|heavy industries]], as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=\u7efc\u8ff0|chapterurl=http://njdfz.nje.cn/UpLoadFile/html/%E5%B8%82%E5%BF%975-7/html/5Noname002.html |script-title=zh:\u5357\u4eac\u5e02\u5fd7\uff08\u7b2c5\u5377\uff09\u00b7\u5de5\u4e1a}}</ref> Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the [[Reform and Opening]] recovering market economy, the [[state-owned enterprises]] found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or [[privatization]] and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Zifeng Tower 2017.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Nanjing Zifeng Tower]] and the [[Purple Mountain (Nanjing)|Purple Mountain]] in the background]]\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past.

The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600&nbsp;meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580&nbsp;meters spanning the river itself.

In the past, the name connoted the area stretching from the fifth milestone junction of Upper Serangoon Road and Upper Paya Lebar Road/Boundary Road to the seventh and a half milestone junction of Upper Serangoon Road and Punggol Road.  The area just beyond the seventh milestone along Punggol Road was formerly considered part of Punggol but is now within Hougang Town and that section of Punggol Road is now Hougang Avenue 8, with Punggol Road starting further north.<ref>{{cite web|title=OneMap, see Historical Maps from 1970s or earlier |url=http://hm.onemap.sg/}}</ref>\n\nPig farming was carried out in Punggol, including the area of Punggol that is now part of Hougang Town. The last of these pig farmers were relocated by the late-1990s to flats built in Hougang.  Today, Hougang is an HDB [[new town]] with over 40,000 housing units interspersed with pockets of private residential areas.\n\nThere was also a fishing port at the end of Upper Serangoon Road beyond the seventh milestone.\n\nAt Hougang Street 21, there was a [[water well|well]] that is still identified as the ''tua jia kha'' (\u5927\u4e95\u811a) well structure. This well identified the Teochew village of ''tua jia kha'' which means the \"foot of a big well\". In the past, the village was a popular place for food, street [[wayang]]s, itinerant Chinese [[medicine men]] and story tellers spinning yarns.\n\nHougang has been developed since 1977 with the construction of Tampines Way. Further development has been made for the development of new neighbourhoods in Neighbourhood 1 - 3 by 1983, Neighbourhood 4 - 7 by 1992. Neighbourhood 8 is the city centre of the Hougang, completed in 1994. Neighbourhood 9 has been in the recent and has been completed by 2000.\n\nIn 2015, project named Hougang Capeview, a Build-To-Order project at Upper Serangoon Road, is the first public housing project to receive the CONQUAS Star, an accolade administered by the Building and Construction Authority. Hougang Capeview, which comprises 781 residential units in six blocks at Upper Serangoon Road, received a Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) score of more than 95, above the national average of 88.2. The CONQUAS score is BCA\u2019s measure of construction quality across Singapore.<ref>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hougang-bto-development/2134928.html</ref>\n\n==Shopping==\n\nHougang has 8 shopping malls which are\n\n* [[Hougang Mall]], a five-storey shopping mall with an NTUC FairPrice outlet, Singtel outlet, Starhub outlet, and Popular bookstore.

Most of its commercial activity is centred on a few [[shopping mall]]s such as [[Hougang Mall]], Kang Kar Mall, [[Heartland Mall]], Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre and [[Hougang1]].\n\nSimilar to most other residential towns in [[Singapore]], Hougang was designed to be a partially [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]] with enough amenities to minimize the number of residents commuting to the Central Area. Facilities include Hougang Sports Hall, an indoor sports complex operated by Sport Singapore which runs ClubFITT membership and sports programmes, Hougang [[stadium]] home to [[S.League]] club [[Hougang United FC|Hougang United]], an aquatics centre, a number of parks such as Punggol Park, along with many [[wet market]]s and [[hawker centre]]s.\n\nOne of the more prominent landmarks in Hougang is the Buangkok Green Medical Park, which houses several medical facilities including the [[Institute of Mental Health (Singapore)|Institute of Mental Health]] (IMH) and Singapore Leprosy Relief Association (SILRA).\n\nThe Hougang Central Bus Interchange serves Hougang Town with a range of bus services going to other parts of the island.

Currently, Aljunied and Hougang wards were managed by the opposition [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]] (WP), while Ang Mo Kio and Marine Parade were managed by the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP). Previously, Hougang were administered by five now-defunct wards ([[Jalan Kayu Single Member Constituency|Jalan Kayu]], [[Paya Lebar Single Member Constituency|Paya Lebar]], [[Punggol Single Member Constituency|Punggol]], [[Serangoon Gardens Single Member Constituency|Serangoon Gardens]] and [[Upper Serangoon Single Member Constituency|Upper Serangoon]]), before it redistricted into GRCs, notably [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency|Cheng San GRC]] (also defunct since [[2001 Singaporean general election|2001]]).\n\nThe area covering Hougang Avenues 2, 5, 7 and a small portion of Hougang Central, falls under the namesake Hougang SMC, where it was carved out from Punggol ward ahead of the [[1988 Singaporean general election|1988 elections]]. The first Member Of Parliament (MP) of the ward was PAP's Tang Guan Seng, until it had been captured by former WP secretary-general [[Low Thia Khiang]] in [[1991 Singaporean general election|1991]].

The GRC was not contested in 2001 with the WP being disqualified due to incomplete applications, but in the 2006 elections, the WP were able to pose a strong challenge for this ward, with the members consist of WP's chairwoman [[Sylvia Lim]] and former members [[Goh Meng Seng]] (now the secretary-general of [[People's Power Party (Singapore)|People's Power Party]]) and [[James Gomez]]<ref>[[Aljunied Group Representation Constituency]]</ref>/\n\nThe north-western portions of Hougang (Avenues 4, 8 and 9, and Street 91), which includes [[Hougang Stadium]] and Regentville Condo, falls under the Ang Mo Kio-Hougang division of the Ang Mo Kio GRC. Its MP is [[Darryl David]], who replaces former MP [[Yeo Guat Kwang]] after the 2015 elections. Prior to the 2011 elections, the ward was a part of Aljunied GRC (under the name of Aljunied-Hougang), where Yeo was then the MP.\n\nThe northern portions of Hougang (north of Avenues 6, 8 and Street 51) falls under the Sengkang South division, also part of the Ang Mo Kio GRC, where [[Gan Thiam Poh]] was the MP.

Facilities include Hougang Sports Hall, an indoor sports complex operated by Sport Singapore which runs ClubFITT membership and sports programmes, Hougang [[stadium]] home to [[S.League]] club [[Hougang United FC|Hougang United]], an aquatics centre, a number of parks such as Punggol Park, along with many [[wet market]]s and [[hawker centre]]s.\n\nOne of the more prominent landmarks in Hougang is the Buangkok Green Medical Park, which houses several medical facilities including the [[Institute of Mental Health (Singapore)|Institute of Mental Health]] (IMH) and Singapore Leprosy Relief Association (SILRA).\n\nThe Hougang Central Bus Interchange serves Hougang Town with a range of bus services going to other parts of the island. It is located in Hougang Central, near Hougang Mall and it has an underground link to [[Hougang MRT station]]. This bus interchange was officially opened on 17 February 1995 by former cabinet minister Goh Chee Wee, who was then Senior Minister of State for Communications, Trade and Industry to serve all buses around the Hougang Area. Its sister bus interchange, [[Hougang South Bus Interchange]] (that is near to [[Kovan MRT station]]) ceased operations in 2004 and was converted to Kovan Hub.\n\nTwo even older bus terminals operated in Hougang before the construction of the Hougang Central and Hougang South Bus Interchanges. One was at the end of Upper Serangoon Road in Kangkar Village, which was replaced by Hougang Central, while the other was at the sixth and a half milestone of Upper Serangoon Road, which was replaced by Hougang South.<ref>[[List of former bus stations in Singapore]]</ref>\n\n==Highlights==\n[[File:Singapore Hougang 2002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Houses in Hougang]]\nA distinctive feature of Hougang lies in the large semi-circular balconies which occur in many [[Housing and Development Board]] [[public housing]] flats in the area. This feature is not as prevalent in public housing outside Hougang. The latest addition of new Condominium will be [https://www.florence-residence.com/ Florence Residences] in 2019.\n\n==Politics==\nThe political representation of Hougang was split into four different constituencies as of the [[2015 Singaporean general election|2015 elections]], three of which were [[Group Representation Constituencies]] (GRC) ([[Aljunied Group Representation Constituency|Aljunied]], [[Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency|Ang Mo Kio]], and [[Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency|Marine Parade]]), and one Single Member Constituency (SMC) bearing the same name, the [[Hougang Single Member Constituency]]. Currently, Aljunied and Hougang wards were managed by the opposition [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]] (WP), while Ang Mo Kio and Marine Parade were managed by the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP). Previously, Hougang were administered by five now-defunct wards ([[Jalan Kayu Single Member Constituency|Jalan Kayu]], [[Paya Lebar Single Member Constituency|Paya Lebar]], [[Punggol Single Member Constituency|Punggol]], [[Serangoon Gardens Single Member Constituency|Serangoon Gardens]] and [[Upper Serangoon Single Member Constituency|Upper Serangoon]]), before it redistricted into GRCs, notably [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency|Cheng San GRC]] (also defunct since [[2001 Singaporean general election|2001]]).\n\nThe area covering Hougang Avenues 2, 5, 7 and a small portion of Hougang Central, falls under the namesake Hougang SMC, where it was carved out from Punggol ward ahead of the [[1988 Singaporean general election|1988 elections]]. The first Member Of Parliament (MP) of the ward was PAP's Tang Guan Seng, until it had been captured by former WP secretary-general [[Low Thia Khiang]] in [[1991 Singaporean general election|1991]]. Low left the ward to contest (and later elect himself in) Aljunied GRC ahead of the [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011 elections]], and was replaced by [[Yaw Shin Leong]], another WP candidate who previously contested [[Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency|Ang Mo Kio GRC]] in the [[2006 Singaporean general election|2006 elections]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1127421/1/.html | title=E: WP takes Hougang, PAP wins 11 SMCs | publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]] | accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref> Yaw remained as an MP until his expulsion from the party's CEC and resigned his seat in February 2012 over an extramarital affair. [[Png Eng Huat]], a candidate whose part of the WP team contested [[East Coast Group Representation Constituency|East Coast GRC]] in the 2011 elections, had since represented this ward after winning his [[2012 Hougang by-election|by-election]] on May 2012.\n\nThe area covering south of Hougang Avenues 6, 8, 10, as well as [[Punggol Park]], [[Defu Industrial Park]] and the subregion of [[Kovan, Singapore|Kovan]], falls under both Paya Lebar and [[Bedok Reservoir]]-Punggol divisions of Aljunied GRC. The GRC was previously managed by the PAP which members include [[Cynthia Phua]] and former [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Foreign Minister]] [[George Yeo]], until it was taken over by WP's [[Chen Show Mao]] and Low Thia Khiang, respectively, in the 2011 elections, with the takeover marked the first time an opposition party had been elected in a GRC since it was established in 1988. The GRC was not contested in 2001 with the WP being disqualified due to incomplete applications, but in the 2006 elections, the WP were able to pose a strong challenge for this ward, with the members consist of WP's chairwoman [[Sylvia Lim]] and former members [[Goh Meng Seng]] (now the secretary-general of [[People's Power Party (Singapore)|People's Power Party]]) and [[James Gomez]]<ref>[[Aljunied Group Representation Constituency]]</ref>/\n\nThe north-western portions of Hougang (Avenues 4, 8 and 9, and Street 91), which includes [[Hougang Stadium]] and Regentville Condo, falls under the Ang Mo Kio-Hougang division of the Ang Mo Kio GRC. Its MP is [[Darryl David]], who replaces former MP [[Yeo Guat Kwang]] after the 2015 elections. Prior to the 2011 elections, the ward was a part of Aljunied GRC (under the name of Aljunied-Hougang), where Yeo was then the MP.\n\nThe northern portions of Hougang (north of Avenues 6, 8 and Street 51) falls under the Sengkang South division, also part of the Ang Mo Kio GRC, where [[Gan Thiam Poh]] was the MP. It was previously belong to [[Pasir Ris-Punggol Group Representation Constituency|Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC]] (under the name of Punggol South) until it was carved out in 2015.\n\nThe western portions of Hougang, previously being Serangoon Gardens division, were belong to the Jalan Kayu (Ang Mo Kio) and Serangoon (Aljunied) divisions, which were represented by [[Intan Azura Mokhtar]] and Sylvia Lim, respectively. The area was previously belong to the short-lived [[Thomson Group Representation Constituency|Thomson GRC]] in 1991.\n\nThe southernmost portion of Hougang, Tai Seng, was under the Geylang Serai division of the Marine Parade GRC, where [[Fatimah Lateef]] represented the ward. Marine Parade was also contested by WP during the 2015 elections.\n\n==Schools==\nThe area has a total of eight secondary schools, nine primary schools and [[Serangoon Junior College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sis.moe.gov.sg/|title=School Information Service (SIS)|website=sis.moe.gov.sg}}</ref> Serangoon Junior College was closed in 2019 and merged with [[Anderson Junior College]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/anderson-serangoon-jcs-among-8-junior-colleges-to-merge/3690100.html|title=Anderson, Serangoon JCs among 8 junior colleges to merge|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US}}</ref>\n[[File:Hougang Sports Hall .jpg|thumb]]\n\n{{commons|Singapore#Hougang}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[https://www.florence-residence.com/ The Florence Residences]\n\n==Sources==\n*Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2003), ''Toponymics - A Study of Singapore Street Names'', Eastern Universities Press, {{ISBN|981-210-205-1}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hougang MRT station]]\n\n{{Places in Singapore}}\n\n[[Category:Places in Singapore]]\n[[Category:North-East Region, Singapore]]\n[[Category:Hougang| ]]\n", "name_user": "Deoma12", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hougang"}

A [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Private Act of Parliament]] allowed it to use public money to buy {{convert|226|acre}} of [[marsh]]y grazing land on the western edge of Birkenhead. Plots of land on the edge of the proposed park were then sold off in order to finance its construction.

Several miles of drainage pipes were laid to remove the water from the marshy land. During construction, hundreds of tonnes of stone and earth were moved to create well-drained terraces, hills, rockeries and lakes. It also led to the diversion of Old Bidston Road and the loss of a direct route between [[Claughton, Merseyside|Claughton]] and [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]].\nPaxton planted trees and shrubs at various places so visitors would enjoy the surprise of unexpected views or hidden features as they wandered through the park.

The family of a local trade unionist and \"conchie\", George Beardsworth, watched as he was repeatedly beaten and thrown over an obstacle course in the park.

Birkenhead park was influential on the design of public parks both in the UK and internationally and it is considered a landmark in the history of public parks.<ref name=\"historicengland.org.uk\"/>\n\nIn 1850, American landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] arrived by ship in [[Liverpool]]. During his stay in Northwest England, he paid a visit to Birkenhead Park along with several other public gardens. He noted Birkenhead was \"a model town\" which was built \"all in accordance with the advanced science, taste, and enterprising spirit that are supposed to distinguish the nineteenth century\".<ref>{{harvnb|Olmsted|1852|p=83}}</ref>\nIn 1858, he and [[Calvert Vaux]] won the competition to design a new park, [[Central Park]], for the rapidly growing city of [[New York City|New York]].\n \nOlmsted, who was influenced by the park, was greatly impressed by Paxton's designs. In his book ''Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England'', he wrote about its social value as an aesthetic form:\n<blockquote>\nfive minutes of admiration, and a few more spent studying the manner in which art had been employed to obtain from nature so much beauty, and I was ready to admit that in democratic America there was nothing to be thought of as comparable with this People\u2019s Garden.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\">{{harvnb|Olmsted|1852|p=79}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOlmsted also commented on the \"perfection\" of the park's gardening:\n<blockquote>\nI cannot undertake to describe the effect of so much taste and skill as had evidently been employed; I will only tell you, that we passed by winding paths, over acres and acres, with a constant varying surface, where on all sides were growing every variety of shrubs and flowers, with more than natural grace, all set in borders of greenest, closest turf, and all kept with consummate neatness.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nBirkenhead Park was used as a template for the creation of [[Sefton Park]], which opened in Liverpool in 1872.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:Birkenhead Park cricket pavilion 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The gabled cricket pavilion]]\n[[File:Jackson monument, Birkenhead Park front.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Jackson Memorial drinking fountain]]\nThe [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]] is at the northeast entrance to Birkenhead Park.

The park influenced the design of [[Central Park]] in New York and [[Sefton Park]] in Liverpool.\n \nThe park contains many listed buildings. The [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]] was designed by [[Lewis Hornblower]] and is at the northeast corner; it consists of three arches flanked by lodges and is in [[Ionic order|Ionic]] style. The Swiss Bridge, a pedestrian span of stringer construction, is unique as being the only [[covered bridge]] of traditional wooden construction in the United Kingdom. There is also a [[Pavilion]] called the Roman Boathouse standing by the lake in the park, the upper storey of which was originally intended to be a bandstand. There are a large number of historic listed lodges of various designs within the grounds of the park.\n\nThe park has a modern visitor centre, caf\u00e9, children's play area, woodland walks and various sporting facilities and clubs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roman pavilion, Birkenhead Park 2019-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman Pavilion and Boathouse]]\n[[File:Swiss Bridge, Birkenhead Park 2019-1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Swiss Bridge over the lake.]]\nIn 1841 an [[Improvement commissioners|Improvement Commission]] within Birkenhead's local government proposed the idea of a municipal park. A [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Private Act of Parliament]] allowed it to use public money to buy {{convert|226|acre}} of [[marsh]]y grazing land on the western edge of Birkenhead. Plots of land on the edge of the proposed park were then sold off in order to finance its construction. The park plan was designed by [[Joseph Paxton]] and the building was supervised by [[Edward Kemp (landscape architect)|Edward Kemp]] because both had previously worked on redesigning the gardens at [[Chatsworth House]].<ref name=\"trees\"/> Entrances, gateways, lodges, and other structures were designed for the park by [[Lewis Hornblower]] and John Robertson.{{sfnp|Hartwell|Hyde|Hubbard|Pevsner|2011|pp=144\u2013146|ps=}}  Meanwhile, high-class residential accommodation was being built both around the park and in other areas, such as Clifton Park, the layout and buildings designed by Walter Scott and [[Charles Reed (architect)|Charles Reed]].{{sfnp|Hartwell|Hyde|Hubbard|Pevsner|2011|pp=159\u2013151|ps=}}  Although some large houses and private villas were initially built by local merchants and wealthier business people, the [[Long Depression]] in the latter 19th century meant many plots remained undeveloped well into early 20th century.<ref name=\"trees\">{{cite book|title=Trees in Towns and Cities: A History of British Urban Arboriculture|first=Mark|last= Johnston|publisher=Windgather Press|year= 2015|ISBN= 9781909686656|page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tgJDCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA154&dq=economic%20long%20depression%20birkenhead%20park&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q=economic%20conditions&f=false 154]}}</ref>\n\nThe park took five years to build and was officially opened on 5 April 1847<ref name=\"historicengland.org.uk\">{{Cite web |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1000994 |title=BIRKENHEAD PARK, Non Civil Parish - 1000994 |website=Historic England |access-date=2020-04-02 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> by [[Lord Morpeth]], an estimated 10,000 people attended on that day.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolparks.org/red/docs/parks/birkenhead_park/index.html |title=Birkenhead Park |website=Liverpool Parks |access-date=2020-04-02 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The park had an informal style rather than a structured neatly arranged urban garden. Several miles of drainage pipes were laid to remove the water from the marshy land. During construction, hundreds of tonnes of stone and earth were moved to create well-drained terraces, hills, rockeries and lakes. It also led to the diversion of Old Bidston Road and the loss of a direct route between [[Claughton, Merseyside|Claughton]] and [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]].\nPaxton planted trees and shrubs at various places so visitors would enjoy the surprise of unexpected views or hidden features as they wandered through the park. Buildings included the Swiss Bridge, Boathouse, Norman Lodges, Gothic Lodge, Castellated Lodge and Italian Lodge. The [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]], which is one of several into the park, was built to look like a classical [[triumphal arch]]. \n[[File:Eisteddfod stone, Birkenhead Park (1).JPG|thumb|250px|[[National Eisteddfod of Wales|Eisteddfod stone]] within the Park.]]\nDuring the [[First World War]], part of the park was used as a training ground by the 3rd Battalion of the [[Cheshire Regiment]]. Recruits stayed at the Birkenhead Barracks on Grange Road West. [[Conscientious objectors]] were sent to the 3rd Cheshires because the battalion had a tough reputation. The family of a local trade unionist and \"conchie\", George Beardsworth, watched as he was repeatedly beaten and thrown over an obstacle course in the park. Although his treatment at Birkenhead led to questions in Parliament and a court case against the officers and men involved, no one was ever censured or prosecuted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Karyn|last= Burnham|title=The Courage of Cowards: The untold Stories of the First World War Conscientious Objectors|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2014|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vWJtBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA87&ots=Z4KPHFNJ7p&dq=George%20Beardsworth%20mp&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=true 86\u201389]|isbn=9781781592953}}</ref> In 1917 the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] (\"[[Hedd Wyn|The Eisteddfod of the Black Chair]]\"), which was attended by Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], was held within the park.

Birkenhead park was influential on the design of public parks both in the UK and internationally and it is considered a landmark in the history of public parks.<ref name=\"historicengland.org.uk\"/>\n\nIn 1850, American landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] arrived by ship in [[Liverpool]]. During his stay in Northwest England, he paid a visit to Birkenhead Park along with several other public gardens. He noted Birkenhead was \"a model town\" which was built \"all in accordance with the advanced science, taste, and enterprising spirit that are supposed to distinguish the nineteenth century\".<ref>{{harvnb|Olmsted|1852|p=83}}</ref>\nIn 1858, he and [[Calvert Vaux]] won the competition to design a new park, [[Central Park]], for the rapidly growing city of [[New York City|New York]].\n \nOlmsted, who was influenced by the park, was greatly impressed by Paxton's designs. In his book ''Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England'', he wrote about its social value as an aesthetic form:\n<blockquote>\nfive minutes of admiration, and a few more spent studying the manner in which art had been employed to obtain from nature so much beauty, and I was ready to admit that in democratic America there was nothing to be thought of as comparable with this People\u2019s Garden.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\">{{harvnb|Olmsted|1852|p=79}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOlmsted also commented on the \"perfection\" of the park's gardening:\n<blockquote>\nI cannot undertake to describe the effect of so much taste and skill as had evidently been employed; I will only tell you, that we passed by winding paths, over acres and acres, with a constant varying surface, where on all sides were growing every variety of shrubs and flowers, with more than natural grace, all set in borders of greenest, closest turf, and all kept with consummate neatness.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nBirkenhead Park was used as a template for the creation of [[Sefton Park]], which opened in Liverpool in 1872.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:Birkenhead Park cricket pavilion 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The gabled cricket pavilion]]\n[[File:Jackson monument, Birkenhead Park front.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Jackson Memorial drinking fountain]]\nThe [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]] is at the northeast entrance to Birkenhead Park.

It was released on November 16, 2004, by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Sony Urban Music]]. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]] as well as several new producers.\n\nFor the album's theme, the members drew inspiration from the conversations they had during the first week of recording when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and [[ballad]]s that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among [[music journalism|music critics]] who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.\n\nAs part of the album's promotion, the group performed songs from it on numerous award ceremonies and televised appearances in the US and Europe. They further embarked on the tour [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It]] in 2005 with 67 dates across four continents worldwide. ''Destiny Fulfilled'' spawned four singles\u2014the [[lead single]] \"[[Lose My Breath]]\", \"[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]\", \"[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]\" and \"[[Cater 2 U]]\". After the tour, the group disbanded.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = People ask why. We're friends. We enjoy each other. We sound good together. We grew up together and hopefully we can set an example for other groups, and other female groups especially, that you can support each other and not be insecure and be happy for one another. And it's OK to do solo projects and to grow up and get a life. But it's also OK to come back together... It doesn't always have to be what the media tries to make it out to be.

This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fourth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.<ref name=\"MossReunited\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/destinys_child/news_feature/041108/index3.jhtml |title=Destiny\u2019s Child: Reunited And It Fells So Good |last=Moss |first=Corey |publisher=[[MTV News]].

The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to \u2013 not because it's a good business move.\"<ref name=\"Benson\"/>\n\n== Production and recording ==\nProduction of the album began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from frequent collaborators including [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]]. The group worked on the album within a period of three weeks.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> Jerkins, who had worked with Beyonc\u00e9 for her solo album ''Dangerously in Love'', concerned how he would manage the production, saying, \"How is this going to work?' Cause Beyonc\u00e9, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?\".<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's \"excitement being back in the studio together\", calling the process \"natural\".<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/>\n\nDiffering from ''Survivor'' in that previously Beyonc\u00e9 had taken an active role in writing and producing, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in ''Destiny Fulfilled'', their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyonc\u00e9, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads\u2014which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyonc\u00e9 elaborated \"We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.\"<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: \"All of us have been in three different places&nbsp;... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.\"<ref name=\"MossShut\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1489338/destinys-child-back-in-the-studio-so-shut-up-kelly-rowland-says/|title=Destiny's Child Back In The Studio, So 'Shut Up!'

She concluded, \"[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be.\"<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> For the music of the album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by [[The Emotions]], [[Jodeci]] and [[SWV]] mixing elements of their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1493304/beyonce-salutes-jay-z-on-destinys-child-track-soldier/|title=Beyonce Salutes Jay-Z On Destiny\u2019s Child Track 'Soldier'|publisher=MTV News.

It was released on November 16, 2004, by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Sony Urban Music]]. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]] as well as several new producers.\n\nFor the album's theme, the members drew inspiration from the conversations they had during the first week of recording when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and [[ballad]]s that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among [[music journalism|music critics]] who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.\n\nAs part of the album's promotion, the group performed songs from it on numerous award ceremonies and televised appearances in the US and Europe. They further embarked on the tour [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It]] in 2005 with 67 dates across four continents worldwide. ''Destiny Fulfilled'' spawned four singles\u2014the [[lead single]] \"[[Lose My Breath]]\", \"[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]\", \"[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]\" and \"[[Cater 2 U]]\". After the tour, the group disbanded.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = People ask why. We're friends. We enjoy each other. We sound good together. We grew up together and hopefully we can set an example for other groups, and other female groups especially, that you can support each other and not be insecure and be happy for one another. And it's OK to do solo projects and to grow up and get a life. But it's also OK to come back together... It doesn't always have to be what the media tries to make it out to be. Women can get along and be businesswomen and be smart and not be catty all the time.\"\n |align  = left\n |width  = 25%\n |source =\u2014Beyonc\u00e9<ref name=\"MossReunited\" />\n}}\n\nWhile recording their third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' in late 2000, [[Beyonc\u00e9]] announced that Destiny's Child would eventually go on a hiatus that would allow each member to release a solo album, which they hoped would further increase interest in the group.<ref>{{cite news|last=VanHorn|first=Teri|title=Destiny's Child Solo CDs Won't Compete With Group, Each Other|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1375037/destinys-child-solo-cds-wont-compete-with-group-each-other/|publisher=MTV News.

This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fourth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.<ref name=\"MossReunited\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/destinys_child/news_feature/041108/index3.jhtml |title=Destiny\u2019s Child: Reunited And It Fells So Good |last=Moss |first=Corey |publisher=[[MTV News]].

The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to \u2013 not because it's a good business move.\"<ref name=\"Benson\"/>\n\n== Production and recording ==\nProduction of the album began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from frequent collaborators including [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]]. The group worked on the album within a period of three weeks.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> Jerkins, who had worked with Beyonc\u00e9 for her solo album ''Dangerously in Love'', concerned how he would manage the production, saying, \"How is this going to work?' Cause Beyonc\u00e9, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?\".<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's \"excitement being back in the studio together\", calling the process \"natural\".<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/>\n\nDiffering from ''Survivor'' in that previously Beyonc\u00e9 had taken an active role in writing and producing, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in ''Destiny Fulfilled'', their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists.<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyonc\u00e9, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads\u2014which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyonc\u00e9 elaborated \"We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.\"<ref name=\"MossReunited\" /> As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: \"All of us have been in three different places&nbsp;... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.\"<ref name=\"MossShut\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1489338/destinys-child-back-in-the-studio-so-shut-up-kelly-rowland-says/|title=Destiny's Child Back In The Studio, So 'Shut Up!'

MTV Networks|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\nDuring an interview with [[MTV]], Beyonc\u00e9 stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, \"[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be.\"<ref name=\"VineyardSplit\"/> For the music of the album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by [[The Emotions]], [[Jodeci]] and [[SWV]] mixing elements of their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1493304/beyonce-salutes-jay-z-on-destinys-child-track-soldier/|title=Beyonce Salutes Jay-Z On Destiny\u2019s Child Track 'Soldier'|publisher=MTV News.
