The bubble was characterized by rapid acceleration of asset prices and [[overheating (economics)|overheated economic]] activity, as well as an uncontrolled [[money supply]] and [[credit expansion]].<ref name=\"okina\">Kunio Okina, Masaaki Shirakawa, and Shigenori Shiratsuka (February 2001):The Asset Price Bubble and Monetary Policy: Japan's Experience in the Late 1980s and the Lessons</ref> More specifically, over-confidence and  [[speculation]] regarding asset and stock prices were closely associated with excessive [[monetary policy|monetary easing policy]] at the time.<ref name=\"edgardo\">Edgardo Demaestri, Pietro Masci (2003): Financial Crises in Japan and Latin America, Inter-American Development Bank</ref>\n\nBy August 1990, the [[Nikkei 225|Nikkei stock index]] had plummeted to half its peak by the time of the fifth monetary tightening by the [[Bank of Japan]] (BOJ).<ref name=\"okina\"/> By late 1991, asset prices began to fall. Even though asset prices had visibly collapsed by early 1992,<ref name=\"okina\"/> the economy's decline continued for more than a decade. This decline resulted in a huge accumulation of [[Non-performing loan|non-performing assets loans]] (NPL), causing difficulties for many financial institutions. The bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble contributed to what many call the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]].<ref>http://fhayashi.fc2web.com/Prescott1/Postscript_2003/hayashi-prescott.pdf</ref>  Japan's annual land prices averaged nationwide have finally risen since the asset bubble collapse, though only mildly at 0.1%, a process that has taken 26 years to show up statistically.<ref>http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0004745149</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nEarly research has found that the rapid increase in Japanese asset prices was largely due to the delayed action by the BOJ to address the issue. At the end of August 1987, the BOJ signaled the possibility of tightening the monetary policy, but decided to delay the decision in view of economic uncertainty related to [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday (October 19, 1987)]] in the US.<ref name=\"jousei\">Research and Statistics Department,  Bank of Japan, April 1987b, Jousei Handan Shiryo: 62-nen Haru (Quarterly Economic Outlook: Spring 1987),\" Chousa Geppo (Monthly Bulletin)(in Japanese)</ref>\n\nMore recent research supports an alternate view, that BOJ reluctance to tighten the monetary policy was in spite of the fact that the economy went into expansion in the second half of 1987.   The Japanese economy had just recovered from the {{nihongo|endaka [[recession]]|\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u5186\u9ad8\u4e0d\u6cc1| Nihon no endakafuky\u014d| lit. \"recession caused by appreciation of Japanese Yen\"}}, which occurred from 1985 to 1986.<ref name=\"jousei\"/> The endaka recession has been closely linked to the [[Plaza Accord]] of September 1985, which led to the strong appreciation of the [[Japanese yen]].<ref name=\"mieno\">Mieno, Yasushi, (2000) Ri wo Mite Gi wo Omou (Recall Faith to See What Makes a Profit), Chuo Koronsha,(in Japanese)</ref>   The term [[Endaka|''endaka fuky\u014d'']] would in the future be used repeatedly to describe the many times the yen surged and the economy went into recession, posing a conundrum for business and government, trade partners, and anti-monetary interventionists.\n\nThe strong appreciation of the yen eroded the Japanese economy, since the economy was led by exports and [[capital investment]] for export purpose. In fact, in order to overcome the endaka recession and stimulate the local economy, an aggressive [[fiscal policy]] was adopted, mainly through expansion of public investment.<ref name=\"okina\"/> Simultaneously, the BOJ declared that curbing the yen's appreciation was a national priority.<ref name=\"mieno\"/><ref name=\"ohta\">Ohta, Takeshi (1991)Kokusai Kin'yu\u2014Genba Kara no Shougen (International Finance\u2014Witness Concerned),Chuko Shinsho (in Japanese)</ref> To prevent the yen from appreciating further, monetary policy makers pursued aggressive monetary easing and slashed the official discount rate to as low as 2.5% by February 1987.<ref name=\"okina\"/>\n\nThe move initially failed to curb further appreciation of the yen, which rose from 200.05 \u00a5/U$ (first round monetary easing) to 128.25 \u00a5/U$ (end of 1987). The course only reversed by the spring of 1988, when the US dollar began to strengthen against the yen. Some researchers have pointed out that \"with exception of the first discount rate cut, the subsequent four are heavily influenced by the US: [the] second and the third cut was a joint announcement to cut the discount rate while the fourth and fifth was due to [a] joint statement [of] either Japan-US or the [[G7|G-7]]\".<ref name=\"okina\"/><ref name=\"ohta\"/> It has been suggested that the US exerted influence to increase the strength of the yen, which would help with the ongoing attempts to reduce the US-Japan [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficit.<ref name=\"okina\"/> Almost all [[discount window|discount rate]] cuts announced by the BOJ explicitly expressed the need to stabilize the foreign exchange rate, rather than to stabilize the domestic economy.<ref name=\"ohta\"/>\n\nLater, BOJ hinted at the possibility of tightening the policy due to inflationary pressures within the domestic economy. Despite leaving the official discount rate unchanged during the summer of 1987, the BOJ expressed concern over excessive [[monetary easing]], particularly after the money supply and asset prices rose sharply.<ref name=\"ohta\"/> Nonetheless, [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] in the US triggered a delay for the BOJ to switch to a monetary tightening policy. The BOJ officially increased the discount rate on March 31, 1989.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/>\n\nThe table below demonstrates the monthly average of the [[U.S. dollar]]/[[Yen]] spot rate (Yen per USD) at 17:00 JST.<ref name=\"boj\">Bank of Japan: [http://www.stat-search.boj.or.jp/ssi/mtshtml/m_en.html US.Dollar/Yen Spot Rate at 17:00 in JST, Average in the Month, Tokyo Market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603050319/http://www.stat-search.boj.or.jp/ssi/mtshtml/m_en.html |date=2013-06-03 }} for duration January 1980 ~ September 2010.

These six major cities experienced far greater asset price inflation compared to other urban land nationwide. By 1991, commercial land prices rose 302.9% compared to 1985, while residential land and industrial land price jumped 180.5% and 162.0%, respectively, compared to 1985.<ref name=\"jrei\"/> Nationwide, statistics showed that commercial land, residential land, and industrial land prices were up by 80.9%, 51.1%, and 51.7%, respectively.<ref name=\"jrei\"/>\n\nBy the early 1980s, Tokyo was an important commercial city due to a high concentration of international [[financial centre|financial corporations and interests]]. The demand for office space continued to soar as more economic activities flooded Tokyo commercial districts, resulting in demand outstripping the supply.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/>  The government policies to solely concentrate its economic activities in Tokyo, and the lack of diversification of [[economic activities]] in other local cities, are also partly to blame for the bubble.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/>\n\nBy 1985, lands within Tokyo commercial districts were unable to fulfill the [[market demand]]. As a result, land prices in Tokyo commercial districts increased sharply within a year. The average price per 1 sq. metre for land in Tokyo commercial districts in 1984 was 1,333,000\u00a5 (U$5,600 assuming in 1984 that 1 U$=238\u00a5).<ref name=\"land\"/> In just a year, the average price per 1 sq. metre for land in Tokyo commercial districts increased to 1,894,000\u00a5 (U$7,958 assuming in 1985 average 1 U$=238\u00a5).<ref name=\"land\"/> This roughly translates to an increase of 42% over just a year. By 1986, the average price per 1 sq. metre for land in Tokyo commercial districts had risen as high as 4,211,000\u00a5 (U$25,065 assuming 1986 average 1 U$=168\u00a5), a jump of 122% compared to 1985. Residential land jumped from an average 297,000\u00a5/U$1,247 per 1 sq. metre (in 1985) to 431,000\u00a5/U$2,565 per 1 sq. metre (in 1986), an increase of 45%.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\nOsaka also experienced a rapid growth in land prices, especially in commercial districts. Land prices in Osaka gained 35% to a price of 1,159,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre (1986) from an average 855,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre (1985).<ref name=\"land\"/> Since Osaka uniquely had historical importance as a commercial center in Japan;<ref name=\"stat.go.jp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/2000/jutsu1/00/01.htm\n|title=Population Census: I Daytime Population |accessdate=2012-04-21 |date=2002-03-29\n|work=Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications}}</ref> hence, land prices in Osaka tend to be higher than most other urban land in Japan.\n\nBy 1987, virtually all land within the Tokyo metropolis was unable to cope with demand. At this point, residential land in Tokyo increased to 890,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre (U$6,180 based on the assumption 1U$ = 144\u00a5) and commercial land 6,493,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre (U$45,090).<ref name=\"land\"/> Consequently, investors flocked to prefectures surrounding the Tokyo metropolis, especially prefectures within the Greater Tokyo Area. Prefectures located in Southern Kanto were more favourable to investors compared to Northern Kanto. Hence, land in cities like Yokohama (Kanagawa prefecture), Saitama (Saitama prefecture), and Chiba (Chiba prefecture) tended to be more expensive than cities like [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]] ([[Ibaraki prefecture]]), [[Utsunomiya]] ([[Tochigi prefecture]]) and [[Maebashi]] ([[Gunma prefecture]]). For instance, in 1987, commercial land prices in Yokohama (average 1 sq. metre) were 1,279,000\u00a5, Saitama were 658,000\u00a5 and Chiba were 1,230,000\u00a5. On the other hand, commercial land prices in Mito (average 1 sq. metre) were 153,000\u00a5, Utsunomiya were 179,000\u00a5 and Maebashi were 135,000\u00a5 in 1986.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\nOsaka continued to enjoy an increase in land prices especially in the commercial area, as the prices increased to 2,025,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre in 1987.<ref name=\"land\"/> Kyoto (Kyoto prefecture) and Kobe (Hyogo prefecture) also enjoyed a sharp increase in land prices, especially in commercial areas which gained 31% and 23%, respectively.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/> The effect of the bubble in Osaka spread as far as Nagoya (Aichi prefecture) which saw the commercial land prices gain as much as 28% compared to 1986.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/>\n\nThe first sign of a possible bubble collapse appeared in 1988. By this time, non-prime land prices in Tokyo had reached their peak, though some areas in the Tokyo wards started to fall, albeit by a relatively small percentage.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/> Prime land in [[Ginza]] district and areas in Central Tokyo continued to rise.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/> Urban land in other cities at this point remained unaffected by the situation faced by the Tokyo metropolis. In Osaka, for instance, the commercial and residential land prices increased by 37% and 41% respectively.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/>\n\nBy 1989, land prices in commercial districts in Tokyo began to stagnate, while land prices in residential areas in Tokyo actually dipped 4.2% compared to 1988.<ref name=\"land\"/> Land prices in prime areas in Tokyo also peaked around this time; Ginza district was the most expensive, peaking at 30,000,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre<ref>{{cite book|last=Shapira|first=Phillip|title=Planning for Cities and Regions in Japan|publisher=Liberpool UP|location=Liverpool|pages=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWrHO8-maUYC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=ginza+1989+square+meter&source=bl&ots=tbd6LAuq3o&sig=YxYxWMVF8gqOORSvnM30J6tDloo&hl=en&ei=yybjTsDpBI-FsgLr6IGJBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=ginza%201989%20square%20meter&f=false}}</ref> (U$218,978 based on assumption 1U$ = 137\u00a5). Yokohama (Kanagawa prefecture) experienced a slowdown due to its location closer to Tokyo. Saitama (Saitama) and Chiba (Chiba) still chalked up healthy gain in land prices. All other urban cities in Japan had yet to see the impact of slowdown in Tokyo.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\nAt their peak, prices in central Tokyo were such that the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]] grounds were estimated to be worth more than all the land in the entire state of California.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yamamura |first=Kozo |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vpZNDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA106 |title=Too Much Stuff: Capitalism in Crisis |date=2018-03-21 |publisher=Policy Press |isbn=978-1-4473-3569-6 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and mid-1991, most urban land had already reached their peak. The lag effect from the fall of [[Nikkei 225]] pushed down the prices of urban land in most parts of Japan by the end of 1991.<ref name=okina/> The bubble collapse was officially declared in early 1992 \u2013 as land prices dropped the most in this period.<ref name=okina/> Tokyo experienced the worst from the catastrophe. Land prices in residential area on average 1 sq/metre slid 19% while commercial land prices declined 13% compared to 1991.<ref name=\"land\"/> Overall land prices in residential area and commercial districts in Tokyo fell to the lowest level since 1987.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\n=== Stock Prices ===\nIn the 1980s, the direction of stock prices in Japan was largely determined by the [[asset]] [[Market (economics)|market]], particularly land prices, in Japan.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/> Looking at the monthly performance of [[Nikkei 225]] in 1984, the index largely moved within 9900\u201311,600 range.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> As land prices in Tokyo began to rise in 1985, the stock market also moved higher. Indeed, the Nikkei 225 managed to rise past 13,000 by December 2, 1985.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/>\n\nThe major surge was obvious by 1986, as the Nikkei 225 gained close to 45% within a year.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> The trend continued throughout 1987, when it touched as high as 26,029 by early August <ref name=\"nikkei\"/> before being dragged down by the NYSE Black Monday. The strong rally throughout 1988 and 1989 helped the Nikkei 225 touch another new record high at 38,957.44 on December 29, 1989 before closing at 38,915.87.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> This translated to a gain of more than 224% since January 2, 1985.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> Some researchers concluded the unusual stock prices are likely due to the rise in land prices since the corporations' net assets increases, hence pushing the stock prices upward.<ref name=\"okina\"/><ref name=\"edgardo\"/> As long as the asset prices continued to strengthen, investors would more likely be attracted to [[speculate]] on stock prices.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, this also portrays the weaknesses of [[corporate governance]] in Japan.<ref name=\"mieno\"/>\n\nOn the downside, the tightening of monetary policy in 1989 seemed to affect stock prices. As lending costs increased drastically, coupled with a major slowdown in land prices in Tokyo, the stock market began to fall sharply in early 1990. The Nikkei 225 slid from an opening of 38,921 (January 4, 1990) to a yearly low of 21,902 (December 5, 1990),<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> which resulted in a loss of more than 43% within a year. Stock prices had officially collapsed by the end 1990. The downward trend continued through the early 1990s, as the Nikkei 225 opened as low as 14,338 on August 19, 1992.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/>\n\n=== Money supply and credit ===\nInitially, the growth of the [[money supply]] decelerated in 1986 (the lowest growth rate was 8.3 percent in October\u2013December 1986), which marked the end of the brief \"endaka recession\".<ref name=\"jousei\"/><ref name= \"boj2\">Research and Statistics Department, Bank of Japan(May 1989) \"Shouwa 63 Nendo no Kin'yu Oyobi Keizai no Doukou (Annual Review of Monetary and Economic Developments in Fiscal 1988),\"Chousa Geppo (Monthly Bulletin),(in Japanese)</ref> The trend was gradually reversed as it accelerated afterwards and exceeded 10 percent in April\u2013June 1987.<ref name= \"boj2\"/>\n\nThe growth of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] was more conspicuous than that of the money supply. During the bubble period, banks were increasing borrowing activity and at the same time, also financing from [[capital markets]] substantially increased against the backdrop of the progress of [[financial deregulation]] and the increase of stock prices.<ref name=\"okina\"/> As a result, the funding of the [[corporate]] and [[household]] sectors rapidly increased from around 1988 and recorded a rate of growth close to 14 percent on a year-on-year basis in 1989.<ref name= \"boj2\"/> Money supply continued to increase even after the BOJ tightened its monetary policy and reached a peak in 1990, thereafter continuing to mark still double-digit growth until the fourth quarter.<ref name= \"boj2\"/> Money supply and credit dropped sharply by 1991, as bank lending began to drop due to a shift in bank lending attitude.<ref name=\"okina\"/>\n\n== Causes ==\n\n=== The Plaza Accord ===\n\nThe [[Plaza Accord]] was signed between [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[West Germany]], and the [[United States]] in 1985, aimed at reducing the imbalance in trade between the countries. At that time, Japan had a huge trade surplus, as the Japanese yen was weaker against U.S. dollar, while the United States suffered from a consistent trade deficit. The reason behind the accord was partially complaints by the States regarding the imbalance in the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar, since most Japanese products imported in the States had higher quality and cheaper prices than the domestic products due to the weaker yen against the dollar.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://diamond.jp/articles/-/60815?page=2|title=\u30d7\u30e9\u30b6\u5408\u610f\u306e\u526f\u7523\u7269\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30c9\u30eb\u5b89\u304c\u751f\u3093\u3060\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u840c\u82bd|work=\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|access-date=2017-12-11|language=ja-JP}}</ref> After reaching a settlement in the Plaza Accord, central banks in participated countries started selling U.S. dollars. In Japan's case, demands for yen increased, and the yen appreciated significantly. In 1985, the exchange rate of yen per dollar was 238. After the foreign exchange intervention followed by Plaza Accord, the exchange rate dropped to 165 yen per dollar in 1986 as yen appreciated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?locations=JP|title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref> This impacted exports in Japan to the States significantly, almost halving them in 1992 from their peak in 1986, whereas the trade deficit in the United States shrank after the Plaza Accord and the deficit cleared out in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=JP|title=Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref> Due to the appreciation in the yen, Japanese companies suffered from huge losses in exports, as they had to sell their products in the States at higher prices than before to make a profit.\n\nAppreciation in the yen accelerated more than expected, because speculators purchased yen and sold US dollars. This further appreciation in the yen shook the economy in Japan, because the main source of economic growth in Japan was its export surplus. The [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth rate dropped from 6.3% in 1985 to 2.8% in 1986, and Japan experienced recession.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=JP|title=GDP growth (annual %) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref> To respond to this recession, the government shifted its focus on increasing demand within the country so that domestic products and services could be consumed in the country instead of exporting to overseas, which would increase domestic consumption as well.\n\nTo summarize the effect of the Plaza Accord in the long run, it did not succeed in equalizing the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States. Despite the fact that there was no major change in exchange rate of the yen and the US dollar, the export surplus in Japan began to rise and the trade deficit in the States started to rise again in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://diamond.jp/articles/-/60815|title=\u30d7\u30e9\u30b6\u5408\u610f\u306e\u526f\u7523\u7269\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30c9\u30eb\u5b89\u304c\u751f\u3093\u3060\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u840c\u82bd|work=\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|access-date=2017-12-11|language=ja-JP}}</ref> Overall, the Plaza Accord directly led to appreciation in the yen, and it incentivized lowering the [[discount window|discount rate]] in 1986 and 1987, which is considered to be one of the direct causes of the asset price bubble.\n\n=== Financial Liberalization ===\nWhen the United States was in recession in early 1980s, the U.S. government pointed out that the imbalance of exchange rate of U.S dollar and Japanese yen as the cause of recession, though the fundamental issue in recession was the fall in competition of domestic producers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.go.jp/jp/prj/sbubble/history/history_01/analysis_01_01_05.pdf|title=Financial liberalization|last=|first=|date=|website=esri.go.jp|access-date=}}</ref> To achieve depreciation of the U.S. dollar and appreciation of the Japanese yen, the United States focused on removing financial restrictions in Japan and increasing the demand for the Japanese yen. The financial restrictions in Japan at that time prevented for Japanese yen to be purchased and invested freely from foreign countries. In 1983, the United States and Japan committee for Yen and U.S. dollar was established to reduce the friction in exchange rate of Japanese yen and U.S. dollar. Through this committee, the United States strongly demanded Japan to deregulate and ease restrictions on financial and capital transactions. As a result, in 1984, restriction on future exchange transaction was removed in Japan, and it became possible for not only banks but companies to be involved in currency trading.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later in the same year, regulation on converting foreign funds into funds Japanese yen was also eliminated. The abolition of financial restrictions in Japan opened up Japanese financial market to overseas, and the demand for Japanese yen increased accordingly. At the same time, there was increasing number of loans from banks to companies on real estate investment purpose in 1985. It partly became the cause of asset price bubble as financial liberalization increased the investment in real estate by companies even before monetary policy took place in 1986.\n\n=== Monetary policy ===\nThe accelerating growth in terms of Japanese asset prices is closely associated with a significant drop in short-term [[interest rates]], notably between 1986 and 1987. The [[Bank of Japan|BoJ]] had slashed the official discount rate from 5.00% (January 30, 1986) to 2.50% (February 23, 1987).<ref name=\"edgardo\"/><ref name=\"yukio\">Yukio Noguchi (1991): Land prices and house prices in Japan, University of Chicago Press</ref> The official discount rate remained unchanged until May 30, 1989.\n\nBOJ official discount rates:<ref name=\"mieno\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''Effective date''' !! Official discount rate\n|-\n| January 30, 1986|| 5.00%  to 4.50% \n|-\n| March 10, 1986 || 4.50%  to 4.00%\n|-\n| April 21, 1986 || 4.00%  to 3.50%\n|-\n| November 1, 1986 || 3.50%  to 3.00%\n|-\n| February 23, 1987 || 3.00%  to 2.50%\n|-\n| February 24, 1987 \u2013 May 30, 1989 || Unchanged at 2.50% \n|}\n\nWith the exception of the first discount rate cut, most of the discount cut was closely motivated by international policy to [[currency intervention|intervene in the foreign exchange market]]. Despite aggressive monetary easing by BOJ, the US dollar slid as much as 35% from \u00a5237/U$ (September 1985) to \u00a5153/U$ (February 1987).<ref name=\"boj\"/> Consequently, the move by the BOJ was heavily criticized since such moves appeared to influence the outcome of the yen, a much neglected domestic factor.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} As a result of such move, [[money supply|money growth]] was out of control. In the 1985-1987 period, money growth had been lingering around 8% before being pushed up to more than 10% by the end of 1987.<ref name=\"jousei\"/><ref name= \"boj2\"/>  By early 1988, growth had reached about 12% per annum.<ref name=\"jousei\"/><ref name= \"boj2\"/>\n\nThe Bank of Japan has also been criticized for its role in fueling the asset bubble. The movement of the BOJ to appreciate the Japanese yen rather than stabilizing the asset price inflation and overheating meant little could be done during the peak of the crisis. Despite the Bank of Japan stepping in to hike the interest rate by May 31, 1989, it seemed to have little effect on the asset inflation. Indeed, land prices continued to rise until the early 1990s.<ref name=\"okina\"/>\n\n=== Distortions in the tax system ===\nJapan has one of the world's most complicated taxation systems, with its [[property tax]] provisions deserving specific mention. These provisions have been widely abused for speculation and have contributed to costlier land, especially within urban areas.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/><ref name=\"yukio\"/><ref name= nishimura>Nishimura Kiyohiko (1990): Nihon no Chikakettei Mechanism (The mechanism of land price determination in Japan)</ref>\n\nThe [[inheritance tax]] is very high in Japan, reported to be 75% of the market price for over 500 million yen until 1988, and it is still 70% of the market price for over 2 billion yen.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> Yet the [[real estate appraisal|appraisal]] of land for tax purposes used to be about one-half of the market value and the [[debt]] was considered at face value during the bubble period.<ref name=\"yukio\"/><ref name= \"nishimura\"/> In order to evade inheritance tax, many wealthy individuals opt to borrow more money (since the interest rate was far lower), hence reducing exposure to inheritance tax.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/>\n\nFurthermore, given that [[capital gains]] on land are not taxed until the time of sale and interest rate payments can be deducted from taxable income for companies and individuals investing in assets (condominiums and offices), this has offered more incentive for wealthy individuals and companies to speculate on the asset price.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> The Japanese property tax stipulated that the statutory standard property tax stood at 1.4%.<ref name=\"yukio\"/>  However, in terms of effective property tax, it is much lower than the published [[statutory]] property tax.<ref name=\"yukio\"/><ref name= \"nishimura\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, local government imposed a tax on the market price land.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> Since the valuations did not rise in tandem with the actual rising market price, the effective property tax regressed over the time. As a result, the [[Greater Tokyo]] area dropped to 0.06% of the market price.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> As the land price escalated much quicker than the tax rate, most Japanese considered land as an asset rather than for productive purposes. Strong expectations that land prices were likely to increase, coupled with minimal property taxes, meant it made more sense to [[speculate]] on the land price than to fully utilize the land for [[Production (economics)|production]] purposes.<ref name= \"nishimura\"/>\n\n=== The land lease law ===\nAs provided under the [[Law of Japan|Japan Civil Code]], the rights of a [[lessee]] and [[Tenant farmer|tenant]] are protected under the Land Lease Law.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> This law can be traced back during [[World War II]], whereby most heads of household were [[conscription|conscripted]] for [[military duty]], leaving their families in danger of being thrown out off their leased land.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> For this reason, land [[leasehold]] contracts automatically renew unless the landlord provides concrete reasoning to object.<ref name=\"yukio\"/>\n\nIn the event of a dispute between the lessee and tenant, courts may convene a hearing in order to ensure that the rent is \"fair and reasonable\".<ref name=\"yukio\"/> If the rent is set by the court, tenants would pay according to the rent set by the court, which meant landlords could not raise the rent more than the actual [[market price]]. Hence, rents are actually kept \"artificially low\"<ref name=\"yukio\"/> and the market fails to respond according to the rental price set by the market. Due to this, many landlords refused to rent out their land for such steeply discount prices, but rather left the land deserted in order to reap huge capital gains should land prices increase sharply.<ref name=\"yukio\"/>\n\n=== Changes in bank behaviour ===\nTraditionally, Japanese are well known to be great [[Deposit (finance)|deposit]] savers. However, the trend seemed to reverse by the late 1980s as more Japanese opted to shift funding from banks to the [[capital market]] \u2013 leaving banks in a tight squeeze as lending costs grew with the shrinking [[customer base]].<ref name=\"edgardo\"/>\n\nIn fact, bank behaviour has gradually become aggressive since 1983 (even before the monetary easing policy in Japan) after the ban on fund-raising in the [[securities market]] was lifted around 1980.<ref name=\"okina\"/> However, major firms were not keen to utilize the bank as the source of funding. For this reason, banks were forced to aggressively promote loans to smaller firms backed by properties.<ref name=\"okina\"/> Soon, especially around 1987\u20131988, banks were even more apt to lend to individuals backed by properties.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/> Evidently, even an ordinary [[salaryman]] could easily borrow up to 100 million yen for any purpose, provided his house was used as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]].<ref name=\"edgardo\"/>\n\nConsequently, this had an adverse impact on whole Japanese asset bubble. Firstly, cheap and easily available loans reduced the funding costs for the purpose of speculation.<ref name=\"iwamoto\">Iwamoto Yasushi, Fumio Ohtake, Makoto Saito, and Koichi Futagami (1999: Keizai Seisaku to Makuro Keizai Gaku (Economic Policy and Macroeconomics), Nihon Keizai Shimbunsha(in Japanese)</ref> Second, stock rises, coupled by low interests rates, reduced the [[capital costs]] and aided financing the [[capital market]] (e.g. [[convertible bonds]], bonds with [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]], etc.).<ref name=\"iwamoto\"/> Third, the combination of a rise in land and stock prices pushed up the value of assets held by corporations, which effectively increased their sources of funding since such these increased the collateral value of the assets.<ref name=\"iwamoto\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Asset price ===\nThe asset price burst seemed to exert a strong impact on the overall Japanese economy. By 1992, [[Urban area|urban]] land prices nationwide declined 1.7% from the peak.<ref name=\"land\"/> However, the impact was worse for land in the six major cities, as the average land prices (commercial, residential, and industrial) dropped 15.5% from its peak.<ref name=\"land\"/> [[Commercial property|Commercial]], [[residential]] and [[industry|industrial]] land prices dropped 15.2%, 17.9%, and 13.1%, respectively.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\nThe entire asset price crisis was far worse, especially in the large business districts of Tokyo. By 2004, prime \"A\" property in Tokyo's financial districts had slumped to less than 1 percent of its peak, and Tokyo's residential homes were less than a tenth of their peak, but still managed to be listed as the most expensive in the world until being surpassed in the late 2000s by Moscow and other cities. However, since 2012, Tokyo is once again the world's most expensive city, followed by Osaka with [[Moscow]] as number 4.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Tens of trillions of dollars of value was wiped out with the combined collapse of the Tokyo stock and real estate markets. Only in 2007 did property prices begin to rise; however, they began to fall in late 2008 due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global financial crisis]].<ref name=\"iwamoto\"/>\n\n=== Household impact ===\nThe entire crisis also badly affected direct [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[investment]] within Japan.<ref name=\"esri\">Economic and Social Research Institute (2003):Trend of the Japanese economy and major topics in and after the 1970s</ref> As a result, from a prolonged decline in the asset prices, there was a sharp decline in consumption, which resulted in long term [[deflation]] in Japan.<ref name=\"esri\"/> The asset price burst also badly affected [[consumer confidence]] since a sharp dip reduced household real [[income]].<ref name=\"iwamoto\"/>\n\n=== Corporate impact ===\n\nAt the same time, since the economy was driven by its high rate of reinvestment, the crash hit the stock market particularly hard. The [[Nikkei 225]] at the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] plunged from a height of 38,915 at the end of December 1989 to 14,309 at the end of August 1992.<ref name=\"esri\"/> By 11 March 2003, it plunged to the post-bubble low of 7,862.<ref name=\"esri\"/> As investments were increasingly directed out of the country, manufacturers were facing difficulties to uphold its [[competitive advantage]] since most manufacturing firms lost some degree of their technological edge.<ref name=\"esri\"/> Consequently, Japanese products became less competitive overseas.\n \nDuring the asset bubble period, most Japanese corporate balance sheets were backed by assets. Hence, the asset prices influenced the corporate balance sheet.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Owing to a lack of [[corporate governance]] in Japanese companies,<ref name=\"mieno\"/> most Japanese corporations had an inclination to convince investors with their healthy balance sheet, since most investors believe that such prices are likely [[bullish]].<ref name=\"esri\"/> An important effect of the bubble collapse was the deterioration of balance sheets. Since asset prices tumbled, increasing [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] on a long-term basis projected a bad balance sheet to investors.<ref name=\"esri\"/> Many Japanese corporations were facing huge difficulties to reduce the [[debt ratio]] \u2013 resulting reluctance from the [[private sector]] to increase investments.<ref name=\"esri\"/>\n\n=== Financial and banking sector ===\nThe easily obtainable credit that helped create and engorge the real estate bubble continued to be a problem for several years, and as late as 1997, banks were still making loans that had a low [[probability]] of being repaid.<ref name=\"esri\"/> [[Loan officer]]s and investment staff had a hard time finding anything to invest in that had the prospect of returning a profit. They would sometimes resort to depositing their block of investment cash, as ordinary deposits, in a competing bank, which would bring complaints from that bank's loan officers and investment staff. Correcting the [[Credit (finance)|credit]] problem became even more difficult as the government began to subsidize failing banks and businesses, creating many so\u2013called \"zombie businesses\".<ref name=\"esri\"/> Eventually, a carry trade developed in which money was borrowed from Japan, invested for returns elsewhere, and then the Japanese were paid back, with a nice [[Profit (economics)|profit]] for the trader.<ref name=\"esri\"/>\n\nThe post bubble crisis also claimed several victims such as Sanyo Securities Co., [[Hokkaido Takushoku Bank]], and [[Yamaichi Securities Co.]] in November 1997.<ref name=\"esri\"/> By October 1998, the failure of the [[Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan]] as well as [[Nippon Credit Bank]] in December the same year worsened the [[financial system]] unrest,<ref name=\"esri\"/> drastically deteriorating [[consumer confidence|consumer]] and business sentiment and dealing a heavy blow to the economy. To address the crisis, the government injected a total of 9.3 trillion yen in public funds into major banks in March 1998 and March 1999.<ref name=\"esri\"/>\n\n=== The lost decade ===\nThe decade beyond 1991 is known as {{nihongo|the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]]|\u5931\u308f\u308c\u305f\u5341\u5e74|ushinawareta j\u016bnen|lit. \"lost decade\"}} in Japan, due to the gradual effect of the asset bubble collapse and effects.\n\n== Government policy ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Government spending ===\nDuring a few years after the bubble crisis, Japan experienced a sharp decline in the GDP growth rate. In 1993, the Japanese government decided on a major increase in government spending. It was aimed to increase domestic demand and stimulate consumption to help pull the economy from recession. However, increasing government spending did not turn as effective as the government predicted it to be. The consumption in household increased in 1993 compared to the previous year and continued increasing for several years, but it started declining again in 1998. It is considered that consumer confidence was at the lowest from uncertainty in the future after the bubble crisis, and consumers preferred to save rather than spending in such a situation. The budget deficit expanded from increased government spending and decreased tax revenue from the recession.\n\n=== Zero interest rate policy ===\nThe central bank imposed zero interest policy in late 1990s to get the economy out of recession after the bubble crisis. The nominal interest rate was reduced from 2% to 0.5% in 1995. Consecutively, the central bank reduced the interest rate to 0.32% and to 0.05% in 1998 and 1999 respectively. It is called the zero interest policy as the central bank lowered the interest rate as close to 0% as possible. The objective of zero interest rate was to stimulate the economy by making it easier for companies to borrow funds from banks and helping them make investments. As the GDP growth rate recovered back to 3% in 2000 first time after 1996, the government perceived it as the beginning of recovery from recession and stopped the zero interest rate policy by raising the interest rate to 1%. However, the GDP growth rate again tanked to 0.5% next year in 2001, and the central bank ended up reducing the interest rate again to 0.35% in 2001. Overall, the depression after the bubble crisis was longer than expected. In addition, the uncertainty about the future of the economy was high during the recession, and therefore, lowering the interest rate was not so effective in stimulating investment and the economy overall at that time. The government took the policy of quantitative easing, in 2001. They expanded the maximum amount of deposit in the central bank, and lowered the call rate between banks nearly to zero. This marked the better policy on recovering the economy. The economy recovered slowly after 2001, and the quantitative easing was stopped in 2006.\n\n==Media==\nThe Japanese asset price bubble is spotlighted in the [[NHK]]'s series ''A Portrait of Postwar Japan'' (2015), Episode 2: \"The Bubble and the Lost Decades.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pf.nhk-ep.co.jp/detail_printable/1948|title=The Bubble and the Lost Decades|date=2015|website=NHK Enterprises}}</ref> The documentary creators obtained information from interviews with more than one hundred key figures of the bubble.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/portrait-of-postwar-japan/oclc/971500676&referer=brief_results|title=A portrait of postwar Japan|date=2017|website=WorldCat}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References==\n* Saxonhouse, Gary and Stern, Robert (Eds) (2004) ''Japan's Lost Decade: Origins, Consequences and Prospects for Recovery (World Economy Special Issues)'', Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-1917-7}}\n* Wood, Christopher (2005) ''The Bubble Economy: Japan's Extraordinary Speculative Boom of the '80s and the Dramatic Bust of the '90s'', Solstice Publishing, {{ISBN|978-979-3780-12-2}}\n* Daniell, Thomas (2008) ''After the Crash: Architecture in Post-Bubble Japan'', Princeton Architectural Press, {{ISBN|978-1-56898-776-7}}\n* Klarman, Seth A.

Even though asset prices had visibly collapsed by early 1992,<ref name=\"okina\"/> the economy's decline continued for more than a decade. This decline resulted in a huge accumulation of [[Non-performing loan|non-performing assets loans]] (NPL), causing difficulties for many financial institutions. The bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble contributed to what many call the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]].<ref>http://fhayashi.fc2web.com/Prescott1/Postscript_2003/hayashi-prescott.pdf</ref>  Japan's annual land prices averaged nationwide have finally risen since the asset bubble collapse, though only mildly at 0.1%, a process that has taken 26 years to show up statistically.<ref>http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0004745149</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nEarly research has found that the rapid increase in Japanese asset prices was largely due to the delayed action by the BOJ to address the issue. At the end of August 1987, the BOJ signaled the possibility of tightening the monetary policy, but decided to delay the decision in view of economic uncertainty related to [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday (October 19, 1987)]] in the US.<ref name=\"jousei\">Research and Statistics Department,  Bank of Japan, April 1987b, Jousei Handan Shiryo: 62-nen Haru (Quarterly Economic Outlook: Spring 1987),\" Chousa Geppo (Monthly Bulletin)(in Japanese)</ref>\n\nMore recent research supports an alternate view, that BOJ reluctance to tighten the monetary policy was in spite of the fact that the economy went into expansion in the second half of 1987.   The Japanese economy had just recovered from the {{nihongo|endaka [[recession]]|\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u5186\u9ad8\u4e0d\u6cc1| Nihon no endakafuky\u014d| lit. \"recession caused by appreciation of Japanese Yen\"}}, which occurred from 1985 to 1986.<ref name=\"jousei\"/> The endaka recession has been closely linked to the [[Plaza Accord]] of September 1985, which led to the strong appreciation of the [[Japanese yen]].<ref name=\"mieno\">Mieno, Yasushi, (2000) Ri wo Mite Gi wo Omou (Recall Faith to See What Makes a Profit), Chuo Koronsha,(in Japanese)</ref>   The term [[Endaka|''endaka fuky\u014d'']] would in the future be used repeatedly to describe the many times the yen surged and the economy went into recession, posing a conundrum for business and government, trade partners, and anti-monetary interventionists.\n\nThe strong appreciation of the yen eroded the Japanese economy, since the economy was led by exports and [[capital investment]] for export purpose. In fact, in order to overcome the endaka recession and stimulate the local economy, an aggressive [[fiscal policy]] was adopted, mainly through expansion of public investment.<ref name=\"okina\"/> Simultaneously, the BOJ declared that curbing the yen's appreciation was a national priority.<ref name=\"mieno\"/><ref name=\"ohta\">Ohta, Takeshi (1991)Kokusai Kin'yu\u2014Genba Kara no Shougen (International Finance\u2014Witness Concerned),Chuko Shinsho (in Japanese)</ref> To prevent the yen from appreciating further, monetary policy makers pursued aggressive monetary easing and slashed the official discount rate to as low as 2.5% by February 1987.<ref name=\"okina\"/>\n\nThe move initially failed to curb further appreciation of the yen, which rose from 200.05 \u00a5/U$ (first round monetary easing) to 128.25 \u00a5/U$ (end of 1987). The course only reversed by the spring of 1988, when the US dollar began to strengthen against the yen. Some researchers have pointed out that \"with exception of the first discount rate cut, the subsequent four are heavily influenced by the US: [the] second and the third cut was a joint announcement to cut the discount rate while the fourth and fifth was due to [a] joint statement [of] either Japan-US or the [[G7|G-7]]\".<ref name=\"okina\"/><ref name=\"ohta\"/> It has been suggested that the US exerted influence to increase the strength of the yen, which would help with the ongoing attempts to reduce the US-Japan [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficit.<ref name=\"okina\"/> Almost all [[discount window|discount rate]] cuts announced by the BOJ explicitly expressed the need to stabilize the foreign exchange rate, rather than to stabilize the domestic economy.<ref name=\"ohta\"/>\n\nLater, BOJ hinted at the possibility of tightening the policy due to inflationary pressures within the domestic economy. Despite leaving the official discount rate unchanged during the summer of 1987, the BOJ expressed concern over excessive [[monetary easing]], particularly after the money supply and asset prices rose sharply.<ref name=\"ohta\"/> Nonetheless, [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] in the US triggered a delay for the BOJ to switch to a monetary tightening policy. The BOJ officially increased the discount rate on March 31, 1989.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/>\n\nThe table below demonstrates the monthly average of the [[U.S. dollar]]/[[Yen]] spot rate (Yen per USD) at 17:00 JST.<ref name=\"boj\">Bank of Japan: [http://www.stat-search.boj.or.jp/ssi/mtshtml/m_en.html US.Dollar/Yen Spot Rate at 17:00 in JST, Average in the Month, Tokyo Market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603050319/http://www.stat-search.boj.or.jp/ssi/mtshtml/m_en.html |date=2013-06-03 }} for duration January 1980 ~ September 2010.

The demand for office space continued to soar as more economic activities flooded Tokyo commercial districts, resulting in demand outstripping the supply.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/>  The government policies to solely concentrate its economic activities in Tokyo, and the lack of diversification of [[economic activities]] in other local cities, are also partly to blame for the bubble.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/>\n\nBy 1985, lands within Tokyo commercial districts were unable to fulfill the [[market demand]]. As a result, land prices in Tokyo commercial districts increased sharply within a year. The average price per 1 sq. metre for land in Tokyo commercial districts in 1984 was 1,333,000\u00a5 (U$5,600 assuming in 1984 that 1 U$=238\u00a5).<ref name=\"land\"/> In just a year, the average price per 1 sq. metre for land in Tokyo commercial districts increased to 1,894,000\u00a5 (U$7,958 assuming in 1985 average 1 U$=238\u00a5).<ref name=\"land\"/> This roughly translates to an increase of 42% over just a year. By 1986, the average price per 1 sq. metre for land in Tokyo commercial districts had risen as high as 4,211,000\u00a5 (U$25,065 assuming 1986 average 1 U$=168\u00a5), a jump of 122% compared to 1985. Residential land jumped from an average 297,000\u00a5/U$1,247 per 1 sq. metre (in 1985) to 431,000\u00a5/U$2,565 per 1 sq. metre (in 1986), an increase of 45%.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\nOsaka also experienced a rapid growth in land prices, especially in commercial districts. Land prices in Osaka gained 35% to a price of 1,159,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre (1986) from an average 855,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre (1985).<ref name=\"land\"/> Since Osaka uniquely had historical importance as a commercial center in Japan;<ref name=\"stat.go.jp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/2000/jutsu1/00/01.htm\n|title=Population Census: I Daytime Population |accessdate=2012-04-21 |date=2002-03-29\n|work=Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications}}</ref> hence, land prices in Osaka tend to be higher than most other urban land in Japan.\n\nBy 1987, virtually all land within the Tokyo metropolis was unable to cope with demand. At this point, residential land in Tokyo increased to 890,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre (U$6,180 based on the assumption 1U$ = 144\u00a5) and commercial land 6,493,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre (U$45,090).<ref name=\"land\"/> Consequently, investors flocked to prefectures surrounding the Tokyo metropolis, especially prefectures within the Greater Tokyo Area. Prefectures located in Southern Kanto were more favourable to investors compared to Northern Kanto. Hence, land in cities like Yokohama (Kanagawa prefecture), Saitama (Saitama prefecture), and Chiba (Chiba prefecture) tended to be more expensive than cities like [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]] ([[Ibaraki prefecture]]), [[Utsunomiya]] ([[Tochigi prefecture]]) and [[Maebashi]] ([[Gunma prefecture]]). For instance, in 1987, commercial land prices in Yokohama (average 1 sq. metre) were 1,279,000\u00a5, Saitama were 658,000\u00a5 and Chiba were 1,230,000\u00a5. On the other hand, commercial land prices in Mito (average 1 sq. metre) were 153,000\u00a5, Utsunomiya were 179,000\u00a5 and Maebashi were 135,000\u00a5 in 1986.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\nOsaka continued to enjoy an increase in land prices especially in the commercial area, as the prices increased to 2,025,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre in 1987.<ref name=\"land\"/> Kyoto (Kyoto prefecture) and Kobe (Hyogo prefecture) also enjoyed a sharp increase in land prices, especially in commercial areas which gained 31% and 23%, respectively.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/> The effect of the bubble in Osaka spread as far as Nagoya (Aichi prefecture) which saw the commercial land prices gain as much as 28% compared to 1986.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/>\n\nThe first sign of a possible bubble collapse appeared in 1988. By this time, non-prime land prices in Tokyo had reached their peak, though some areas in the Tokyo wards started to fall, albeit by a relatively small percentage.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/> Prime land in [[Ginza]] district and areas in Central Tokyo continued to rise.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/> Urban land in other cities at this point remained unaffected by the situation faced by the Tokyo metropolis. In Osaka, for instance, the commercial and residential land prices increased by 37% and 41% respectively.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/>\n\nBy 1989, land prices in commercial districts in Tokyo began to stagnate, while land prices in residential areas in Tokyo actually dipped 4.2% compared to 1988.<ref name=\"land\"/> Land prices in prime areas in Tokyo also peaked around this time; Ginza district was the most expensive, peaking at 30,000,000\u00a5/1 sq. metre<ref>{{cite book|last=Shapira|first=Phillip|title=Planning for Cities and Regions in Japan|publisher=Liberpool UP|location=Liverpool|pages=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWrHO8-maUYC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=ginza+1989+square+meter&source=bl&ots=tbd6LAuq3o&sig=YxYxWMVF8gqOORSvnM30J6tDloo&hl=en&ei=yybjTsDpBI-FsgLr6IGJBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=ginza%201989%20square%20meter&f=false}}</ref> (U$218,978 based on assumption 1U$ = 137\u00a5). Yokohama (Kanagawa prefecture) experienced a slowdown due to its location closer to Tokyo. Saitama (Saitama) and Chiba (Chiba) still chalked up healthy gain in land prices. All other urban cities in Japan had yet to see the impact of slowdown in Tokyo.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\nAt their peak, prices in central Tokyo were such that the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]] grounds were estimated to be worth more than than all the land in the entire state of California.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yamamura |first=Kozo |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vpZNDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA106 |title=Too Much Stuff: Capitalism in Crisis |date=2018-03-21 |publisher=Policy Press |isbn=978-1-4473-3569-6 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and mid-1991, most urban land had already reached their peak. The lag effect from the fall of [[Nikkei 225]] pushed down the prices of urban land in most parts of Japan by the end of 1991.<ref name=okina/> The bubble collapse was officially declared in early 1992 \u2013 as land prices dropped the most in this period.<ref name=okina/> Tokyo experienced the worst from the catastrophe. Land prices in residential area on average 1 sq/metre slid 19% while commercial land prices declined 13% compared to 1991.<ref name=\"land\"/> Overall land prices in residential area and commercial districts in Tokyo fell to the lowest level since 1987.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\n=== Stock Prices ===\nIn the 1980s, the direction of stock prices in Japan was largely determined by the [[asset]] [[Market (economics)|market]], particularly land prices, in Japan.<ref name=\"yoshito\"/> Looking at the monthly performance of [[Nikkei 225]] in 1984, the index largely moved within 9900\u201311,600 range.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> As land prices in Tokyo began to rise in 1985, the stock market also moved higher. Indeed, the Nikkei 225 managed to rise past 13,000 by December 2, 1985.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/>\n\nThe major surge was obvious by 1986, as the Nikkei 225 gained close to 45% within a year.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> The trend continued throughout 1987, when it touched as high as 26,029 by early August <ref name=\"nikkei\"/> before being dragged down by the NYSE Black Monday. The strong rally throughout 1988 and 1989 helped the Nikkei 225 touch another new record high at 38,957.44 on December 29, 1989 before closing at 38,915.87.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> This translated to a gain of more than 224% since January 2, 1985.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> Some researchers concluded the unusual stock prices are likely due to the rise in land prices since the corporations' net assets increases, hence pushing the stock prices upward.<ref name=\"okina\"/><ref name=\"edgardo\"/> As long as the asset prices continued to strengthen, investors would more likely be attracted to [[speculate]] on stock prices.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, this also portrays the weaknesses of [[corporate governance]] in Japan.<ref name=\"mieno\"/>\n\nOn the downside, the tightening of monetary policy in 1989 seemed to affect stock prices. As lending costs increased drastically, coupled with a major slowdown in land prices in Tokyo, the stock market began to fall sharply in early 1990. The Nikkei 225 slid from an opening of 38,921 (January 4, 1990) to a yearly low of 21,902 (December 5, 1990),<ref name=\"nikkei\"/> which resulted in a loss of more than 43% within a year. Stock prices had officially collapsed by the end 1990. The downward trend continued through the early 1990s, as the Nikkei 225 opened as low as 14,338 on August 19, 1992.<ref name=\"nikkei\"/>\n\n=== Money supply and credit ===\nInitially, the growth of the [[money supply]] decelerated in 1986 (the lowest growth rate was 8.3 percent in October\u2013December 1986), which marked the end of the brief \"endaka recession\".<ref name=\"jousei\"/><ref name= \"boj2\">Research and Statistics Department, Bank of Japan(May 1989) \"Shouwa 63 Nendo no Kin'yu Oyobi Keizai no Doukou (Annual Review of Monetary and Economic Developments in Fiscal 1988),\"Chousa Geppo (Monthly Bulletin),(in Japanese)</ref> The trend was gradually reversed as it accelerated afterwards and exceeded 10 percent in April\u2013June 1987.<ref name= \"boj2\"/>\n\nThe growth of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] was more conspicuous than that of the money supply. During the bubble period, banks were increasing borrowing activity and at the same time, also financing from [[capital markets]] substantially increased against the backdrop of the progress of [[financial deregulation]] and the increase of stock prices.<ref name=\"okina\"/> As a result, the funding of the [[corporate]] and [[household]] sectors rapidly increased from around 1988 and recorded a rate of growth close to 14 percent on a year-on-year basis in 1989.<ref name= \"boj2\"/> Money supply continued to increase even after the BOJ tightened its monetary policy and reached a peak in 1990, thereafter continuing to mark still double-digit growth until the fourth quarter.<ref name= \"boj2\"/> Money supply and credit dropped sharply by 1991, as bank lending began to drop due to a shift in bank lending attitude.<ref name=\"okina\"/>\n\n== Causes ==\n\n=== The Plaza Accord ===\n\nThe [[Plaza Accord]] was signed between [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[West Germany]], and the [[United States]] in 1985, aimed at reducing the imbalance in trade between the countries. At that time, Japan had a huge trade surplus, as the Japanese yen was weaker against U.S. dollar, while the United States suffered from a consistent trade deficit. The reason behind the accord was partially complaints by the States regarding the imbalance in the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar, since most Japanese products imported in the States had higher quality and cheaper prices than the domestic products due to the weaker yen against the dollar.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://diamond.jp/articles/-/60815?page=2|title=\u30d7\u30e9\u30b6\u5408\u610f\u306e\u526f\u7523\u7269\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30c9\u30eb\u5b89\u304c\u751f\u3093\u3060\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u840c\u82bd|work=\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|access-date=2017-12-11|language=ja-JP}}</ref> After reaching a settlement in the Plaza Accord, central banks in participated countries started selling U.S. dollars. In Japan's case, demands for yen increased, and the yen appreciated significantly. In 1985, the exchange rate of yen per dollar was 238. After the foreign exchange intervention followed by Plaza Accord, the exchange rate dropped to 165 yen per dollar in 1986 as yen appreciated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?locations=JP|title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref> This impacted exports in Japan to the States significantly, almost halving them in 1992 from their peak in 1986, whereas the trade deficit in the United States shrank after the Plaza Accord and the deficit cleared out in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=JP|title=Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref> Due to the appreciation in the yen, Japanese companies suffered from huge losses in exports, as they had to sell their products in the States at higher prices than before to make a profit.\n\nAppreciation in the yen accelerated more than expected, because speculators purchased yen and sold US dollars. This further appreciation in the yen shook the economy in Japan, because the main source of economic growth in Japan was its export surplus. The [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth rate dropped from 6.3% in 1985 to 2.8% in 1986, and Japan experienced recession.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=JP|title=GDP growth (annual %) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref> To respond to this recession, the government shifted its focus on increasing demand within the country so that domestic products and services could be consumed in the country instead of exporting to overseas, which would increase domestic consumption as well.\n\nTo summarize the effect of the Plaza Accord in the long run, it did not succeed in equalizing the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States. Despite the fact that there was no major change in exchange rate of the yen and the US dollar, the export surplus in Japan began to rise and the trade deficit in the States started to rise again in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://diamond.jp/articles/-/60815|title=\u30d7\u30e9\u30b6\u5408\u610f\u306e\u526f\u7523\u7269\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30c9\u30eb\u5b89\u304c\u751f\u3093\u3060\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u840c\u82bd|work=\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|access-date=2017-12-11|language=ja-JP}}</ref> Overall, the Plaza Accord directly led to appreciation in the yen, and it incentivized lowering the [[discount window|discount rate]] in 1986 and 1987, which is considered to be one of the direct causes of the asset price bubble.\n\n=== Financial Liberalization ===\nWhen the United States was in recession in early 1980s, the U.S. government pointed out that the imbalance of exchange rate of U.S dollar and Japanese yen as the cause of recession, though the fundamental issue in recession was the fall in competition of domestic producers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.go.jp/jp/prj/sbubble/history/history_01/analysis_01_01_05.pdf|title=Financial liberalization|last=|first=|date=|website=esri.go.jp|access-date=}}</ref> To achieve depreciation of the U.S. dollar and appreciation of the Japanese yen, the United States focused on removing financial restrictions in Japan and increasing the demand for the Japanese yen. The financial restrictions in Japan at that time prevented for Japanese yen to be purchased and invested freely from foreign countries. In 1983, the United States and Japan committee for Yen and U.S. dollar was established to reduce the friction in exchange rate of Japanese yen and U.S. dollar. Through this committee, the United States strongly demanded Japan to deregulate and ease restrictions on financial and capital transactions. As a result, in 1984, restriction on future exchange transaction was removed in Japan, and it became possible for not only banks but companies to be involved in currency trading.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later in the same year, regulation on converting foreign funds into funds Japanese yen was also eliminated. The abolition of financial restrictions in Japan opened up Japanese financial market to overseas, and the demand for Japanese yen increased accordingly. At the same time, there was increasing number of loans from banks to companies on real estate investment purpose in 1985. It partly became the cause of asset price bubble as financial liberalization increased the investment in real estate by companies even before monetary policy took place in 1986.\n\n=== Monetary policy ===\nThe accelerating growth in terms of Japanese asset prices is closely associated with a significant drop in short-term [[interest rates]], notably between 1986 and 1987. The [[Bank of Japan|BoJ]] had slashed the official discount rate from 5.00% (January 30, 1986) to 2.50% (February 23, 1987).<ref name=\"edgardo\"/><ref name=\"yukio\">Yukio Noguchi (1991): Land prices and house prices in Japan, University of Chicago Press</ref> The official discount rate remained unchanged until May 30, 1989.\n\nBOJ official discount rates:<ref name=\"mieno\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''Effective date''' !! Official discount rate\n|-\n| January 30, 1986|| 5.00%  to 4.50% \n|-\n| March 10, 1986 || 4.50%  to 4.00%\n|-\n| April 21, 1986 || 4.00%  to 3.50%\n|-\n| November 1, 1986 || 3.50%  to 3.00%\n|-\n| February 23, 1987 || 3.00%  to 2.50%\n|-\n| February 24, 1987 \u2013 May 30, 1989 || Unchanged at 2.50% \n|}\n\nWith the exception of the first discount rate cut, most of the discount cut was closely motivated by international policy to [[currency intervention|intervene in the foreign exchange market]]. Despite aggressive monetary easing by BOJ, the US dollar slid as much as 35% from \u00a5237/U$ (September 1985) to \u00a5153/U$ (February 1987).<ref name=\"boj\"/> Consequently, the move by the BOJ was heavily criticized since such moves appeared to influence the outcome of the yen, a much neglected domestic factor.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} As a result of such move, [[money supply|money growth]] was out of control. In the 1985-1987 period, money growth had been lingering around 8% before being pushed up to more than 10% by the end of 1987.<ref name=\"jousei\"/><ref name= \"boj2\"/>  By early 1988, growth had reached about 12% per annum.<ref name=\"jousei\"/><ref name= \"boj2\"/>\n\nThe Bank of Japan has also been criticized for its role in fueling the asset bubble. The movement of the BOJ to appreciate the Japanese yen rather than stabilizing the asset price inflation and overheating meant little could be done during the peak of the crisis. Despite the Bank of Japan stepping in to hike the interest rate by May 31, 1989, it seemed to have little effect on the asset inflation. Indeed, land prices continued to rise until the early 1990s.<ref name=\"okina\"/>\n\n=== Distortions in the tax system ===\nJapan has one of the world's most complicated taxation systems, with its [[property tax]] provisions deserving specific mention. These provisions have been widely abused for speculation and have contributed to costlier land, especially within urban areas.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/><ref name=\"yukio\"/><ref name= nishimura>Nishimura Kiyohiko (1990): Nihon no Chikakettei Mechanism (The mechanism of land price determination in Japan)</ref>\n\nThe [[inheritance tax]] is very high in Japan, reported to be 75% of the market price for over 500 million yen until 1988, and it is still 70% of the market price for over 2 billion yen.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> Yet the [[real estate appraisal|appraisal]] of land for tax purposes used to be about one-half of the market value and the [[debt]] was considered at face value during the bubble period.<ref name=\"yukio\"/><ref name= \"nishimura\"/> In order to evade inheritance tax, many wealthy individuals opt to borrow more money (since the interest rate was far lower), hence reducing exposure to inheritance tax.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/>\n\nFurthermore, given that [[capital gains]] on land are not taxed until the time of sale and interest rate payments can be deducted from taxable income for companies and individuals investing in assets (condominiums and offices), this has offered more incentive for wealthy individuals and companies to speculate on the asset price.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> The Japanese property tax stipulated that the statutory standard property tax stood at 1.4%.<ref name=\"yukio\"/>  However, in terms of effective property tax, it is much lower than the published [[statutory]] property tax.<ref name=\"yukio\"/><ref name= \"nishimura\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, local government imposed a tax on the market price land.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> Since the valuations did not rise in tandem with the actual rising market price, the effective property tax regressed over the time. As a result, the [[Greater Tokyo]] area dropped to 0.06% of the market price.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> As the land price escalated much quicker than the tax rate, most Japanese considered land as an asset rather than for productive purposes. Strong expectations that land prices were likely to increase, coupled with minimal property taxes, meant it made more sense to [[speculate]] on the land price than to fully utilize the land for [[Production (economics)|production]] purposes.<ref name= \"nishimura\"/>\n\n=== The land lease law ===\nAs provided under the [[Law of Japan|Japan Civil Code]], the rights of a [[lessee]] and [[Tenant farmer|tenant]] are protected under the Land Lease Law.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> This law can be traced back during [[World War II]], whereby most heads of household were [[conscription|conscripted]] for [[military duty]], leaving their families in danger of being thrown out off their leased land.<ref name=\"yukio\"/> For this reason, land [[leasehold]] contracts automatically renew unless the landlord provides concrete reasoning to object.<ref name=\"yukio\"/>\n\nIn the event of a dispute between the lessee and tenant, courts may convene a hearing in order to ensure that the rent is \"fair and reasonable\".<ref name=\"yukio\"/> If the rent is set by the court, tenants would pay according to the rent set by the court, which meant landlords could not raise the rent more than the actual [[market price]]. Hence, rents are actually kept \"artificially low\"<ref name=\"yukio\"/> and the market fails to respond according to the rental price set by the market. Due to this, many landlords refused to rent out their land for such steeply discount prices, but rather left the land deserted in order to reap huge capital gains should land prices increase sharply.<ref name=\"yukio\"/>\n\n=== Changes in bank behaviour ===\nTraditionally, Japanese are well known to be great [[Deposit (finance)|deposit]] savers. However, the trend seemed to reverse by the late 1980s as more Japanese opted to shift funding from banks to the [[capital market]] \u2013 leaving banks in a tight squeeze as lending costs grew with the shrinking [[customer base]].<ref name=\"edgardo\"/>\n\nIn fact, bank behaviour has gradually become aggressive since 1983 (even before the monetary easing policy in Japan) after the ban on fund-raising in the [[securities market]] was lifted around 1980.<ref name=\"okina\"/> However, major firms were not keen to utilize the bank as the source of funding. For this reason, banks were forced to aggressively promote loans to smaller firms backed by properties.<ref name=\"okina\"/> Soon, especially around 1987\u20131988, banks were even more apt to lend to individuals backed by properties.<ref name=\"edgardo\"/> Evidently, even an ordinary [[salaryman]] could easily borrow up to 100 million yen for any purpose, provided his house was used as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]].<ref name=\"edgardo\"/>\n\nConsequently, this had an adverse impact on whole Japanese asset bubble. Firstly, cheap and easily available loans reduced the funding costs for the purpose of speculation.<ref name=\"iwamoto\">Iwamoto Yasushi, Fumio Ohtake, Makoto Saito, and Koichi Futagami (1999: Keizai Seisaku to Makuro Keizai Gaku (Economic Policy and Macroeconomics), Nihon Keizai Shimbunsha(in Japanese)</ref> Second, stock rises, coupled by low interests rates, reduced the [[capital costs]] and aided financing the [[capital market]] (e.g. [[convertible bonds]], bonds with [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]], etc.).<ref name=\"iwamoto\"/> Third, the combination of a rise in land and stock prices pushed up the value of assets held by corporations, which effectively increased their sources of funding since such these increased the collateral value of the assets.<ref name=\"iwamoto\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Asset price ===\nThe asset price burst seemed to exert a strong impact on the overall Japanese economy. By 1992, [[Urban area|urban]] land prices nationwide declined 1.7% from the peak.<ref name=\"land\"/> However, the impact was worse for land in the six major cities, as the average land prices (commercial, residential, and industrial) dropped 15.5% from its peak.<ref name=\"land\"/> [[Commercial property|Commercial]], [[residential]] and [[industry|industrial]] land prices dropped 15.2%, 17.9%, and 13.1%, respectively.<ref name=\"land\"/>\n\nThe entire asset price crisis was far worse, especially in the large business districts of Tokyo. By 2004, prime \"A\" property in Tokyo's financial districts had slumped to less than 1 percent of its peak, and Tokyo's residential homes were less than a tenth of their peak, but still managed to be listed as the most expensive in the world until being surpassed in the late 2000s by Moscow and other cities. However, since 2012, Tokyo is once again the world's most expensive city, followed by Osaka with [[Moscow]] as number 4.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Tens of trillions of dollars of value was wiped out with the combined collapse of the Tokyo stock and real estate markets. Only in 2007 did property prices begin to rise; however, they began to fall in late 2008 due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global financial crisis]].<ref name=\"iwamoto\"/>\n\n=== Household impact ===\nThe entire crisis also badly affected direct [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[investment]] within Japan.<ref name=\"esri\">Economic and Social Research Institute (2003):Trend of the Japanese economy and major topics in and after the 1970s</ref> As a result, from a prolonged decline in the asset prices, there was a sharp decline in consumption, which resulted in long term [[deflation]] in Japan.<ref name=\"esri\"/> The asset price burst also badly affected [[consumer confidence]] since a sharp dip reduced household real [[income]].<ref name=\"iwamoto\"/>\n\n=== Corporate impact ===\n\nAt the same time, since the economy was driven by its high rate of reinvestment, the crash hit the stock market particularly hard. The [[Nikkei 225]] at the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] plunged from a height of 38,915 at the end of December 1989 to 14,309 at the end of August 1992.<ref name=\"esri\"/> By 11 March 2003, it plunged to the post-bubble low of 7,862.<ref name=\"esri\"/> As investments were increasingly directed out of the country, manufacturers were facing difficulties to uphold its [[competitive advantage]] since most manufacturing firms lost some degree of their technological edge.<ref name=\"esri\"/> Consequently, Japanese products became less competitive overseas.\n \nDuring the asset bubble period, most Japanese corporate balance sheets were backed by assets. Hence, the asset prices influenced the corporate balance sheet.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Owing to a lack of [[corporate governance]] in Japanese companies,<ref name=\"mieno\"/> most Japanese corporations had an inclination to convince investors with their healthy balance sheet, since most investors believe that such prices are likely [[bullish]].<ref name=\"esri\"/> An important effect of the bubble collapse was the deterioration of balance sheets. Since asset prices tumbled, increasing [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] on a long-term basis projected a bad balance sheet to investors.<ref name=\"esri\"/> Many Japanese corporations were facing huge difficulties to reduce the [[debt ratio]] \u2013 resulting reluctance from the [[private sector]] to increase investments.<ref name=\"esri\"/>\n\n=== Financial and banking sector ===\nThe easily obtainable credit that helped create and engorge the real estate bubble continued to be a problem for several years, and as late as 1997, banks were still making loans that had a low [[probability]] of being repaid.<ref name=\"esri\"/> [[Loan officer]]s and investment staff had a hard time finding anything to invest in that had the prospect of returning a profit. They would sometimes resort to depositing their block of investment cash, as ordinary deposits, in a competing bank, which would bring complaints from that bank's loan officers and investment staff. Correcting the [[Credit (finance)|credit]] problem became even more difficult as the government began to subsidize failing banks and businesses, creating many so\u2013called \"zombie businesses\".<ref name=\"esri\"/> Eventually, a carry trade developed in which money was borrowed from Japan, invested for returns elsewhere, and then the Japanese were paid back, with a nice [[Profit (economics)|profit]] for the trader.<ref name=\"esri\"/>\n\nThe post bubble crisis also claimed several victims such as Sanyo Securities Co., [[Hokkaido Takushoku Bank]], and [[Yamaichi Securities Co.]] in November 1997.<ref name=\"esri\"/> By October 1998, the failure of the [[Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan]] as well as [[Nippon Credit Bank]] in December the same year worsened the [[financial system]] unrest,<ref name=\"esri\"/> drastically deteriorating [[consumer confidence|consumer]] and business sentiment and dealing a heavy blow to the economy. To address the crisis, the government injected a total of 9.3 trillion yen in public funds into major banks in March 1998 and March 1999.<ref name=\"esri\"/>\n\n=== The lost decade ===\nThe decade beyond 1991 is known as {{nihongo|the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]]|\u5931\u308f\u308c\u305f\u5341\u5e74|ushinawareta j\u016bnen|lit. \"lost decade\"}} in Japan, due to the gradual effect of the asset bubble collapse and effects.\n\n== Government policy ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Government spending ===\nDuring a few years after the bubble crisis, Japan experienced a sharp decline in the GDP growth rate. In 1993, the Japanese government decided on a major increase in government spending. It was aimed to increase domestic demand and stimulate consumption to help pull the economy from recession. However, increasing government spending did not turn as effective as the government predicted it to be. The consumption in household increased in 1993 compared to the previous year and continued increasing for several years, but it started declining again in 1998. It is considered that consumer confidence was at the lowest from uncertainty in the future after the bubble crisis, and consumers preferred to save rather than spending in such a situation. The budget deficit expanded from increased government spending and decreased tax revenue from the recession.\n\n=== Zero interest rate policy ===\nThe central bank imposed zero interest policy in late 1990s to get the economy out of recession after the bubble crisis. The nominal interest rate was reduced from 2% to 0.5% in 1995. Consecutively, the central bank reduced the interest rate to 0.32% and to 0.05% in 1998 and 1999 respectively. It is called the zero interest policy as the central bank lowered the interest rate as close to 0% as possible. The objective of zero interest rate was to stimulate the economy by making it easier for companies to borrow funds from banks and helping them make investments. As the GDP growth rate recovered back to 3% in 2000 first time after 1996, the government perceived it as the beginning of recovery from recession and stopped the zero interest rate policy by raising the interest rate to 1%. However, the GDP growth rate again tanked to 0.5% next year in 2001, and the central bank ended up reducing the interest rate again to 0.35% in 2001. Overall, the depression after the bubble crisis was longer than expected. In addition, the uncertainty about the future of the economy was high during the recession, and therefore, lowering the interest rate was not so effective in stimulating investment and the economy overall at that time. The government took the policy of quantitative easing, in 2001. They expanded the maximum amount of deposit in the central bank, and lowered the call rate between banks nearly to zero. This marked the better policy on recovering the economy. The economy recovered slowly after 2001, and the quantitative easing was stopped in 2006.\n\n==Media==\nThe Japanese asset price bubble is spotlighted in the [[NHK]]'s series ''A Portrait of Postwar Japan'' (2015), Episode 2: \"The Bubble and the Lost Decades.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pf.nhk-ep.co.jp/detail_printable/1948|title=The Bubble and the Lost Decades|date=2015|website=NHK Enterprises}}</ref> The documentary creators obtained information from interviews with more than one hundred key figures of the bubble.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/portrait-of-postwar-japan/oclc/971500676&referer=brief_results|title=A portrait of postwar Japan|date=2017|website=WorldCat}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References==\n* Saxonhouse, Gary and Stern, Robert (Eds) (2004) ''Japan's Lost Decade: Origins, Consequences and Prospects for Recovery (World Economy Special Issues)'', Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-1917-7}}\n* Wood, Christopher (2005) ''The Bubble Economy: Japan's Extraordinary Speculative Boom of the '80s and the Dramatic Bust of the '90s'', Solstice Publishing, {{ISBN|978-979-3780-12-2}}\n* Daniell, Thomas (2008) ''After the Crash: Architecture in Post-Bubble Japan'', Princeton Architectural Press, {{ISBN|978-1-56898-776-7}}\n* Klarman, Seth A.

The Bills improved on their 4\u201312 record from the [[2010 Buffalo Bills season|2010]] season, winning six games; however, the team also missed the playoffs for the twelfth consecutive season; the team had not made the playoffs since [[1999 Buffalo Bills season|1999]], the longest standing playoff drought in the NFL at the time. Buffalo played in the [[AFC East|Eastern]] division of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC).\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\nIn week 3 of the season, the Bills broke a 15-game losing streak that the team had accrued against the [[New England Patriots]] that dated to opening day of the [[2003 Buffalo Bills season|2003 season]]; Buffalo defeated the Patriots, 34\u201331. In doing so, the 2011 Bills became the only team since before 1950 (when comprehensive statistical record keeping began) to win two consecutive games in which they trailed by at least 18 points; they overcame a 21\u20133 deficit to [[Oakland Raiders|Oakland]] in Week 2 and a 21\u20130 deficit to [[New England Patriots|New England]] in Week 3. Incidentally, Buffalo's loss to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] the following week was the Bills' first loss to Cincinnati since the [[1988-89 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Cincinnati Bengals 21, Buffalo Bills 10|1988 AFC Championship game]]; that streak had been the longest winning streak by one team over another after Buffalo snapped their losing streak to New England.\n\nThe Bills started the season with a 5\u20132 record, positioned to make the playoffs, before losing eight of their final nine games, eliminating them from the playoffs. Wide receiver [[Stevie Johnson]] set a franchise mark as the only receiver in Bills history to record two consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. No other Bills receiver \u2013 including [[Andre Reed]], [[James Lofton]], [[Eric Moulds]] or [[Lee Evans (American football)|Lee Evans]] \u2013 had done so. Buffalo's offense only surrendered 23 sacks all season, the fewest in the NFL.<ref>[http://www.buffalorumblings.com/2012/1/10/2693445/buffalo-bills-2011-season-ryan-fitzpatrick 2011 Buffalo Bills: Team Allows Fewest Sacks In NFL]</ref>\n\n===Strong start, weak finish===\nThe Bills were looking to make the playoffs for the first time since 1999, and enjoyed a 3\u20130 start, including a 21-point comeback against the [[2011 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]] in week 3. However, after a dominating Week Eight shutout win over [[2011 Washington Redskins season|Washington]] in [[Bills Toronto Series|Toronto]] (their only victory north of the border, as their Toronto Series was cancelled after the 2013 season), improving the team's record to 5-2, the remainder of the Bills' season was plagued by injuries to key starters. As a result, Buffalo suffered a seven-game losing streak to the [[2011 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] (twice), [[2011 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], [[2011 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] (twice), [[2011 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] and [[2011 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]], with the Week 14 loss to San Diego eliminating the team from postseason contention. With the [[2011 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] earning a playoff spot in Week 16, and the [[2011 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] winning the [[AFC South]] in 2011, the Bills took sole possession of the [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|NFL's longest current playoff drought]], at 12 and counting.\n\nThe 2011 losing streak was eventually broken by defeating the [[2011 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] on Christmas Eve, a game that was blacked out in [[Western New York]] due to poor ticket sales. In the first seven games of the season (of which the Bills won five), the Bills had a +9 turnover differential (18 takeaways, 9 giveaways); from Week 9 until the end of the season, the Bills gave the ball away 21 times, with only 12 takeaways. Quarterback [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] started the season strongly, posting a 97.8 [[passer rating]] and a 14/7 touchdown-interception ratio through the first seven games; in the final nine games, Fitzpatrick threw ten touchdowns and 16 interceptions, with a 66.5 quarterback rating in that span. His 23 total interceptions were the most thrown by any quarterback in the league in 2011. He threw only 5 interceptions total in the Bills' six wins and 18 in their ten losses.

showdown with the [[Miami Dolphins]].  Buffalo delivered the game's opening punch in the first quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker [[Dave Rayner]], but the Dolphins answered with quarterback [[Matt Moore (American football)|Matt Moore]] completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Anthony Fasano]], followed by running back [[Reggie Bush]] getting a 5-yard touchdown run.  Miami added onto their lead in the second quarter with Moore completing a 12-yard touchdown pass to fullback [[Charles Clay (American football)|Charles Clay]] and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Davone Bess]].  The Bills would close out the half with a 56-yard field goal from Rayner.\n\nThe Dolphins added onto Buffalo's misery in the third quarter with running back [[Lex Hilliard]] recovering a blocked punt in the endzone for a touchdown.  The Bills tried to rally in the fourth quarter as rookie linebacker [[Kelvin Sheppard]] tackled running back [[Daniel Thomas (running back)|Daniel Thomas]] in the endzone for a safety, but Miami's lead proved to be too much to overcome.\n\nWith the loss, Buffalo fell to 5\u20135.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Week 12====\n\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Bills\n|V1= 7|V2=7 |V3=7 |V4=3\n|Host=Jets\n|H1= 0|H2=14 |H3=7 |H4=7\n|Date=November 27\n|Location=[[MetLife Stadium]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n|StartTime=1:00 p.m.\n|TimeZone=EST\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=79,088\n|Weather={{convert|60|F|C}}, partly cloudy\n|Referee=[[Carl Cheffers]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Marv Albert]] and [[Rich Gannon]]\n|TVStation=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time=1:38 |Team=BUF |Event=[[David Nelson (wide receiver)|David Nelson]] 8 yard pass from [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] ([[Dave Rayner]] kick) |Score= BUF 7\u20130}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=12:02 |Team=NYJ |Event= [[Dustin Keller]] 3 yard pass from [[Mark Sanchez]] ([[Nick Folk]] kick) |Score= Tie 7\u20137}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=2:06 |Team=BUF|Event=[[Stevie Johnson]] 5 yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Rian Lindell kick) |Score= BUF 14\u20137}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=1:03 |Team=NYJ |Event=[[Plaxico Burress]] 14 yard pass from Mark Sanchez (Nick Folk kick) |Score= Tie 14\u201314}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=3:50 |Team=NYJ |Event=Dustin Keller 18 yard pass from Mark Sanchez (Nick Folk kick) |Score=NYJ 21\u201314}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=2:11 |Team=BUF |Event=[[Brad Smith (American football)|Brad Smith]] 36 yard pass from [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] (Dave Rayner kick) |Score= Tie 21\u201321}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=9:46 |Team=BUF |Event=Dave Rayner 53 yard field goal |Score= BUF 24\u201321}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=1:01 |Team=NYJ |Event= [[Santonio Holmes]] 16 yard pass from Mark Sanchez (Nick Folk kick) |Score= NYJ 28\u201324|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55331/NYJ_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Week 13====\n{{See also|2011 Tennessee Titans season}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Titans\n|V1= 10|V2=7 |V3= 3|V4=3\n|Host=Bills\n|H1=7 |H2=3 |H3=0 |H4=7\n|Date=December 4\n|Location=[[Ralph Wilson Stadium]], [[Orchard Park, New York]]\n|StartTime=1:00 p.m.\n|TimeZone=EST\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=56,463\n|Weather={{convert|57|F|C}}, mostly cloudy\n|Referee=[[Alberto Riveron]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Spero Dedes]] and [[Steve Beuerlein]]\n|TVStation=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry= yes|Quarter=Q1|Time=12:27 |Team= TEN|Event=[[Rob Bironas]] 48 yard field goal |Score= TEN 3\u20130}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=7:17 |Team= BUF|Event= [[C.

The Bills improved on their 4\u201312 record from the [[2010 Buffalo Bills season|2010]] season, winning six games; however, the team also missed the playoffs for the twelfth consecutive season; the team had not made the playoffs since [[1999 Buffalo Bills season|1999]], the longest standing playoff drought in the NFL at the time. Buffalo played in the [[AFC East|Eastern]] division of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC).\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\nIn week 3 of the season, the Bills broke a 15-game losing streak that the team had accrued against the [[New England Patriots]] that dated to opening day of the [[2003 Buffalo Bills season|2003 season]]; Buffalo defeated the Patriots, 34\u201331. In doing so, the 2011 Bills became the only team since before 1950 (when comprehensive statistical record keeping began) to win two consecutive games in which they trailed by at least 18 points; they overcame a 21\u20133 deficit to [[Oakland Raiders|Oakland]] in Week 2 and a 21\u20130 deficit to [[New England Patriots|New England]] in Week 3. Incidentally, Buffalo's loss to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] the following week was the Bills' first loss to Cincinnati since the [[1988-89 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Cincinnati Bengals 21, Buffalo Bills 10|1988 AFC Championship game]]; that streak had been the longest winning streak by one team over another after Buffalo snapped their losing streak to New England.\n\nThe Bills started the season with a 5\u20132 record, positioned to make the playoffs, before losing eight of their final nine games, eliminating them from the playoffs. Wide receiver [[Stevie Johnson]] set a franchise mark as the only receiver in Bills history to record two consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. No other Bills receiver \u2013 including [[Andre Reed]], [[James Lofton]], [[Eric Moulds]] or [[Lee Evans (American football)|Lee Evans]] \u2013 had done so. Buffalo's offense only surrendered 23 sacks all season, the fewest in the NFL.<ref>[http://www.buffalorumblings.com/2012/1/10/2693445/buffalo-bills-2011-season-ryan-fitzpatrick 2011 Buffalo Bills: Team Allows Fewest Sacks In NFL]</ref>\n\n===Strong start, weak finish===\nThe Bills were looking to make the playoffs for the first time since 1999, and enjoyed a 3\u20130 start, including a 21-point comeback against the [[2011 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]] in week 3. However, after a dominating Week Eight shutout win over [[2011 Washington Redskins season|Washington]] in [[Bills Toronto Series|Toronto]] (their only victory north of the border, as their Toronto Series was cancelled after the 2013 season), improving the team's record to 5-2, the remainder of the Bills' season was plagued by injuries to key starters. As a result, Buffalo suffered a seven-game losing streak to the [[2011 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] (twice), [[2011 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], [[2011 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] (twice), [[2011 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] and [[2011 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]], with the Week 14 loss to San Diego eliminating the team from postseason contention. With the [[2011 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] earning a playoff spot in Week 16, and the [[2011 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] winning the [[AFC South]] in 2011, the Bills took sole possession of the [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|NFL's longest current playoff drought]], at 12 and counting.\n\nThe 2011 losing streak was eventually broken by defeating the [[2011 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] on Christmas Eve, a game that was blacked out in [[Western New York]] due to poor ticket sales. In the first seven games of the season (of which the Bills won five), the Bills had a +9 turnover differential (18 takeaways, 9 giveaways); from Week 9 until the end of the season, the Bills gave the ball away 21 times, with only 12 takeaways. Quarterback [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] started the season strongly, posting a 97.8 [[passer rating]] and a 14/7 touchdown-interception ratio through the first seven games; in the final nine games, Fitzpatrick threw ten touchdowns and 16 interceptions, with a 66.5 quarterback rating in that span. His 23 total interceptions were the most thrown by any quarterback in the league in 2011. He threw only 5 interceptions total in the Bills' six wins and 18 in their ten losses.

showdown with the [[Miami Dolphins]].  Buffalo delivered the game's opening punch in the first quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker [[Dave Rayner]], but the Dolphins answered with quarterback [[Matt Moore (American football)|Matt Moore]] completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Anthony Fasano]], followed by running back [[Reggie Bush]] getting a 5-yard touchdown run.  Miami added onto their lead in the second quarter with Moore completing a 12-yard touchdown pass to fullback [[Charles Clay (American football)|Charles Clay]] and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Davone Bess]].  The Bills would close out the half with a 56-yard field goal from Rayner.\n\nThe Dolphins added onto Buffalo's misery in the third quarter with running back [[Lex Hilliard]] recovering a blocked punt in the endzone for a touchdown.  The Bills tried to rally in the fourth quarter as rookie linebacker [[Kelvin Sheppard]] tackled running back [[Daniel Thomas (American football)|Daniel Thomas]] in the endzone for a safety, but Miami's lead proved to be too much to overcome.\n\nWith the loss, Buffalo fell to 5\u20135.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Week 12====\n\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Bills\n|V1= 7|V2=7 |V3=7 |V4=3\n|Host=Jets\n|H1= 0|H2=14 |H3=7 |H4=7\n|Date=November 27\n|Location=[[MetLife Stadium]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n|StartTime=1:00 p.m.\n|TimeZone=EST\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=79,088\n|Weather={{convert|60|F|C}}, partly cloudy\n|Referee=[[Carl Cheffers]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Marv Albert]] and [[Rich Gannon]]\n|TVStation=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time=1:38 |Team=BUF |Event=[[David Nelson (wide receiver)|David Nelson]] 8 yard pass from [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] ([[Dave Rayner]] kick) |Score= BUF 7\u20130}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=12:02 |Team=NYJ |Event= [[Dustin Keller]] 3 yard pass from [[Mark Sanchez]] ([[Nick Folk]] kick) |Score= Tie 7\u20137}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=2:06 |Team=BUF|Event=[[Stevie Johnson]] 5 yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Rian Lindell kick) |Score= BUF 14\u20137}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=1:03 |Team=NYJ |Event=[[Plaxico Burress]] 14 yard pass from Mark Sanchez (Nick Folk kick) |Score= Tie 14\u201314}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=3:50 |Team=NYJ |Event=Dustin Keller 18 yard pass from Mark Sanchez (Nick Folk kick) |Score=NYJ 21\u201314}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=2:11 |Team=BUF |Event=[[Brad Smith (American football)|Brad Smith]] 36 yard pass from [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] (Dave Rayner kick) |Score= Tie 21\u201321}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=9:46 |Team=BUF |Event=Dave Rayner 53 yard field goal |Score= BUF 24\u201321}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=1:01 |Team=NYJ |Event= [[Santonio Holmes]] 16 yard pass from Mark Sanchez (Nick Folk kick) |Score= NYJ 28\u201324|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55331/NYJ_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Week 13====\n{{See also|2011 Tennessee Titans season}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Titans\n|V1= 10|V2=7 |V3= 3|V4=3\n|Host=Bills\n|H1=7 |H2=3 |H3=0 |H4=7\n|Date=December 4\n|Location=[[Ralph Wilson Stadium]], [[Orchard Park, New York]]\n|StartTime=1:00 p.m.\n|TimeZone=EST\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=56,463\n|Weather={{convert|57|F|C}}, mostly cloudy\n|Referee=[[Alberto Riveron]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Spero Dedes]] and [[Steve Beuerlein]]\n|TVStation=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry= yes|Quarter=Q1|Time=12:27 |Team= TEN|Event=[[Rob Bironas]] 48 yard field goal |Score= TEN 3\u20130}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=7:17 |Team= BUF|Event= [[C.

A part of the [[Wake County Public School System]], Heritage High School is home to over 1,880 students <ref>https://www.nchsaa.org/sites/default/files/attachments/17-21RealignmentClassifications_11-13-15.pdf</ref> in 9th\u201312th grade.\n\n==History==\n\nHeritage High School opened in 2010 in response to rapid population growth throughout Wake Forest. During the 2009\u20132010 school year, the campus was used by the students and staff of [[Wake Forest High School|Wake Forest-Rolesville High School]] while their campus underwent renovations. When Heritage opened, it was armed with a top-level administration team and well-respected educators from a variety of surrounding high schools, including former [[Wakefield High School (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Wakefield High School]] principal Dr. Mark Savage. Two other Heritage employees of note came from Wakefield: Dean of Students Deirdra Williams and Athletic Director Patrick Kennedy.\n\nWhen Heritage first opened, it was only occupied by students in 9th and 10th grades. In this first year, Heritage trotted out varsity teams in every sport with the exception of football. In the 2011\u20132012 school year, the building was three-fourths occupied due to the addition of another freshman class. The school was finally filled with all four classes in the 2012\u20132013 school year. The 2012-2013 year also marked Heritage's first-ever graduating class.\n\nOn July 19, 2016 the Wake County Public School System announced that Heritage principle Dr. Mark Savage would be promoted to the Western Area Superintendent and former Enloe principal, Mr. Scott Lyons would be moved to Heritage to become the school's second principal.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hui|first1=Keung|title=New principals hired at Enloe High School, Heritage High School|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/wake-ed-blog/article90658667.html|website=The News & Observer|publisher=The News & Observer|accessdate=25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Early accolades===\n\nAfter the first graduating class, Dr. Mark Savage was named [[Wake County Public School System|WCPSS]] Principal of the Year in 2013,<ref>http://www.wral.com/heritage-high-leader-named-wake-principal-of-year/13009154/</ref> an impressive accomplishment for a new high school. The following year, Heritage teacher Allison Reid was named the Wake County Teacher of the Year for her outstanding ability to integrate technology into instruction.<ref>http://www.wral.com/heritage-high-educator-named-wake-teacher-of-the-year/13630773/</ref> In 2016, Miles Macleod, another Heritage educator, was named Wake County Teacher of the Year for his work in establishing a culture of service and global knowledge at the school through the creation of Project Wisdom organization.<ref>http://www.wcpss.net/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&ModuleInstanceID=7209&ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=52278&PageID=1</ref> Heritage became the first Wake County school to ever have two different educators win the award in three years.\n\n== Schedule==\n\nThe school year at Heritage High School starts in late August and ends in early June. The class schedule, commonly referred to as \"block scheduling\", has four different classes each semester, each period being approximately ninety minutes long. This completes a course in one semester instead of one year and provides four new classes in the second semester. Students take exams in mid-January and again in early June.\n\nHeritage High School operates on the three lunch, or A, B, C Lunch system. All lunches are 40 minutes long, and juniors and seniors are permitted to drive off campus.\n\nHeritage High School also uses the Husky Help time period for extra help and instruction.

A part of the [[Wake County Public School System]], Heritage High School is home to over 1,880 students <ref>https://www.nchsaa.org/sites/default/files/attachments/17-21RealignmentClassifications_11-13-15.pdf</ref> in 9th\u201312th grade.\n\n==History==\n\nHeritage High School opened in 2010 in response to rapid population growth throughout Wake Forest. During the 2009\u20132010 school year, the campus was used by the students and staff of [[Wake Forest High School|Wake Forest-Rolesville High School]] while their campus underwent renovations. When Heritage opened, it was armed with a top-level administration team and well-respected educators from a variety of surrounding high schools, including former [[Wakefield High School (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Wakefield High School]] principal Dr. Mark Savage. Two other Heritage employees of note came from Wakefield: Dean of Students Deirdra Williams and Athletic Director Patrick Kennedy.\n\nWhen Heritage first opened, it was only occupied by students in 9th and 10th grades. In this first year, Heritage trotted out varsity teams in every sport with the exception of football. In the 2011\u20132012 school year, the building was three-fourths occupied due to the addition of another freshman class. The school was finally filled with all four classes in the 2012\u20132013 school year. The 2012-2013 year also marked Heritage's first-ever graduating class.\n\nOn July 19, 2016 the Wake County Public School System announced that Heritage principle Dr. Mark Savage would be promoted to the Western Area Superintendent and former Enloe principal, Mr. Scott Lyons would be moved to Heritage to become the school's second principal.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hui|first1=Keung|title=New principals hired at Enloe High School, Heritage High School|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/wake-ed-blog/article90658667.html|website=The News & Observer|publisher=The News & Observer|accessdate=25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Early accolades===\n\nAfter the first graduating class, Dr. Mark Savage was named [[Wake County Public School System|WCPSS]] Principal of the Year in 2013,<ref>http://www.wral.com/heritage-high-leader-named-wake-principal-of-year/13009154/</ref> an impressive accomplishment for a new high school. The following year, Heritage teacher Allison Reid was named the Wake County Teacher of the Year for her outstanding ability to integrate technology into instruction.<ref>http://www.wral.com/heritage-high-educator-named-wake-teacher-of-the-year/13630773/</ref> In 2016, Miles Macleod, another Heritage educator, was named Wake County Teacher of the Year for his work in establishing a culture of service and global knowledge at the school through the creation of Project Wisdom organization.<ref>http://www.wcpss.net/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&ModuleInstanceID=7209&ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=52278&PageID=1</ref> Heritage became the first Wake County school to ever have two different educators win the award in three years.\n\n== Schedule==\n\nThe school year at Heritage High School starts in late August and ends in early June. The class schedule, commonly referred to as \"block scheduling\", has four different classes each semester, each period being approximately ninety minutes long. This completes a course in one semester instead of one year and provides four new classes in the second semester. Students take exams in mid-January and again in early June.\n\nHeritage High School operates on the three lunch, or A, B, C Lunch system. All lunches are 40 minutes long, and juniors and seniors are permitted to drive off campus.\n\nHeritage High School also uses the Husky Help time period for extra help and instruction. For 30 minutes per day students with a C, D, or an F must stay back in their class to receive remediation from their teacher on a more individualized basis. The students with an A or B are allowed to leave the classroom and have 30 free minutes to use as a study hall.\n\nHeritage High School offers numerous Advanced Placement(AP) courses.

Among these, peripatetic nomads are the most neglected and discriminated social group in India.<ref>Customary strangers : new perspectives on peripatetic peoples in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia / edited by Joseph C. Berland and Aparna Rao</ref> They have lost their livelihood because of drastic changes in transport, industries, production, entertainment and distribution systems. They find pastures for their herders\n\n== Historic development ==\n\nNomadic tribes have always been a source of suspicion to [[Sedentism|sedentary]] people. In the colonial period, the British normalized a set of notions about such groups that echoed European ideas about the [[Romani people|gypsies]], whose [[History of the Romani people|origins are in the Indian subcontinent]]. They listed such groups that posed a \u2018threat\u2019 to settled society and introduced a legislative measure, the [[Criminal Tribes Act]] (CTA) in 1871 and as a result of which nearly 200 such communities stood \u2018notified\u2019 as criminal.\n\nThe Targalas or Nayaks have been [[Itinerant groups in Europe|itinerant]] drama troupes in [[Gujarat]] who moved from village to village to perform \u2018[[Bhavai]]\u2019, a [[folk dance]] theatre form. These performers too carry the stigma of criminality. There are numerous folk tales of \u2018the skillful thefts\u2019 allegedly committed by Bhavai troupe members. And if a burglary had taken place in a village where Bhavai had been performed, members of the troupe would be arrested and interrogated. The itinerant Bhavai players have always been expected to report their entry, stay and exit to the village headman.\n\nThe folk dance drama of [[Bhavai]] probably originated in the then Anart Pradesh (now North Gujarat). It then spread over other parts of Gujarat, [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], [[Kutch]] and [[Marvad]] (now [[Rajasthan]]). It has been a popular form of entertainment among the rural and the townsfolk from the 14th century through to the 19th century in the North-west region of India. Although its origin are in the worship of the Mother Goddess, [[Bhavani]], it has gathered secular elements with the passage of time and come to embrace the whole range of human emotions of the rural community. It is to Gujarat what [[Yakshagana]] is to [[Karnataka]], [[Nautanki]] to [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Tamasha]] and [[Lalit (raga)|Lalit]] to [[Maharashtra]] - a veritable folk dance drama.\n\nThe performing Targalas are believed to be the descendants of the poet [[Asait Thakar]] of [[Unjha]] who lived in the 14th century. As the legend goes, Asait was an Audichya Brahmin of [[Unjha]] in North Gujarat. His host Hemala Patel\u2019s daughter Ganga was kidnapped by a Rawal Ratan Singh, Sardar Jahan Roz. Hemala Patel urged Asait Thakar to use his artistic skills to help liberate his daughter from the Sardar. Asait told the Sardar, after pleasing him with his performance and songs that he should liberate the girl, who he claimed was his.\n\nIndian distinguished  from other nomads in India in that they breed animals and this distinguishes them from other groups that which make a living by combining with other itinerant professions such as blacksmithing by [[Gadia Lohar]], or selling salt by the [[Lambadi]].  These pastoral groups are concentrated in certain regions such as the [[semi-arid]] and arid [[Thar Desert|Thar]] desert region and the neighbouring [[salt marsh]]es of [[Kutch]] along the [[Indo-Pakistan border]], the [[alpine climate|alpine]] and [[sub-alpine]] zones above 3200 metres in the [[Himalayas]] forming the states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"dfid.gov.uk\">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/outputs/ZC0181b.pdf</ref>\n\nTypes of livestock kept in mobile pastoral systems include buffaloes, sheep, goats, camels, cattle, donkeys, and [[yaks]] among others. Unlike in the [[Middle East]], where pastoralist are organized in tribes occupying distinct areas, in India pastoralist are integrated in the [[caste]] system, representing [[endogamous group|endogamous]] social units specialising in animal husbandry.<ref name=\"dfid.gov.uk\"/>\n\nIn western India in the [[Kutch]] region, there are a groups of pastoral nomads known as the [[Maldhari]].

In the colonial period, the British normalized a set of notions about such groups that echoed European ideas about the [[Romani people|gypsies]], whose [[History of the Romani people|origins are in the Indian subcontinent]]. They listed such groups that posed a \u2018threat\u2019 to settled society and introduced a legislative measure, the [[Criminal Tribes Act]] (CTA) in 1871 and as a result of which nearly 200 such communities stood \u2018notified\u2019 as criminal.\n\nThe Targalas or Nayaks have been [[Itinerant groups in Europe|itinerant]] drama troupes in [[Gujarat]] who moved from village to village to perform \u2018[[Bhavai]]\u2019, a [[folk dance]] theatre form. These performers too carry the stigma of criminality. There are numerous folk tales of \u2018the skillful thefts\u2019 allegedly committed by Bhavai troupe members. And if a burglary had taken place in a village where Bhavai had been performed, members of the troupe would be arrested and interrogated. The itinerant Bhavai players have always been expected to report their entry, stay and exit to the village headman.\n\nThe folk dance drama of [[Bhavai]] probably originated in the then Anart Pradesh (now North Gujarat). It then spread over other parts of Gujarat, [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], [[Kutch]] and [[Marvad]] (now [[Rajasthan]]). It has been a popular form of entertainment among the rural and the townsfolk from the 14th century through to the 19th century in the North-west region of India. Although its origin are in the worship of the Mother Goddess, [[Bhavani]], it has gathered secular elements with the passage of time and come to embrace the whole range of human emotions of the rural community. It is to Gujarat what [[Yakshagana]] is to [[Karnataka]], [[Nautanki]] to [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Tamasha]] and [[Lalit (raga)|Lalit]] to [[Maharashtra]] - a veritable folk dance drama.\n\nThe performing Targalas are believed to be the descendants of the poet [[Asait Thakar]] of [[Unjha]] who lived in the 14th century. As the legend goes, Asait was an Audichya Brahmin of [[Unjha]] in North Gujarat. His host Hemala Patel\u2019s daughter Ganga was kidnapped by a Rawal Ratan Singh, Sardar Jahan Roz. Hemala Patel urged Asait Thakar to use his artistic skills to help liberate his daughter from the Sardar. Asait told the Sardar, after pleasing him with his performance and songs that he should liberate the girl, who he claimed was his.\n\nIndian distinguished  from other nomads in India in that they breed animals and this distinguishes them from other groups that which make a living by combining with other itinerant professions such as blacksmithing by [[Gadia Lohar]], or selling salt by the [[Lambadi]].  These pastoral groups are concentrated in certain regions such as the [[semi-arid]] and arid [[Thar Desert|Thar]] desert region and the neighbouring [[salt marsh]]es of [[Kutch]] along the [[Indo-Pakistan border]], the [[alpine climate|alpine]] and [[sub-alpine]] zones above 3200 metres in the [[Himalayas]] forming the states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"dfid.gov.uk\">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/outputs/ZC0181b.pdf</ref>\n\nTypes of livestock kept in mobile pastoral systems include buffaloes, sheep, goats, camels, cattle, donkeys, and [[yaks]] among others.
