Jesuit missionaries sent from their Portuguese-held Goa built a Catholic church in Lahore, the first in Punjab, around 1597, two years after being granted permission by emperor Akbar, who had called them to his court in Fatehpur Sikri for religious discussions. This church was later demolished, perhaps during Aurangzeb times. Later on, Christianity was mainly brought by the [[British Raj|British rulers]] of India in the later 18th and 19th&nbsp;century. This is evidenced in cities established by the British, such as the port city of [[Karachi]], where the majestic [[Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Karachi|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], one of Pakistan's largest church, stands, and the churches in the city of [[Rawalpindi]], where the British established a major military cantonment.\n[[File:Trinity church Karachi.JPG|thumb|Holy Trinity Cathedral, Karachi]]\nThe Europeans won{{how|date=June 2014}} small numbers of converts to [[Anglicanism]], [[Methodism]], the [[Lutheran Church]] and [[Catholicism]] from the native populations. [[Islam]] was very strong in the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier Province]], but small native communities of converts to Christianity were formed. The largest numbers came from resident officers of the British Army and the government. European and wealthy native Christians established colleges, churches, hospitals and schools in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and [[Peshawar]]. There is a large Catholic [[Goa]]n community in [[Karachi]] that was established when Karachi's infrastructure was developed by the British before World War II, and the [[Irish people|Irish]] (who were subjects of the British Empire and formed a large part of the British Army) were an important factor in the establishment of Pakistan's Catholic community.\n[[File:Night view of St. Mary's Cathedral & Bishop's House Multan.jpg|thumb|Night view of St Mary's Cathedral & Bishop's House Multan]]\nWhen Pakistan achieved independence in 1947, the organization and activities of the Christian community changed drastically. Christians in [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] had been quite active after 1945 in their support for Muhammad Ali [[Jinnah]]'s [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. Even before the final phase of the movement, leading Indian Christians like [[Pothan Joseph]] had rendered valuable services as journalists and propagandists of the Muslim League.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Jinnah had repeatedly promised all citizens of Pakistan complete equality of citizenship, but this promise was not kept by his successors. Pakistan became an [[Islamic Republic]] in 1956, making [[Islam]] the source of legislation and cornerstone of the national identity, while guaranteeing freedom of religion and equal citizenship to all citizens. In the mass population exchanges that occurred between Pakistan and India upon independence due to conflict between Muslims and followers of [[Indian religions]], most Hindus and nearly all [[Sikh]]s fled the country. [[Pakistani Punjab]] is now over 2% Christian, with very few Hindus left. Christians have made some contributions to the Pakistani national life. Pakistan's first non-Muslim Chief Justice of Pakistan Supreme Court was Justice [[A. R. Cornelius]]. Pakistani Christians also distinguished themselves as great fighter pilots in the [[Pakistan Air Force]]. Notable amongst them are [[Cecil Chaudhry]], Peter O'Reilly and [[Mervyn L Middlecoat]]. Christians have also contributed as educationists, doctors, lawyers and businessmen. One of Pakistan's [[Batting (cricket)|cricketers]], [[Yousuf Youhana]], was born Christian, but later converted to Islam, taking the Islamic name [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]]. In Britain, the bishop emeritus of Rochester [[Michael Nazir-Ali]] is a Pakistani Christian.\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that [[Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority]] (PEMRA) had banned all of the Christian television stations.

In 1971, [[East Pakistan]] became independent as [[Bangladesh]], and the majority of Pakistan's Hindus, who lived in Bangladesh, were severed from Pakistan. Pakistan became a culturally monolithic, increasingly Islamic state, with smaller religious minorities than ever.\n\nWith the governments of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and [[Zia ul-Haq]], more stringently Islamic laws transformed Pakistan. Conversion to other faiths than Islam is not prohibited by law, but culture and social pressures do not favour such conversions. Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|change their faith]] to Christianity, are subject to societal pressure. Extremely controversial were the [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|blasphemy laws]], which made it treacherous for non-Muslims to express themselves without being accused of being un-Islamic. Zia also introduced the [[Sharia]] as a basis for lawmaking, reinforced by [[Nawaz Sharif]] in 1991.

Jesuit missionaries sent from their Portuguese-held Goa built a Catholic church in Lahore, the first in Punjab, around 1597, two years after being granted permission by emperor Akbar, who had called them to his court in Fatehpur Sikri for religious discussions. This church was later demolished, perhaps during Aurangzeb times. Later on, Christianity was mainly brought by the [[British Raj|British rulers]] of India in the later 18th and 19th&nbsp;century. This is evidenced in cities established by the British, such as the port city of [[Karachi]], where the majestic [[Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Karachi|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], one of Pakistan's largest church, stands, and the churches in the city of [[Rawalpindi]], where the British established a major military cantonment.\n[[File:Trinity church Karachi.JPG|thumb|Holy Trinity Cathedral, Karachi]]\nThe Europeans won{{how|date=June 2014}} small numbers of converts to [[Anglicanism]], [[Methodism]], the [[Lutheran Church]] and [[Catholicism]] from the native populations. [[Islam]] was very strong in the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier Province]], but small native communities of converts to Christianity were formed. The largest numbers came from resident officers of the British Army and the government. European and wealthy native Christians established colleges, churches, hospitals and schools in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and [[Peshawar]]. There is a large Catholic [[Goa]]n community in [[Karachi]] that was established when Karachi's infrastructure was developed by the British before World War II, and the [[Irish people|Irish]] (who were subjects of the British Empire and formed a large part of the British Army) were an important factor in the establishment of Pakistan's Catholic community.\n[[File:Night view of St. Mary's Cathedral & Bishop's House Multan.jpg|thumb|Night view of St Mary's Cathedral & Bishop's House Multan]]\nWhen Pakistan achieved independence in 1947, the organization and activities of the Christian community changed drastically. Christians in [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] had been quite active after 1945 in their support for Muhammad Ali [[Jinnah]]'s [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. Even before the final phase of the movement, leading Indian Christians like [[Pothan Joseph]] had rendered valuable services as journalists and propagandists of the Muslim League.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Jinnah had repeatedly promised all citizens of Pakistan complete equality of citizenship, but this promise was not kept by his successors. Pakistan became an [[Islamic Republic]] in 1956, making [[Islam]] the source of legislation and cornerstone of the national identity, while guaranteeing freedom of religion and equal citizenship to all citizens. In the mass population exchanges that occurred between Pakistan and India upon independence due to conflict between Muslims and followers of [[Indian religions]], most Hindus and nearly all [[Sikh]]s fled the country. [[Pakistani Punjab]] is now over 2% Christian, with very few Hindus left. Christians have made some contributions to the Pakistani national life. Pakistan's first non-Muslim Chief Justice of Pakistan Supreme Court was Justice [[A. R. Cornelius]]. Pakistani Christians also distinguished themselves as great fighter pilots in the [[Pakistan Air Force]]. Notable amongst them are [[Cecil Chaudhry]], Peter O'Reilly and [[Mervyn L Middlecoat]]. Christians have also contributed as educationists, doctors, lawyers and businessmen. One of Pakistan's [[Batting (cricket)|cricketers]], [[Yousuf Youhana]], was born Christian, but later converted to Islam, taking the Islamic name [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]]. In Britain, the bishop emeritus of Rochester [[Michael Nazir-Ali]] is a Pakistani Christian.\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that [[Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority]] (PEMRA) had banned all of the Christian television stations.

In 1971, [[East Pakistan]] became independent as [[Bangladesh]], and the majority of Pakistan's Hindus, who lived in Bangladesh, were severed from Pakistan. Pakistan became a culturally monolithic, increasingly Islamic state, with smaller religious minorities than ever.\n\nWith the governments of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and [[Zia ul-Haq]], more stringently Islamic laws transformed Pakistan. Conversion to other faiths than Islam is not prohibited by law, but culture and social pressures do not favour such conversions. Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|change their faith]] to Christianity, are subject to societal pressure. Extremely controversial were the [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|blasphemy laws]], which made it treacherous for non-Muslims to express themselves without being accused of being un-Islamic. Zia also introduced the [[Sharia]] as a basis for lawmaking, reinforced by [[Nawaz Sharif]] in 1991. [[Forced conversion|Coerced conversions]] to Islam from Christianity are a major source of concern for Pakistani Christians, and the minority faces threats, harassment and intimidation tactics from [[extremists]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/28/wpak28.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/04/28/ixworld.html |title=News |work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Discrimination in the Constitution===\n{{See also|Zia-ul Haq's Islamitization}} \nChristians, along with other non-Muslim minorities, are discriminated against in the [[Constitution of Pakistan]].

She received top billing in ''[[Hot Cars]]'' (1956), a crime drama involving a stolen-car racket. In the opening sequence of [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958), she appeared as Zita, the dancer who dies at the end of the famous first tracking shot, during which her character exclaims to a border guard \"I keep hearing this ticking noise inside my head!\"\n\nShe had a brief role as an astronaut's girlfriend in the 1958 science-fiction classic ''[[Queen of Outer Space]]''. She had fourth billing in another sci-fi story, 1959's ''[[The Atomic Submarine]]''. During the 1960s, she starred in short musical films for the [[Scopitone]] video-jukebox system. Her songs included \"The Web of Love\" and \"The Silencer\".\n\nIn 1964, producer Stanley Todd discussed a film project with Lansing, tentatively titled ''Project 22'', with location shooting planned in Yugoslavia, and [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Geraldine Chaplin]] named to the cast. The movie never was made.\n\nLansing played \"Lola\" in the romantic comedy ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]'' (1965) with a cast that included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Deborah Kerr]], and [[Dean Martin]]. Lansing previously had appeared in Sinatra's drama ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' (1959) and in Martin's comedy ''[[Who Was That Lady?]]'' (1960). She turned down the chance to replace Jayne Mansfield in  ''[[The Ice House (1969 film)|The Ice House]]'' (a 1969 horror film), and instead appeared opposite [[Basil Rathbone]] (in his last film appearance) and [[John Carradine]] in ''[[Hillbillys in a Haunted House]]'' (1967), as Mamie Van Doren's replacement. Her last film was ''[[Bigfoot (1970 film)|Bigfoot]]'' (1970).\n\n===Recordings===\nLansing started singing in nightclubs in the early 1960s, and her performances are documented in several trade magazines. She performed with the [[Xavier Cugat]] orchestra and briefly toured with [[Les Paul]], but little is known about songs she actually recorded. Apparently, while starring on ''[[Love That Bob]]'', she recorded a 45 r.p.m. single on the small REO record label in 1957: \"Love Me/What's It Gonna Be\" (REO #1007). In 1962, she recorded six\u2013eight sides at Que Recorders in Los Angeles. These turned up at auction and were acetates of four songs each (with two songs duplicated on the second acetate). It is unknown whether these tracks were released on an album. Both acetates list the same identifying number of #4-8351. The songs recorded on February 23, 1962, were \"Masquerade Is Over\", [[All of You (Cole Porter song)|\"All of You\" (Cole Porter)]], \"The One I Love\" (which was most likely \"[[The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)]]\", and [[Who Cares? (Gershwin song)|\"Who Cares?\" (George and Ira Gershwin)]]. On April 30, 1962, the songs recorded were \"Feel So Young\" (which was probably \"[[You Make Me Feel So Young]]\"), \"[[Dream (1944 song)]]\", \"Masquerade\", and \"All Of You\". It was reported in ''Cashbox'' magazine on April 17, 1965, that Lansing was recording an album for RCA records with [[Jimmie Haskell]] (and suggested that it should be titled ''Joi to the World of Jazz''), but nothing further is known about this project.<ref name=\"glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com\"/>\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Ralph Taeger Joi Lansing Klondike 1960.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Ralph Taeger]] in ''[[Klondike (TV series)|Klondike]]'' (1960)]]\nLansing appeared in ''[[The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok]]'', ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]'', ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[Where's Raymond?]]'', ''[[Noah's Ark (1956 TV series)|Noah's Ark]]'', ''[[State Trooper (TV series)|State Trooper]]'', ''[[The People's Choice (TV series)|The People's Choice]]'', ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]'', ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', ''[[Bat Masterson]]'', ''[[This Man Dawson]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', and had a recurring role in ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Eve Arden: A Chronicle of All Film, Television, Radio and Stage Performances|author=Tucker, D.C.|date=2011|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers|isbn=9780786488100|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R1ONAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA166|page=166|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, she played Vera Payson in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode \"The Case of the Crimson Kiss\".

She received top billing in ''[[Hot Cars]]'' (1956), a crime drama involving a stolen-car racket. In the opening sequence of [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958), she appeared as Zita, the dancer who dies at the end of the famous first tracking shot, during which her character exclaims to a border guard \"I keep hearing this ticking noise inside my head!\"\n\nShe had a brief role as an astronaut's girlfriend in the 1958 science-fiction classic ''[[Queen of Outer Space]]''. She had fourth billing in another sci-fi story, 1959's ''[[The Atomic Submarine]]''. During the 1960s, she starred in short musical films for the [[Scopitone]] video-jukebox system. Her songs included \"The Web of Love\" and \"The Silencer\".\n\nIn 1964, producer Stanley Todd discussed a film project with Lansing, tentatively titled ''Project 22'', with location shooting planned in Yugoslavia, and [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Geraldine Chaplin]] named to the cast. The movie never was made.\n\nLansing played \"Lola\" in the romantic comedy ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]'' (1965) with a cast that included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Deborah Kerr]], and [[Dean Martin]]. Lansing previously had appeared in Sinatra's drama ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' (1959) and in Martin's comedy ''[[Who Was That Lady?]]'' (1960). She turned down the chance to replace Jayne Mansfield in  ''[[The Ice House (1969 film)|The Ice House]]'' (a 1969 horror film), and instead appeared opposite [[Basil Rathbone]] (in his last film appearance) and [[John Carradine]] in ''[[Hillbillys in a Haunted House]]'' (1967), as Mamie Van Doren's replacement. Her last film was ''[[Bigfoot (1970 film)|Bigfoot]]'' (1970).\n\n===Recordings===\nLansing started singing in nightclubs in the early 1960s, and her performances are documented in several trade magazines. She performed with the [[Xavier Cugat]] orchestra and briefly toured with [[Les Paul]], but little is known about songs she actually recorded. Apparently, while starring on ''[[Love That Bob]]'', she recorded a 45 r.p.m. single on the small REO record label in 1957: \"Love Me/What's It Gonna Be\" (REO #1007). In 1962, she recorded six\u2013eight sides at Que Recorders in Los Angeles. These turned up at auction and were acetates of four songs each (with two songs duplicated on the second acetate). It is unknown whether these tracks were released on an album. Both acetates list the same identifying number of #4-8351. The songs recorded on February 23, 1962, were \"Masquerade Is Over\", [[All of You (Cole Porter song)|\"All of You\" (Cole Porter)]], \"The One I Love\" (which was most likely \"[[The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)]]\", and [[Who Cares? (Gershwin song)|\"Who Cares?\" (George and Ira Gershwin)]]. On April 30, 1962, the songs recorded were \"Feel So Young\" (which was probably \"[[You Make Me Feel So Young]]\"), \"[[Dream (1944 song)]]\", \"Masquerade\", and \"All Of You\". It was reported in ''Cashbox'' magazine on April 17, 1965, that Lansing was recording an album for RCA records with [[Jimmie Haskell]] (and suggested that it should be titled ''Joi to the World of Jazz''), but nothing further is known about this project.<ref name=\"glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com\"/>\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Ralph Taeger Joi Lansing Klondike 1960.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Ralph Taeger]] in ''[[Klondike (TV series)|Klondike]]'' (1960)]]\nLansing appeared in ''[[The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok]]'', ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]'', ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[Where's Raymond?]]'', ''[[Noah's Ark (1956 TV series)|Noah's Ark]]'', ''[[State Trooper (TV series)|State Trooper]]'', ''[[The People's Choice (TV series)|The People's Choice]]'', ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]'', ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', ''[[Bat Masterson]]'', ''[[This Man Dawson]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', and had a recurring role in ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Eve Arden: A Chronicle of All Film, Television, Radio and Stage Performances|author=Tucker, D.C.|date=2011|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers|isbn=9780786488100|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R1ONAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA166|page=166|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, she played Vera Payson in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode \"The Case of the Crimson Kiss\".

A message encoded with this type of encryption could be decoded with the fixed number on the Caesar Cipher.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/|title=Caesar Cipher in Cryptography|date=2016-06-02|website=GeeksforGeeks|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>'''\n\nAround 800 A.D., Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]] developed the technique of [[frequency analysis]] - which was an attempt to systematically crack Caesar ciphers.<ref name=\":4\" /> This technique looked at the frequency of letters in the encrypted message to determine the appropriate shift. This technique was rendered ineffective after the creation of the [[Polyalphabetic cipher]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti|Leone Alberti]] in 1465, which incorporated different sets of [[Language|languages]]. In order for frequency analysis to be useful, the person trying to decrypt the message would need to know which language the sender chose.<ref name=\":4\" />\n=== 19th-20th century ===\nAround 1790, [[Thomas Jefferson]] theorized a cipher to encode and decode messages in order to provide a more secure way of military correspondence. The cipher, known today as the Wheel Cipher or the [[Jefferson disk|Jefferson Disk]], although never actually built, was theorized as a spool that could jumble an English message up to 36 characters. The message could be decrypted by plugging in the jumbled message to a receiver with an identical cipher.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/wheel-cipher|title=Wheel Cipher|website=www.monticello.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>'''\n\nA similar device to the Jefferson Disk, the [[M-94]], was developed in 1917 independently by US Army Major Joseph Mauborne.

The Enigma Machine was more complex because unlike the Jefferson Wheel and the M-94, each day the jumble of letters switched to a completely new combination.

[[Authenticated encryption]] algorithms are designed to provide both encryption and integrity protection together. Standards for [[cryptographic software]] and [[Hardware encryption|hardware to perform encryption]] are widely available, but successfully using encryption to ensure security may be a challenging problem. A single error in system design or execution can allow successful attacks. Sometimes an adversary can obtain unencrypted information without directly undoing the encryption. See for example [[traffic analysis]], [[TEMPEST]], or [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/threats/trojans#.VV3oaWDTvfY|title=What is a Trojan Virus - Malware Protection - Kaspersky Lab US}}</ref>\n\nIntegrity protection mechanisms such as [[message authentication code|MACs]] and [[Digital signature|digital signatures]] must be applied to the ciphertext when it is first created, typically on the same device used to compose the message, to protect a message [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end]] along its full transmission path; otherwise, any node between the sender and the encryption agent could potentially tamper with it. Encrypting at the time of creation is only secure if the encryption device itself has correct [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] and has not been tampered with. If an endpoint device has been configured to trust a [[root certificate]] that an attacker controls, for example, then the attacker can both inspect and tamper with encrypted data by performing a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] anywhere along the message's path. The common practice of [[Transport Layer Security#TLS_interception|TLS interception]] by network operators represents a controlled and institutionally sanctioned form of such an attack, but countries have also attempted to employ such attacks as a form of control and censorship.<ref>{{cite article|url=https://thehackernews.com/2019/07/kazakhstan-https-security-certificate.html|title=Kazakhstan Begins Intercepting HTTPS Internet Traffic Of All Citizens Forcefully|first1=Mohit|last1=Kumar|date=July 2019|publisher=The Hacker News}}</ref>\n\n=== Ciphertext length and padding ===\n\n{{main| Padding (cryptography)}}\n\nEven when encryption correctly hides a message's content and it cannot be tampered with at rest or in transit, a message's ''length'' is a form of [[metadata]] that can still leak sensitive information about the message.

The message could be decrypted by plugging in the jumbled message to a receiver with an identical cipher.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/wheel-cipher|title=Wheel Cipher|website=www.monticello.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>'''\n\nA similar device to the Jefferson Disk, the [[M-94]], was developed in 1917 independently by US Army Major Joseph Mauborne.

It is now commonly used in protecting information within many kinds of civilian systems. For example, the [[Computer Security Institute]] reported that in 2007, 71% of companies surveyed utilized encryption for some of their data in transit, and 53% utilized encryption for some of their data in storage.<ref>Robert Richardson, 2008 CSI Computer Crime and Security Survey at 19.[http://i.cmpnet.com/v2.gocsi.com/pdf/CSIsurvey2008.pdf i.cmpnet.com]</ref> Encryption can be used to protect data \"at rest\", such as information stored on computers and storage devices (e.g. [[USB flash drives]]).

Cryptography offers a way of making the erasure almost instantaneous. This method is called [[crypto-shredding]]. An example implementation of this method can be found on [[iOS]] devices, where the cryptographic key is kept in a dedicated '[[wikt:efface|effaceable]] storage'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web|title=Welcome|website=Apple Support}}</ref> Because the key is stored on the same device, this setup on its own does not offer full privacy or security protection if an unauthorized person gains physical access to the device.\n\n== Limitations ==\nEncryption is used in the 21st century to protect digital data and information systems. As computing power increased over the years, encryption technology has only become more advanced and secure. However, this advancement in technology has also exposed a potential limitation of today\u2019s encryption methods.\n\nThe length of the encryption key is an indicator of the strength of the encryption method.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Agrawal|first=Monika|date=May 5, 2012|title=A Comparative Survey on Symmetric Key Encryption Techniques|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.433.2037&rep=rep1&type=pdf|journal=International Journal on Computer Science and Engineering|volume=4|pages=877-882|via=}}</ref> For example, the original encryption key, [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] (Data Encryption Standard), was 56 bits, meaning it had 256 combination possibilities.

For example, RSA encryption utilizes the multiplication of very large prime numbers to create a [[semiprime number]] for its public key.

It would take a super computer anywhere between weeks to months to factor this key.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\nHowever, quantum computing can use [[Quantum algorithm|quantum algorithms]] to factor this semiprime number in the same amount of time it takes for normal computers to generate it.<ref name=\":02\" /> This would make all data protected by current public-key encryption vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Other encryption techniques like [[Elliptic-curve cryptography|elliptic curve cryptography]] and symmetric key encryption are also vulnerable to quantum computing.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nWhile quantum computing could be a threat to encryption security in the future, quantum computing as it currently stands is still very limited.

Most applications of encryption protect information only at rest or in transit, leaving sensitive data in cleartext and potentially vulnerable to improper disclosure during processing, such as by a [[Cloud computing|cloud]] service for example. [[Homomorphic encryption]] and [[secure multi-party computation]] are emerging techniques to compute on encrypted data; these techniques are general and [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]] but incur high computational and/or communication costs.\n\nIn response to encryption of data at rest, cyber-adversaries have developed new types of attacks.

[[Authenticated encryption]] algorithms are designed to provide both encryption and integrity protection together. Standards for [[cryptographic software]] and [[Hardware encryption|hardware to perform encryption]] are widely available, but successfully using encryption to ensure security may be a challenging problem. A single error in system design or execution can allow successful attacks. Sometimes an adversary can obtain unencrypted information without directly undoing the encryption. See for example [[traffic analysis]], [[TEMPEST]], or [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/threats/trojans#.VV3oaWDTvfY|title=What is a Trojan Virus - Malware Protection - Kaspersky Lab US}}</ref>\n\nIntegrity protection mechanisms such as [[message authentication code|MACs]] and [[Digital signature|digital signatures]] must be applied to the ciphertext when it is first created, typically on the same device used to compose the message, to protect a message [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end]] along its full transmission path; otherwise, any node between the sender and the encryption agent could potentially tamper with it. Encrypting at the time of creation is only secure if the encryption device itself has correct [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] and has not been tampered with. If an endpoint device has been configured to trust a [[root certificate]] that an attacker controls, for example, then the attacker can both inspect and tamper with encrypted data by performing a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] anywhere along the message's path. The common practice of [[Transport Layer Security#TLS_interception|TLS interception]] by network operators represents a controlled and institutionally sanctioned form of such an attack, but countries have also attempted to employ such attacks as a form of control and censorship.<ref>{{cite article|url=https://thehackernews.com/2019/07/kazakhstan-https-security-certificate.html|title=Kazakhstan Begins Intercepting HTTPS Internet Traffic Of All Citizens Forcefully|first1=Mohit|last1=Kumar|date=July 2019|publisher=The Hacker News}}</ref>\n\n=== Ciphertext length and padding ===\n\n{{main| Padding (cryptography)}}\n\nEven when encryption correctly hides a message's content and it cannot be tampered with at rest or in transit, a message's ''length'' is a form of [[metadata]] that can still leak sensitive information about the message.

However deciding on how fighting elements would fit in a Dessert-themed series is hard and is not compatible with Pretty Cure or any fighting girls series\" and also stated \"using Animals as a secondary morif could help balance the first motif of the series and is possible with imagination, to actually make the series work than just using Sweets as the series's motif\".

The producers stated that the 5-piece team concept was used after 10 years in order to differentiate it from the previous series, ''[[Maho Girls PreCure!]]'' which uses the \"Buddy Concept\". The motif of the series was decided also by the producers due to the choices are being taken. Producer Yu Kaminoki said that \"Running a Sweets Shop/bakery is one of many girls have dreamed of when they grow up, and that is a good theme for the next series. However deciding on how fighting elements would fit in a Dessert-themed series is hard and is not compatible with Pretty Cure or any fighting girls series\" and also stated \"using Animals as a secondary morif could help balance the first motif of the series and is possible with imagination, to actually make the series work than just using Sweets as the series's motif\". Also, the producer said that \"Animal mofif would extend to the main character, Ichika, who decorates and creates desserts with an animal motif due to her huge imagination.\"<ref name=\"animate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animatetimes.com/news/details.php?id=1485843322&image_share=14|title=\u8089\u5f3e\u6226\u3092\u5c01\u5370\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u63cf\u3051\u308b\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u3089\u3057\u3055\u304c\u3042\u308b\uff01\u3000\u300e\u30ad\u30e9\u30ad\u30e9\u2606\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30a2\u30e9\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u300f\u795e\u6728\u512a\u30d7\u30ed\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\uff06\u66ae\u7530\u516c\u5e73\uff33\uff24\uff06\u8c9d\u6fa4\u5e78\u7537\uff33\uff24\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|publisher=[[Animate]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile discussing the staff, the producer said that Kohei Kureta and Yukio Kaizawa were chosen to direct the series, as a way to lessen the burden in production due to coming up with newer concepts.
