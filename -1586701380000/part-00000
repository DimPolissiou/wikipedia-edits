The redevelopment plan includes footpaths to make the area more pedestrian-friendly for a large number of shoppers and visitors. No motorized traffic will be allowed on Chandni Chowk from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid. Roads are also planned to be decongested and some will be barricaded. People who want to come there will have to use the Ebus. The redevelopment plan was supposed to have been completed before the 2010 Commonwealth Games but has been delayed for various reasons. Delhi government is now pushing it seriously. The redevelopment plan is being implemented under Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. The Plan also includes extra parking for 1500 cars. [30]\n\nAs a part of the redevelopment, a multilevel parking cum commercial complex is coming up at Gandhi Maidan in Chandni Chowk. The project was inaugurated by Union minister of science and technology, Dr. Harshvardhan, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gandhi-maidan-parking-in-delhi-s-chandni-chowk-finally-takes-off/story-ZhEhEN6aQeTRx1a80GpmVP.html|title= Gandhi maidan parking in delhi s chandni chowk finally takes off }}</ref>\n\nThis multilevel parking cum commercial complex would be an eight-storeyed building with three basements covering 18,524 square meter area at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore on a PPP model with a Leading Real estate developer [[Omaxe]] .the project that has a capacity to accommodate over 2,300 cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/breather-for-chandni-chowk-urban-art-body-clears-gandhi-maidan-parking/articleshow/69333159.cms]|title= Breather for Chandni chowk urban art body clears Gandhi maidan parking }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Dariba Kalan]]\n* [[Gali paranthe walee]]\n* [[Jainism in Delhi]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n===Further reading===\n* ''Delhi, the emperor's city: rediscovering Chandni Chowk and its environs'', by Vijay Goel.

Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation [29], under the auspices of the Government of the NCT of Delhi, is the agency carrying out this task. The redevelopment plan includes footpaths to make the area more pedestrian-friendly for a large number of shoppers and visitors. No motorized traffic will be allowed on Chandni Chowk from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid. Roads are also planned to be decongested and some will be barricaded. People who want to come there will have to use the Ebus. The redevelopment plan was supposed to have been completed before the 2010 Commonwealth Games but has been delayed for various reasons. Delhi government is now pushing it seriously. The redevelopment plan is being implemented under Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. The Plan also includes extra parking for 1500 cars. [30]\n\nAs a part of the redevelopment, a multilevel parking cum commercial complex is coming up at Gandhi Maidan in Chandni Chowk. The project was inaugurated by Union minister of science and technology, Dr. Harshvardhan, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gandhi-maidan-parking-in-delhi-s-chandni-chowk-finally-takes-off/story-ZhEhEN6aQeTRx1a80GpmVP.html|title= Gandhi maidan parking in delhi s chandni chowk finally takes off }}</ref>\n\nThis multilevel parking cum commercial complex would be an eight-storeyed building with three basements covering 18,524 square meter area at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore on a PPP model with a Leading Real estate developer [[Omaxe]] .the project that has a capacity to accommodate over 2,300 cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/breather-for-chandni-chowk-urban-art-body-clears-gandhi-maidan-parking/articleshow/69333159.cms]|title= Breather for Chandni chowk urban art body clears Gandhi maidan parking }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Dariba Kalan]]\n* [[Gali paranthe walee]]\n* [[Jainism in Delhi]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n===Further reading===\n* ''Delhi, the emperor's city: rediscovering Chandni Chowk and its environs'', by Vijay Goel.

This was a recumbent motorcycle built in small numbers which is today widely recognised as the first modern feet-forward motorcycle design.\n== Staple Hill today ==\nStaple Hill has a wide-ranging high street and the architecture is largely Victorian with ornate roof ridges and eaves, attractive decorative brickwork and architectural features in stonemasonry.

Senegal is bordered by [[Mauritania]] in [[Mauritania\u2013Senegal border|the north]], [[Mali]] to [[Mali\u2013Senegal border|the east]], [[Guinea]] to [[Guinea\u2013Senegal border|the southeast]], and [[Guinea-Bissau]] to [[Guinea-Bissau\u2013Senegal border|the southwest]]. Senegal also [[Gambia\u2013Senegal border|surrounds]] [[The Gambia]], a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the [[Gambia River]], which separates Senegal's southern region of [[Casamance]] from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with [[Cape Verde]]. Senegal's economic and political capital is [[Dakar]].\n\nIt is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential republic]] and is the westernmost country in the mainland of the [[Old World]], or [[Afro-Eurasia]].<ref>Janet H. Gritzner, Charles F. Gritzner \u2013 2009, Senegal \u2013 Page 8</ref> It owes its name to the [[Senegal River]] which borders it to the east and north.

Alternatively, the name could derive from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] phrase \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"our boat.\"\n\n== Cultures and influences ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since [[prehistory]]. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the [[Jolof Empire]]. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, [[phosphate]] mining, fertilizer production, [[petroleum]] refining, construction materials, and ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[green bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[melon]]s, and [[mango]]es.<ref name=fas/> Owing to its relative stability, tourism and hospitality are also burgeoning sectors.\n\nWith it being a multiethnic and secular nation, Senegal is predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] with [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[traditional African religion|animist]] influences. French is the [[official language]], although many native languages are spoken and recognized. Since April 2012, Senegal's president has been [[Macky Sall]]. Senegal has been a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Senegal}}\n\n===Early and pre-colonial eras===\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: [[Takrur]] in the 9th century, {{ILL|Namandiru|wo}} and the [[Jolof Empire]] during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the [[Ghana Empire]].\n\nIslam was introduced through [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] contact with the [[Almoravid dynasty]] of the [[Maghreb]], who in turn propagated it with the help of the Almoravids, and Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.<ref>Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847\u20131914'', p. 7, Edinburgh University Press (1968) {{ISBN|0-8047-0621-2}}</ref><ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation Sereer, Pangool,'' p. 13.

Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of [[Mali]]) each proclaimed independence.\n\n[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]] was Senegal's first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet and philosopher who personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, \"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\".

However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group ([[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] or MFDC) in the [[Casamance]] region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the [[Casamance conflict]]. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President [[Macky Sall]] held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012.<ref>[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=135&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa# \"[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]: Senegal: Casamance, In-depth Developments since 2005\"], ''Conflict Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader [[Abdoulaye Wade]] defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented.

Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. [[Marabout]]s, religious leaders of the various [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal]], have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency.

The Senegalese military force receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States. Germany also provides support but on a smaller scale.\n\nMilitary noninterference in political affairs has contributed to Senegal's stability since independence. Senegal has participated in many international and regional peacekeeping missions.

Other Islamic groups include the much older Q\u0101diriyya order and the Senegalese [[Layene|Laayeen]] order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu. Today, most Senegalese children study at ''daara''s for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can.

[[Chicken as food|Chicken]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[pea]]s, [[Egg (food)|eggs]], and [[beef]] are also used in Senegalese cooking, but not [[pork]], due to the nation's largely [[Muslim]] population. [[Peanut]]s, the primary crop of Senegal, as well as [[couscous]], [[white rice]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[lentil]]s, [[black-eyed pea]]s and various vegetables, are also incorporated into many recipes. Meats and vegetables are typically stewed or marinated in herbs and spices, and then poured over rice or couscous, or eaten with bread.\n\nPopular fresh juices are made from [[Hibiscus|bissap]], [[ginger]], ''buy'' (pronounced 'buoy', which is the fruit of the [[Adansonia digitata|baobab]] tree, also known as \"monkey bread fruit\"), [[mango]], or other fruit or wild trees (most famously [[soursop]], which is called ''corossol'' in French). Desserts are very rich and sweet, combining native ingredients with the extravagance and style characteristic of the French impact on Senegal's culinary methods. They are often served with fresh fruit and are traditionally followed by [[coffee]] or [[tea]].\n\n===Music===\n{{Further|Music of Senegal}}\n[[File:Solo cissokho DSC 0448.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Kora (instrument)|Kora]] player from Senegal]]\nSenegal is known across Africa for its musical heritage, due to the popularity of [[mbalax]], which originated from the Serer [[percussion instrument|percussive]] tradition especially the [[Njuup]], it has been popularized by [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Omar Pene]] and others.

({{lang-fr|link=no|R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal}}; [[Wolof language|Wolof]]: R\u00e9ewum Senegaal), is a country in [[West Africa]]. Senegal is bordered by [[Mauritania]] in [[Mauritania\u2013Senegal border|the north]], [[Mali]] to [[Mali\u2013Senegal border|the east]], [[Guinea]] to [[Guinea\u2013Senegal border|the southeast]], and [[Guinea-Bissau]] to [[Guinea-Bissau\u2013Senegal border|the southwest]]. Senegal also [[Gambia\u2013Senegal border|surrounds]] [[The Gambia]], a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the [[Gambia River]], which separates Senegal's southern region of [[Casamance]] from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with [[Cape Verde]]. Senegal's economic and political capital is [[Dakar]].\n\nIt is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential republic]] and is the westernmost country in the mainland of the [[Old World]], or [[Afro-Eurasia]].<ref>Janet H. Gritzner, Charles F. Gritzner \u2013 2009, Senegal \u2013 Page 8</ref> It owes its name to the [[Senegal River]] which borders it to the east and north. Senegal covers a land area of almost {{convert|197000|km2}} and has an population of around {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Senegal}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} The climate is typically [[Sahel]]ian, though there is a [[Wet season|rainy season]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\"Senegal\" is probably from a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] transliteration of the name of the [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] also known as the [[Sanhaja]],<ref name=fas>{{Cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/africa/senegal/articles/the-real-story-behind-senegals-name/|title=The Real Story Behind Senegal\u2019s Name|first=Beetle|last=Holloway|website=Culture Trip}}</ref> or a combination of the supreme deity in {{w|Serer religion}} (''Rog Sene'') and ''o gal'' meaning ''body of water'' in the [[Serer language]]. Alternatively, the name could derive from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] phrase \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"our boat.\"\n\n== Cultures and influences ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since [[prehistory]]. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the [[Jolof Empire]]. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, [[phosphate]] mining, fertilizer production, [[petroleum]] refining, construction materials, and ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[green bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[melon]]s, and [[mango]]es.<ref name=fas/> Owing to its relative stability, tourism and hospitality are also burgeoning sectors.\n\nWith it being a multiethnic and secular nation, Senegal is predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] with [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[traditional African religion|animist]] influences. French is the [[official language]], although many native languages are spoken and recognized. Since April 2012, Senegal's president has been [[Macky Sall]]. Senegal has been a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Senegal}}\n\n===Early and pre-colonial eras===\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: [[Takrur]] in the 9th century, {{ILL|Namandiru|wo}} and the [[Jolof Empire]] during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the [[Ghana Empire]].\n\nIslam was introduced through [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] contact with the [[Almoravid dynasty]] of the [[Maghreb]], who in turn propagated it with the help of the Almoravids, and Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.<ref>Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847\u20131914'', p. 7, Edinburgh University Press (1968) {{ISBN|0-8047-0621-2}}</ref><ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation Sereer, Pangool,'' p. 13. Dakar, Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1990), {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was [[Slavery in Africa|enslaved]], typically as a result of captives taken in warfare.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 \"Slavery\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Guide to Black History'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |date=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century the Jolof Empire grew more powerful, having united [[Cayor]] and the kingdoms of [[Baol]], [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]], [[Waalo]], [[Futa Tooro]] and [[Bambouk]], or much of present-day West Africa.

French and British diplomacy in the area were thrown into disarray.\n\n===Independence (1960)===\nOn 4 April 1959 Senegal and the [[French Sudan]] merged to form the [[Mali Federation]], which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of a transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of [[Mali]]) each proclaimed independence.\n\n[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]] was Senegal's first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet and philosopher who personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, \"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\". Pro-African, he advocated a brand of African socialism.<ref>''A Critical bibliography of French literature: in three parts. The Twentieth.'' Edited by David Clark Cabeen, Richard A.

Former prime minister [[Mamadou Dia]], who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 96.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Boubacar Lam]] discovered Senegalese oral history that was initially compiled by the [[Toucouleur people|Tuculor]] noble, [[Yoro Dy\u00e2o]], not long after [[World War I]], which documented migrations into [[West Africa]] from the [[Nile Valley]]; ethnic groups, from the [[Senegal River]] to the [[Niger Delta]], retained traditions of having an eastern origin.<ref name=\"AfrAm\">{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Jane |title=A Companion to African-American Studies |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=463 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODmpx1fgJNIC&pg=PA463|isbn=978-1-4051-5466-6}}</ref>\n\nSenegal joined with [[The Gambia]] to form the nominal [[Senegambia Confederation]] on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group ([[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] or MFDC) in the [[Casamance]] region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the [[Casamance conflict]]. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President [[Macky Sall]] held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012.<ref>[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=135&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa# \"[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]: Senegal: Casamance, In-depth Developments since 2005\"], ''Conflict Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader [[Abdoulaye Wade]] defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet yielded a resolution.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of Senegal}}\n[[File:Macky Sall - 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Macky Sall]], President of Senegal (2012\u2013present)]]\n[[File:Abdoulaye Wade in 16-05-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdoulaye Wade]], President of Senegal (2000\u20132012)]]\n\nSenegal is a [[republic]] with a presidency; the president is [[Elections in Senegal|elected]] every five years as of 2016, previously being seven years from independence to 2001, five years from 2001 to 2008, and 7 years again from 2008 to 2016,  by adult voters. The first president, [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]], was a poet and writer, and was the first African elected to the ''Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise''. Senegal's second president, [[Abdou Diouf]], later served as general secretary of the ''Organisation de la Francophonie''. The third president was [[Abdoulaye Wade]], a lawyer.

The [[unicameral]] parliament consists of the [[National Assembly of Senegal|National Assembly]], which has 150&nbsp;seats (a [[Senate (Senegal)|Senate]] was in place from 1999 to 2001 and 2007 to 2012).<ref name=cia>{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=CIA |work=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Senegal |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html |year=2009|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> An independent judiciary also exists in Senegal. The nation's highest courts that deal with business issues are the constitutional council and the court of justice, members of which are named by the president.\n\n===Political culture===\nCurrently, Senegal has a quasi-democratic political culture, one of the more successful post-colonial democratic transitions in Africa. Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. [[Marabout]]s, religious leaders of the various [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal]], have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency. In 2009, [[Freedom House]] downgraded Senegal's status from \"Free\" to \"Partially Free\", based on increased centralisation of power in the executive. By 2014, it had recovered its Free status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/senegal-0#.VEWVY_nF-So|title=Senegal - Country report - Freedom in the World - 2014|website=Freedomhouse.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Senegal finished in 12th position on the [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]].<ref name=\"ibrahim_index\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/section/the-ibrahim-index |title=The Ibrahim Index \u00bb Mo Ibrahim Foundation |publisher=Moibrahimfoundation.org |accessdate=3 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229141051/http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/section/the-ibrahim-index |archivedate=29 December 2011 }}</ref> The Ibrahim Index is a comprehensive measure of African governance (limited to [[sub-Saharan Africa]] until 2008), based on a number of different variables which reflect the success with which governments deliver essential political goods to their citizens.

Friendly to the West, especially to France and to the [[United States]], Senegal also is a vigorous proponent of more assistance from developed countries to the [[Third World]].\n\nSenegal enjoys mostly cordial relations with its neighbors. In spite of clear progress on other fronts with [[Mauritania]] (border security, resource management, economic integration, etc.), an estimated 35,000 Mauritanian refugees (of the estimated 40,000 who were expelled from their home country in 1989) remain in Senegal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2014/05/mauritanian-refugees-refuse-leave-senegal-20145872721336117.html|title=Mauritanian refugees refuse to leave Senegal|date=8 May 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera}}</ref>\n\nSenegal is part of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).

The Senegalese military force receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States. Germany also provides support but on a smaller scale.\n\nMilitary noninterference in political affairs has contributed to Senegal's stability since independence. Senegal has participated in many international and regional peacekeeping missions. Most recently, in 2000, Senegal sent a battalion to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] to participate in [[MONUC]], the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping mission, and agreed to deploy a United States-trained battalion to [[Sierra Leone]] to participate in [[UNAMSIL]], another UN peacekeeping mission.\n\nIn 2015, Senegal participated in the Saudi Arabian-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Houthis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Senegal to send 2,100 troops to join Saudi-led alliance|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/04/us-yemen-saudi-senegal-idUSKBN0NP1N920150504|date=4 May 2015|agency=Reuters}}</ref>\n\n===Law===\nSenegal is a secular state, as defined in its [[Constitution of Senegal|Constitution]].<ref name=\"Constitution of Senegal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/sn/sn014en.pdf|title=Constitution of Senegal (Article 1)|accessdate=4 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930153624/http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/sn/sn014en.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo fight corruption, the government has created the National Anti-Corruption Office (OFNAC) and the Commission of Restitution and Recovery of Illegally Acquired Assets.

In Murid communities, which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies, the term ''daara'' often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader. Other Islamic groups include the much older Q\u0101diriyya order and the Senegalese [[Layene|Laayeen]] order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu. Today, most Senegalese children study at ''daara''s for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can. Some of them continue their religious studies at councils (''majlis'') or at the growing number of private Arabic schools and publicly funded Franco-Arabic schools.\n\nSmall Roman Catholic communities are mainly found in coastal Serer, [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Mankanya people|Mankanya]] and Balant populations, and in eastern Senegal among the Bassari and Coniagui. The Protestant churches are mainly attended by immigrants but during the second half of the 20th century Protestant churches led by Senegalese leaders from different ethnic groups have evolved.

[[Peanut]]s, the primary crop of Senegal, as well as [[couscous]], [[white rice]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[lentil]]s, [[black-eyed pea]]s and various vegetables, are also incorporated into many recipes. Meats and vegetables are typically stewed or marinated in herbs and spices, and then poured over rice or couscous, or eaten with bread.\n\nPopular fresh juices are made from [[Hibiscus|bissap]], [[ginger]], ''buy'' (pronounced 'buoy', which is the fruit of the [[Adansonia digitata|baobab]] tree, also known as \"monkey bread fruit\"), [[mango]], or other fruit or wild trees (most famously [[soursop]], which is called ''corossol'' in French).

He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Cosmology and philosophy ==\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Aramazd]]\n\n==== Chaos and Order ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]]. According to the faith, in the beginning was the Ar, which was the creating force of the reality.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] principle begetting the universe, the universal ideal and a conscience.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} According to Hetanists, ''Ar'' is the life-giving word root,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} and it is the origin of words like, for instance, ''art'' (\"arable\", \"cultivation\"; culture, art), ''aryyun'' (\"blood\"), ''argand'' (\"womb\"), ''armat'' (\"root\"), ''arka'' (\"king\"), ''ara'' (\"male\"), ''Arev'' (the Sun), ''Ara'' (manifested Ar), ''Ari'' (acting with Ar), ''Chari'' (opposing Ar).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=115|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=271}} The \"essence of things\" and their \"perfection\" is represented by ''[[swastika]]'' motifs.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nThere are two universal states of reality - Chaos and Order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://grapaharan.org/%D5%80%D5%AB%D5%B6_%D5%B0%D5%A1%D5%BE%D5%A1%D5%BF%D6%84_%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%B4_%D5%B0%D5%A5%D5%A9%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%B8%D5%BD%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%B6_%D5%AF%D6%80%D5%B8%D5%B6%D6%84_%D5%B0%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%B8%D6%81|title=\u0540\u056b\u0576 \u0570\u0561\u057e\u0561\u057f\u0584 \u056f\u0561\u0574 \u0570\u0565\u0569\u0561\u0576\u0578\u057d\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u056f\u0580\u0578\u0576\u0584 \u0570\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0581 \u2014 \u0533\u0580\u0561\u057a\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576|website=grapaharan.org|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Every chaos has a bit of order inside it and every order has a bit of chaos in it, therefore neither chaos nor order can exist stably forever. Thus, it is illogical to strive to create an eternal order - it is logically impossible, and ultimately will only create an illusion of order. Hetanists see the meaning of life and the way to escape the endless cycles of order and chaos in confronting the chaos personally and \"taming\" it, thus ensuring perfect harmony and stability in the universe and personal life of Hetanists.

That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between order and chaos unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while chaos, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn And Mihr(who is born again) bring the order back.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n== Deities ==\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar.

He was called almighty and all-father. His temple was in Kamakh, Ani province, which also was a grave for Armenian kings of the [[Artaxiad|artaxiad dynasty of Armenia.]] Along with his son and daughter Anahit and Vahagn, he constituted the holy triad of Hetanism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=NyzDrkPG2nIC&pg=PA797&dq=Anahit&hl=en&ei=eEwFTZncGs-dOt6zyaYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Anahit&f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art|date=October 2001|publisher=Adegi Graphics LLC|isbn=978-1-4021-9433-7|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Anahit ===\nDaughter of Aramazd.

It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live.

A mountain in [[Sophene]] district was known as Anahit's throne (''Athor Anahta''). The entire district of Erez, in the province of Akilisene (Ekeghiats), was called ''Anahtakan Gavar''.\n\nAccording to [[Plutarch]], the temple of Erez was the wealthiest and the noblest in Armenia.   During the expedition of [[Mark Antony]] in Armenia, the statue was broken to pieces by the Roman soldiers. [[Pliny the Elder]] gives us the following story about it: The Emperor [[Augustus]], being invited to dinner by one of his generals, asked him if it were true that the wreckers of Anahit's statue had been punished by the wrathful goddess. \"No!\" answered the general, \"on the contrary, I have to\u2011day the good fortune of treating you with one part of the hip of that gold statue.\" The Armenians erected a new golden statue of Anahit in Erez, which was worshiped before the time of [[Gregory the Illuminator|St. Gregory Illuminator]].<ref name=\"Leeming\"/>\n\nThe annual festivity of the month [[Navasard]], held in honor of Anahit, was the occasion of great gatherings, attended with dance, music, recitals, competitions, etc. The sick went to the temples in pilgrimage, asking for recovery. The symbol of ancient Armenian medicine was the head of the bronze gilded statue of the goddess Anahit.\n\n=== Vahagn ===\nVahagn, somestimes known as Aray or Demetr, was the third God of the pantheon, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun. He is the dying and reborning God, who is born from the union of water and fire, soil and the sky.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=NyzDrkPG2nIC&pg=PA797|title=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art|date=October 2001|publisher=Adegi Graphics LLC|isbn=978-1-4021-9433-7|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHe is the most popular Armenian God and is a notable figure in the armenian consicene even nowadays.\n\nIt is said that Vahagn fought and conquered dragons, hence his title Vishabakagh, \"dragon reaper\", where dragons in Armenian lore are identified as \"[[Vishap]]s\". He was invoked as a god of courage, later identified with Heracles.\n\nThe Vahagnian song was sung to the accompaniment of the lyre by the bards of Goghten (modern Akulis), long after the conversion of Armenia to Christianity.\n\nThe stalk or reed, key to the situation, is an important word in Indo-European mythology, in connection with fire in its three forms. Vahagn was linked to [[Verethragna]], the hypostasis of victory in the texts of the [[Avesta]]; the name turned into Vahagn (the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] \"th\" becoming \"h\" in [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] [[Middle Persian]]), later on to take the form of Vahagn. See \u054e\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0563\u0576 for more on the origin of the name.\n\nThe name of the Armenian princely house of [[Vahevuni]]s is believed to derive from Vahagn. The Vahevunis were ranked high in the Royal Register of Armenia, recorded by King [[Valarshak]]. In pre-Christian Armenia, the Vahevunis hereditarily possessed the temple town of [[Ashtishat]] on the left bank of the [[Aratzani]] river and most likely also held the post of the [[Sparapet]], ''i.e.'', the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armenian Army.<ref name=\"Leeming\"/>\n\nGaregin Njdeh, an armenian national hero, is considered a reincarnation of Vahagn.\n\n====== Astghik ======\nAstghik was the lover of Vahagn and was considered his polar opposite. She was the goddess of love and water. According to folk tradition, Vahagn met Astghik in the field of Ararat. Their marriage was a blessing for the earth, and soon holy rain started pouring from the sky fertilizing the lands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/agathangelos/en/AGATHANGELOS.html|title=AGATHANGELOS, History of St. Gregory and the Conversion of Armenia|website=www.vehi.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nHer name is the diminutive of Armenian \u0561\u057d\u057f\u0572 ''''ast\u0142'''' , meaning ''\"[[star]]\"'', and all star goddesses were originally called Night goddesses including the morning and evening star (Venus) which from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *h\u2082st\u1e17r is [[cognate]] to Sanskrit ''st\u1e5b\u0301'', Avestan ''star'', Pahlavi ''star'', Persian ''set\u0101r'', [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: ast\u1e17r etc.\n\nHer principal seat was in [[Ashtishat]] (Taron), located to the North from [[Mu\u015f]], where her chamber was dedicated to the name of [[Vahagn]], the personification of a sun-god, her lover or husband according to popular tales, and had been named \"Vahagn's bedroom\".\n\nOther temples and places of worship of Ast\u0142ik had been located in various towns and villages, such as the mountain of [[Palaty]] (to the South-West from [[Lake Van]]), in [[Artamet]] (12&nbsp;km from Van), etc.\n\nThe unique monuments of prehistoric Armenia, [[vishap]] \"dragon stones\" (Arm. vi\u0161ap 'serpent, water dragon'), spread in many provinces of historical Armenia \u2013 Gegharkunik, Aragatsotn, Javakhk, Tayk, etc., and are additional manifestations of her worship.\n\n=== Nane ===\nGoddess of War, Nane was depicted as a young beautiful woman in the clothing of a warrior, with spear and shield in hand\n\nIt is however known that in Ancient Armenia, it was traditional for Kings to meet with the oldest woman in their dynasty because she was often seen as the epitome of Nane. In Armenia and other countries around the world, the name Nane continues to be used not only as a personal name, but also as a nickname for the grandmother of the household. ''Nanna, Nani, Nannan, etc''\n\nThe [[temple]] of the goddess Nane was in the town of Thil across from the Lycus River. Her temple was destroyed during the Christianization of Armenia.\n\n=== Mihr ===\nMihr is somtimes considered to be out of the pantheon, as he has a special status as a sun-God. Together with Vahagn, he brings the world from chaos into order. \n\nMihr is the root of many Armenian proper names such as Mihran, Mihrdat and Mehruzhan. The Armenian hetanist temple Mehian also has the same source. The month of February was dedicated to Mihr and it was called Mehekan. In 301 A.D. Christianity became the official religion of Armenia, and the Armenian church adopted many hetanist rites and ceremonies. For example, the Christian fire-festival of [[Trndez]], which has hetanist roots is still celebrated in February, the month dedicated to Mihr.\n\nAramazd, Vahagn and Anahit together constituted the holy trinity of the hetanist religion. Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Spandaramet ===\nSpandaramet was the manifestation of the underworld, which, unlike in western traditions, was considered root of life and not death.\n\nSpandaramet was the guardian spirit of the land and the vines, the latter meaning, the Christian writers of the fifth century Armenians used to translate this name Dionysius. By associating Spandaramet with the [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]], this word was used as a synonym for Hades, an idea that already appeared in other mythologies of [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself. These holy trees are adorned with ribbons and handkerchiefs symbolising one's requests to the gods.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}}\n\nBesides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the [[Metsamor Castle]] (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, the [[Erebuni Fortress]] (eighth century BCE), [[Shengavit Settlement|Shengavit]] (fourth to second millennium BCE) and [[Zorats Karer]] (third millennium BCE), and the mountains.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}} Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\n=== Holidays ===\nThe Arordiners celebrate a number of holidays:{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} Terendez, Zatik, Hambardzum, [[Vardavar]] and Khaghoghorhnek. To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\n== Poetry and legends ==\nSeveral hetanist legends and poems have survived till our days.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on 11 August 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the Assyrian queen.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n\n[[Category:Hetanism]]\n[[Category:Religion in ancient history]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n", "text_old": "<noinclude>{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=Hetanism|2=Talk:Armenian Native Faith#Requested move 10 April 2020 }}</noinclude>\n{{short description|Armenian Pre-Christian faith}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Sidebar with collapsible lists\n|name = Hetanism sidebar\n|bodyclass = plainlist\n|pretitle = Part of [[:Category:Hetanism|a series]] on\n|title = [[Hetanism]]\n|image = [[File:Left-Facing Armenian Eternity Sign UC 058E SVG.svg|150px|Arevakhach, symbol of Hetanism]]\n|caption = ''[[Arevakhach]]'', primary symbol of Hetanism\n|listtitlestyle = color:#ffffff; background-color:#800\n|contentclass = hlist \n\n|list1name = Primary\n|list1title = Main Conceptions\n|content1 =\n|list1 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Ar (hetanism)|Ar]]\n*[[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos vs. Order]]\n*[[Fire worship]]\n*[[List of water deities|Water worship]]\n*[[Monotheism]] with [[Polytheism|Polytheistic]] characteristics\n*[[Tseghakron]]\n*[[Armenian mythology]]\n*[[Monarchism]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list2name = Divine\n|list2title = Divine entities\n|list2 = {{startflatlist}}\n* [[Aramazd]]\n* [[Hayk]]\n* [[Anahit]]\n* [[Vahagn]]\n* [[Tir]]\n* [[Mihr]]\n* [[Vanatur]]\n* [[Ara the Beautiful]]\n* [[Turk\u2018 Ange\u0142|Turk-angel]]\n* [[Nane]]\n* [[Astghik]]\n* [[Spandaramet]]\n* [[Barshamin]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list3name = Scripture and worship\n|list3title = Scripture and worship\n|list3 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Ukhtagirq]]\n*[[Vardavar]]\n*[[Matagh]]\n*[[Knunk]]\n*[[Garni Temple]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list4name = Accounts and legends\n|list4title = Accounts and legends\n|list4 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Ughtagirk]]\n*[[Movses Khorenatsi]]\n*[[Anania Shirakatsi]]\n*[[Ara the Beautiful]]\n*[[Hayk and Bel]]\n*[[Birth of Vahagn]]\n*[[Creation myth]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list5name = History and culture\n|list5title = History and culture\n|list5 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Haldi]]sm\n*[[Matagh]]\n*[[Armenian calendar]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|list7name = Related topics\n|list7title = Related topics\n|list7 = {{startflatlist}}\n*[[Zoroastrianism in Armenia]]\n*[[Kingdom of Armenia]]\n*[[Tseghakronism]]\n{{endflatlist}}\n\n|below = {{portal-inline|Religion}}\n\n}}\n'''Hetanism''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0540\u0565\u0569\u0561\u0576\u0578\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576 ''Hetanosutiwn'') or '''Armenian native faith''', was the dominant<ref name=\"Romeny 2010\">{{Cite book|last=Romeny|first=R.

He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Cosmology and philosophy ==\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Aramazd]]\n\n==== Chaos and Order ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]].

Thus, it is illogical to strive to create an eternal order - it is logically impossible, and ultimately will only create an illusion of order. Hetanists see the meaning of life and the way to escape the endless cycles of order and chaos in confronting the chaos personally and \"taming\" it, thus ensuring perfect harmony and stability in the universe and personal life of Hetanists.

That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between order and chaos unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while chaos, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn And Mihr(who is born again) bring the order back.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n== Deities ==\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar.

He was called almighty and all-father.

It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live.

A mountain in [[Sophene]] district was known as Anahit's throne (''Athor Anahta''). The entire district of Erez, in the province of Akilisene (Ekeghiats), was called ''Anahtakan Gavar''.\n\nAccording to [[Plutarch]], the temple of Erez was the wealthiest and the noblest in Armenia.   During the expedition of [[Mark Antony]] in Armenia, the statue was broken to pieces by the Roman soldiers. [[Pliny the Elder]] gives us the following story about it: The Emperor [[Augustus]], being invited to dinner by one of his generals, asked him if it were true that the wreckers of Anahit's statue had been punished by the wrathful goddess. \"No!\" answered the general, \"on the contrary, I have to\u2011day the good fortune of treating you with one part of the hip of that gold statue.\" The Armenians erected a new golden statue of Anahit in Erez, which was worshiped before the time of [[Gregory the Illuminator|St. Gregory Illuminator]].<ref name=\"Leeming\"/>\n\nThe annual festivity of the month [[Navasard]], held in honor of Anahit, was the occasion of great gatherings, attended with dance, music, recitals, competitions, etc. The sick went to the temples in pilgrimage, asking for recovery. The symbol of ancient Armenian medicine was the head of the bronze gilded statue of the goddess Anahit.\n\n=== Vahagn ===\nVahagn, somestimes known as Aray or Demetr, was the third God of the pantheon, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun. He is the dying and reborning God, who is born from the union of water and fire, soil and the sky.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=NyzDrkPG2nIC&pg=PA797|title=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art|date=October 2001|publisher=Adegi Graphics LLC|isbn=978-1-4021-9433-7|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHe is the most popular Armenian God and is a notable figure in the armenian consicene even nowadays.\n\nIt is said that Vahagn fought and conquered dragons, hence his title Vishabakagh, \"dragon reaper\", where dragons in Armenian lore are identified as \"[[Vishap]]s\". He was invoked as a god of courage, later identified with Heracles.\n\nThe Vahagnian song was sung to the accompaniment of the lyre by the bards of Goghten (modern Akulis), long after the conversion of Armenia to Christianity.\n\nThe stalk or reed, key to the situation, is an important word in Indo-European mythology, in connection with fire in its three forms. Vahagn was linked to [[Verethragna]], the hypostasis of victory in the texts of the [[Avesta]]; the name turned into Vahagn (the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] \"th\" becoming \"h\" in [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] [[Middle Persian]]), later on to take the form of Vahagn. See \u054e\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0563\u0576 for more on the origin of the name.\n\nThe name of the Armenian princely house of [[Vahevuni]]s is believed to derive from Vahagn. The Vahevunis were ranked high in the Royal Register of Armenia, recorded by King [[Valarshak]]. In pre-Christian Armenia, the Vahevunis hereditarily possessed the temple town of [[Ashtishat]] on the left bank of the [[Aratzani]] river and most likely also held the post of the [[Sparapet]], ''i.e.'', the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armenian Army.<ref name=\"Leeming\"/>\n\nGaregin Njdeh, an armenian national hero, is considered a reincarnation of Vahagn.\n\n====== Astghik ======\nAstghik was the lover of Vahagn and was considered his polar opposite. She was the goddess of love and water. According to folk tradition, Vahagn met Astghik in the field of Ararat. Their marriage was a blessing for the earth, and soon holy rain started pouring from the sky fertilizing the lands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/agathangelos/en/AGATHANGELOS.html|title=AGATHANGELOS, History of St. Gregory and the Conversion of Armenia|website=www.vehi.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nHer name is the diminutive of Armenian \u0561\u057d\u057f\u0572 ''''ast\u0142'''' , meaning ''\"[[star]]\"'', and all star goddesses were originally called Night goddesses including the morning and evening star (Venus) which from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *h\u2082st\u1e17r is [[cognate]] to Sanskrit ''st\u1e5b\u0301'', Avestan ''star'', Pahlavi ''star'', Persian ''set\u0101r'', [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: ast\u1e17r etc.\n\nHer principal seat was in [[Ashtishat]] (Taron), located to the North from [[Mu\u015f]], where her chamber was dedicated to the name of [[Vahagn]], the personification of a sun-god, her lover or husband according to popular tales, and had been named \"Vahagn's bedroom\".\n\nOther temples and places of worship of Ast\u0142ik had been located in various towns and villages, such as the mountain of [[Palaty]] (to the South-West from [[Lake Van]]), in [[Artamet]] (12&nbsp;km from Van), etc.\n\nThe unique monuments of prehistoric Armenia, [[vishap]] \"dragon stones\" (Arm. vi\u0161ap 'serpent, water dragon'), spread in many provinces of historical Armenia \u2013 Gegharkunik, Aragatsotn, Javakhk, Tayk, etc., and are additional manifestations of her worship.\n\n=== Nane ===\nGoddess of War, Nane was depicted as a young beautiful woman in the clothing of a warrior, with spear and shield in hand\n\nIt is however known that in Ancient Armenia, it was traditional for Kings to meet with the oldest woman in their dynasty because she was often seen as the epitome of Nane. In Armenia and other countries around the world, the name Nane continues to be used not only as a personal name, but also as a nickname for the grandmother of the household. ''Nanna, Nani, Nannan, etc''\n\nThe [[temple]] of the goddess Nane was in the town of Thil across from the Lycus River. Her temple was destroyed during the Christianization of Armenia.\n\n=== Mihr ===\nMihr is somtimes considered to be out of the pantheon, as he has a special status as a sun-God. Together with Vahagn, he brings the world from chaos into order. \n\nMihr is the root of many Armenian proper names such as Mihran, Mihrdat and Mehruzhan. The Armenian hetanist temple Mehian also has the same source. The month of February was dedicated to Mihr and it was called Mehekan. In 301 A.D. Christianity became the official religion of Armenia, and the Armenian church adopted many hetanist rites and ceremonies. For example, the Christian fire-festival of [[Trndez]], which has hetanist roots is still celebrated in February, the month dedicated to Mihr.\n\nAramazd, Vahagn and Anahit together constituted the holy trinity of the hetanist religion. Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Spandaramet ===\nSpandaramet was the manifestation of the underworld, which, unlike in western traditions, was considered root of life and not death.\n\nSpandaramet was the guardian spirit of the land and the vines, the latter meaning, the Christian writers of the fifth century Armenians used to translate this name Dionysius. By associating Spandaramet with the [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]], this word was used as a synonym for Hades, an idea that already appeared in other mythologies of [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself. These holy trees are adorned with ribbons and handkerchiefs symbolising one's requests to the gods.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}}\n\nBesides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the [[Metsamor Castle]] (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, the [[Erebuni Fortress]] (eighth century BCE), [[Shengavit Settlement|Shengavit]] (fourth to second millennium BCE) and [[Zorats Karer]] (third millennium BCE), and the mountains.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}} Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\n=== Holidays ===\nThe Arordiners celebrate a number of holidays:{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} Terendez, Zatik, Hambardzum, [[Vardavar]] and Khaghoghorhnek. To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\n== Poetry and legends ==\nSeveral hetanist legends and poems have survived till our days.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on 11 August 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the Assyrian queen.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n\n[[Category:Hetanism]]\n[[Category:Religion in ancient history]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Native_Faith"}
