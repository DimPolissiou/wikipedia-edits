Between 1998 and 2007 they played in Minsk Oblast championship.\nIn 2008, they joined [[Belarusian Second League]]. In 2010, they finished in second place and were granted a promotion to [[Belarusian First League|First League]] in 2011. In early 2011 the team changed its name to '''Slutsk'''.\n\n==Online Popularity==\nIn early 2020, FC Slutsk became subject to an influx of international support. This was a result of the cancellation of various football leagues during the outbreak of Coronavirus COVID-19. Whilst the Belarusian Premier League continued, football fans around the world flocked to watch the only available games. The creation of Facebook group 'FK Slutsk Worldwide', originating from Australia, excelled this popularity and resulted in FC Slutsk striker Artem Serdyuk joining the page.\n\n==Current squad==\n''As

On January 25, 1850, the Fort Wayne and Bluffton Plank Road Company was then organized. The plank road was a toll road; any horse or [[horse-drawn vehicle]] had to pay a toll. The Fort Wayne, Cincinnati, & Louisville Railroad was built through Ossian in 1869, though it was not in complete operation until the following year. Today, the railroad is a significant north-south route for the [[Norfolk Southern Corporation]]. Ossian is still served by [[Indiana State Road 1]], while four miles north is [[Interstate 469]], the beltway around [[Fort Wayne]], and also just seven miles south of [[Fort Wayne International Airport]].\n\nA 25-foot tall grain silo was painted to look like a [[Minions (Despicable Me)|minion]] from the [[Despicable Me]] movie on a nearby rural farm in 2016.

1843, [[Indiana State Road 1]] was made serviceable from [[Fort Wayne]] to [[Bluffton, Indiana|Bluffton]]. On January 25, 1850, the Fort Wayne and Bluffton Plank Road Company was then organized. The plank road was a toll road; any horse or [[horse-drawn vehicle]] had to pay a toll. The Fort Wayne, Cincinnati, & Louisville Railroad was built through Ossian in 1869, though it was not in complete operation until the following year. Today, the railroad is a significant north-south route for the [[Norfolk Southern Corporation]]. Ossian is still served by [[Indiana State Road 1]], while four miles north is [[Interstate 469]], the beltway around [[Fort Wayne]], and also just seven miles south of [[Fort Wayne International Airport]].\n\nA 25-foot tall grain silo was painted to look like a [[Minions (Despicable Me)|minion]] from the [[Despicable Me]] movie on a nearby rural farm in 2016.

This included the disputed areas of western New Mexico northward to Wyoming. After statehood, 128 counties were carved out of its area.\n\nThe county was named for San Antonio de B\u00e9xar, one of the 23 Mexican municipalities (administrative divisions) of Texas at the time of its independence. San Antonio de B\u00e9xar\u2014originally ''Villa de San Fernando de B\u00e9xar''\u2014was the first civil government established by the Spanish in the [[Spanish Texas|province of Texas]]. Specifically, the municipality was created in 1731 when 55 [[Canary Islands|Canary Islanders]] settled near the system of [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] that had been established around the source of the [[San Antonio River]]. The new settlement was named after the ''[[Presidio San Antonio de Bexar|Presidio]]'' San Antonio de B\u00e9jar, the Spanish military outpost that protected the missions. The presidio, located at the [[San Pedro Springs]], was founded in 1718 and named for [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 1st Duke of Ari\u00f3n|Viceroy Balthasar Manuel de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Guzm\u00e1n Sotomayor y Sarmiento]], second son of the Duke of [[B\u00e9jar]] (a town in Spain).

This included the disputed areas of western New Mexico northward to Wyoming. After statehood, 128 counties were carved out of its area.\n\nThe county was named for San Antonio de B\u00e9xar, one of the 23 Mexican municipalities (administrative divisions) of Texas at the time of its independence. San Antonio de B\u00e9xar\u2014originally ''Villa de San Fernando de B\u00e9xar''\u2014was the first civil government established by the Spanish in the [[Spanish Texas|province of Texas]]. Specifically, the municipality was created in 1731 when 55 [[Canary Islands|Canary Islanders]] settled near the system of [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] that had been established around the source of the [[San Antonio River]]. The new settlement was named after the ''[[Presidio San Antonio de Bexar|Presidio]]'' San Antonio de B\u00e9jar, the Spanish military outpost that protected the missions. The presidio, located at the [[San Pedro Springs]], was founded in 1718 and named for [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 1st Duke of Ari\u00f3n|Viceroy Balthasar Manuel de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Guzm\u00e1n Sotomayor y Sarmiento]], second son of the Duke of [[B\u00e9jar]] (a town in Spain). The modern city of San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas also derived its name from San Antonio de B\u00e9jar.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1256|sqmi}}, of which {{cvt|1240|sqmi}} is land and {{cvt|16|sqmi}} (1.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web |url= http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_48.txt |publisher= United States Census Bureau |accessdate=April 19, 2015 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> Bexar County is in south-central Texas, about 190 miles (305&nbsp;km) west of [[Houston]] and {{cvt|140|miles}} from both the US-Mexican border to the southwest and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the southeast.\n\nThe [[Balcones Fault|Balcones Escarpment]] bisects the county from west to northeast; to the north of the escarpment are the rocky hills, springs and canyons of the [[Texas Hill Country]]. South of the escarpment are [[Texas blackland prairies|Blackland Prairie]] and the South Texas plains. The [[San Antonio River]] rises from springs north of [[Downtown San Antonio]], and flows southward and southeastward through the county.\n\n===Major highways===\n[[File:Highway281South.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 281 South, San Antonio, Bexar County]]\nBexar County has a comprehensive \"wagon wheel\" freeway system, with radial freeways and beltways that encircle Downtown San Antonio, allowing for simplified countywide freeway access, in a manner much like the freeways around Houston or Dallas.

But it left me with no scars whatever; it just sort of vanished.\" He said about his current beliefs that \"God is the greatest imaginary being of all time.

A year later Boorman was executive producer on Jordan's first feature ''[[Angel (1982 Irish film)|Angel]]'', a tale of a musician caught up in the Troubles played by [[Stephen Rea]] who has subsequently appeared in almost all of Jordan's films to date. During the 1980s, he directed films that won him acclaim, including ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' and ''[[Mona Lisa (1986 film)|Mona Lisa]]'', both made in England. ''The Company of Wolves'', a dark and sexually-themed reimagining of the [[Little Red Riding Hood]] fairy tale based on short stories by [[Angela Carter]], became a cult favorite.\n\nAs a writer/director, Jordan has a highly idiosyncratic body of work, ranging from mainstream hits like ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' to commercial failures like ''[[We're No Angels (1989 film)|We're No Angels]]'' to a variety of more personal, low-budget [[arthouse]] pictures. He was also the driving force behind the cable TV series ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]''.\n[[File:Neil Jordan.4756.jpg|thumb|left|Neil Jordan at the German premiere of ''The Brave One'', 2007]]\n\nUnconventional sexual relationships are a recurring theme in Jordan's work, and he often finds a sympathetic side to characters that audiences would traditionally consider deviant or downright horrifying. His film ''[[The Miracle (1991 film)|The Miracle]]'', for instance, followed two characters who struggled to resist a strong, incestuous attraction. ''[[The Vampire Chronicles|Interview with the Vampire]]'', like the [[Anne Rice]] book it was based on, focused on the intense, intimate interpersonal relationship of two undead men who murder humans nightly (although the pair never have sex, they are clearly lovers of a sort), accompanied by an equally lusty vampire woman who is eternally trapped in the body of a little girl. While Lestat ([[Tom Cruise]]) is depicted in an attractive but villainous manner, his partner Louis ([[Brad Pitt]]) and the child vampire Claudia ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) are meant to capture the audience's sympathy despite their predatory nature. In the remake of ''[[The End of the Affair]]'', two people ([[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Julianne Moore]]) engage in a love affair that will end as suddenly as it started, with both not wanting its end.\n\nIn addition to the unusual sexuality of Jordan's films, he frequently returns to the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] of [[Northern Ireland]]. ''The Crying Game'' and ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'' both concern a transgender character (played by [[Jaye Davidson]] and [[Cillian Murphy]], respectively), both concern the Troubles, and both feature frequent Jordan leading man Stephen Rea. The two films, however, are very different, with ''Crying Game'' being a realistic thriller/romance and ''Breakfast on Pluto'' a much more episodic, stylized, darkly comic biography. Jordan also frequently tells stories about children or young people, such as ''The Miracle'' and ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]''. While his pictures are most often grounded in reality, he occasionally directs more fantastic or dreamlike films, such as ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'', ''[[High Spirits (film)|High Spirits]],'' ''Interview with the Vampire''  and ''[[In Dreams (film)|In Dreams]]''.\n\n[[File:Alicja Bachleda, Colin Farrell & Neil Jordan by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|Jordan with [[Alicja Bachleda-Curu\u015b]] and [[Colin Farrell]] at the ''[[Ondine (film)|Ondine]]'' premiere, 2010 Tribeca Film Festival in New York]]\nThe critical success of Jordan's early pictures led him to Hollywood, where he directed ''[[High Spirits (film)|High Spirits]]'' and ''[[We're No Angels (1989 film)|We're No Angels]]''; both were critical and financial disasters.

While his pictures are most often grounded in reality, he occasionally directs more fantastic or dreamlike films, such as ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'', ''[[High Spirits (film)|High Spirits]],'' ''Interview with the Vampire''  and ''[[In Dreams (film)|In Dreams]]''.\n\n[[File:Alicja Bachleda, Colin Farrell & Neil Jordan by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|Jordan with [[Alicja Bachleda-Curu\u015b]] and [[Colin Farrell]] at the ''[[Ondine (film)|Ondine]]'' premiere, 2010 Tribeca Film Festival in New York]]\nThe critical success of Jordan's early pictures led him to Hollywood, where he directed ''[[High Spirits (film)|High Spirits]]'' and ''[[We're No Angels (1989 film)|We're No Angels]]''; both were critical and financial disasters. He later returned home to make the more personal ''[[The Crying Game]]'', which was nominated for six Academy Awards.
