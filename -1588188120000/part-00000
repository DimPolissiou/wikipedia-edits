Additional factors included Russian goals of recovering territorial losses endured during the [[Crimean War]] of 1853\u201356, re-establishing itself in the [[Black Sea]] and supporting the political movement attempting to free Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Russian-led coalition won the war, pushing the Turks back all the way to the gates of Constantinople but for the timely intervention of the western European great powers.\n\nAs a result, Russia succeeded in claiming provinces in the Caucasus, namely [[Kars Oblast |Kars]] and [[Batum Oblast |Batum]], and also annexed the [[Budjak]] region. The principalities of [[United Principalities |Romania]], [[Principality of Serbia| Serbia]], and [[Principality of Montenegro| Montenegro]], each of which had had ''de facto'' sovereignty for some time, formally proclaimed independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After almost five centuries of Ottoman domination (1396\u20131878), a Bulgarian state  re-emerged: the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], covering the land between the [[Danube]] River and the [[Balkan Mountains]] (except Northern [[Dobrudja]] which was given to Romania), as well as the region of [[Sofia]], which became the new state's capital. The [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 also allowed [[Austria-Hungary]] to [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina |occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] to take over [[Cyprus]].\n\nThe initial [[Treaty of San Stefano]], signed on 3 March 1878, is today celebrated on [[Liberation Day]] in Bulgaria,<ref>{{cite book|title= Labour Law in Bulgaria|first= Vasil|last= Mr\u016dchkov|p= 120|publisher= Kluwer Law International|year= 2011|isbn= 978-9-041-13616-9}}</ref> although the occasion somewhat fell out of favour during years of Communist rule.<ref>\n{{cite book|title= Nationalism from the Left: The Bulgarian Communist Party During the Second World War and the Early Post-War Years|first= Yannis|last= Sygkelos|p= 220|publisher= Brill|year= 2011|isbn= 978-9-004-19208-9}}\n</ref>\n\n==Conflict pre-history==\n=== Treatment of Christians in the Ottoman Empire ===\nArticle 9 of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|1856 Paris Peace Treaty]], concluded at the end of the [[Crimean War]], obliged the Ottoman Empire to grant Christians equal rights with Muslims.

Although local level relations between communities were often good, this practice encouraged exploitation.

In southern [[Lebanon]], where Maronite peasants worked for Druze overlords, Druze peasants sided with their overlords against the Maronites, transforming the conflict into a [[1860 Druze-Christian conflict in Lebanon|civil war]]. Although both sides suffered, about 10,000 Maronites were [[massacre]]d at the hands of the Druze.<ref name=\"countrystudies.us\">{{Citation | url = http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/74.htm | title = Country Studies | contribution = Lebanon | place = US | publisher = Library of Congress | year = 1994}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=cdl;idno=cdl324 | page = 219 | title = The Druzes and the Maronites under the Turkish rule from 1840 to 1860 | first = C | last = Churchill | place = London | publisher = B Quaritch | year = 1862}}.</ref>\n\nUnder the threat of European intervention, Ottoman authorities restored order.

Christian attacks on Muslims in Beirut stirred the Muslim population of [[Damascus]] to attack the Christian minority with between 5,000 and 25,000 of the latter being killed,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} including the [[United States of America|American]] and [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] consuls, giving the event an international dimension.\n\nOttoman foreign minister [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha]] came to Syria and solved the problems by seeking out and executing the culprits, including the governor and other officials. Order was restored, and preparations made to give Lebanon new autonomy to avoid European intervention. Nevertheless, in September 1860 France sent a fleet, and Britain joined to prevent a unilateral intervention that could help increase French influence in the area at Britain's expense.{{Sfn | Shaw | Shaw | 1977 | pp = 142\u201343}}\n\n====The revolt in Crete, 1866\u20131869====\n[[File:MoniArkadiou2.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Moni Arkadiou]] monastery]]\nThe [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u201369)|Cretan Revolt]], which began in 1866, resulted from the failure of the Ottoman Empire to apply reforms for improving the life of the population and the Cretans' desire for [[enosis]] \u2014 union with [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robson|first1=Maureen M.|title=Lord Clarendon and the Cretan Question, 1868-9|journal=The Historical Journal|date=1960|volume=3|issue=1|pages=38\u201355|doi=10.1017/S0018246X00023001}}</ref> The insurgents gained control over the whole island, except for five fortified cities where the Muslims took refuge. The Greek press claimed that Muslims had massacred Greeks and the word was spread throughout Europe. Thousands of Greek volunteers were mobilized and sent to the island.\n\nThe siege of [[Moni Arkadiou]] monastery became particularly well known. In November 1866, about 250 Cretan Greek combatants and around 600 women and children were besieged by about 23,000 mainly Cretan Muslims aided by Ottoman troops, and this became widely known in Europe. After a bloody battle with a large number of casualties on both sides, the Cretan Greeks finally surrendered when their ammunition ran out but were killed upon surrender.<ref>{{Citation | last = Stillman | first = William James | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11594/11594.txt | title = The Autobiography of a Journalist | volume = II | publisher = The Project Gutenberg | format = ebook | date = March 15, 2004 | id = [[eBook#11594]]}}.</ref>\n\nBy early 1869, the insurrection was suppressed, but [[Ottoman Porte|the Porte]] offered some concessions, introducing island self-rule and increasing Christian rights on the island. Although the Cretan crisis ended better for the Ottomans than almost any other diplomatic confrontation of the century, the insurrection, and especially the brutality with which it was suppressed, led to greater public attention in Europe to the oppression of Christians in the Ottoman Empire.\n\n{{Quote |Small as the amount of attention is which can be given by the people of England to the affairs of Turkey ... enough was transpiring from time to time to produce a vague but a settled and general impression that the Sultans were not fulfilling the \"solemn promises\" they had made to Europe; that the vices of the Turkish government were ineradicable; and that whenever another crisis might arise affecting the \"independence\" of the Ottoman Empire, it would be wholly impossible to afford to it again the support we had afforded in the [[Crimean war]].{{Sfn | Argyll | 1879 | p = 122}}}}\n\n===Changing balance of power in Europe===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2011}}\n[[File:Territorial changes of the Ottoman Empire 1862.jpg|thumb|right|Ottoman Empire in 1862]]\nAlthough on the winning side in the [[Crimean War]], the Ottoman Empire [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|continued to decline]] in power and prestige. The financial strain on the treasury forced the Ottoman government to take a series of foreign loans at such steep interest rates that, despite all the fiscal reforms that followed, pushed it into unpayable debts and economic difficulties. This was further aggravated by the need to accommodate more than 600,000 Muslim [[Circassians]], expelled by the Russians from the Caucasus, to the Black Sea ports of north Anatolia and the Balkan ports of [[Constan\u0163a]] and [[Varna]], which cost a great deal in money and in civil disorder to the Ottoman authorities.<ref>{{Citation | last = Finkel | first = Caroline | title = The History of the Ottoman Empire | place = New York | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2005 | page = 467}}.</ref>\n\n====The New European Concert====\nThe [[Concert of Europe]] established in 1814 was shaken in 1859 when France and Austria [[Second Italian War of Independence|fought over Italy]]. It came apart completely as a result of the wars of [[German Unification]], when the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], led by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], defeated Austria in 1866 and France in 1870, replacing Austria-Hungary as the dominant power in Central Europe. Britain, worn out by its participation in the Crimean War and diverted by the [[Irish question]] and the social problems created by the [[Industrial Revolution]], chose not to intervene again to restore the European balance. Bismarck did not wish the breakup of the Ottoman Empire to create rivalries that might lead to war, so he took up the Tsar's earlier suggestion that arrangements be made in case the Ottoman Empire fell apart, creating the [[Three Emperors' League]] with Austria and Russia to keep France isolated on the continent.\n\nFrance responded by supporting self-determination movements, particularly if they concerned the three emperors and the Sultan. Thus revolts in Poland against Russia and national aspirations in the Balkans were encouraged by France. Russia worked to regain its right to maintain a fleet on the Black Sea and vied with the French in gaining influence in the Balkans by using the new [[Pan-Slavic]] idea that all Slavs should be united under Russian leadership. This could be done only by destroying the two empires where most non-Russian Slavs lived, the Habsburg and the Ottoman Empires. The ambitions and the rivalries of the Russians and French in the Balkans surfaced in Serbia, which was experiencing its own national revival and had ambitions that partly conflicted with those of the great powers.{{Sfn | Shaw | Shaw | 1977 | p = 146}}\n\n====Russia after the Crimean War====\n[[File:Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Gorchakov]]]]\n\nRussia ended the Crimean War with minimal territorial losses, but was forced to destroy its [[Black Sea Fleet]] and [[Sevastopol]] fortifications. Russian international prestige was damaged, and for many years revenge for the Crimean War became the main goal of Russian foreign policy. This was not easy though \u2014 the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Treaty]] included guarantees of Ottoman territorial integrity by Great Britain, France and Austria; only Prussia remained friendly to Russia.\n\nThe newly appointed Russian chancellor, [[Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov|Alexander Gorchakov]] depended upon alliance with Prussia and its chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]. Russia consistently supported Prussia in her wars with [[Second Schleswig War|Denmark (1864)]], [[Austro-Prussian War|Austria (1866)]] and [[Franco-Prussian War|France (1870)]]. In March 1871, using the crushing French defeat and the support of a grateful Germany, Russia achieved [[Commissions of the Danube River#London Conference of 1871|international recognition]] of its earlier denouncement of Article 11 of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Treaty]], thus enabling it to revive the [[Black Sea Fleet]].\n\nOther clauses of the Paris Peace Treaty, however, remained in force, specifically Article 8 with guarantees of Ottoman territorial integrity by Great Britain, France and Austria. Therefore, Russia was extremely cautious in its relations with the Ottoman Empire, coordinating all its actions with other European powers. A Russian war with Turkey would require at least the tacit support of all other Great Powers, and Russian diplomacy was waiting for a convenient moment.\n\n==Balkan crisis of 1875\u20131876==\nThe state of Ottoman administration in the Balkans continued to deteriorate throughout the 19th century, with the central government occasionally losing control over whole provinces. Reforms imposed by European powers did little to improve the conditions of the Christian population, while managing to dissatisfy a sizable portion of the Muslim population. [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] suffered at least two waves of rebellion by the local Muslim population, the most recent in 1850.\n\nAustria consolidated after the turmoil of the first half of the century and sought to reinvigorate its longstanding policy of expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the nominally autonomous, de facto independent principalities of Serbia and Montenegro also sought to expand into regions inhabited by their compatriots. Nationalist and [[irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments were strong and were encouraged by Russia and her agents. At the same time, a severe drought in Anatolia in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent in the heart of the Empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare bankruptcy in October, 1875 and increase taxes on outlying provinces including the Balkans.\n\n===Albanian revolts===\nFranklin Parker states that the Albanian highlanders resented new taxes and reformations, they fought against the Ottomans in the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parker |first1=Franklin |last2=Parker |first2=Betty June |title=Reforms cost money, and the Kosovars resented new taxes and conscription.

By August almost all of Herzegovina had been seized and the revolt had spread into Bosnia. Supported by nationalist volunteers from Serbia and Montenegro, the uprising continued as the Ottomans committed more and more troops to suppress it.\n\n====Bulgarian Uprising====\n{{Main|April Uprising}}\n\nThe revolt of Bosnia and Herzegovina spurred Bucharest-based Bulgarian revolutionaries into action. In 1875, a Bulgarian uprising was hastily prepared to take advantage of Ottoman preoccupation, but it fizzled before it started. In the spring of 1876, another uprising erupted in the south-central Bulgarian lands despite the fact that there were numerous regular Turkish troops in those areas.\n\nA special Turkish military committee was established to quell the uprising.

Widespread sympathy for the Bulgarian cause led to a nationwide surge in patriotism on a scale comparable with the one during the [[French invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]]. From autumn 1875, the movement to support the Bulgarian uprising involved all classes of Russian society. This was accompanied by sharp public discussions about Russian goals in this conflict: [[Slavophile]]s, including [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], saw in the impending war the chance to unite all Orthodox nations under Russia's helm, thus fulfilling what they believed was the historic mission of Russia, while their opponents, [[westernizer]]s, inspired by [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], denied the importance of religion and believed that Russian goals should not be defense of Orthodoxy but liberation of Bulgaria.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.libfl.ru/win/nbc/books/bolgaria.html |first=\u0412\u041c |last=\u0425\u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 |script-title=ru:\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f: \"\u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u2014 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\" |publisher=Lib FL |place=[[Russia|RU]] |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028062618/http://www.libfl.ru/win/nbc/books/bolgaria.html |archivedate=October 28, 2007 }}.</ref>\n\n===Serbo-Turkish War and diplomatic maneuvering===\n{{Main|Serbo-Turkish War (1876\u201378)|Constantinople Conference|Expulsion of the Albanians 1877\u20131878}}\n[[File:Serio-comic war map for 1877.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.25|Serio-comic war map for 1877.

In July and August, the ill-prepared and poorly equipped Serbian army helped by Russian volunteers failed to achieve offensive objectives but did manage to repulse the Ottoman offensive into Serbia. Meanwhile, Russia's [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]] met [[Austria-Hungary]]'s [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] and [[Julius Andrassy|Count Andr\u00e1ssy]] in the [[Z\u00e1kupy|Reichstadt]] castle in [[Bohemia]]. No written agreement was made, but during the discussions, Russia agreed to support Austrian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and [[Austria-Hungary]], in exchange, agreed to support the return of Southern [[Bessarabia]]\u2014lost by Russia during the [[Crimean War]]\u2014and Russian annexation of the port of [[Batumi|Batum]] on the east coast of the [[Black Sea]]. Bulgaria was to become autonomous (independent, according to the Russian records).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.diphis.ru/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=100#3 | title = History of world diplomacy 15th century BC \u2013 1940 AD | last = Potemkin | first = VP | place = [[Russia|RU]] | publisher = Diphis}}.</ref>\n\nAs the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued, Serbia suffered a string of setbacks and asked the European powers to mediate an end to the war. A joint ultimatum by the European powers forced the Porte to give Serbia a one-month truce and start peace negotiations. Turkish peace conditions however were refused by European powers as too harsh. In early October, after the truce expired, the Turkish army resumed its offensive and the Serbian position quickly became desperate. On October 31, Russia issued an ultimatum requiring the Ottoman Empire to stop the hostilities and sign a new truce with Serbia within 48 hours. This was supported by the partial mobilization of the Russian army (up to 20 divisions). The Sultan accepted the conditions of the ultimatum.\n\nTo resolve the crisis, on December 11, 1876, the [[Constantinople Conference]] of the Great Powers was opened in Constantinople (to which the Turks were not invited). A compromise solution was negotiated, granting autonomy to [[Bulgaria]], Bosnia and Herzegovina under the joint control of European powers. The Ottomans, however, refused to sacrifice their independence by allowing international representatives to oversee the institution of reforms and sought to discredit the conference by announcing on December 23, the day the conference was closed, that a [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|constitution]] was adopted that declared equal rights for religious minorities within the Empire. The Ottomans attempted to use this manoeuver to get their objections and amendments to the agreement heard. When they were rejected by the Great Powers, the Ottoman Empire announced its decision to disregard the results of the conference.\n\nOn January 15, 1877, Russia and Austria-Hungary signed a written agreement confirming the results of an earlier [[Reichstadt Agreement]] in July 1876. This assured Russia of the benevolent neutrality of Austria-Hungary in the impending war. These terms meant that in case of war Russia would do the fighting and Austria would derive most of the advantage. Russia therefore made a final effort for a peaceful settlement. After reaching an agreement with its main Balkan rival and with anti-Ottoman sympathies running high throughout Europe due to the Bulgarian atrocities and the rejection of the Constantinople agreements, Russia finally felt free to declare war.\n\n==Course of the war==\n{{See also|Romanian War of Independence}}\n\n===Opening manoeuvres===\n[[File:\u041d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0443\u043d\u044b, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043a \u043f\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0435 \u043a \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0443 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0410\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f 3 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 1877 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430.jpg|thumb|Dragoons of Nizhny Novgorod pursuing the Turks near [[Kars]], 1877, painting by [[Aleksey Kivshenko]]]]\n\nRussia declared war on the Ottomans on 24 April 1877 and its troops entered Romania through the newly built [[Eiffel Bridge, Ungheni|Eiffel Bridge]] near Ungheni, on the Prut river. On April 12, 1877, Romania gave permission to the Russian troops to pass through its territory to attack the Turks, resulting in Turkish bombardments of Romanian towns on the Danube. On May 10, 1877, the [[Principality of Romania]], which was under formal Turkish rule, declared its independence.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/cronologieen.html | title = Chronology of events from 1856 to 1997 period relating to the Romanian monarchy | publisher = Kent State University | place = Ohio | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230042922/http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/cronologieen.html | archivedate = 2007-12-30 }}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, the outcome was far from obvious. The Russians could send a larger army into the Balkans: about 300,000 troops were within reach. The Ottomans had about 200,000 troops on the Balkan peninsula, of which about 100,000 were assigned to fortified garrisons, leaving about 100,000 for the army of operation. The Ottomans had the advantage of being fortified, complete command of the Black Sea, and patrol boats along the [[Danube]] river.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://archive.org/details/warineastillustr00scheiala | title = The War in the East: An illustrated history of the Conflict between Russia and Turkey with a Review of the Eastern Question | year = 1878 | author-link = Alexander Jacob Schem | last = Schem | first = Alexander Jacob}}.</ref> They also possessed superior arms, including new British and American-made rifles and German-made artillery.\n\n[[File:Pereprava cherez Dunaj.jpg|thumb|left|Russian crossing of the Danube, June 1877, painting by [[Nikolai Dmitriev-Orenburgsky]], 1883]]\n\nIn the event, however, the Ottomans usually resorted to passive defense, leaving the strategic initiative to the Russians, who, after making some mistakes, found a winning strategy for the war. The Ottoman military command in Constantinople made poor assumptions about Russian intentions. They decided that Russians would be too lazy to march along the Danube and cross it away from the delta, and would prefer the short way along the [[Black Sea]] coast. This would be ignoring the fact that the coast had the strongest, best supplied and garrisoned Turkish fortresses. There was only one well manned fortress along the inner part of the river Danube, [[Vidin]]. It was garrisoned only because the troops, led by Osman Pasha, had just taken part in defeating the Serbs in their recent war against the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Russian campaign was better planned, but it relied heavily on Turkish passivity. A crucial Russian mistake was sending too few troops initially; an expeditionary force of about 185,000 crossed the Danube in June, slightly fewer than the combined Turkish forces in the Balkans (about 200,000). After setbacks in July (at [[Pleven]] and [[Stara Zagora]]), the Russian military command realized it did not have the reserves to keep the offensive going and switched to a defensive posture. The Russians did not even have enough forces to blockade Pleven properly until late August, which effectively delayed the whole campaign for about two months.\n\n===Balkan theatre===\n[[File:Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878).png|thumb|Map of the Balkan Theater]]\nAt the start of the war, Russia and Romania destroyed all vessels along the Danube and [[Naval mine|mined]] the river, thus ensuring that Russian forces could cross the Danube at any point without resistance from the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]]. The Ottoman command did not appreciate the significance of the Russians' actions. In June, a small Russian unit crossed the Danube close to the delta, at [[Gala\u021bi]], and marched towards Ruschuk (today [[Rousse|Ruse]]). This made the Ottomans even more confident that the big Russian force would come right through the middle of the Ottoman stronghold.\n\n[[File:K\u00e4rtchen zur Schlacht bei Plewna (11. & 12.09.1877).jpg|thumb|left|Russian, Romanian and Ottoman troop movements at [[Pleven|Plevna]]]]\n\nOn 25\u201326 May, a Romanian torpedo boat with a mixed Romanian-Russian crew [[Action off M\u0103cin|attacked and sank]] an Ottoman monitor on the Danube.<ref>[http://www.navypedia.org/ships/turkey/tu_of_hizber.htm Navypedia.org: Ottoman navy: Hizber river monitors]</ref> Under the direct command of Major-General [[Mikhail Ivanovich Dragomirov]], on the night of 27/28 June 1877 ([[New Style|NS]]) the Russians constructed a pontoon bridge across the Danube at [[Svishtov]].

At this point the Russian force was divided into three parts: the Eastern Detachment under the command of [[Tsarevich]] Alexander Alexandrovich, the future Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia]], assigned to capture the fortress of Ruschuk and cover the army's eastern flank; the Western Detachment, to capture the fortress of [[Nikopol, Bulgaria]] and cover the army's western flank; and the Advance Detachment under Count [[Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko]], which was assigned to quickly move via [[Veliko Tarnovo]] and penetrate the [[Balkan Mountains]], the most significant barrier between the Danube and Constantinople.\n\n[[File:Boj u Ivanovo-Chiflik.jpg|thumb|Fighting near Ivanovo-Chiflik]]\n\nResponding to the Russian crossing of the Danube, the Ottoman high command in Constantinople ordered [[Osman Nuri Pa\u015fa]] to advance east from [[Vidin]] and occupy the fortress of [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]], just west of the Russian crossing. On his way to Nikopol, Osman Pasha learned that the Russians had already captured the fortress and so moved to the crossroads town of Plevna (now known as [[Pleven]]), which he occupied with a force of approximately 15,000 on 19 July (NS).{{Sfn | von Herbert | 1895 | p = 131}} The Russians, approximately 9,000 under the command of General Schilder-Schuldner, reached Plevna early in the morning. Thus began the [[Siege of Plevna]].\n\nOsman Pasha organized a defense and repelled two Russian attacks with colossal casualties on the Russian side. At that point, the sides were almost equal in numbers and the Russian army was very discouraged.<ref>{{Citation | title = Reminiscences of the King of Roumania | publisher = Harper & Brothers | year = 1899 | pages = 274\u201375 | url = https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofk00kremiala#page/274/mode/2up}}.</ref> Most analysts agree that a counter-attack would have allowed the Ottomans to gain control of, and destroy, the Russians' bridge.{{who|date=August 2009}} However, Osman Pasha had orders to stay fortified in Plevna, and so he did not leave that fortress.\n\n[[File:GhaziOsmanPasha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Osman Nuri Pasha|Gazi Osman Pasha]]]]\n[[File:Nikopol dmitriev.jpg|thumb|left|The Ottoman capitulation at [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Ni\u011fbolu (Nicopolis, modern Nikopol)]] in 1877 was significant, as it was the site of an [[Battle of Nicopolis|important Ottoman victory in 1396]] which marked the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Balkans.]]\n\nRussia had no more troops to throw against Plevna, so the Russians besieged it, and subsequently asked<ref>{{Citation | title = Reminiscences of the King of Roumania | publisher = Harper & Brothers | year = 1899 | page = 275 | url = https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofk00kremiala#page/274/mode/2up}}.</ref> the Romanians to provide extra troops. On August 9, Suleiman Pasha made an attempt to help Osman Pasha with 30,000 troops, but he was stopped by Bulgarians at the [[Battle of Shipka Pass]]. After three days of fighting, the volunteers were relieved by a Russian force led by General Radezky, and the Turkish forces withdrew. Soon afterwards, Romanian forces crossed the Danube and joined the siege. On August 16, at Gorni-Studen, the armies (West Army group) around Plevna were placed under the command of the Romanian Prince [[Carol I]], aided by the Russian general Pavel Dmitrievich Zotov and the Romanian general [[Alexandru Cernat]].\n\nThe Turks maintained several fortresses around Pleven which the Russian and Romanian forces gradually reduced.<ref>{{Citation | last = Furneaux | first = Rupert | title = The Siege of Pleven | year = 1958}}.</ref>{{Sfn|von Herbert|1895}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2013}} The Romanian 4th Division led by General [[Gheorghe Manu]] took the Grivitsa redoubt after four bloody assaults and managed to keep it until the very end of the siege. The [[siege of Plevna]] (July\u2013December 1877) turned to victory only after Russian and Romanian forces cut off all supply routes to the fortified Ottomans. With supplies running low, Osman Pasha made an attempt to break the Russian siege in the direction of Opanets. On December 9, in the middle of the night the Ottomans threw bridges over the Vit River and crossed it, attacked on a {{convert |2|mi|km|adj =on}} front and broke through the first line of Russian trenches. Here they fought hand to hand and bayonet to bayonet, with little advantage to either side. Outnumbering the Ottomans almost 5 to 1, the Russians drove the Ottomans back across the Vit. Osman Pasha was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet, which killed his horse beneath him. Making a brief stand, the Ottomans eventually found themselves driven back into the city, losing 5,000 men to the Russians' 2,000. The next day, Osman surrendered the city, the garrison, and his sword to the Romanian colonel, [[Mihail Cerchez]]. He was treated honorably, but his troops perished in the snows by the thousand as they straggled off into captivity. The more seriously wounded were left behind in their camp hospitals, only to be murdered by the Bulgarians.<ref>{{Citation | author = Lord Kinross | title = The Ottoman Centuries | year = 1977 | page = 522 | publisher = Morrow Quill}}.</ref>{{dubious |date=January 2011}}\n\n[[File:Zahvat grivickogo reduta.jpg|thumb|Taking of the Grivitsa redoubt by the Russians \u2013 a few hours later the redoubt was recaptured by the Ottomans and fell to the Romanians on 30 August 1877 in what became known as the \"Third Battle of Grivitsa\".]]\n\nAt this point Serbia, having finally secured monetary aid from Russia, declared war on the Ottoman Empire again. This time there were far fewer Russian officers in the Serbian army but this was more than offset by the experience gained from the 1876\u201377 war. Under nominal command of [[Milan I of Serbia|prince Milan Obrenovi\u0107]] (effective command was in hands of general [[Kosta Proti\u0107]], the army chief of staff), the [[Serbian Army]] went on offensive in what is now eastern south Serbia. A planned offensive into the Ottoman [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] was called off due to strong diplomatic pressure from [[Austria-Hungary]], which wanted to prevent Serbia and Montenegro from coming into contact, and which had designs to spread Austria-Hungary's influence through the area. The Ottomans, outnumbered unlike two years before, mostly confined themselves to passive defence of fortified positions. By the end of hostilities the Serbs had captured Ak-Palanka (today [[Bela Palanka]]), [[Pirot]], [[Ni\u0161]] and [[Vranje]].\n\n[[File:Battle at river Skit 1877.jpg|thumb|left|Battle at bridge Skit, November 1877]]\n\nRussians under [[Field Marshal]] [[Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko]] succeeded in capturing the passes at the [[Stara Planina]] mountain, which were crucial for maneuvering. Next, both sides fought a series of [[Battle of Shipka Pass|battles for Shipka Pass]]. Gourko made several attacks on the [[Shipka Pass|Pass]] and eventually secured it. Ottoman troops spent much effort to recapture this important route, to use it to reinforce Osman Pasha in Pleven, but failed. Eventually Gourko led a final offensive that crushed the Ottomans around Shipka Pass. The Ottoman offensive against Shipka Pass is considered one of the major mistakes of the war, as other passes were virtually unguarded. At this time a huge number of Ottoman troops stayed fortified along the Black Sea coast and engaged in very few operations.\n\nA Russian army crossed the Stara Planina by a high snowy pass in winter, guided and helped by local Bulgarians, not expected by the Ottoman army, and defeated the Turks at the [[Battle of Tashkessen]] and [[Battle of Sofia|took Sofia]].

Many [[Armenians]] in the eastern provinces ([[Turkish Armenia]]) of the Ottoman Empire greeted the advancing Russians as liberators. Violence and instability directed at Armenians during the war by Kurd and Circassian bands had left many Armenians looking toward the invading Russians as the ultimate guarantors of their security. In January 1878, [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Nerses II Varzhapetian]] approached the Russian leadership with the view of receiving assurances that the Russians would introduce provisions in the prospective peace treaty for self-administration in the Armenian provinces. Though not as explicit, Article 16 of the Treaty of San Stefano read:\n{{quotation |As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the Sublime Porte engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from Kurds and Circassians.<ref>{{Citation | last = Hertslet | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Hertslet | title = The Map of Europe by Treaty | volume = 4 | place = London | publisher = Butterworths | year = 1891 | page = 2686}}.</ref>}}\n\nGreat Britain, however, took objection to Russia holding on to so much Ottoman territory and forced it to enter into new negotiations by convening the Congress of Berlin in June 1878. An Armenian delegation led by prelate [[Mkrtich Khrimian]] traveled to Berlin to present the case of the Armenians but, much to its chagrin, was left out of the negotiations. Article 16 was modified and watered down, and all mention of the Russian forces remaining in the provinces was removed. In the final text of the Treaty of Berlin, it was transformed into Article 61, which read:\n{{quotation |The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and Kurds.

However, during this war the cross instead reminded the Ottomans of the [[Crusades]]; so they elected to replace the cross with the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Crescent|Red Crescent]] instead. This ultimately became the symbol of the Movement's national societies in most [[Muslim]] countries, and was ratified as an emblem of protection by later [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1929 and again in 1949 (the current version).\n\n[[Iran]], which neighbored both the Russian Empire and Ottoman Empire, considered them to be rivals, and probably considered the Red Crescent in particular to be an Ottoman symbol; except for the Red Crescent being centred and without a star, it is a colour reversal of the [[Ottoman flag]] (and the modern [[Flag of Turkey|Turkish flag]]). This appears to have led to their national society in the Movement being initially known as the [[Red Lion and Sun Society]], using a [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#The Red Lion and Sun|red version]] of the [[Lion and Sun]], a traditional Iranian symbol. After the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, Iran switched to the Red Crescent, but the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize the Red Lion and Sun as an emblem of protection.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe novella ''[[Jalaleddin (novella)|Jalaleddin]]'', published in 1878 by the novelist [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]] describes the Kurdish massacres of Armenians in the Eastern Ottoman Empire at the time of the Russo-Turkish War.

Additional factors included Russian goals of recovering territorial losses endured during the [[Crimean War]] of 1853\u201356, re-establishing itself in the [[Black Sea]] and supporting the political movement attempting to free Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Russian-led coalition won the war, pushing the Turks back all the way to the gates of Constantinople but for the timely intervention of the western European great powers.\n\nAs a result, Russia succeeded in claiming provinces in the Caucasus, namely [[Kars Oblast |Kars]] and [[Batum Oblast |Batum]], and also annexed the [[Budjak]] region. The principalities of [[United Principalities |Romania]], [[Principality of Serbia| Serbia]], and [[Principality of Montenegro| Montenegro]], each of which had had ''de facto'' sovereignty for some time, formally proclaimed independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After almost five centuries of Ottoman domination (1396\u20131878), a Bulgarian state  re-emerged: the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], covering the land between the [[Danube]] River and the [[Balkan Mountains]] (except Northern [[Dobrudja]] which was given to Romania), as well as the region of [[Sofia]], which became the new state's capital.

In southern [[Lebanon]], where Maronite peasants worked for Druze overlords, Druze peasants sided with their overlords against the Maronites, transforming the conflict into a [[1860 Druze-Christian conflict in Lebanon|civil war]].

The financial strain on the treasury forced the Ottoman government to take a series of foreign loans at such steep interest rates that, despite all the fiscal reforms that followed, pushed it into unpayable debts and economic difficulties. This was further aggravated by the need to accommodate more than 600,000 Muslim [[Circassians]], expelled by the Russians from the Caucasus, to the Black Sea ports of north Anatolia and the Balkan ports of [[Constan\u0163a]] and [[Varna]], which cost a great deal in money and in civil disorder to the Ottoman authorities.<ref>{{Citation | last = Finkel | first = Caroline | title = The History of the Ottoman Empire | place = New York | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2005 | page = 467}}.</ref>\n\n====The New European Concert====\nThe [[Concert of Europe]] established in 1814 was shaken in 1859 when France and Austria [[Second Italian War of Independence|fought over Italy]]. It came apart completely as a result of the wars of [[German Unification]], when the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], led by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], defeated Austria in 1866 and France in 1870, replacing Austria-Hungary as the dominant power in Central Europe. Britain, worn out by its participation in the Crimean War and diverted by the [[Irish question]] and the social problems created by the [[Industrial Revolution]], chose not to intervene again to restore the European balance. Bismarck did not wish the breakup of the Ottoman Empire to create rivalries that might lead to war, so he took up the Tsar's earlier suggestion that arrangements be made in case the Ottoman Empire fell apart, creating the [[Three Emperors' League]] with Austria and Russia to keep France isolated on the continent.\n\nFrance responded by supporting self-determination movements, particularly if they concerned the three emperors and the Sultan. Thus revolts in Poland against Russia and national aspirations in the Balkans were encouraged by France. Russia worked to regain its right to maintain a fleet on the Black Sea and vied with the French in gaining influence in the Balkans by using the new [[Pan-Slavic]] idea that all Slavs should be united under Russian leadership. This could be done only by destroying the two empires where most non-Russian Slavs lived, the Habsburg and the Ottoman Empires. The ambitions and the rivalries of the Russians and French in the Balkans surfaced in Serbia, which was experiencing its own national revival and had ambitions that partly conflicted with those of the great powers.{{Sfn | Shaw | Shaw | 1977 | p = 146}}\n\n====Russia after the Crimean War====\n[[File:Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Gorchakov]]]]\n\nRussia ended the Crimean War with minimal territorial losses, but was forced to destroy its [[Black Sea Fleet]] and [[Sevastopol]] fortifications. Russian international prestige was damaged, and for many years revenge for the Crimean War became the main goal of Russian foreign policy. This was not easy though \u2014 the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Treaty]] included guarantees of Ottoman territorial integrity by Great Britain, France and Austria; only Prussia remained friendly to Russia.\n\nThe newly appointed Russian chancellor, [[Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov|Alexander Gorchakov]] depended upon alliance with Prussia and its chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]. Russia consistently supported Prussia in her wars with [[Second Schleswig War|Denmark (1864)]], [[Austro-Prussian War|Austria (1866)]] and [[Franco-Prussian War|France (1870)]]. In March 1871, using the crushing French defeat and the support of a grateful Germany, Russia achieved [[Commissions of the Danube River#London Conference of 1871|international recognition]] of its earlier denouncement of Article 11 of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Treaty]], thus enabling it to revive the [[Black Sea Fleet]].\n\nOther clauses of the Paris Peace Treaty, however, remained in force, specifically Article 8 with guarantees of Ottoman territorial integrity by Great Britain, France and Austria. Therefore, Russia was extremely cautious in its relations with the Ottoman Empire, coordinating all its actions with other European powers. A Russian war with Turkey would require at least the tacit support of all other Great Powers, and Russian diplomacy was waiting for a convenient moment.\n\n==Balkan crisis of 1875\u20131876==\nThe state of Ottoman administration in the Balkans continued to deteriorate throughout the 19th century, with the central government occasionally losing control over whole provinces. Reforms imposed by European powers did little to improve the conditions of the Christian population, while managing to dissatisfy a sizable portion of the Muslim population. [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] suffered at least two waves of rebellion by the local Muslim population, the most recent in 1850.\n\nAustria consolidated after the turmoil of the first half of the century and sought to reinvigorate its longstanding policy of expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the nominally autonomous, de facto independent principalities of Serbia and Montenegro also sought to expand into regions inhabited by their compatriots. Nationalist and [[irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments were strong and were encouraged by Russia and her agents. At the same time, a severe drought in Anatolia in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent in the heart of the Empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare bankruptcy in October, 1875 and increase taxes on outlying provinces including the Balkans.\n\n===Albanian revolts===\nFranklin Parker states that the Albanian highlanders resented new taxes and reformations, they fought against the Ottomans in the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parker |first1=Franklin |last2=Parker |first2=Betty June |title=Reforms cost money, and the Kosovars resented new taxes and conscription.

In 1875, a Bulgarian uprising was hastily prepared to take advantage of Ottoman preoccupation, but it fizzled before it started. In the spring of 1876, another uprising erupted in the south-central Bulgarian lands despite the fact that there were numerous regular Turkish troops in those areas.\n\nA special Turkish military committee was established to quell the uprising. Regular troops (Nisam) and irregular ones (Redif or Bashi-bazouk) were directed to fight the Bulgarians (May 11 \u2013 June 9, 1876). The irregulars were mostly drawn from the Muslim inhabitants of the Bulgarian regions, many of whom were [[Circassians|Circassian]] Islamic population which migrated from the [[Caucasus]] or [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]]s who were expelled during the [[Crimean War]] and even Islamized Bulgarians.

Widespread sympathy for the Bulgarian cause led to a nationwide surge in patriotism on a scale comparable with the one during the [[French invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]]. From autumn 1875, the movement to support the Bulgarian uprising involved all classes of Russian society. This was accompanied by sharp public discussions about Russian goals in this conflict: [[Slavophile]]s, including [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], saw in the impending war the chance to unite all Orthodox nations under Russia's helm, thus fulfilling what they believed was the historic mission of Russia, while their opponents, [[westernizer]]s, inspired by [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], denied the importance of religion and believed that Russian goals should not be defense of Orthodoxy but liberation of Bulgaria.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.libfl.ru/win/nbc/books/bolgaria.html |first=\u0412\u041c |last=\u0425\u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 |script-title=ru:\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f: \"\u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u2014 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\" |publisher=Lib FL |place=[[Russia|RU]] |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028062618/http://www.libfl.ru/win/nbc/books/bolgaria.html |archivedate=October 28, 2007 }}.</ref>\n\n===Serbo-Turkish War and diplomatic maneuvering===\n{{Main|Serbo-Turkish War (1876\u201378)|Constantinople Conference|Expulsion of the Albanians 1877\u20131878}}\n[[File:Serio-comic war map for 1877.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.25|Serio-comic war map for 1877.

Meanwhile, Russia's [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]] met [[Austria-Hungary]]'s [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] and [[Julius Andrassy|Count Andr\u00e1ssy]] in the [[Z\u00e1kupy|Reichstadt]] castle in [[Bohemia]].

A joint ultimatum by the European powers forced the Porte to give Serbia a one-month truce and start peace negotiations. Turkish peace conditions however were refused by European powers as too harsh. In early October, after the truce expired, the Turkish army resumed its offensive and the Serbian position quickly became desperate. On October 31, Russia issued an ultimatum requiring the Ottoman Empire to stop the hostilities and sign a new truce with Serbia within 48 hours. This was supported by the partial mobilization of the Russian army (up to 20 divisions). The Sultan accepted the conditions of the ultimatum.\n\nTo resolve the crisis, on December 11, 1876, the [[Constantinople Conference]] of the Great Powers was opened in Constantinople (to which the Turks were not invited). A compromise solution was negotiated, granting autonomy to [[Bulgaria]], Bosnia and Herzegovina under the joint control of European powers. The Ottomans, however, refused to sacrifice their independence by allowing international representatives to oversee the institution of reforms and sought to discredit the conference by announcing on December 23, the day the conference was closed, that a [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|constitution]] was adopted that declared equal rights for religious minorities within the Empire. The Ottomans attempted to use this manoeuver to get their objections and amendments to the agreement heard. When they were rejected by the Great Powers, the Ottoman Empire announced its decision to disregard the results of the conference.\n\nOn January 15, 1877, Russia and Austria-Hungary signed a written agreement confirming the results of an earlier [[Reichstadt Agreement]] in July 1876. This assured Russia of the benevolent neutrality of Austria-Hungary in the impending war. These terms meant that in case of war Russia would do the fighting and Austria would derive most of the advantage. Russia therefore made a final effort for a peaceful settlement. After reaching an agreement with its main Balkan rival and with anti-Ottoman sympathies running high throughout Europe due to the Bulgarian atrocities and the rejection of the Constantinople agreements, Russia finally felt free to declare war.\n\n==Course of the war==\n{{See also|Romanian War of Independence}}\n\n===Opening manoeuvres===\n[[File:\u041d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0443\u043d\u044b, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043a \u043f\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0435 \u043a \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0443 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0410\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f 3 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 1877 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430.jpg|thumb|Dragoons of Nizhny Novgorod pursuing the Turks near [[Kars]], 1877, painting by [[Aleksey Kivshenko]]]]\n\nRussia declared war on the Ottomans on 24 April 1877 and its troops entered Romania through the newly built [[Eiffel Bridge, Ungheni|Eiffel Bridge]] near Ungheni, on the Prut river.

On May 10, 1877, the [[Principality of Romania]], which was under formal Turkish rule, declared its independence.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/cronologieen.html | title = Chronology of events from 1856 to 1997 period relating to the Romanian monarchy | publisher = Kent State University | place = Ohio | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230042922/http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/cronologieen.html | archivedate = 2007-12-30 }}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, the outcome was far from obvious. The Russians could send a larger army into the Balkans: about 300,000 troops were within reach. The Ottomans had about 200,000 troops on the Balkan peninsula, of which about 100,000 were assigned to fortified garrisons, leaving about 100,000 for the army of operation. The Ottomans had the advantage of being fortified, complete command of the Black Sea, and patrol boats along the [[Danube]] river.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://archive.org/details/warineastillustr00scheiala | title = The War in the East: An illustrated history of the Conflict between Russia and Turkey with a Review of the Eastern Question | year = 1878 | author-link = Alexander Jacob Schem | last = Schem | first = Alexander Jacob}}.</ref> They also possessed superior arms, including new British and American-made rifles and German-made artillery.\n\n[[File:Pereprava cherez Dunaj.jpg|thumb|left|Russian crossing of the Danube, June 1877, painting by [[Nikolai Dmitriev-Orenburgsky]], 1883]]\n\nIn the event, however, the Ottomans usually resorted to passive defense, leaving the strategic initiative to the Russians, who, after making some mistakes, found a winning strategy for the war. The Ottoman military command in Constantinople made poor assumptions about Russian intentions. They decided that Russians would be too lazy to march along the Danube and cross it away from the delta, and would prefer the short way along the [[Black Sea]] coast. This would be ignoring the fact that the coast had the strongest, best supplied and garrisoned Turkish fortresses. There was only one well manned fortress along the inner part of the river Danube, [[Vidin]]. It was garrisoned only because the troops, led by Osman Pasha, had just taken part in defeating the Serbs in their recent war against the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Russian campaign was better planned, but it relied heavily on Turkish passivity. A crucial Russian mistake was sending too few troops initially; an expeditionary force of about 185,000 crossed the Danube in June, slightly fewer than the combined Turkish forces in the Balkans (about 200,000). After setbacks in July (at [[Pleven]] and [[Stara Zagora]]), the Russian military command realized it did not have the reserves to keep the offensive going and switched to a defensive posture. The Russians did not even have enough forces to blockade Pleven properly until late August, which effectively delayed the whole campaign for about two months.\n\n===Balkan theatre===\n[[File:Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878).png|thumb|Map of the Balkan Theater]]\nAt the start of the war, Russia and Romania destroyed all vessels along the Danube and [[Naval mine|mined]] the river, thus ensuring that Russian forces could cross the Danube at any point without resistance from the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]]. The Ottoman command did not appreciate the significance of the Russians' actions. In June, a small Russian unit crossed the Danube close to the delta, at [[Gala\u021bi]], and marched towards Ruschuk (today [[Rousse|Ruse]]). This made the Ottomans even more confident that the big Russian force would come right through the middle of the Ottoman stronghold.\n\n[[File:K\u00e4rtchen zur Schlacht bei Plewna (11. & 12.09.1877).jpg|thumb|left|Russian, Romanian and Ottoman troop movements at [[Pleven|Plevna]]]]\n\nOn 25\u201326 May, a Romanian torpedo boat with a mixed Romanian-Russian crew [[Action off M\u0103cin|attacked and sank]] an Ottoman monitor on the Danube.<ref>[http://www.navypedia.org/ships/turkey/tu_of_hizber.htm Navypedia.org: Ottoman navy: Hizber river monitors]</ref> Under the direct command of Major-General [[Mikhail Ivanovich Dragomirov]], on the night of 27/28 June 1877 ([[New Style|NS]]) the Russians constructed a pontoon bridge across the Danube at [[Svishtov]].

At this point the Russian force was divided into three parts: the Eastern Detachment under the command of [[Tsarevich]] Alexander Alexandrovich, the future Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia]], assigned to capture the fortress of Ruschuk and cover the army's eastern flank; the Western Detachment, to capture the fortress of [[Nikopol, Bulgaria]] and cover the army's western flank; and the Advance Detachment under Count [[Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko]], which was assigned to quickly move via [[Veliko Tarnovo]] and penetrate the [[Balkan Mountains]], the most significant barrier between the Danube and Constantinople.\n\n[[File:Boj u Ivanovo-Chiflik.jpg|thumb|Fighting near Ivanovo-Chiflik]]\n\nResponding to the Russian crossing of the Danube, the Ottoman high command in Constantinople ordered [[Osman Nuri Pa\u015fa]] to advance east from [[Vidin]] and occupy the fortress of [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]], just west of the Russian crossing. On his way to Nikopol, Osman Pasha learned that the Russians had already captured the fortress and so moved to the crossroads town of Plevna (now known as [[Pleven]]), which he occupied with a force of approximately 15,000 on 19 July (NS).{{Sfn | von Herbert | 1895 | p = 131}} The Russians, approximately 9,000 under the command of General Schilder-Schuldner, reached Plevna early in the morning. Thus began the [[Siege of Plevna]].\n\nOsman Pasha organized a defense and repelled two Russian attacks with colossal casualties on the Russian side.

On August 9, Suleiman Pasha made an attempt to help Osman Pasha with 30,000 troops, but he was stopped by Bulgarians at the [[Battle of Shipka Pass]]. After three days of fighting, the volunteers were relieved by a Russian force led by General Radezky, and the Turkish forces withdrew. Soon afterwards, Romanian forces crossed the Danube and joined the siege. On August 16, at Gorni-Studen, the armies (West Army group) around Plevna were placed under the command of the Romanian Prince [[Carol I]], aided by the Russian general Pavel Dmitrievich Zotov and the Romanian general [[Alexandru Cernat]].\n\nThe Turks maintained several fortresses around Pleven which the Russian and Romanian forces gradually reduced.<ref>{{Citation | last = Furneaux | first = Rupert | title = The Siege of Pleven | year = 1958}}.</ref>{{Sfn|von Herbert|1895}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2013}} The Romanian 4th Division led by General [[Gheorghe Manu]] took the Grivitsa redoubt after four bloody assaults and managed to keep it until the very end of the siege. The [[siege of Plevna]] (July\u2013December 1877) turned to victory only after Russian and Romanian forces cut off all supply routes to the fortified Ottomans. With supplies running low, Osman Pasha made an attempt to break the Russian siege in the direction of Opanets. On December 9, in the middle of the night the Ottomans threw bridges over the Vit River and crossed it, attacked on a {{convert |2|mi|km|adj =on}} front and broke through the first line of Russian trenches. Here they fought hand to hand and bayonet to bayonet, with little advantage to either side. Outnumbering the Ottomans almost 5 to 1, the Russians drove the Ottomans back across the Vit. Osman Pasha was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet, which killed his horse beneath him. Making a brief stand, the Ottomans eventually found themselves driven back into the city, losing 5,000 men to the Russians' 2,000. The next day, Osman surrendered the city, the garrison, and his sword to the Romanian colonel, [[Mihail Cerchez]]. He was treated honorably, but his troops perished in the snows by the thousand as they straggled off into captivity. The more seriously wounded were left behind in their camp hospitals, only to be murdered by the Bulgarians.<ref>{{Citation | author = Lord Kinross | title = The Ottoman Centuries | year = 1977 | page = 522 | publisher = Morrow Quill}}.</ref>{{dubious |date=January 2011}}\n\n[[File:Zahvat grivickogo reduta.jpg|thumb|Taking of the Grivitsa redoubt by the Russians \u2013 a few hours later the redoubt was recaptured by the Ottomans and fell to the Romanians on 30 August 1877 in what became known as the \"Third Battle of Grivitsa\".]]\n\nAt this point Serbia, having finally secured monetary aid from Russia, declared war on the Ottoman Empire again. This time there were far fewer Russian officers in the Serbian army but this was more than offset by the experience gained from the 1876\u201377 war. Under nominal command of [[Milan I of Serbia|prince Milan Obrenovi\u0107]] (effective command was in hands of general [[Kosta Proti\u0107]], the army chief of staff), the [[Serbian Army]] went on offensive in what is now eastern south Serbia. A planned offensive into the Ottoman [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] was called off due to strong diplomatic pressure from [[Austria-Hungary]], which wanted to prevent Serbia and Montenegro from coming into contact, and which had designs to spread Austria-Hungary's influence through the area. The Ottomans, outnumbered unlike two years before, mostly confined themselves to passive defence of fortified positions. By the end of hostilities the Serbs had captured Ak-Palanka (today [[Bela Palanka]]), [[Pirot]], [[Ni\u0161]] and [[Vranje]].\n\n[[File:Battle at river Skit 1877.jpg|thumb|left|Battle at bridge Skit, November 1877]]\n\nRussians under [[Field Marshal]] [[Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko]] succeeded in capturing the passes at the [[Stara Planina]] mountain, which were crucial for maneuvering. Next, both sides fought a series of [[Battle of Shipka Pass|battles for Shipka Pass]]. Gourko made several attacks on the [[Shipka Pass|Pass]] and eventually secured it. Ottoman troops spent much effort to recapture this important route, to use it to reinforce Osman Pasha in Pleven, but failed. Eventually Gourko led a final offensive that crushed the Ottomans around Shipka Pass. The Ottoman offensive against Shipka Pass is considered one of the major mistakes of the war, as other passes were virtually unguarded. At this time a huge number of Ottoman troops stayed fortified along the Black Sea coast and engaged in very few operations.\n\nA Russian army crossed the Stara Planina by a high snowy pass in winter, guided and helped by local Bulgarians, not expected by the Ottoman army, and defeated the Turks at the [[Battle of Tashkessen]] and [[Battle of Sofia|took Sofia]]. The way was now open for a quick advance through [[Plovdiv]] and [[Edirne]] to [[Constantinople]].\n\nBesides the [[Romanian Army]] (which mobilized 130,000 men, losing 10,000 of them to this war), more than 12,000 volunteer Bulgarian troops (''Opalchenie'') from the local [[Bulgaria]]n population as well as many ''[[hajduk]]'' detachments fought in the war on the side of the Russians.\n\n===Caucasian theatre===\n[[File:DefenceOfBayazet.jpg|thumb|Russian troops repulsing a Turkish assault against the fortress of [[Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t|Beyazid]] on June 8, 1877, oil painting by Lev Feliksovich Lagorio, 1891]]\n\nThe Russian Caucasus Corps was stationed in [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russian Armenia|Armenia]], composed of approximately 50,000 men and 202 guns under the overall command of [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich]], [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1844\u20131881)|Governor General of the Caucasus]].<ref>Menning.

Many [[Armenians]] in the eastern provinces ([[Turkish Armenia]]) of the Ottoman Empire greeted the advancing Russians as liberators. Violence and instability directed at Armenians during the war by Kurd and Circassian bands had left many Armenians looking toward the invading Russians as the ultimate guarantors of their security. In January 1878, [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Nerses II Varzhapetian]] approached the Russian leadership with the view of receiving assurances that the Russians would introduce provisions in the prospective peace treaty for self-administration in the Armenian provinces. Though not as explicit, Article 16 of the Treaty of San Stefano read:\n{{quotation |As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the Sublime Porte engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from Kurds and Circassians.<ref>{{Citation | last = Hertslet | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Hertslet | title = The Map of Europe by Treaty | volume = 4 | place = London | publisher = Butterworths | year = 1891 | page = 2686}}.</ref>}}\n\nGreat Britain, however, took objection to Russia holding on to so much Ottoman territory and forced it to enter into new negotiations by convening the Congress of Berlin in June 1878. An Armenian delegation led by prelate [[Mkrtich Khrimian]] traveled to Berlin to present the case of the Armenians but, much to its chagrin, was left out of the negotiations. Article 16 was modified and watered down, and all mention of the Russian forces remaining in the provinces was removed. In the final text of the Treaty of Berlin, it was transformed into Article 61, which read:\n{{quotation |The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to this effect to the powers, who will superintend their application.<ref>{{Citation | last = Hurewitz | first = Jacob C | title = Diplomacy in the Near and Middle East: A Documentary Record 1535\u20131956 | volume = I | place = Princeton, NJ | publisher = Van Nostrand | year = 1956 | page = 190}}.</ref>}}\n\nAs it turned out, the reforms were not forthcoming. Khrimian returned to Constantinople and delivered a famous speech in which he likened the peace conference to a {{\"'}}big cauldron of Liberty Stew' into which the big nations dipped their 'iron ladles' for real results, while the Armenian delegation had only a 'Paper Ladle'. 'Ah dear Armenian people,' Khrimian said, 'could I have dipped my Paper Ladle in the cauldron it would sog and remain there!

Both Russia and the Ottoman Empire had signed the [[First Geneva Convention]] (1864), which made the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Cross|Red Cross]], a colour reversal of the [[Flag of Switzerland|flag]] of neutral [[Switzerland]], the sole emblem of protection for military medical personnel and facilities. However, during this war the cross instead reminded the Ottomans of the [[Crusades]]; so they elected to replace the cross with the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Crescent|Red Crescent]] instead. This ultimately became the symbol of the Movement's national societies in most [[Muslim]] countries, and was ratified as an emblem of protection by later [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1929 and again in 1949 (the current version).\n\n[[Iran]], which neighbored both the Russian Empire and Ottoman Empire, considered them to be rivals, and probably considered the Red Crescent in particular to be an Ottoman symbol; except for the Red Crescent being centred and without a star, it is a colour reversal of the [[Ottoman flag]] (and the modern [[Flag of Turkey|Turkish flag]]). This appears to have led to their national society in the Movement being initially known as the [[Red Lion and Sun Society]], using a [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#The Red Lion and Sun|red version]] of the [[Lion and Sun]], a traditional Iranian symbol. After the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, Iran switched to the Red Crescent, but the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize the Red Lion and Sun as an emblem of protection.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe novella ''[[Jalaleddin (novella)|Jalaleddin]]'', published in 1878 by the novelist [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]] describes the Kurdish massacres of Armenians in the Eastern Ottoman Empire at the time of the Russo-Turkish War.

The [[Vasquez Rocks]], {{convert|40|mi}} north of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], were one of his many hideouts and are named after him.\n\n== Early life ==\nTiburcio Vasquez was born in [[Monterey]], [[Alta California]], Mexico (present-day [[California]], United States) on April 11, 1835 to Jos\u00e9 Hermenegildo Vasquez and Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Cantua.<ref name=\"Acu\u00f1a\">{{harvnb|Acu\u00f1a|2011|p=140}}</ref><ref name=\"Boessenecker_013\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|p=13}}</ref> In accord with Spanish tradition, Vasquez's birth was celebrated on the feast day of his namesake, St. Tiburtius. Thus, he always referred to his birthday as August 11, 1835.<ref name=\"Boessenecker\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010}}</ref> His great-grandfather came to Alta California with the [[De Anza Expedition]] of 1776. Vasquez was slightly built,  about {{convert|5|ft|7|in|cm}}. His family sent him to school, and he was fluent in both English and Spanish.\n\nIn 1852, Vasquez was influenced by [[Anastacio Garc\u00eda]], one of California's most dangerous bandits.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_046\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=46\u201348}}</ref> In 1854, Vasquez was present at the slaying of Monterey Constable William Hardmount in a fight with Anastacio Garc\u00eda at a [[fandango (dance)|fandango]]. Vasquez denied any involvement and fled, becoming an outlaw. Vasquez later claimed his crimes were the result of discrimination by the ''norteamericanos'' and insisted that he was a defender of Mexican-American rights.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_049\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=49\u201353}}</ref> Vasquez and Garc\u00eda played leading roles in Monterey County's murderous Roach-Belcher feud, which ended when Garc\u00eda was executed by hanging in 1875.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_054-069\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=54\u201369}}</ref>\n\nBy 1856, Vasquez was rustling horses. A sheriff's posse caught up with him near [[Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]], and he spent the next five years behind bars in [[San Quentin]] prison. There he helped organize, and participated in, four bloody prison breaks which left twenty convicts dead.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_070\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=70\u2013101}}</ref> After his release, he committed numerous burglaries, cattle thefts, and highway robberies in Sonoma County in 1866. He was captured after a store burglary in [[Petaluma]] and sent to prison again for three years.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_102\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=102\u2013120}}</ref> His \"trademark\" was \"binding [his victims'] hands behind their back and leaving them face down in the dust.\"<ref name=\"Roddy\">{{harvnb|Roddy|1970}}</ref>\n\n== Final years ==\nIn 1870, Vasquez organized a bandit gang, which included the notorious Juan Soto, and later, [[Procopio|Procopio Bustamante]]. After numerous bandit raids, he was shot and badly wounded in a gunfight with [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] police officer Robert Liddell. He managed to escape, and his sisters nursed him back to health.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_165\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=165\u2013172}}</ref>\n\nIn 1873, he gained statewide, and then nationwide, notoriety. Vasquez and his gang stole $2,200 from Snyder's Store in [[Tres Pinos]], now called [[Paicines, California|Paicines]], in [[San Benito County]]. Three were killed, but not by Tiburcio. [[Posse Comitatus (Common Law)|Posses]] began searching for him, and Governor [[Newton Booth]] placed a $1,000 reward on his head. Sheriff John H. Adams from San Jose pursued the band to Southern California; Vasquez escaped after a gunfight.<ref>{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=213\u2013241}}</ref>\n\nVasquez hid for a while in Southern California, where he was less well known. With his two most trusted men, he rode over the [[Tejon Pass (Kern County)|old Tejon Pass]], through the [[Antelope Valley]], and rested at Jim Hefner's ranch at [[Elizabeth Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Elizabeth Lake]]. Vasquez's brother, Francisco, lived nearby. After resting, Vasquez rode on to [[Littlerock, California|Littlerock]] Creek, which became his first [[Southern California]] hideout.\n\nVasquez was popular in the Mexican-American community, and had many friends and family members from Santa Rosa in Northern California to Los Angeles in the south. He was handsome, literate, charming, played guitar, and was a skillful dancer. Women were attracted to him and he had many love affairs. He enjoyed reading romantic novels and writing poetry for his female admirers. He had several affairs with married women, one of which eventually led to his downfall.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_139\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=139\u2013140, 206\u2013207, 233\u2013234}}</ref>\n\nVasquez returned to the San Joaquin Valley. On November 10, 1873, he and his gang robbed the Jones store at Millerton in Fresno County. On December 26, 1873, he and his band sacked the town of [[Kingston, California|Kingston]] in [[Fresno County]], robbing all the businesses and making off with $2,500 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_250\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=250\u2013268}}</ref>\n\nGovernor Booth was now authorized by the California State Legislature to spend up to $15,000 to bring the law down on Vasquez. Posses were formed in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]], [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]], Fresno, and [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]] counties. In January 1874, Booth offered $3,000 for Vasquez's capture alive, and $2,000 if he was brought back dead. These rewards were increased in February to $8,000 and $6,000, respectively. [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] Sheriff Harry Morse was assigned specifically to track down Vasquez.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_271\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=271\u2013285}}</ref>\n\nHeading towards [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], Vasquez and gang member, Clodoveo Ch\u00e1vez, rode to the rock promontory near [[Inyokern, California|Inyokern]] now known as [[Robbers Roost (Kern County, California)|Robbers Roost]]. Near that spot, at Coyote Holes, they robbed a stagecoach from the [[Cerro Gordo Mines]], silver mines near [[Owens Lake]]. During the robbery Vasquez shot and wounded a man who did not obey his orders.\n\nThe gang moved to Elizabeth Lake and [[Soledad Canyon]], robbing a stage of $300, stealing six horses and a wagon near present-day [[Acton, California|Acton]], and robbing lone travelers. Vasquez was believed to be hiding out at Vasquez Rocks.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_289\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=289\u2013290}}</ref> These rock formations proved a formidable hideout for him and his gang. Shallow caves, deep crevices, and numerous overhangs created a maze for any posse to thread. The tallest rock, 150 feet (46&nbsp;m) high, provided an excellent lookout point.\n\nFor the next two months, he escaped attention. However, he then made an error that led to his capture. On April 15, 1874, he and his band held the prominent sheepman, Alessandro Repetto, for ransom. Pursuing posses from Los Angeles almost trapped the gang in the San Gabriel Mountains, but once again, Vasquez and his men escaped.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_293\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=293\u2013302}}</ref>\n\n== Capture ==\n[[File:Map of Tiburcio V\u00e1squez Capture.jpg|thumb|Vintage Map of Tiburcio V\u00e1squez Capture]]\nVasquez took up residence at the adobe home of [[Yiorgos Caralambo|\"Greek George\" Caralambo]] in the northwest corner of [[Rancho La Brea]], located 200 yards (183&nbsp;m) south of the present-day [[Sunset Strip]] in [[West Hollywood]]. Greek George was a former [[camel]] driver for General [[Edward Fitzgerald Beale|Beale]] in the [[United States Army|Army]] [[U.S. Camel Corps|Camel Corps]]. Allegedly, Vasquez seduced and impregnated his own niece. Either the girl's family or Greek George's wife's family betrayed Vasquez to Los Angeles Sheriff [[William R. Rowland]]. Rowland sent a posse to the ranch and captured Vasquez on May 14, 1874. Greek George's adobe was situated near the present-day Melrose Place in West Hollywood, very close to where the movie industry set up shop a few decades later.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_309\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=309\u2013319}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sfc051574a.htm | title=Vasquez Captured At Last. | publisher=Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society | accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref>\n\nVasquez remained in the [[Los Angeles County]] jail for nine days. He had numerous requests for interviews by many newspaper reporters, but agreed to see only three: two from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and one from the ''Los Angeles Star''. He told them his aim was to return California to Mexican rule. He insisted he was an honorable man and claimed he had never killed anyone. He was photographed by [[Valentin Wolfenstein]] behind the jail on May 18, 1874.<ref name=cslfdn>{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2012|p=6}}</ref>\n\nIn late May, Vasquez was moved by steamship to [[San Francisco]]. He eventually stood trial in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Vasquez quickly became a celebrity among many of his fellow [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] Californians. He admitted he was an outlaw, but again denied he had ever killed anyone. A note purportedly written by Clodoveo Ch\u00e1vez, one of his gang members, was dropped into a Wells Fargo box. Ch\u00e1vez wrote that he, not Vasquez, had shot the men at Tres Pinos. Nevertheless, at his trial Vasquez admitted participating in the Tres Pinos raid. Since all the participants in the robbery were equally guilty of any murder that took place during its commission, whether Vasquez actually pulled the trigger was legally irrelevant. In January 1875, Vasquez was convicted and sentenced to hang for murder. His trial had taken four days and the jury deliberated for only two hours before finally finding him guilty of one count of murder in the Tres Pinos robbery.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_327\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=327\u2013348}}</ref>\n\nVisitors still flocked to Vasquez's jail cell, many of them women. He signed autographs and posed for photographs. Vasquez sold the photos from the window of his cell and used the money to pay for his legal defense. After his conviction, he appealed for clemency. It was denied by Governor [[Romualdo Pacheco]]. Vasquez calmly met his fate in San Jose on March 19, 1875. He was 39 years old.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_349\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=349\u2013366}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nEven today, Tiburcio V\u00e1squez remains controversial. He is seen as a hero by some for his defiance of what he viewed as unjust laws and discrimination. Others regard him as a colorful outlaw. To this day, many continue to visit and pay respects to Vasquez's grave. He was buried in [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds|Santa Clara Mission Cemetery]] in Santa Clara, California.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-tiburciovasquez/|title=Tiburcio Vasquez \u2013 California Desperado|last=|first=|date=|website=Legends of America|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\nHis grave is very difficult to find, but visitors to Santa Clara cemetery have managed to find it for years. The groundskeeper directed Vasquez relative, Patrick McAnaney, to the grave in 1980, telling him \"Vasquez lived at odds with the people, and he was buried at odds with them.\" This was in reference to his gravestone being set at an angle relative to the other gravestones. \n\nAs of Aug 12, 2017, historian and Psychic Medium, Michael J. Kouri and friends found his grave after a long search. Online photos show his grave beside two large cacti and in front of a palm tree, no longer standing. However, they fail to mention that his carved granite headstone is the only stone in the entire cemetery to stand at an angle. All the rest are in uniform rows, and many other graves surrounding Vasquez's grave are flat to the ground as if no one else wanted to be interred near the famous bandido until decades later when his fame had died down. Vasquez's ghost is said to haunt many places, including the cemetery, some of his hideouts, areas where gruesome crimes were committed, and the prison cells where he was held.\n\nWith his upper-class [[Californio]] background, Vasquez is thought to have been one of several sources for the bandit-hero character [[Zorro]].<ref>{{harvnb|Deutch|2008|}}</ref>\n\nThe actor [[Anthony Caruso (actor)|Anthony Caruso]] played Vasquez in ''[[Stories of the Century]].''\n\nArmand Alzamora (1928\u20132009) played Vasquez in the 1957 episode, \"The Last Bad Man\" of the syndicated anthology series, ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]].

The [[Vasquez Rocks]], {{convert|40|mi}} north of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], were one of his many hideouts and are named after him.\n\n== Early life ==\nTiburcio Vasquez was born in [[Monterey]], [[Alta California]], Mexico (present-day [[California]], United States) on April 11, 1835 to Jos\u00e9 Hermenegildo Vasquez and Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Cantua.<ref name=\"Acu\u00f1a\">{{harvnb|Acu\u00f1a|2011|p=140}}</ref><ref name=\"Boessenecker_013\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|p=13}}</ref> In accord with Spanish tradition, Vasquez's birth was celebrated on the feast day of his namesake, St. Tiburtius. Thus, he always referred to his birthday as August 11, 1835.<ref name=\"Boessenecker\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010}}</ref> His great-grandfather came to Alta California with the [[De Anza Expedition]] of 1776. Vasquez was slightly built,  about {{convert|5|ft|7|in|cm}}. His family sent him to school, and he was fluent in both English and Spanish.\n\nIn 1852, Vasquez was influenced by [[Anastacio Garc\u00eda]], one of California's most dangerous bandits.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_046\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=46\u201348}}</ref> In 1854, Vasquez was present at the slaying of Monterey Constable William Hardmount in a fight with Anastacio Garc\u00eda at a [[fandango (dance)|fandango]]. Vasquez denied any involvement and fled, becoming an outlaw. Vasquez later claimed his crimes were the result of discrimination by the ''norteamericanos'' and insisted that he was a defender of Mexican-American rights.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_049\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=49\u201353}}</ref> Vasquez and Garc\u00eda played leading roles in Monterey County's murderous Roach-Belcher feud, which ended when Garc\u00eda was executed by hanging in 1875.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_054-069\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=54\u201369}}</ref>\n\nBy 1856, Vasquez was rustling horses. A sheriff's posse caught up with him near [[Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]], and he spent the next five years behind bars in [[San Quentin]] prison. There he helped organize, and participated in, four bloody prison breaks which left twenty convicts dead.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_070\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=70\u2013101}}</ref> After his release, he committed numerous burglaries, cattle thefts, and highway robberies in Sonoma County in 1866. He was captured after a store burglary in [[Petaluma]] and sent to prison again for three years.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_102\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=102\u2013120}}</ref> His \"trademark\" was \"binding [his victims'] hands behind their back and leaving them face down in the dust.\"<ref name=\"Roddy\">{{harvnb|Roddy|1970}}</ref>\n\n== Final years ==\nIn 1870, Vasquez organized a bandit gang, which included the notorious Juan Soto, and later, [[Procopio|Procopio Bustamante]]. After numerous bandit raids, he was shot and badly wounded in a gunfight with [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] police officer Robert Liddell. He managed to escape, and his sisters nursed him back to health.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_165\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=165\u2013172}}</ref>\n\nIn 1873, he gained statewide, and then nationwide, notoriety. Vasquez and his gang stole $2,200 from Snyder's Store in [[Tres Pinos]], now called [[Paicines, California|Paicines]], in [[San Benito County]], three were killed, but not by Tiburcio. [[Posse Comitatus (Common Law)|Posses]] began searching for him, and Governor [[Newton Booth]] placed a $1,000 reward on his head. Sheriff John H. Adams from San Jose pursued the band to Southern California; Vasquez escaped after a gunfight.<ref>{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=213\u2013241}}</ref>\n\nVasquez hid for a while in Southern California, where he was less well known. With his two most trusted men, he rode over the [[Tejon Pass (Kern County)|old Tejon Pass]], through the [[Antelope Valley]], and rested at Jim Hefner's ranch at [[Elizabeth Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Elizabeth Lake]]. Vasquez's brother, Francisco, lived nearby. After resting, Vasquez rode on to [[Littlerock, California|Littlerock]] Creek, which became his first [[Southern California]] hideout.\n\nVasquez was popular in the Mexican-American community, and had many friends and family members from Santa Rosa in Northern California to Los Angeles in the south. He was handsome, literate, charming, played guitar, and was a skillful dancer. Women were attracted to him and he had many love affairs. He enjoyed reading romantic novels and writing poetry for his female admirers. He had several affairs with married women, one of which eventually led to his downfall.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_139\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=139\u2013140, 206\u2013207, 233\u2013234}}</ref>\n\nVasquez returned to the San Joaquin Valley. On November 10, 1873, he and his gang robbed the Jones store at Millerton in Fresno County. On December 26, 1873, he and his band sacked the town of [[Kingston, California|Kingston]] in [[Fresno County]], robbing all the businesses and making off with $2,500 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_250\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=250\u2013268}}</ref>\n\nGovernor Booth was now authorized by the California State Legislature to spend up to $15,000 to bring the law down on Vasquez. Posses were formed in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]], [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]], Fresno, and [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]] counties. In January 1874, Booth offered $3,000 for Vasquez's capture alive, and $2,000 if he was brought back dead. These rewards were increased in February to $8,000 and $6,000, respectively. [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] Sheriff Harry Morse was assigned specifically to track down Vasquez.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_271\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=271\u2013285}}</ref>\n\nHeading towards [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], Vasquez and gang member, Clodoveo Ch\u00e1vez, rode to the rock promontory near [[Inyokern, California|Inyokern]] now known as [[Robbers Roost (Kern County, California)|Robbers Roost]]. Near that spot, at Coyote Holes, they robbed a stagecoach from the [[Cerro Gordo Mines]], silver mines near [[Owens Lake]]. During the robbery Vasquez shot and wounded a man who did not obey his orders.\n\nThe gang moved to Elizabeth Lake and [[Soledad Canyon]], robbing a stage of $300, stealing six horses and a wagon near present-day [[Acton, California|Acton]], and robbing lone travelers. Vasquez was believed to be hiding out at Vasquez Rocks.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_289\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=289\u2013290}}</ref> These rock formations proved a formidable hideout for him and his gang. Shallow caves, deep crevices, and numerous overhangs created a maze for any posse to thread. The tallest rock, 150 feet (46&nbsp;m) high, provided an excellent lookout point.\n\nFor the next two months, he escaped attention. However, he then made an error that led to his capture. On April 15, 1874, he and his band held the prominent sheepman, Alessandro Repetto, for ransom. Pursuing posses from Los Angeles almost trapped the gang in the San Gabriel Mountains, but once again, Vasquez and his men escaped.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_293\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=293\u2013302}}</ref>\n\n== Capture ==\n[[File:Map of Tiburcio V\u00e1squez Capture.jpg|thumb|Vintage Map of Tiburcio V\u00e1squez Capture]]\nVasquez took up residence at the adobe home of [[Yiorgos Caralambo|\"Greek George\" Caralambo]] in the northwest corner of [[Rancho La Brea]], located 200 yards (183&nbsp;m) south of the present-day [[Sunset Strip]] in [[West Hollywood]]. Greek George was a former [[camel]] driver for General [[Edward Fitzgerald Beale|Beale]] in the [[United States Army|Army]] [[U.S. Camel Corps|Camel Corps]]. Allegedly, Vasquez seduced and impregnated his own niece. Either the girl's family or Greek George's wife's family betrayed Vasquez to Los Angeles Sheriff [[William R. Rowland]]. Rowland sent a posse to the ranch and captured Vasquez on May 14, 1874. Greek George's adobe was situated near the present-day Melrose Place in West Hollywood, very close to where the movie industry set up shop a few decades later.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_309\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=309\u2013319}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sfc051574a.htm | title=Vasquez Captured At Last. | publisher=Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society | accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref>\n\nVasquez remained in the [[Los Angeles County]] jail for nine days. He had numerous requests for interviews by many newspaper reporters, but agreed to see only three: two from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and one from the ''Los Angeles Star''. He told them his aim was to return California to Mexican rule. He insisted he was an honorable man and claimed he had never killed anyone. He was photographed by [[Valentin Wolfenstein]] behind the jail on May 18, 1874.<ref name=cslfdn>{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2012|p=6}}</ref>\n\nIn late May, Vasquez was moved by steamship to [[San Francisco]]. He eventually stood trial in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Vasquez quickly became a celebrity among many of his fellow [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] Californians. He admitted he was an outlaw, but again denied he had ever killed anyone. A note purportedly written by Clodoveo Ch\u00e1vez, one of his gang members, was dropped into a Wells Fargo box. Ch\u00e1vez wrote that he, not Vasquez, had shot the men at Tres Pinos. Nevertheless, at his trial Vasquez admitted participating in the Tres Pinos raid. Since all the participants in the robbery were equally guilty of any murder that took place during its commission, whether Vasquez actually pulled the trigger was legally irrelevant. In January 1875, Vasquez was convicted and sentenced to hang for murder. His trial had taken four days and the jury deliberated for only two hours before finally finding him guilty of one count of murder in the Tres Pinos robbery.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_327\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=327\u2013348}}</ref>\n\nVisitors still flocked to Vasquez's jail cell, many of them women. He signed autographs and posed for photographs. Vasquez sold the photos from the window of his cell and used the money to pay for his legal defense. After his conviction, he appealed for clemency. It was denied by Governor [[Romualdo Pacheco]]. Vasquez calmly met his fate in San Jose on March 19, 1875. He was 39 years old.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_349\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=349\u2013366}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nEven today, Tiburcio V\u00e1squez remains controversial. He is seen as a hero by some for his defiance of what he viewed as unjust laws and discrimination. Others regard him as a colorful outlaw. To this day, many continue to visit and pay respects to Vasquez's grave. He was buried in [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds|Santa Clara Mission Cemetery]] in Santa Clara, California.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-tiburciovasquez/|title=Tiburcio Vasquez \u2013 California Desperado|last=|first=|date=|website=Legends of America|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\nHis grave is very difficult to find, but visitors to Santa Clara cemetery have managed to find it for years. The groundskeeper directed Vasquez relative, Patrick McAnaney, to the grave in 1980, telling him \"Vasquez lived at odds with the people, and he was buried at odds with them.\" This was in reference to his gravestone being set at an angle relative to the other gravestones. \n\nAs of Aug 12, 2017, historian and Psychic Medium, Michael J. Kouri and friends found his grave after a long search. Online photos show his grave beside two large cacti and in front of a palm tree, no longer standing. However, they fail to mention that his carved granite headstone is the only stone in the entire cemetery to stand at an angle. All the rest are in uniform rows, and many other graves surrounding Vasquez's grave are flat to the ground as if no one else wanted to be interred near the famous bandido until decades later when his fame had died down. Vasquez's ghost is said to haunt many places, including the cemetery, some of his hideouts, areas where gruesome crimes were committed, and the prison cells where he was held.\n\nWith his upper-class [[Californio]] background, Vasquez is thought to have been one of several sources for the bandit-hero character [[Zorro]].<ref>{{harvnb|Deutch|2008|}}</ref>\n\nThe actor [[Anthony Caruso (actor)|Anthony Caruso]] played Vasquez in ''[[Stories of the Century]].''\n\nArmand Alzamora (1928\u20132009) played Vasquez in the 1957 episode, \"The Last Bad Man\" of the syndicated anthology series, ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]]. The segment focuses on Vasquez's early life of crime, his hatred for the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|US takeover of California]], the prison escape, and his hanging at the age of 39.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556823/|title=The Last Bad Man on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe trunk and knife that belonged to Tiburcio are on display at the [[Andres Pico Adobe]] in [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles|Mission Hills]], part of the [[San Fernando Valley Historical Society]] collection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://californiahistoricalsociety.blogspot.com/2016/08/history-keepers-knife-and-trunk-of.html|title=History Keepers: Knife and Trunk of Tiburcio Vasquez|last=|first=|date=2016-08-03|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Places named for Vasquez ===\n==== Geographical features ====\n* [[Vasquez Rocks]], an area of distinctive rock formations in the [[Sierra Pelona Mountains]] that is popular as a filming location for movies and television\n* Vasquez Canyon in [[Saugus, California]]\n* Vasquez Tree, outside of the 21-mile house, in [[Morgan Hill, California]]\n* Vasquez day use area in the [[Angeles National Forest]]\n* Tiburcio's X and (Vasquez's) Monolith, two rock faces popular with climbers in [[Pinnacles National Park, California|Pinnacles National Park]], were named for the legend that Vasquez hid out in a cave below the Monolith.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubine|1995|pp=12,55,62}}</ref>\n\n==== Buildings and facilities ====\n* Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, [[Hayward, California]] and [[Union City, California|Union City]]<ref>{{harvnb|Our History: What's in a name?|2013}}</ref>\n* Vasquez High School in [[Acton, California#Education|Acton, California]]\n* The Alisal Union School District near [[Salinas, California]] named a new school Tiburcio Vasquez Elementary School in 2012.

With pneumonic plague, the first signs of illness are fever, headache, weakness and rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough and sometimes bloody or watery [[sputum]].<ref name=\"CDC\" />\n\nThe pneumonia progresses for two to four days and may cause respiratory failure and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]. Patients will die without early treatment, some within 36 hours.\n\nInitial pneumonic plague symptoms can often include the following:\n\n* [[Fever]]\n* [[muscle weakness|Weakness]]\n* [[Headaches]]\n* [[Nausea]]\n\nRapidly developing [[pneumonia]] with:\n\n* [[Shortness of breath]]\n* [[Chest pain]]\n* [[Cough]]\n* Bloody or watery [[sputum]] (saliva and discharge from [[respiratory passages]]).\n\n==Causes==\nPneumonic plague can be caused in two ways: primary, which results from the inhalation of aerosolised plague [[bacteria]], or secondary, when [[septicemic plague|septicaemic plague]] spreads into [[lung]] tissue from the bloodstream. Pneumonic plague is ''not'' exclusively [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne]] like bubonic plague; instead it can be spread from person to person. There have been cases of pneumonic plague resulting from the dissection or handling of contaminated animal tissue.

Patients will die without early treatment, some within 36 hours.\n\nInitial pneumonic plague symptoms can often include the following:\n\n* [[Fever]]\n* [[muscle weakness|Weakness]]\n* [[Headaches]]\n* [[Nausea]]\n\nRapidly developing [[pneumonia]] with:\n\n* [[Shortness of breath]]\n* [[Chest pain]]\n* [[Cough]]\n* Bloody or watery [[sputum]] (saliva and discharge from [[respiratory passages]]).\n\n==Causes==\nPneumonic plague can be caused in two ways: primary, which results from the inhalation of aerosolised plague [[bacteria]], or secondary, when [[septicemic plague|septicaemic plague]] spreads into [[lung]] tissue from the bloodstream. Pneumonic plague is ''not'' exclusively [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne]] like bubonic plague; instead it can be spread from person to person.
