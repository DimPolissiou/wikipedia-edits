An interview with R&D Manager Mickey Dunlap suggested that no more than 20 machines were produced in the winter of 1985/86, suggesting that the lower number is more accurate. Chassises were built in house, or in the case of the [[Tiger ATV LTD#Tiger KTM Powered 80cc ATC|Tiger 80]], heavily modified, and all bodywork were produced in-house, at their Burnsville, Minnesota facility, while drivetrains were provided By [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]] and [[KTM]].

For example, the clue \"A New England state + 'Flying Circus' man\" would result in an answer of \"Vermonty Python,\" formed by combining \"Vermont\" and \"Monty Python\". Smushes did not have to use the exact spelling of both words. For example, \"Belly Lafghanistan\" could be a combination of \"belly laugh\" and \"Afghanistan.\"\n\n===Rounds 1 and 2===\nRapid-fire clues are presented in which the answers smush together. The first contestant to buzz in with the correct answer scored points, but an incorrect answer gave the opposing contestants a chance to take a guess. Round one featured two-part clues which created two answers to be smushed together. Each correct answer was worth one point. Later in that round, the remaining clues were visual clues. Round two had three-part clues with three answers smushed together, called \"Smush Tris\", with each correct answer worth two points. The final smush in the second round was called the \"Smush Quad\", a four-part clue worth three points.\n\nThe contestant with the lowest score at the end of each of the first two rounds was eliminated from the game.\n\n===Round 3 (Smush Chain)===\nRound three was called the \"Smush Chain.\" Clues were given one at a time to a smush that would grow progressively longer. To score, the contestant must buzz in and recite the entire chain, starting at the first clue. A total of seven clues were asked, the first of which served as the base of the smush, and was not a smush in itself. For example, the chain might become \"Leap Yeardrum Major Tommy Thompson Twin Cities,\" by combining \"[[Leap year|Leap Year]],\" \"[[Ear Drum]],\" \"[[Drum major (marching band)|Drum Major]],\" \"[[Major Tom]],\" \"[[Tommy Thompson]],\" \"[[Thompson Twins]],\" and \"[[twin cities]].\" The first clue was worth one point, the second clue was worth two points, and so on, up to seven points. The contestant with the higher score went on to the bonus round.\n\n===Money Round===\nIn the bonus round, hostess Lisa wrote a word or phrase on a mirror in lipstick which served as the root word for the next five smushes. Five clues were read one at a time, the answers to which smush to either the left or right side of the root word. The winning contestant had 45 seconds to answer those clues. For each correct smush given, the winning contestant was awarded $1,000. If the contestant made a mistake the clue and smush was thrown out.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga.

There had also been ongoing efforts by the United Nations to suppress Belgian support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August.

UMHK officials privately told Tshombe they were withdrawing their support for succession.<ref name=\"othen\" /> General Moke vainly attempted to organise the 140 mercenaries and 2,000 gendarmes under his command to prepare a final defence of Kolwezi. His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and indiscipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Discipline in the garrison increasingly faltered; in once instance, two mercenaries attempted to steal Puren's jeep. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of [[Baudouinville]] to surrender to besieging UN and ANC forces. Instead, they and most of the population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near [[Kongolo, Katanga|Kongolo]] laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers. On 14 January, Indian troops found the last intact bridge into Kolwezi. After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.<ref name=\"othen\" /> At a final meeting with his mercenary commanders, Tshombe ordered all remaining Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. [[Jean Schramme]] was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January.<ref name=\"othen\" />\n\nOn 15 January, Tshombe sent a formal message to Thant, \"I am ready to proclaim immediately before the world that the Katanga's secession is ended.\"{{sfn|Meisler|2011|p=133}} He offered to return to \u00c9lisabethville to oversee the implementation of Thant's proposal for reunification if Prime Minister Adoula granted amnesty to himself and his government. At a press conference, Adoula accepted Tshombe's proposition and announced that what remained of the Katangese Gendarmerie would be integrated into the ANC.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} Total statistics on Katangese Gendarmerie and mercenary casualties from Operation Grandslam are unknown. Following the operation the UN was able to confirm that Portuguese Angola, South Africa, and Northern Rhodesia had assisted the Katangese in arming their air force.{{sfn|Dorn|2016|p=32}}\n\n=== Exile, return, and the Simba rebellion ===\n{{Further|Simba rebellion}}\nAfter the defeat of the State of Katanga, plans to disarm or integrate the gendarmes were made. On 8 February 1963, General Moke and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000-17,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000-3,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the Kwilu and Simba rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} They were used successfully against the insurgencies, and, following Tshombe's ousting from power, they retained significant political distance from Mobutu's regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in [[Stanleyville mutinies|a bloody mutiny]] in July 1966.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}}\n\nA March 1967 trial of Tshombe ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' criminalized the actions of the gendarmes retrospectively. After the trial, the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and [[Kisangani]], after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes, led by Belgian mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=|pp=77-78}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Tough the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo. The mercenaries were expelled from Africa and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=|pp=77-78}}{{Sfn|Arnold|1999|p=15}}\n\nA brief rebellion was executed by [[Bob Denard]] from November 1 to 5, 1967.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Genarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.

It's not that Harkaway has a tendency to overwrite: both in labouring a point or observation before labouring it some more, and using arcane (and possibly non-existent) words where a normal, widely-known one was available. [...] My main problem is that ''Gnomon'' doesn't make a lick of sense. Or maybe it does, in the author's mind, but I'm afraid I was baffled, to the point of paralysed stupidity.

[...] My main problem is that ''Gnomon'' doesn't make a lick of sense. Or maybe it does, in the author's mind, but I'm afraid I was baffled, to the point of paralysed stupidity. I genuinely couldn't tell you, by the end, who did what and when, whether anything reported here actually occurred, whether any or all of these characters even exist.</blockquote>\n\nIn [[The Guardian|''The Guardian'']], Steven Poole also gave the book a relatively negative review.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Poole |first1=Steven |title=Gnomon by Nick Harkaway review \u2013 a future of total surveillance |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/16/gnomon-nick-harkaway-review-science-fiction-artifical-intelligence |website=The Guardian |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> \"''Gnomon'' [...] reads like the first draft of what might have been a tighter 400-page book rather than a rambling 700-pager. Progress is routinely halted by sketchy Wikipedia-style exposition-dumps about tidal flow or [[behavioural economics]], or a character asking herself a whole page or two of questions about what just happened, or vague disquisitions on the meaning of identity. Things are repeatedly explained, unnecessarily.\" Still, Poole also said, \"Such defects wouldn\u2019t be so annoying were it not obvious that Nick Harkaway can sometimes be a very good writer indeed. Readers who are prepared to mentally edit the book as they go along, as the author and editor have not, will encounter a host of highly enjoyable fragments and suggestive ideas.\"\n\nFor [[NPR]], Jason Sheehan gave a mixed review,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheehan |first1=Jason |title='Gnomon' Starts Simply \u2014 And Then It Goes Sideways |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/07/573582683/gnomon-starts-simply-and-then-it-goes-sideways |website=NPR |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> saying, \"it's a big book, a digressive book, and it contains so much that it sometimes feels (like Diana Hunter's house is supposed to feel) like a museum of curiosities trapped between two covers and shaken vigorously. You can't help but be hooked by a detail here, a tic of recursive language there, until suddenly, you know things about [[Isis]], ocean water or the [[Thames]] that you never thought would be interesting until Harkaway dangled them in front of you.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33852053-gnomon ''Gnomon'' on Goodreads]\n\n[[Category:2017 novels]]\n[[Category:British novels]]\n[[Category:Science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:English-language novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the United Kingdom]]\n{{book-stub}}\n", "name_user": "RobertM525", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changing stub type", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon_(novel)"}
