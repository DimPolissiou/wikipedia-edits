Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ravagers rescue him as Peter tries to steal his ship, managing to outsmart every member of the crew and capturing Yondu. After Yondu frees himself from his restraints and attacks Peter, he gives him a choice between letting himself be released into space without more trouble or execution.

Yondu is initially skeptical of this idea, but after he learns Peter, like him, is a homeless orphan, Yondu allows him to stay on the ship with the Ravagers as their cleaning boy. Peter uses the opportunity to learn everything he can from space.<ref>Humphries, Sam (w), Garron, Javier (a). ''Star-Lord'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, Yondu makes him an official Ravager.<ref>''Star-Lord'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a member of the [[marsupial]] alien race of the planet Centauri IV, Yondu possesses an intuitive mystical \"sixth sense\" perception that permits him limited empathic relationships with other lifeforms. The higher the lifeform, the more limited is his empathic potential. Additionally, Yondu possesses an intuitive rapport with nature, particularly with his own world, but also with any world that still possesses natural wildlife. With this rapport, he can sense incongruous elements (foreign bodies or substances) or focus on specific elements within the whole (such as the location of a given plant). He is also sensitive to mystical beings and forces and is able to detect their presence and activities without effort. By going into a trance, Yondu is able to replenish his own inner strength by communing with natural forces.\n\nYondu is an above average physical specimen of his race. He has slightly more strength and endurance than the average human male. As a hunter, Yondu is an expert in the use of bow and arrow. His ability to whistle with a range of four octaves aids his archery (see Weapons, below). The native Centaurian language is a system of grunts, clicks, and whistles, but Yondu has managed to master the English language, although it is painful for him to speak for too long without resting his throat. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and a highly skilled hunter and tracker. He has extensive knowledge of the social and religious customs of the natives of Centauri IV.\n\n===Weapons===\nYondu uses a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} single curve bow and a quiver of arrows composed of ''yaka'', a special sound-sensitive metal found only on Centauri IV. A yaka arrow can actually change its direction (but not speed) in response to certain high-octave whistle-sounds some Centaurians can produce. Yondu is so skillful at controlling his arrows, he can cause an arrow to return to his hand or weave its way through a crowd of people without touching them. Yondu's arrows are {{convert|15|in|cm}} in length and are very flexible. He carries about 20 of them at one time. In ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'', Yondu utilizes his expertise in archery by shooting \"drone-arrows\" to give the Guardians an eye in the sky.{{issue|date=August 2014}}\n\nYondu's right hand is replaced for a time by a bionic device called a weapons concealment appendage, a metal cup replacing his right hand.<ref name=\"GotG16\"/> Thus, he could no longer practice archery nor perform functions requiring him to grasp with his right hand. The device can release from within itself a number of weapons, including a mace, a hatchet, a scythe, a barbed spear, and others; when not in use the weapons are concealed within the appendage at a reduced size, until enlarged by Pym particles. Yondu's bionic weapon-hand is later replaced with a duplicate of his original hand.<ref name=\"GotGA2\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Yondu appears in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' TV series, voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/568500511491690497 |title=Marvel Entertainment on Twitter: \"The voice of #Yondu & #Cosmo has voiced The Leader, Spider-Man and Silver Surfer in series & games #GuardiansVoiceCast #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy\" |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date=2015-02-19 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/568507822784163840 |title=Marvel Entertainment on Twitter: \"James Arnold Taylor (@JATactor) will voice Yondu & Cosmo in #DisneyXD's #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy! #GuardiansVoiceCast \" |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}</ref>\n* Yondu appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes - Guardians of the Galaxy: The Thanos Threat]]'', voiced again by James Arnold Taylor.<ref>End credits for ''Lego Marvel Super Heroes - Guardians of the Galaxy: The Thanos Threat''</ref>\n* Michael Rooker is set to reprise his role as Yondu in the [[Disney+]] animated series, ''[[What If...?

Yondu initially chases after Quill after he takes an orb artifact for himself instead of turning it over to the Ravagers. After it is revealed that the orb holds the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Power Stone]], and Quill and [[Gamora]] are captured by Yondu, Yondu is persuaded to aid the Guardians in stopping [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] from using the orb to destroy Xandar with the promise of claiming the orb for himself. However, after Yondu claims the orb from Quill and departs, he learns that Quill gave him a fake that holds a [[Troll doll]] to add to his collection of small figurines, much to his amusement. Yondu and his lieutenant, [[Kraglin]], reveal in dialogue that it was Quill's father who hired Yondu to kidnap and deliver the young Peter Quill to him, but that they decided not to deliver the boy to him because Quill's father, according to Yondu, was a \"jackass\".\n* Rooker reprised the role in the 2017 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''.<ref name=\"GotGV2Fin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-marvel-studios-reveals-latest-phase-3-secrets|title=SDCC: Marvel Studios Reveals Latest Phase 3 Secrets|last=Ching|first=Albert|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=July 24, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725143033/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-marvel-studios-reveals-latest-phase-3-secrets|archivedate=July 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It is revealed that Yondu and his Ravager clan were exiled from the greater Ravager community after kidnapping Peter and [[Ego, the Living Planet|Ego]]'s other children, which broke the Ravager Code. Yondu and his crew are tasked on Contraxia by Ayesha's representatives to track down and capture the Guardians. However, Yondu decides not to capture Quill and the others and instead wants the batteries that Rocket stole from the Sovereign, which infuriates most of the other Ravagers including Taserface who initiates a mutiny, and Yondu is incarcerated with Rocket Raccoon and Groot. He has his fin destroyed in the process by Nebula, which is revealed as the technology enabling him to control his arrow. Yondu subsequently uses a larger fin that more closely resembles his appearance from the comics\u2014identified as the prototype for the fin he wore in the first film- which is retrieved by Groot. With help from this last loyalist Kraglin, Yondu, Rocket, and Groot escape and destroy his ship, killing all the mutineers. Yondu then helps the Guardians defeat Ego, with Rocket and Groot proclaiming him to be part of the team thanks to his actions, and sacrifices his life to save Peter's when they exit the planet's atmosphere, Yondu using the last jetpack but giving Peter the last spacesuit. It is revealed the reason he kept Quill was because he realized Ego had slain all the other children he had sired and summoned back to him and Yondu wanted to protect Peter from that end, thinking of Peter as his son. During Yondu's funeral, Peter declares Yondu his true father. Informed about Yondu's last deeds by Rocket Raccoon, Stakar and the other Ravagers salute Yondu as a hero for his self-sacrifice.\n\n===Video games===\n* Yondu appears in ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/30/disney-infinity-marvel-super-heroes-announced|title=Disney Infinity Marvel Super Heroes Announced|accessdate=April 30, 2014|date=April 30, 2014|publisher=IGN}}</ref> voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Chris-Edgerly/|title=Behind the Voice Actors|website=Behindthevoiceactors.com|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref> He appears as both a mission giver and playable character.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} He also appears in ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n* Yondu is a playable character in ''[[Marvel: Future Fight]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/video_games/24718/netmarble_unveils_guardians_of_the_galaxy_update_for_marvel_future_fight|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613191500/http://marvel.com/news/video_games/24718/netmarble_unveils_guardians_of_the_galaxy_update_for_marvel_future_fight|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 13, 2015|title=Netmarble Unveils Guardians of the Galaxy Update for 'Marvel Future Fight'|accessdate=December 9, 2015|date=June 11, 2015|publisher=[[Marvel Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n* Yondu appears in ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance#Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2|Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marvelavengersalliance2.com/aa2_characters/yondu/ |title=Yondu &#124; Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 |website=Marvelavengersalliance2.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}</ref>\n* Yondu appears in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series]]'', voiced by Mark Barbolak.<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web | title=Voice Of Yondu - Guardians of the Galaxy <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors | url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy/Yondu/ | work=Behind The Voice Actors | accessdate=December 12, 2017| postscript=.

Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ravagers rescue him as Peter tries to steal his ship, managing to outsmart every member of the crew and capturing Yondu. After Yondu frees himself from his restraints and attacks Peter, he gives him a choice between letting himself be released into space without more trouble or execution. Peter instead asks to join his crew. Yondu is initially skeptical of this idea, but after he learns Peter, like him, is a homeless orphan, Yondu allows him to stay on the ship with the Ravagers as their cleaning boy. Peter uses the opportunity to learn everything he can from space.<ref>Humphries, Sam (w), Garron, Javier (a). ''Star-Lord'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, Yondu makes him an official Ravager.<ref>''Star-Lord'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a member of the [[marsupial]] alien race of the planet Centauri IV, Yondu possesses an intuitive mystical \"sixth sense\" perception that permits him limited empathic relationships with other lifeforms. The higher the lifeform, the more limited is his empathic potential. Additionally, Yondu possesses an intuitive rapport with nature, particularly with his own world, but also with any world that still possesses natural wildlife. With this rapport, he can sense incongruous elements (foreign bodies or substances) or focus on specific elements within the whole (such as the location of a given plant). He is also sensitive to mystical beings and forces and is able to detect their presence and activities without effort. By going into a trance, Yondu is able to replenish his own inner strength by communing with natural forces.\n\nYondu is an above average physical specimen of his race. He has slightly more strength and endurance than the average human male. As a hunter, Yondu is an expert in the use of bow and arrow. His ability to whistle with a range of four octaves aids his archery (see Weapons, below). The native Centaurian language is a system of grunts, clicks, and whistles, but Yondu has managed to master the English language, although it is painful for him to speak for too long without resting his throat. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and a highly skilled hunter and tracker. He has extensive knowledge of the social and religious customs of the natives of Centauri IV.\n\n===Weapons===\nYondu uses a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} single curve bow and a quiver of arrows composed of ''yaka'', a special sound-sensitive metal found only on Centauri IV. A yaka arrow can actually change its direction (but not speed) in response to certain high-octave whistle-sounds some Centaurians can produce. Yondu is so skillful at controlling his arrows, he can cause an arrow to return to his hand or weave its way through a crowd of people without touching them. Yondu's arrows are {{convert|15|in|cm}} in length and are very flexible. He carries about 20 of them at one time. In ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'', Yondu utilizes his expertise in archery by shooting \"drone-arrows\" to give the Guardians an eye in the sky.{{issue|date=August 2014}}\n\nYondu's right hand is replaced for a time by a bionic device called a weapons concealment appendage, a metal cup replacing his right hand.<ref name=\"GotG16\"/> Thus, he could no longer practice archery nor perform functions requiring him to grasp with his right hand. The device can release from within itself a number of weapons, including a mace, a hatchet, a scythe, a barbed spear, and others; when not in use the weapons are concealed within the appendage at a reduced size, until enlarged by Pym particles. Yondu's bionic weapon-hand is later replaced with a duplicate of his original hand.<ref name=\"GotGA2\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Yondu appears in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' TV series, voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/568500511491690497 |title=Marvel Entertainment on Twitter: \"The voice of #Yondu & #Cosmo has voiced The Leader, Spider-Man and Silver Surfer in series & games #GuardiansVoiceCast #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy\" |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date=2015-02-19 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/568507822784163840 |title=Marvel Entertainment on Twitter: \"James Arnold Taylor (@JATactor) will voice Yondu & Cosmo in #DisneyXD's #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy! #GuardiansVoiceCast \" |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}</ref>\n* Yondu appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes - Guardians of the Galaxy: The Thanos Threat]]'', voiced again by James Arnold Taylor.<ref>End credits for ''Lego Marvel Super Heroes - Guardians of the Galaxy: The Thanos Threat''</ref>\n* Michael Rooker is set to reprise his role as Yondu in the [[Disney+]] animated series, ''[[What If...?

Yondu initially chases after Quill after he takes an orb artifact for himself instead of turning it over to the Ravagers. After it is revealed that the orb holds the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Power Stone]], and Quill and [[Gamora]] are captured by Yondu, Yondu is persuaded to aid the Guardians in stopping [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] from using the orb to destroy Xandar with the promise of claiming the orb for himself. However, after Yondu claims the orb from Quill and departs, he learns that Quill gave him a fake that holds a [[Troll doll]] to add to his collection of small figurines, much to his amusement. Yondu and his lieutenant, [[Kraglin]], reveal in dialogue that it was Quill's father who hired Yondu to kidnap and deliver the young Peter Quill to him, but that they decided not to deliver the boy to him because Quill's father, according to Yondu, was a \"jackass\".\n* Rooker reprised the role in the 2017 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''.<ref name=\"GotGV2Fin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-marvel-studios-reveals-latest-phase-3-secrets|title=SDCC: Marvel Studios Reveals Latest Phase 3 Secrets|last=Ching|first=Albert|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=July 24, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725143033/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-marvel-studios-reveals-latest-phase-3-secrets|archivedate=July 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It is revealed that Yondu and his Ravager clan were exiled from the greater Ravager community after kidnapping Peter and [[Ego, the Living Planet|Ego]]'s other children, which broke the Ravager Code. Yondu and his crew are tasked on Contraxia by Ayesha's representatives to track down and capture the Guardians. However, Yondu decides not to capture Quill and the others and instead wants the batteries that Rocket stole from the Sovereign, which infuriates most of the other Ravagers including Taserface who initiates a mutiny, and Yondu is incarcerated with Rocket Raccoon and Groot. He has his fin destroyed in the process by Nebula, which is revealed as the technology enabling him to control his arrow. Yondu subsequently uses a larger fin that more closely resembles his appearance from the comics\u2014identified as the prototype for the fin he wore in the first film- which is retrieved by Groot. With help from this last loyalist Kraglin, Yondu, Rocket, and Groot escape and destroy his ship, killing all the mutineers. Yondu then helps the Guardians defeat Ego, with Rocket and Groot proclaiming him to be part of the team thanks to his actions, and sacrifices his life to save Peter's when they exit the planet's atmosphere, Yondu using the last jetpack but giving Peter the last spacesuit. It is revealed the reason he kept Quill was because he realized Ego had slain all the other children he had sired and summoned back to him and Yondu wanted to protect Peter from that end, thinking of Peter as his son. During Yondu's funeral, Peter declares Yondu his true father. Informed about Yondu's last deeds by Rocket Raccoon, Stakar and the other Ravagers salute Yondu as a hero for his self-sacrifice.\n\n===Video games===\n* Yondu appears in ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/30/disney-infinity-marvel-super-heroes-announced|title=Disney Infinity Marvel Super Heroes Announced|accessdate=April 30, 2014|date=April 30, 2014|publisher=IGN}}</ref> voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Chris-Edgerly/|title=Behind the Voice Actors|website=Behindthevoiceactors.com|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref> He appears as both a mission giver and playable character.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} He also appears in ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n* Yondu is a playable character in ''[[Marvel: Future Fight]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/video_games/24718/netmarble_unveils_guardians_of_the_galaxy_update_for_marvel_future_fight|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613191500/http://marvel.com/news/video_games/24718/netmarble_unveils_guardians_of_the_galaxy_update_for_marvel_future_fight|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 13, 2015|title=Netmarble Unveils Guardians of the Galaxy Update for 'Marvel Future Fight'|accessdate=December 9, 2015|date=June 11, 2015|publisher=[[Marvel Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n* Yondu appears in ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance#Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2|Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marvelavengersalliance2.com/aa2_characters/yondu/ |title=Yondu &#124; Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 |website=Marvelavengersalliance2.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}</ref>\n* Yondu appears in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series]]'', voiced by Mark Barbolak.<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web | title=Voice Of Yondu - Guardians of the Galaxy <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors | url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy/Yondu/ | work=Behind The Voice Actors | accessdate=December 12, 2017| postscript=.
