His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Despite a promising start, the band broke up in the late 1970s and Squier, the band's frontman, left to pursue a solo career.\n\nSquier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and released his solo debut in spring of 1980. ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signerature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in an 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for 6 weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier's fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' came in September 1984 and brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Co-produced by a veteran songwriter [[Jim Steinman]], ''Signs of Life'' saw Squier melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; he reportedly played for half-empty arenas on the most dates of Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued the tour and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, performing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video, more familiar to his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold a disappointing 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. It was also Squier's first album not to be supported with a tour since Capitol decided not to promote it - which later built strong tensions between the label and Squier.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]].'' It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did partly restore Squier's success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock with small hints of then-successful glam metal; it's nowadays regarded as one of the strongest inputs of his catalogue by his fanbase. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite a promising comeback chances, Squier's popularity continued to descend and he wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. The album was criticized for the lack of innovation in songwriting and peaked only at #117 in US, becoming his lowest charting album since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies, despite its opening track \"Angry\" receiving modest airplay and becoming his last new entry on the Mainstream Rock charts. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He embarked on a mini-tour to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\".{{unsourced|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier joined [[Bad Company]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] on a nationwide summer tour.\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"\n\nSampling of \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" continued as of 2016. The late [[Jam Master Jay]]'s reference to the song as a classic beat in the early days of hip hop paid great dividends for Squier. The three-piece hip hop group [[Run DMC]] performed a track live at The Funhouse entitled \"Here We Go,\" using the song's backbeat. [[Jay-Z]]'s \"99 Problems,\" a massive hit in 2003, was on that beat, as were British grime/hip-hop MC Dizzee Rascal's \"Fix Up, Look Sharp\" [[Kanye West]]'s \"Addiction\" and, in 2012, the [[Alicia Keys]] selection \"Girl on Fire.\"\n\n<br />{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and ended up opening for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Despite a promising success, the band broke up in the late 1970s and Squier, the band's frontman, left to pursue a solo career.\n\nSquier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and released his solo debut in spring of 1980. ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signerature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in an 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for 6 weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier's fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' came in September 1984 and brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Co-produced by a veteran songwriter [[Jim Steinman]], ''Signs of Life'' saw Squier melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; he reportedly played for half-empty arenas on the most dates of Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued the tour and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, performing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video, more familiar to his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold a disappointing 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. It was also Squier's first album not to be supported with a tour since Capitol decided not to promote it - which later built strong tensions between the label and Squier.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]].'' It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did partly restore Squier's success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock with small hints of then-successful glam metal; it's nowadays regarded as one of the strongest inputs of his catalogue by his fanbase. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite a promising comeback chances, Squier's popularity continued to descend and he wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. The album was criticized for the lack of innovation in songwriting and peaked only at #117 in US, becoming his lowest charting album since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies, despite its opening track \"Angry\" receiving modest airplay and becoming his last new entry on the Mainstream Rock charts. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He embarked on a mini-tour to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\".{{unsourced|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier joined [[Bad Company]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] on a nationwide summer tour.\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"\n\nSampling of \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" continued as of 2016. The late [[Jam Master Jay]]'s reference to the song as a classic beat in the early days of hip hop paid great dividends for Squier. The three-piece hip hop group [[Run DMC]] performed a track live at The Funhouse entitled \"Here We Go,\" using the song's backbeat. [[Jay-Z]]'s \"99 Problems,\" a massive hit in 2003, was on that beat, as were British grime/hip-hop MC Dizzee Rascal's \"Fix Up, Look Sharp\" [[Kanye West]]'s \"Addiction\" and, in 2012, the [[Alicia Keys]] selection \"Girl on Fire.\"\n\n<br />{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J.
