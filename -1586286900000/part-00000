Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of ''Ramayana''. The powerful Indian emperor [[Harsha]] (606\u2013648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy ''[[Ratnavali]]'', ''[[Priyadarsika]]'', and the [[Buddhist]] drama ''[[Nagananda]]''.

The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], [[Theatre architecture|architecture]], [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.<ref>Richmond (1998, 517).</ref> In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in an hereditary process. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.\n\nUnder the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (''sutradhara''), who may also have acted.<ref>Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 517).</ref> This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a [[Puppetry|puppeteer]]\u2014the literal meaning of \"''sutradhara''\" is \"holder of the strings or threads\".<ref>Richmond (1998, 517).</ref> The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique.<ref>Richmond (1998, 518).</ref> There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played characters younger or older than themselves. Of all the elements of theatre, the ''Treatise'' gives most attention to acting (''abhinaya''), which consists of two styles: realistic (''lokadharmi'') and conventional (''natyadharmi''), though the major focus is on the latter.<ref>Richmond (1998, 518). The literal meaning of ''abhinaya'' is \"to carry forwards\".</ref>\n\nThe theory of ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' described in the text has been a major influence on the modern [[theatre of India]] as well as [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]], particularly [[Bollywood]].\n\n==Plays==\n\n===''Mricchakatika'' (''The Little Clay Cart'')===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Moulin Rouge!]] -->\n{{main|Mrichakatika}}\nOne of the earliest known Sanskrit plays, this play was composed by [[\u015audraka]] in the 2nd century BC. Rife with romance, sex, royal intrigue and comedy, the juicy plot of the play has numerous twists and turns. The main story is about a young man named Charudatta, and his love for Vasantasena, a rich courtesan or [[nagarvadhu]]. The love affair is complicated by a royal courtier, who is also attracted to Vasantasena. The plot is further complicated by thieves and mistaken identities, and thus making it a greatly hilarious and entertaining play. It invited widespread admiration when staged in New York in 1924. The play was made into a 1984 [[Bollywood|Hindi]] movie ''[[Utsav]]'', directed by [[Girish Karnad]]. The Indian play depicted in the 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' may have been based on ''The Little Clay Cart''.\n\n===Bh\u0101sa===\n{{Main|Bh\u0101sa}}\nThe plays written by Bh\u0101sa were known to historians only through the references of later writers, as the manuscripts themselves were lost. Manuscripts of 13 plays written by him were discovered in an old library in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) in 1913 by the scholar [[T. Ganapati Sastri|Ganapati Sastri]]. A 14th play was later discovered and attributed to Bh\u0101sa, but its authorship is disputed.\n\nBh\u0101sa's most famous plays are ''Svapnavasavadattam (Swapnav\u0101sadatta)'' (\"Vasavadatta's dream\"), ''Panchar\u0101tra'', and ''Pratijna Yaugandharayaanam'' (\"The vows of Yaugandharayana\"). Some other plays being  ''Pratiman\u0101taka, Abhishekan\u0101taka, B\u0101lacharita, D\u016btav\u0101kya, Karnabh\u0101ra, D\u016btaghatotkacha, Ch\u0101rudatta, [[Madhyamavyayoga|Madhyamavy\u0101yoga]]'' and ''[[Urubhanga|\u016arubha\u1e45ga]]''.\n\n''Karnabharam'' is a critically acclaimed play and it is being subjected to lot of experimentation by the modern theatre groups in [[India]].\n\nBh\u0101sa is considered to be one of the best [[Sanskrit]] playwrights, second only to [[Kalidasa]]. He is earlier than Kalidasa and is dated to the 3rd or 4th century CE.<ref>Robert E.

He deals primarily with famous [[Hindu]] legends and themes; three famous plays by K\u0101lid\u0101sa are ''[[Vikram\u014drva\u015b\u012byam]]'' (\"Vikrama and Urvashi\"), ''[[M\u0101lavik\u0101gnimitram]]'' (\"Malavika and Agnimitra\"), and the play that he is most known for: ''[[Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam]]'' (\"The Recognition of Shakuntala\"). The last named play is considered to be greatest play in Sanskrit. More than a millennium later, it would so powerfully impress the famous German writer [[Goethe]] that he would write:\n\n:''\"Wouldst thou the young year's blossoms and the fruits of its decline''\n:''And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured, feasted, fed,''\n:''Wouldst thou the earth and heaven itself in one sole name combine?''\n:''I name thee, ''O Sakuntala!'' and all at once is said. \" ''\n\nK\u0101lid\u0101sa also wrote two large epic poems, ''[[Raghuva\u1e43\u015ba]]'' (\"The Genealogy of Raghu\") and ''[[Kum\u0101rasambhava]]'' (\"Birth of Kumara\"), and two smaller epics, ''[[\u1e5aitusa\u1e43h\u0101ra]]'' (\"Medley of Seasons\") and ''[[Meghad\u016bta]]'' ''(The Cloud Messenger)'', another 'perfect' work.\n\nK\u0101lid\u0101sa's writing is characterized by the usage of simple but beautiful Sanskrit, and by his extensive use of [[simile]]s. His similes have earned him the saying, ''Upama Kalidasasya'' (K\u0101lid\u0101sa ''owns'' simile).\nThe full \u015bloka reads: '''\"upam\u0101 K\u0101lid\u0101sasya, Bh\u0101raver artha gauravam | Da\u1e47\u1e0dinah padal\u0101lityam, M\u0101ghe shanti trayogu\u1e47ah ||\"'''\n\n===''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' of [[Vishakhadatta]]===\nAmongst Sanskrit plays, the historical play ''Mudrarakshasa'' is unique because it contains political intrigue and is full of life, action and sustained interest. The time period of  composition is prior to 800 C.E. In the play, [[Chandragupta Maurya]] is ruling from Pataliputra, having deposed the last of the Nanda kings. ''Rakshasa'' the minister of Nanda, attempts to avenge his late master. [[Chanakya]], the minister of Chandragupta succeeds in winning over Rakshasa to his master's side.<ref>Macdonell A.A.

(Artist:[[Mani Damodara Chakyar]])]]\n\n==Performances==\nSanskrit plays were very popular and were staged in ancient times all over India. Now the only surviving ancient Sanskrit drama theatre is [[Koodiyattam]], which is preserved in [[Kerala]] by the [[Chakyar]] community. This form of Sanskrit drama is thought to be at least 2000 years old and is one of the oldest living theatrical traditions in the world.  All major Sanskrit plays such as that of Bhasa,  Sri Harsha, Shakti Bhadra etc. are performed in Koodiyattam. Guru ''N\u0101ty\u0101ch\u0101rya Vid\u016bshakaratnam [[Padma Shri]]'' [[Mani Madhava Chakyar|M\u0101ni M\u0101dhava Ch\u0101ky\u0101r]] choreographed and directed plays like Kalidasa's ''[[Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala]]'', ''[[Vikramorva\u015b\u012bya]]'' and ''[[M\u0101lavik\u0101gnimitra]]''; Bhasa's ''Swapnav\u0101sadatta'' and ''Panchar\u0101tra'' for the first time in the history of Koodiyattam. He popularised Koodiyattam and rejuvenated the only surviving Sanskrit drama theatre in India.\n\nOne of the hypotheses (as yet without consensus) of the origins of the \"Trivandrum plays\" of Bhasa is that these 13 plays were adapted from their original sources and brought to Kerala for choreography in the Koodiyattam tradition.\n\n==Modern Sanskrit Plays==\n[[Manmohan Acharya]], a modern Sanskrit playwright has written many plays and dance dramas. Some worth-mentioning plays are ''Arjuna-Pratijnaa, Shrita-kamalam, Pada-pallavam, Divya-Jayadevam, Pingalaa, Mrtyuh, Sthitaprajnah, Tantra-mahasaktih, Purva-sakuntalam, Uttara-sakuntalam'' and ''Raavanah''.<ref>http://www.narthaki.com/info/rev11/rev1092.html</ref> \n[[File:Tantramahashakti.jpg|thumb| Famous Indian Dance Drama, Tantram <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7s4lGuOvLE youtube video]</ref> by Srjan, Script written by Vanikavi]]\n\n[[Vidyadhar Shastri#Plays in Sanskrit|Vidyadhar Shastri]] wrote three Sanskrit plays viz.

The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], [[Theatre architecture|architecture]], [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.<ref>Richmond (1998, 517).</ref> In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in an hereditary process. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.\n\nUnder the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (''sutradhara''), who may also have acted.<ref>Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 517).</ref> This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a [[Puppetry|puppeteer]]\u2014the literal meaning of \"''sutradhara''\" is \"holder of the strings or threads\".<ref>Richmond (1998, 517).</ref> The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique.<ref>Richmond (1998, 518).</ref> There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played characters younger or older than themselves. Of all the elements of theatre, the ''Treatise'' gives most attention to acting (''abhinaya''), which consists of two styles: realistic (''lokadharmi'') and conventional (''natyadharmi''), though the major focus is on the latter.<ref>Richmond (1998, 518). The literal meaning of ''abhinaya'' is \"to carry forwards\".</ref>\n\nThe theory of ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' described in the text has been a major influence on the modern [[theatre of India]] as well as [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]], particularly [[Bollywood]].\n\n==Plays==\n\n===''Mricchakatika'' (''The Little Clay Cart'')===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Moulin Rouge!]] -->\n{{main|Mrichakatika}}\nOne of the earliest known Sanskrit plays, this play was composed by [[\u015audraka]] in the 2nd century BC. Rife with romance, sex, royal intrigue and comedy, the juicy plot of the play has numerous twists and turns. The main story is about a young man named Charudatta, and his love for Vasantasena, a rich courtesan or [[nagarvadhu]]. The love affair is complicated by a royal courtier, who is also attracted to Vasantasena. The plot is further complicated by thieves and mistaken identities, and thus making it a greatly hilarious and entertaining play. It invited widespread admiration when staged in New York in 1924. The play was made into a 1984 [[Bollywood|Hindi]] movie ''[[Utsav]]'', directed by [[Girish Karnad]]. The Indian play depicted in the 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' may have been based on ''The Little Clay Cart''.\n\n===Bh\u0101sa===\n{{Main|Bh\u0101sa}}\nThe plays written by Bh\u0101sa were known to historians only through the references of later writers, as the manuscripts themselves were lost. Manuscripts of 13 plays written by him were discovered in an old library in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) in 1913 by the scholar [[T. Ganapati Sastri|Ganapati Sastri]]. A 14th play was later discovered and attributed to Bh\u0101sa, but its authorship is disputed.\n\nBh\u0101sa's most famous plays are ''Svapnavasavadattam (Swapnav\u0101sadatta)'' (\"Vasavadatta dream\"), ''Panchar\u0101tra'', and ''Pratijna Yaugandharayaanam'' (\"The vows of Yaugandharayana\"). Some other plays being  ''Pratiman\u0101taka, Abhishekan\u0101taka, B\u0101lacharita, D\u016btav\u0101kya, Karnabh\u0101ra, D\u016btaghatotkacha, Ch\u0101rudatta, [[Madhyamavyayoga|Madhyamavy\u0101yoga]]'' and ''[[Urubhanga|\u016arubha\u1e45ga]]''.\n\n''Karnabharam'' is a critically acclaimed play and it is being subjected to lot of experimentation by the modern theatre groups in [[India]].\n\nBh\u0101sa is considered to be one of the best [[Sanskrit]] playwrights, second only to [[Kalidasa]]. He is earlier than Kalidasa and is dated to the 3rd or 4th century CE.<ref>Robert E.

He deals primarily with famous [[Hindu]] legends and themes; three famous plays by K\u0101lid\u0101sa are ''[[Vikram\u014drva\u015b\u012byam]]'' (\"Vikrama and Urvashi\"), ''[[M\u0101lavik\u0101gnimitram]]'' (\"Malavika and Agnimitra\"), and the play that he is most known for: ''[[Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam]]'' (\"The Recognition of Shakuntala\"). The last named play is considered to be greatest play in Sanskrit. More than a millennium later, it would so powerfully impress the famous German writer [[Goethe]] that he would write:\n\n:''\"Wouldst thou the young year's blossoms and the fruits of its decline''\n:''And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured, feasted, fed,''\n:''Wouldst thou the earth and heaven itself in one sole name combine?''\n:''I name thee, ''O Sakuntala!'' and all at once is said. \" ''\n\nK\u0101lid\u0101sa also wrote two large epic poems, ''[[Raghuva\u1e43\u015ba]]'' (\"The Genealogy of Raghu\") and ''[[Kum\u0101rasambhava]]'' (\"Birth of Kumara\"), and two smaller epics, ''[[\u1e5aitusa\u1e43h\u0101ra]]'' (\"Medley of Seasons\") and ''[[Meghad\u016bta]]'' ''(The Cloud Messenger)'', another 'perfect' work.\n\nK\u0101lid\u0101sa's writing is characterized by the usage of simple but beautiful Sanskrit, and by his extensive use of [[simile]]s. His similes have earned him the saying, ''Upama Kalidasasya'' (K\u0101lid\u0101sa ''owns'' simile).\nThe full \u015bloka reads: '''\"upam\u0101 K\u0101lid\u0101sasya, Bh\u0101raver artha gauravam | Da\u1e47\u1e0dinah padal\u0101lityam, M\u0101ghe shanti trayogu\u1e47ah ||\"'''\n\n===''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' of [[Vishakhadatta]]===\nAmongst Sanskrit plays, the historical play ''Mudrarakshasa'' is unique because it contains political intrigue and is full of life, action and sustained interest. The time period of  composition is prior to 800 C.E. In the play, [[Chandragupta Maurya]] is ruling from Pataliputra, having deposed the last of the Nanda kings. ''Rakshasa'' the minister of Nanda, attempts to avenge his late master. [[Chanakya]], the minister of Chandragupta succeeds in winning over Rakshasa to his master's side.<ref>Macdonell A.A.

(Artist:[[Mani Damodara Chakyar]])]]\n\n==Performances==\nSanskrit plays were very popular and were staged in ancient times all over India. Now the only surviving ancient Sanskrit drama theatre is [[Koodiyattam]], which is preserved in [[Kerala]] by the [[Chakyar]] community. This form of Sanskrit drama is thought to be at least 2000 years old and is one of the oldest living theatrical traditions in the world.  All major Sanskrit plays such as that of Bhasa,  Sri Harsha, Shakti Bhadra etc. are performed in Koodiyattam. Guru ''N\u0101ty\u0101ch\u0101rya Vid\u016bshakaratnam [[Padma Shri]]'' [[Mani Madhava Chakyar|M\u0101ni M\u0101dhava Ch\u0101ky\u0101r]] choreographed and directed plays like Kalidasa's ''[[Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala]]'', ''[[Vikramorva\u015b\u012bya]]'' and ''[[M\u0101lavik\u0101gnimitra]]''; Bhasa's ''Swapnav\u0101sadatta'' and ''Panchar\u0101tra'' for the first time in the history of Koodiyattam. He popularised Koodiyattam and rejuvenated the only surviving Sanskrit drama theatre in India.\n\nOne of the hypotheses (as yet without consensus) of the origins of the \"Trivandrum plays\" of Bhasa is that these 13 plays were adapted from their original sources and brought to Kerala for choreography in the Koodiyattam tradition.\n\n==Modern Sanskrit Plays==\n[[Manmohan Acharya]], a modern Sanskrit playwright has written many plays and dance dramas. Some worth-mentioning plays are ''Arjuna-Pratigyaa, Shrita-kamalam, Pada-pallavam, Divya-Jayadevan, Pingalaa, Mrtyuh, Sthitaprajna, Tantra-mahasaktih, Purva-shakuntalam, Uttara-sakuntalam'' and ''Raavanah''.<ref>http://www.narthaki.com/info/rev11/rev1092.html</ref> \n[[File:Tantramahashakti.jpg|thumb| Famous Indian Dance Drama, Tantram <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7s4lGuOvLE youtube video]</ref> by Srjan, Script written by Vanikavi]]\n\n[[Vidyadhar Shastri#Plays in Sanskrit|Vidyadhar Shastri]] wrote three Sanskrit plays viz.

Meat of any kind was from $1 to 3 Dollars a pound. So great was the suffering among the very poor that all children under 12 were sold to the Butchers to be cut up and sold for food in order to keep others from starving. A boy or girl under 14 was not safe in the street. You could go in any shop\nand ask for steak \u2013 chops \u2013 or stew meat. Part of the naked body of a boy or girl would be brought out and just what you wanted cut from it. A boy or girls behind which is the sweetest part of the body and sold as veal cutlet brought the highest price. John staid there so long he acquired a taste for human flesh. On his return to N.Y. he stole two boys one 7 one 11. Took them to his home stripped them naked tied them in a closet then burned everything they had on. Several times every day and night he spanked them \u2013 tortured them \u2013 to make their meat good and tender. First he killed the 11 yr old boy, because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it. Every part of his body was cooked and eaten except Head \u2013 bones and guts. He was roasted in the oven, (all of his ass) boiled, broiled, fried, stewed. The little boy was next, went the same way. At that time I was living at 409 E 100 St, rear \u2013 right side. He told me so often how good human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it. On Sunday June the 3 \u2013 1928 I called on you at 406 W 15 St. Brought you pot cheese \u2013 strawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat in my lap and kissed me. I made up my mind to eat her, on the pretense of taking her to a party. You said Yes she could go. I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out. When we got there, I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down stairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama. First I stripped her naked. How she did kick \u2013 bite and scratch. I choked her to death then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms, cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven.

Stripped him naked and tied his hands and feet and gagged him with a piece of dirty rag I picked out of the dump. Then I burned his clothes. Threw his shoes in the dump. Then I walked back and took trolley to 59 St. at 2 A.M. and walked home from there. Next day about 2 P.M., I took tools, a good heavy [[cat o' nine tails|cat-of-nine tails]]. Home made. Short handle. Cut one of my belts in half, slit these half in six strips about 8 in. long. I whipped his bare behind till the blood ran from his legs. I cut off his ears&nbsp;\u2013 nose&nbsp;\u2013 [[Glasgow smile|slit his mouth from ear to ear]]. Gouged out his eyes. He was dead then. I stuck the knife in his belly and held my mouth to his body and drank his blood. I picked up four old potato sacks and gathered a pile of stones. Then I cut him up. I had a grip with me. I put his nose, ears and a few slices of his belly in the grip. Then I cut him thru the middle of his body. Just below his belly button. Then thru his legs about 2 in. below his behind. I put this in my grip with a lot of paper. I cut off the head&nbsp;\u2013 feet&nbsp;\u2013 arms&nbsp;\u2013 hands and the legs below the knee. This I put in sacks weighed with stones, tied the ends and threw them into the pools of slimy water you will see all along the road going to North Beach. Water is 3 to 4 ft. deep. They sank at once. I came home with my meat. I had the front of his body I liked best. His monkey and pee wees and a nice little fat behind to roast in the oven and eat. I made a stew out of his ears&nbsp;\u2013 nose&nbsp;\u2013 pieces of his face and belly. I put onions, carrots, turnips, celery, salt and pepper. It was good. Then I split the cheeks of his behind open, cut off his monkey and pee wees and washed them first. I put strips of bacon on each cheek of his behind and put in the oven. Then I picked 4 onions and when meat had roasted about 1/4 hr., I poured about a pint of water over it for gravy and put in the onions. At frequent intervals I basted his behind with a wooden spoon. So the meat would be nice and juicy. In about 2 hr., it was nice and brown, cooked thru. I never ate any roast turkey that tasted half as good as his sweet fat little behind did. I ate every bit of the meat in about four days. His little monkey was as sweet as a nut, but his pee-wees I could not chew. Threw them in the toilet.}}\n\nElizabeth Gaffney visited Fish in Sing Sing, accompanied by Detective King and two other men. She wanted to ask him about her son's death, but Fish refused to speak to her. Fish began to weep and asked to be left alone. After two hours of asking him questions through his lawyer, James Dempsey, Mrs. Gaffney gave up. She was still unconvinced that Albert Fish was her son's killer.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Trial and execution==\nAlbert Fish's trial for the murder of Grace Budd began on March 11, 1935, in [[White Plains, New York]]. Frederick P. Close presided as judge and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] Chief Assistant District Attorney Elbert F. Gallagher was prosecuting attorney. Fish's defense counsel was James Dempsey, a former prosecutor and the one-time mayor of [[Peekskill, New York]]. The trial lasted for 10 days. Fish pleaded [[insanity]], and claimed to have heard voices from God telling him to kill children. Several [[psychiatrist]]s testified about Fish's [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]], which included [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], [[flagellation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[voyeurism]], [[piquerism]], [[cannibalism]], [[coprophagia]], [[Urolagnia|urophilia]], [[pedophilia]] and [[infibulation]]. Dempsey in his summation noted that Fish was a \"psychiatric phenomenon\" and that nowhere in legal or medical records was there another individual who possessed so many sexual abnormalities.<ref name=\"Schechter\" />\n\nThe defense's chief expert witness was [[Fredric Wertham]], a psychiatrist with an emphasis on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1\u201324). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly \"sacrificing\" a boy would be [[penance]] for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but he turned out to be larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy.<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Wertham then detailed Fish's [[cannibalism]], which in his mind he associated with [[Communion rite|communion]]. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered \"He is insane\".<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an \"insane knowledge\".<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Fish Held Insane By Three Experts.

He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross examination, Dempsey asked if coprophilia, urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person. Gregory replied that such a person was not \"mentally sick\" and that these were common perversions that were \"socially perfectly alright\" and that Fish was \"no different from millions of other people\", some very prominent and successful, who suffered from the \"very same\" perversions. The next witness was the resident physician at [[The Tombs]], Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying on the issue of sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, \"That is not masochism\", as he was only \"punishing himself to get sexual gratification\". The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but \"was a matter of taste\" and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert's opinion.<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.<ref name=\"crimelibrary\" /><!--{{quotation|He went into his room and he had a little pair of trunks, brown trunks, that he put on.

They sailed from San Francisco to Hong Kong China. On arriving there he and two others went ashore and got drunk. When they returned the boat was gone. At that time there was a famine in China. Meat of any kind was from $1 to 3 Dollars a pound. So great was the suffering among the very poor that all children under 12 were sold to the Butchers to be cut up and sold for food in order to keep others from starving. A boy or girl under 14 was not safe in the street. You could go in any shop\nand ask for steak \u2013 chops \u2013 or stew meat. Part of the naked body of a boy or girl would be brought out and just what you wanted cut from it. A boy or girls behind which is the sweetest part of the body and sold as veal cutlet brought the highest price. John staid there so long he acquired a taste for human flesh. On his return to N.Y. he stole two boys one 7 one 11. Took them to his home stripped them naked tied them in a closet then burned everything they had on. Several times every day and night he spanked them \u2013 tortured them \u2013 to make their meat good and tender. First he killed the 11 yr old boy, because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it. Every part of his body was cooked and eaten except Head \u2013 bones and guts. He was roasted in the oven, (all of his ass) boiled, broiled, fried, stewed. The little boy was next, went the same way. At that time I was living at 409 E 100 St, rear \u2013 right side. He told me so often how good human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it. On Sunday June the 3 \u2013 1928 I called on you at 406 W 15 St. Brought you pot cheese \u2013 strawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat in my lap and kissed me. I made up my mind to eat her, on the pretense of taking her to a party. You said Yes she could go. I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out. When we got there, I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down stairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama. First I stripped her naked. How she did kick \u2013 bite and scratch. I choked her to death then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms, cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven.

He had been sexually assaulted, then strangled with his suspenders.<ref name=\"Schechter\"/> According to an autopsy, McDonnell had also suffered extensive lacerations to his legs and abdomen, and his left [[hamstring]] had almost entirely been stripped of its flesh.

She was still unconvinced that Albert Fish was her son's killer.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Trial and execution==\nAlbert Fish's trial for the murder of Grace Budd began on March 11, 1935, in [[White Plains, New York]]. Frederick P. Close presided as judge and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] Chief Assistant District Attorney Elbert F. Gallagher was prosecuting attorney. Fish's defense counsel was James Dempsey, a former prosecutor and the one-time mayor of [[Peekskill, New York]]. The trial lasted for 10 days. Fish pleaded [[insanity]], and claimed to have heard voices from God telling him to kill children. Several [[psychiatrist]]s testified about Fish's [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]], which included [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], [[flagellation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[voyeurism]], [[piquerism]], [[cannibalism]], [[coprophagia]], [[Urolagnia|urophilia]], [[pedophilia]] and [[infibulation]]. Dempsey in his summation noted that Fish was a \"psychiatric phenomenon\" and that nowhere in legal or medical records was there another individual who possessed so many sexual abnormalities.<ref name=\"Schechter\" />\n\nThe defense's chief expert witness was [[Fredric Wertham]], a psychiatrist with an emphasis on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1\u201324). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly \"sacrificing\" a boy would be [[penance]] for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but he turned out to be larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy.<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Wertham then detailed Fish's [[cannibalism]], which in his mind he associated with [[Communion rite|communion]]. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered \"He is insane\".<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an \"insane knowledge\".<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Fish Held Insane By Three Experts.

He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross examination, Dempsey asked if coprophilia, urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person. Gregory replied that such a person was not \"mentally sick\" and that these were common perversions that were \"socially perfectly alright\" and that Fish was \"no different from millions of other people\", some very prominent and successful, who suffered from the \"very same\" perversions. The next witness was the resident physician at [[The Tombs]], Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying on the issue of sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, \"That is not masochism\", as he was only \"punishing himself to get sexual gratification\". The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but \"was a matter of taste\" and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert's opinion.<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.<ref name=\"crimelibrary\" /><!--{{quotation|He went into his room and he had a little pair of trunks, brown trunks, that he put on.

The [[screenplay|teleplay]] by [[Arnold Schulman]] is based on the best-selling 1987 non-fiction book ''[[And the Band Played On|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic]]'' by [[Randy Shilts]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] before being broadcast by [[HBO]] on September 11, 1993. It later was released in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]]. The HBO movie was later aired on [[NBC]] in 1994. NBC (as well as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) were some of the networks considered to make a miniseries based on the book in the late 1980s, but the networks turned it down because they could not find a way to structure it as a two-night, four-hour miniseries. In 1994, NBC finally aired the movie with a parental discretion warning due to its sensitive subject matter.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a prologue set in 1976, American [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Don Francis]] arrives in a village on the banks of the [[Ebola River]] in [[Zaire]] and discovers many of the residents and the doctor working with them have died from a mysterious illness later identified as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola hemorrhagic fever]]. It is his first exposure to such an [[epidemic]], and the images of the dead he helps [[cremation|cremate]] will haunt him when he later becomes involved with [[HIV/AIDS]] research at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].\n\nIn 1981, Francis becomes aware of a growing number of deaths from unexplained sources among [[gay]] men in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], and is prompted to begin an in-depth investigation of the possible causes. Working with no money, limited space, and outdated equipment, he comes in contact with politicians, numerous members of the medical community (many of whom resent his involvement because of their personal agendas), and gay activists. Of the latter, some such as [[Bill Kraus]] support him, while others express resentment at what they see as unwanted interference in their lifestyles, especially in his attempts to close the local [[Gay bathhouse|bathhouses]]. One day, when exercising at a local gym, Kraus notices a spot at the base of his leg, worrying that it might be [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. After a series of blood tests, Kraus is horrified that his worst fears have been confirmed when he learns that he has been diagnosed with AIDS. While Francis pursues his theory that AIDS is caused by a [[sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted virus]] on the model of [[feline leukemia virus|feline leukemia]], he finds his efforts are stonewalled by the CDC, which is unwilling to prove the disease is transmitted through blood, and competing [[France|French]] and [[United States|American]] scientists, particularly [[Robert Gallo|Dr. Robert Gallo]]. These medical researchers squabble about who should receive credit for discovering the virus. Meanwhile, the death toll climbs rapidly.\n\n==Principal cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as [[Don Francis|Dr. Don Francis]], an epidemiologist, [[HIV/AIDS]] researcher, and one of the first scientists to suggest that AIDS was caused by an [[Pathogen|infectious agent]]\n* [[Alan Alda]] as [[Robert Gallo|Dr. Robert Gallo]], a biomedical researcher and one of the discoverers of HIV as the infectious agent responsible for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Bill Kraus]], a [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] and AIDS activist and congressional aide\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as [[Mary Guinan|Dr. Mary Guinan]], an investigator of the HIV/AIDS epidemic for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]\n* [[Richard Masur]] as [[William Darrow|Dr. William Darrow]], one of the discoverers of HIV as the virus that causes AIDS\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as Dr. James Curran, an investigator of the HIV/AIDS epidemic for the CDC\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as [[Selma Dritz|Dr. Selma Dritz]], a physician and epidemiologist\n* [[Jeffrey Nordling]] as [[Ga\u00ebtan Dugas]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[flight attendant]] who was an early AIDS patient\n* [[Donal Logue]] as [[Bobbi Campbell]], an AIDS activist\n* [[B.

The emotions and agony involved in this subject give ''Band'' an irresistible power, yet the movie's rhythm is choppy and the dialogue frequently stiff and clich\u00e9d.

directed by [[Roger Spottiswoode]]. The [[screenplay|teleplay]] by [[Arnold Schulman]] is based on the best-selling 1987 non-fiction book ''[[And the Band Played On|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic]]'' by [[Randy Shilts]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] before being broadcast by [[HBO]] on September 11, 1993. It later was released in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]]. The HBO movie was later aired on [[NBC]] in 1994. NBC (as well as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) were some of the networks considered to make a miniseries based on the book in the late 1980s, but the networks turned it down because they could not find a way to structure it as a two-night, four-hour miniseries. In 1994, NBC finally aired the movie with a parental discretion warning due to its sensitive subject matter.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a prologue set in 1976, American [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Don Francis]] arrives in a village on the banks of the [[Ebola River]] in [[Zaire]] and discovers many of the residents and the doctor working with them have died from a mysterious illness later identified as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola hemorrhagic fever]]. It is his first exposure to such an [[epidemic]], and the images of the dead he helps [[cremation|cremate]] will haunt him when he later becomes involved with [[HIV/AIDS]] research at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].\n\nIn 1981, Francis becomes aware of a growing number of deaths from unexplained sources among [[gay]] men in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], and is prompted to begin an in-depth investigation of the possible causes. Working with no money, limited space, and outdated equipment, he comes in contact with politicians, numerous members of the medical community (many of whom resent his involvement because of their personal agendas), and gay activists. Of the latter, some such as [[Bill Kraus]] support him, while others express resentment at what they see as unwanted interference in their lifestyles, especially in his attempts to close the local [[Gay bathhouse|bathhouses]]. One day, when exercising at a local gym, Kraus notices a spot at the base of his leg, worrying that it might be [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. After a series of blood tests, Kraus is horrified that his worst fears have been confirmed when he learns that he has been diagnosed with AIDS. While Francis pursues his theory that AIDS is caused by a [[sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted virus]] on the model of [[feline leukemia virus|feline leukemia]], he finds his efforts are stonewalled by the CDC, which is unwilling to prove the disease is transmitted through blood, and competing [[France|French]] and [[United States|American]] scientists, particularly [[Robert Gallo|Dr. Robert Gallo]]. These medical researchers squabble about who should receive credit for discovering the virus. Meanwhile, the death toll climbs rapidly.\n\n==Principal cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as [[Don Francis|Dr. Don Francis]], an epidemiologist, [[HIV/AIDS]] researcher, and one of the first scientists to suggest that AIDS was caused by an [[Pathogen|infectious agent]]\n* [[Alan Alda]] as [[Robert Gallo|Dr. Robert Gallo]], a biomedical researcher and one of the discoverers of HIV as the infectious agent responsible for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Bill Kraus]], a [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] and AIDS activist and congressional aide\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as [[Mary Guinan|Dr. Mary Guinan]], an investigator of the HIV/AIDS epidemic for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]\n* [[Richard Masur]] as [[William Darrow|Dr. William Darrow]], one of the discoverers of HIV as the virus that causes AIDS\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as Dr. James Curran, an investigator of the HIV/AIDS epidemic for the CDC\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as [[Selma Dritz|Dr. Selma Dritz]], a physician and epidemiologist\n* [[Jeffrey Nordling]] as [[Ga\u00ebtan Dugas]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[flight attendant]] who was an early AIDS patient\n* [[Donal Logue]] as [[Bobbi Campbell]], an AIDS activist\n* [[B.

Many critics praised the results. Film review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% \"Fresh\" rating]] based on eight reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/and_the_band_played_on/ |title=And the Band Played On (1993) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTony Scott of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that \"if there are lapses, director Spottiswoode's engrossing, powerful work still accomplishes its mission: Shilts's book, with all its shock, sorrow and anger, has been transferred decisively to the screen.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tony Scott |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901186.html?categoryid=32&cs=1&p=0 |title=Review: ''And the Band Played On''|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 30, 1993 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nJohn O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' agreed that the adaptation \"adds up to tough and uncommonly courageous television. Excessive tinkering has left the pacing of the film sluggish in spots, but the story is never less than compelling.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=John J.

The stars lend warmth to a movie necessarily preoccupied with cold research and politics, and they lend prestige: The movie must be important, since actors of this stature agreed to appear. The result of the stars' generosity, however, works against the movie by halting the flow of the drama every time a familiar face pops up on screen. The emotions and agony involved in this subject give ''Band'' an irresistible power, yet the movie's rhythm is choppy and the dialogue frequently stiff and clich\u00e9d. The best compliment one can pay this TV movie is to say that unlike so many fact-based films, it does not exploit or diminish the tragedy of its subject.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Ken Tucker]] |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307958,00.html |title=And the Band Played On |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=September 10, 1993 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a review from ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]]'', the writing team thought \"so keen were the makers of this adaptation of Randy Shilts's best-seller to bombard us with the facts and figures of the history of AIDS that they forgot to offer a properly dramatic human framework to make us care fully about the characters.\" The review also says that the multiple issues the film attempts to cover \"make for a disjointed, clich\u00e9d narrative.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/77950/And_the_Band_Played_On.html |title=And the Band Played On |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]] |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nRichard Zoglin of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote \"Shilts's prodigiously researched 600-page book has been boiled down to a fact-filled, dramatically coherent, occasionally moving 2 hours and 20 minutes. At a time when most made-for-TV movies have gone tabloid crazy, here is a rare one that tackles a big subject, raises the right issues, fights the good fight.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Zoglin

Headgear is most often used along with braces or other orthodontic appliances.

It is most effective for children and teenagers because their jaws are still developing and can be easily manipulated. (If an adult is fitted with headgear, it is usually to help correct the position of teeth that have shifted after other teeth have been extracted.)

On average, however, once the braces are put on, they usually remain in place for one to three years.

Headgear is most often used along with braces or other orthodontic appliances. While braces correct the position of teeth, orthodontic headgear\u2014which as the name suggests is worn on or is strapped onto the patient\u2019s head\u2014is most often added to orthodontic treatment to help alter the alignment of the jaw, although there are some situations in which such an appliance can help move teeth, particularly molars.\n\nWhatever the purpose, orthodontic headgear works by exerting tension on the braces via hooks, a facebow, coils, elastic bands, metal orthodontic bands, and other attachable appliances directly into the patient\u2019s mouth. It is most effective for children and teenagers because their jaws are still developing and can be easily manipulated. (If an adult is fitted with headgear, it is usually to help correct the position of teeth that have shifted after other teeth have been extracted.) Thus [[Orthodontic headgear|Headgear]] is typically used to treat a number of jaw alignment or bite problems such as [[overbite]] and underbite.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Millett DT, Cunningham SJ, O'Brien KD, Benson PE, de Oliveira CM | title = Orthodontic treatment for deep bite and retroclined upper front teeth in children | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD005972 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29390172 | pmc = 6491166 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005972.pub4 }}</ref>\n\n=== Palatal expansion ===\n[[Palatal expansion]] can be achieved using either fixed or removable appliances.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000979.pub2/full]</ref>\n\n=== Jaw surgery ===\n[[Jaw surgery]] may be required to fix severe malocclusions.

For example, ''wTourist'', ''Acrobat'', ''Hearthealer'' are MITE families in some plant species are under the TE superfamily ''PIF/Harbinger''. ''Stowaway'' is a MITE family in ''Pisum sativum L.'' with TSD TA in relation with ''Tc1/mariner''  TE superfamily. A group of MITEs known as CMITES related to ''Piggybac'' superfamily were found in certain coral species.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang S, Zhang L, Meyer E, Matz MV | title = Characterization of a group of MITEs with unusual features from two coral genomes | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = e10700 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20502527 | pmc = 2872659 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0010700 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...510700W }}</ref>\n\nWhile most of the MITEs are grouped, some of them are yet to be allotted their TE superfamilies. Such families include ''AtATE'' in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and ''ATon'' family found in ''Aedes aegypti''. Besides this, many more MITE families are likely to be discovered.\n\n== MITEs in Plant Genomes ==\nMITEs were first discovered in plants. Elements belonging to the ''CACTA'', ''hAT'', ''Mutator'', ''PIF'', and ''Tc1''/''Mariner'' superfamilies have been described.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Feschotte C, Pritham EJ | title = DNA transposons and the evolution of eukaryotic genomes | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 41 | pages = 331\u201368 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18076328 | pmc = 2167627 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.40.110405.090448 }}</ref> Depending upon the similarity of their terminal inverted repeats and target site duplications, most of the MITEs in plant genomes are divided into two major groups: ''Tourist''-like MITEs (derived from ''PIF'')<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang X, Jiang N, Feschotte C, Wessler SR | title = PIF- and Pong-like transposable elements: distribution, evolution and relationship with Tourist-like miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements | journal = Genetics | volume = 166 | issue = 2 | pages = 971\u201386 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 15020481 | pmc = 1470744 }}</ref> and ''Stowaway''-like MITEs (derived from ''Tc1''/''mariner'').<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bureau TE, Wessler SR | title = Stowaway: a new family of inverted repeat elements associated with the genes of both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 907\u201316 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8061524 | pmc = 160488 | doi = 10.2307/3869968 | jstor = 3869968 }}</ref>''Stowaway'' and ''Tourist'' elements  differ remarkably in their sequences but they have been found to have significant structural similarities.\n\n''Stowaway'' elements possess target site specificity, have small size and conserved terminal inverted repeat. So is the case determined in ''Tourist'' like MITEs. They can form stable DNA secondary structures which can be very useful in identifying them. A few ''Stowaway'' elements also contain cis-acting regulatory domains.\n\nOther MITE superfamilies have also been described in plants, such as ''hAT''-type MITEs in banana<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Menzel G, Heitkam T, Seibt KM, Nouroz F, M\u00fcller-Stoermer M, Heslop-Harrison JS, Schmidt T | title = The diversification and activity of hAT transposons in Musa genomes | journal = Chromosome Research | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 559\u201371 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25377178 | doi = 10.1007/s10577-014-9445-5 }}</ref> and the nightshades.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuang H, Padmanabhan C, Li F, Kamei A, Bhaskar PB, Ouyang S, Jiang J, Buell CR, Baker B | title = Identification of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) and biogenesis of their siRNAs in the Solanaceae: new functional implications for MITEs | journal = Genome Research | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 42\u201356 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19037014 | pmc = 2612961 | doi = 10.1101/gr.078196.108 | url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/1/42 }}</ref>\n\n== MITEs as Genetic Markers ==\nBased on the presence or absence of MITE family ''Heartbreaker'' (''Hbr'') in maize genome, a [[molecular marker]] was developed. These ''Hbr'' markers have been proved to be stable, uniformly distributed in maize genome. A study by Casa et al showed that HBr markers could be used along with other molecular markers to study genotype of related maize inbred lines<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Casa AM, Mitchell SE, Smith OS, Register JC, Wessler SR, Kresovich S | title = Evaluation of Hbr (MITE) markers for assessment of genetic relationships among maize ( Zea mays L.) inbred lines | journal = TAG.
