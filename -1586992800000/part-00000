At the age of eleven, Konitz received his first clarinet. However, he later dropped the instrument in favor of the tenor saxophone. He eventually moved from tenor to alto. His greatest influences at the time were the swing [[big bands]]  he and his brother listened to on the radio; hearing Goodman on the radio was what prodded him to ask for a clarinet.

A month later, the band broke up. Between 1945 and 1947, he worked intermittently with [[Jerry Wald]]. In 1946, he met pianist [[Lennie Tristano]], and the two worked together in a small cocktail bar. His next substantial work was with [[Claude Thornhill]] in 1947 with [[Gil Evans]] arranging and [[Gerry Mulligan]] as a composer.<ref>Hamilton, p. 265</ref><ref name=Gordon>Gordon, Jack. \"Lee Kontiz\", ''Jazz Journal'', December 1998, pp. 6\u20138</ref>\n\nHe participated with [[Miles Davis]] in a group that had a brief booking in September 1948 and another the following year, but he recorded in 1949 and 1950 the sides collected on the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' album. The presence of Konitz and other white musicians in the group angered some black jazz players because many were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms.\n\nKonitz has stated he considered the group to belong to Gerry Mulligan. His debut as leader also came in 1949 with sides collected on the album ''[[Subconscious-Lee]]''. ([[Prestige Records|Prestige]], 1955).<ref>Neal Umphred ''Goldmine's Price Guide to Collectible Jazz Albums' 1949\u201369'', [[Iola, Wisconsin]]: Krause Publications, 1994, p.290</ref> He turned down an opportunity to work with Goodman in 1949, a decision he regretted.<ref name=Gordon/> Parker lent him support on the day Konitz's child was born in Seattle, Washington, while he was stuck in New York City. The two were good friends, not the rivals some jazz critics made them out to be.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Konitz recorded and toured with [[Stan Kenton]]'s orchestra, but he continued to record as a leader. In 1961, he recorded ''[[Motion (Lee Konitz album)|Motion]]'' with [[Elvin Jones]] on drums and [[Sonny Dallas]] on bass. This spontaneous session consisted entirely of standards. The loose trio format aptly featured Konitz's unorthodox phrasing and chromaticism.\n\n[[File:lee-konitz.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Lee Konitz playing in [[Aarhus, Denmark]]]]\n\nIn 1967, Konitz recorded ''The Lee Konitz Duets'' in configurations that were often unusual for the period (saxophone and trombone, two saxophones). The recordings drew on nearly the entire history of jazz from [[Louis Armstrong]]'s \"Struttin' with Some Barbecue\" with valve trombonist [[Marshall Brown (musician)|Marshall Brown]] to two [[free improvisation]] duos: one with a [[Duke Ellington]] associate, violinist [[Ray Nance]], and one with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]].\n\nKonitz contributed to the film score for ''[[Desperate Characters]]'' (1971). In 1981, he performed at the [[Woodstock Jazz Festival]], which was held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the [[Creative Music Studio]].\n\nKonitz has worked with [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Attila Zoller]], Gerry Mulligan, and Elvin Jones. He recorded trio dates with [[Brad Mehldau]] and [[Charlie Haden]], released by Blue Note, as well as [[Live at Birdland (Lee Konitz album)|a live album recorded in 2009 at Birdland]] and released by ECM in 2011 with drummer [[Paul Motian]]. Konitz has become more experimental as he has grown older and has released a number of free jazz and avant-garde jazz albums, playing alongside many younger musicians. His album with [[Grace Kelly (musician)|Grace Kelly]] was given 4 1/2 stars by Michael Jackson in ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Michael|title=GRACEfulLEE Grace Kelly/Lee Konitz-Down Beat Review|url=http://www.downbeat.com/digitaledition/2008/db1108/_art/db1108.pdf|accessdate=2015-08-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915214636/http://www.downbeat.com/digitaledition/2008/DB1108/_art/DB1108.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-15}}</ref>\n\nHe has had problems with his heart for which he has received surgery in the past.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jung|first=Fred|title=A Fireside Chat With Lee Konitz|url=http://www.jazzweekly.com/interviews/konitz.htm|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> He was scheduled to appear at Melbourne's Recital Centre in 2011 for the Melbourne International Jazz Festival, but he canceled due to illness.\n\nIn August 2012 Konitz played to sell-out crowds at the [[Blue Note Jazz Club|Blue Note]] in Greenwich Village as part of Enfants Terribles, a collaboration with [[Bill Frisell]], [[Gary Peacock]], and [[Joey Baron]]. Days after his 87th birthday in 2014, he played three nights at Cafe Stritch in San Jose, California, with the Jeff Denson Trio, improvising on the old standards he favors.<ref>''San Jose Mercury News'', October 16, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Lee Konitz discography}}\n\n==Television appearances==\n*''[[SOLOS: The Jazz Sessions]]''<ref>[http://www.solosjazz.com/a_lee.php Lee Konitz].

He improvised on the saxophone before learning to play standards.<ref name=r1>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Michael|title=An interview with Lee Konitz|url=http://www.sawf.org/Newedit/edit09182000/musicarts.asp |accessdate=2007-05-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025727/http://www.sawf.org/Newedit/edit09182000/musicarts.asp|archivedate=2011-07-20}}</ref>\n\nKonitz began his professional career in 1945 with the [[Teddy Powell]] band as a replacement for [[Charlie Ventura]]. A month later, the band broke up. Between 1945 and 1947, he worked intermittently with [[Jerry Wald]]. In 1946, he met pianist [[Lennie Tristano]], and the two worked together in a small cocktail bar. His next substantial work was with [[Claude Thornhill]] in 1947 with [[Gil Evans]] arranging and [[Gerry Mulligan]] as a composer.<ref>Hamilton, p. 265</ref><ref name=Gordon>Gordon, Jack. \"Lee Kontiz\", ''Jazz Journal'', December 1998, pp. 6\u20138</ref>\n\nHe participated with [[Miles Davis]] in a group that had a brief booking in September 1948 and another the following year, but he recorded in 1949 and 1950 the sides collected on the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' album. The presence of Konitz and other white musicians in the group angered some black jazz players because many were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms.\n\nKonitz has stated he considered the group to belong to Gerry Mulligan. His debut as leader also came in 1949 with sides collected on the album ''[[Subconscious-Lee]]''. ([[Prestige Records|Prestige]], 1955).<ref>Neal Umphred ''Goldmine's Price Guide to Collectible Jazz Albums' 1949\u201369'', [[Iola, Wisconsin]]: Krause Publications, 1994, p.290</ref> He turned down an opportunity to work with Goodman in 1949, a decision he regretted.<ref name=Gordon/> Parker lent him support on the day Konitz's child was born in Seattle, Washington, while he was stuck in New York City. The two were good friends, not the rivals some jazz critics made them out to be.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Konitz recorded and toured with [[Stan Kenton]]'s orchestra, but he continued to record as a leader. In 1961, he recorded ''[[Motion (Lee Konitz album)|Motion]]'' with [[Elvin Jones]] on drums and [[Sonny Dallas]] on bass. This spontaneous session consisted entirely of standards. The loose trio format aptly featured Konitz's unorthodox phrasing and chromaticism.\n\n[[File:lee-konitz.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Lee Konitz playing in [[Aarhus, Denmark]]]]\n\nIn 1967, Konitz recorded ''The Lee Konitz Duets'' in configurations that were often unusual for the period (saxophone and trombone, two saxophones). The recordings drew on nearly the entire history of jazz from [[Louis Armstrong]]'s \"Struttin' with Some Barbecue\" with valve trombonist [[Marshall Brown (musician)|Marshall Brown]] to two [[free improvisation]] duos: one with a [[Duke Ellington]] associate, violinist [[Ray Nance]], and one with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]].\n\nKonitz contributed to the film score for ''[[Desperate Characters]]'' (1971). In 1981, he performed at the [[Woodstock Jazz Festival]], which was held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the [[Creative Music Studio]].\n\nKonitz has worked with [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Attila Zoller]], Gerry Mulligan, and Elvin Jones. He recorded trio dates with [[Brad Mehldau]] and [[Charlie Haden]], released by Blue Note, as well as [[Live at Birdland (Lee Konitz album)|a live album recorded in 2009 at Birdland]] and released by ECM in 2011 with drummer [[Paul Motian]]. Konitz has become more experimental as he has grown older and has released a number of free jazz and avant-garde jazz albums, playing alongside many younger musicians. His album with [[Grace Kelly (musician)|Grace Kelly]] was given 4 1/2 stars by Michael Jackson in ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Michael|title=GRACEfulLEE Grace Kelly/Lee Konitz-Down Beat Review|url=http://www.downbeat.com/digitaledition/2008/db1108/_art/db1108.pdf|accessdate=2015-08-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915214636/http://www.downbeat.com/digitaledition/2008/DB1108/_art/DB1108.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-15}}</ref>\n\nHe has had problems with his heart for which he has received surgery in the past.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jung|first=Fred|title=A Fireside Chat With Lee Konitz|url=http://www.jazzweekly.com/interviews/konitz.htm|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> He was scheduled to appear at Melbourne's Recital Centre in 2011 for the Melbourne International Jazz Festival, but he canceled due to illness.\n\nIn August 2012 Konitz played to sell-out crowds at the [[Blue Note Jazz Club|Blue Note]] in Greenwich Village as part of Enfants Terribles, a collaboration with [[Bill Frisell]], [[Gary Peacock]], and [[Joey Baron]]. Days after his 87th birthday in 2014, he played three nights at Cafe Stritch in San Jose, California, with the Jeff Denson Trio, improvising on the old standards he favors.<ref>''San Jose Mercury News'', October 16, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Lee Konitz discography}}\n\n==Television appearances==\n*''[[SOLOS: The Jazz Sessions]]''<ref>[http://www.solosjazz.com/a_lee.php Lee Konitz].
