The premise of the show has the presenters on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget then selling it to a new owner.\n\nThe programme was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood the founding directors of Attaboy TV both long-time car enthusiasts.\n\nThere have so far been 15 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being \"Balaclava\" by the [[Wideboys]]. The previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4.Series 1 originally aired in 2003. The second half of Series 6 was aired in autumn of 2009 on [[Discovery Real Time]].Series 5 was renamed to Wheeler Dealers On the Road in this series Brewer and China expanded their car search by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. Beginning with part 2 of Series 8, Brewer further expanded their horizon by touring the [[United States]]. In Series 12, Brewer and China set up a new workshop in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Series 12 also introduced the brand new workshop back in the UK.\n\nIn April 2013 a spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers Trading Up was launched. This series was produced by X2 Productions Ltd and has Brewer travelling around the world to buy and sell, but not repair or restore, used cars in different countries on a set budget. He begins with $3,000 and trades his way through the series up to a [[Porsche 911]]. It was recommissioned by Discovery Channel International for a second series where Brewer ends up buying a Ferrari.\n\n== Format ==\nIn each episode, Brewer buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it on. For the first series, the budget was \u00a31,000, for series 2, \u00a32,000, and for series 3, \u00a33,000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a \u00a310,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a [[Ferrari GT4|Ferrari Dino 308 GT4]] in series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as \"up to \u00a320,000\".\n\nThe presentation for each project usually follows a similar [[TV format]]. Through series 6, the project was presented in two 30-minute episodes. Starting with series 7, the format was changed to single 60 minute (including commercials) episodes.\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe programme was created with a [[Do-it-yourself|DIYer]] in mind. The costs, and thus any profit or loss for a given project, are assessed without consideration of the [[Wage|labour costs]] of the mechanic (the assumption is that a well-equipped and able enthusiast could complete all work him or herself) but if repairs require professional help, like body resprays, complicated electronics, or windscreen replacements, they are added to the final cost.\n\nAlso addressed on each vehicle are its service history, bodywork defects (e.g. rust, dents), worn-out interiors and accessories. Vehicles that have either been inactive for long periods of time or purchased from outside the UK are restored and modified to pass the country's mandatory [[MOT test]].\n\n=== Part one ===\n* Brewer starts with a budget to buy and then fix up a vehicle.\n* Brewer gives a brief history of the merits of the chosen model of vehicle.\n* Brewer locates, test drives, negotiates for and buys the vehicle (usually sealed with a handshake and Brewer triumphantly expressing to camera that he's just bought a <name of vehicle>).\n** (Starting from series 5, prospective cars Brewer wanted to buy, but needed too much work, were shown. This also took place in Series 1, Episode 7)\n* Brewer turns the vehicle over to the mechanic, and together they assess its needs.\n* The mechanic begins work, providing assessments of the work and its challenges.\n* Brewer stops by the workshop for an overview of progress, and expenditures are reviewed.\n\n=== Part two ===\n* A quick review of the first episode (for series where each project is split into two episodes).\n* Brewer goes on a field trip to procure some required parts.\n* Brewer interviews an owner of a similar vehicle in top condition, then drives and comments on the car. Brewer also assesses the merit and likelihood of getting the Wheeler Dealers example to the same condition as the example he is driving.\n** (This feature was dropped from series 5 onwards.)\n* The mechanic finishes the work on the project vehicle which is subsequently shown on a revolving turntable.\n* Brewer returns to the workshop and discusses the finished vehicle with the mechanic.\n* There is a final tally of expenditures.\n* Brewer drives the completed car, assessing improvements.\n** (Starting from series 5, Brewer and the mechanic test drive the finished vehicle together and discuss its resale value.)\n* Brewer sells the vehicle to a new owner (after the inevitable haggling). The deal is sealed when Brewer says, \"Hold out your hand, you've just bought a <name of vehicle>!\" and shakes the new buyer's hand.\n* Brewer summarises what the final selling price and profit is (or in rare instances what the loss is) and usually states that they have saved another vehicle to be enjoyed by the new owner.\n** (Starting from series 5, prospective buyers who failed to buy the car are shown.)\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Mike Brewer (television presenter)|Mike Brewer]] uses his skills as a former car trader to scout and buy used cars to be restored and sold for profit. He's also responsible for procuring replacement parts and sometimes specialists to refurbish expensive parts.\n\n[[Edd China]] as the show's mechanic from series 1 to 13, doing much of the restoration and mechanical/servicing work, and giving viewers tips on how to sort out and solve various car problems, as well as estimating how much a garage would charge for such repairs. On 21 March 2017, Velocity announced that China had left the show \"to pursue other projects\" and that he would be replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. He explained that he chose to leave because he was disagreeing with the channel, which wanted to cut down his fixes in the workshop. As, since series 13 the programme is produced by [[Discovery Studios]] (instead of Attaboy TV for the 12 previous seasons for Velocity (now [[Motor Trend (TV network)|Motor Trend Network]]), [[Discovery Communications]] has strengthened its control on ''Wheeler Dealers'' and according to China,<ref name=\"WantEdd\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IB15T1LYiY&list=PL1kPAxOddPS_4DNLIkRg5HT51KiFN_m8r/|title=Edd China on leaving Wheeler Dealers|date=21 March 2017|access-date=8 October 2017|website=youtube.com}}</ref> it would seem it found its production too expensive.\n\nPaul Brackley, the series' technical advisor, made sporadic appearances to assist China in carrying heavy parts or equipment in the garage, when China needed additional assistance (such as when China was bleeding brake/clutch fluid or checking an exhaust while a vehicle was running), and helping Brewer tow non-running or non-MOT-compliant vehicles to the shop.\n\n=== Guest appearances on other shows ===\nWhile buying more American cars for the show, Brewer dropped in on [[Chip Foose]] during the 2 June 2013 episode of ''[[Overhaulin']]'', where Foose showed Brewer the 1972 [[Lotus Europa]] he was customising.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Wheeler Dealers episodes}}\n\nAs of 27 April 2020 175 episodes have been shown covering 175 different vehicles with 9 recap episodes.\n\n=== ''Wheeler Dealers'' ===\nFor series 1 to 6, each car was covered in two half an hour episodes (including ad breaks).

After having to refurbish the brake calipers, swap the engine and giving the car a new paint job, they were able to sell it for 135,000 SEK, giving them a total profit of 28,000 SEK.\n\n=== U.S. Top 5 Specials ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width: 40%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=5% |Series\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=5% |Episodes\n!colspan=\"2\" |Originally aired\n|-\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series premiere\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series finale\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#FF0000;\"|\n| '''1'''\n| 5\n| 5 June 2013\n| 3 July 2013\n|}\n[[Discovery (TV channel)|Discovery U.S.]]'s [[Motor Trend (TV network)|Velocity]] channel commissioned a series of one-hour ''Wheeler Dealers: Top 5'' Specials hosted by Mike Brewer, featuring the top five vehicles of each genre Brewer and China have worked on during the first nine years of the show.

if they are not in running order or street legal.\n\nBrewer has used a [[Mitsubishi Pajero#Fourth generation (2006\u2013present)|Mitsubishi Shogun]] to travel around England since series 9 (2012). Vehicles used prior to series 9 include a dark turquoise [[Nissan Primera#P12 (2002\u20132008)|Nissan Primera Estate]], a blue [[Subaru Legacy (fourth generation)|Subaru Legacy Estate]], a red [[Honda Accord (Japan and Europe seventh generation)|Honda Accord Tourer]], a black [[SsangYong Rexton#Second generation (2006\u2013present)|SsangYong Rexton II]], a dark blue [[SsangYong Kyron]], a black [[Land Rover Discovery#Discovery 4 / LR4|Land Rover Discovery 4]], a blue [[Nissan X-Trail]] and a light blue [[Ford Kuga]]. For Series 8a, he used a black X-Trail. For Series 12b, he used a white [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter#Second generation|Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] to transport the [[Messerschmitt KR200]] back to the workshop.\n\nWhen Brewer travelled to [[France]] in series 5 to purchase a Citro\u00ebn DS, he rented a French-registered black [[Opel Zafira]]; he rented a [[Opel Zafira#Zafira B|newer version of the Zafira]] when he returned to France to buy the Renault Alpine A310 in series 9a. Brewer used a French-registered silver [[Toyota Corolla Verso#Third generation (2004-2009)|Toyota Corolla Verso]] when he returned to buy the Citro\u00ebn 2CV in series 11a. When he returned to France in series 12b, he rented a French-registered grey [[Audi Q3]] to purchase the Citro\u00ebn HY.\n\n=== ''Trading Up'' ===\nFor ''Trading Up'', Brewer drove a white [[Toyota Fortuner]] owned by a used car dealer in India. In Dubai, Brewer's contact drove him around in a white [[Ferrari F430]]. In Texas, Brewer used a grey [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]]. Taxicabs featured in the series included a yellow Hindustan Ambassador Grand and a green and yellow [[Bajaj Auto|Bajaj]] RE in India, a black LTC TX4 in the UK, a black [[Toyota Crown Comfort]] in Japan, a yellow and red Volkswagen Sedan Type 1 in Mexico, a white [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] in Australia, a white Chevrolet Onix Sedan in Brazil, a yellow [[Dodge Charger]] in Texas, and a yellow [[Fiat 600 Multipla]] in Italy. For Hire Cars, he rented a Black [[Mitsubishi Pajero#Fourth generation (2006\u2013present)|Mitsubishi Shogun]] in the UK, a black [[Chrysler Grand Voyager]] in Brazil, a dark red [[GMC Yukon]] in Texas, a grey [[Land Rover Discovery#Discovery 3 / LR3|Land Rover Discovery 3]] in Poland, and a white [[Fiat 500 (2007)|Fiat 500]] in Italy. In Poland, when Brewer is taking the Fiat 126p to get vinyl wrapped, he borrowed a grey [[Opel Movano]], to carry the car to the vinyl wrapping shop.\n\nFor the ''Wheeler Dealers: Top 5'' US specials, Brewer stood in China's shop, in front of a red [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]].\n\n=== Intro/segment vehicles ===\nThe opening sequences and filler segments from series 1 to 9 featured the cars that were worked on throughout their corresponding seasons:\n\n*Series 1: All the vehicles done so far\n*Series 2 and 3: MGB GT\n*Series 4: Porsche 911 2.7S Targa\n*Series 5: Mercedes-Benz R107 280SL\n*Series 6: Ferrari Dino 308 GT4\n*Series 7: Lotus Elan S3\n*Series 8a: Jaguar E-Type Series 3\n*Series 8b: Dodge Charger\n*Series 9a: Fiat Dino\n*Series 9b: Gardner Douglas Cobra\n\nSeries 10 did away with using cars on the opening and commercial break sequences, instead using a title card with the series logo and the colour(s) of the episode's car on the background. The filler segments, however, used the following cars:\n\n*Series 10a: Aston Martin DB7\n*Series 10b: Lamborghini Urraco P250S\n\nStarting with series 11, ''Wheeler Dealers'' no longer uses cars on the filler segments.\n\n==International productions==\nThe popularity of the original UK series led to a French-language spinoff titled '''''Wheeler Dealers France''''', which premiered on 10 October 2016 on [[RMC D\u00e9couverte]]. The series is presented by Gerry Blyenberg and Aur\u00e9lien Letheux. Brewer made a special guest appearance on season 2 episode 1 of the series.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Deals on Wheels]]'' - An earlier programme presented by Brewer with a similar premise.\n*''[[Salvage Hunters]]'' - A similar concept series, related to buying and selling [[antique]]s\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://wheelerdealers.discoveryuk.com}} ([[Discovery (UK and Ireland)|Discovery UK]])\n* {{Official website|https://watch.motortrend.com/tv-shows/wheeler-dealers/}} ([[Motor Trend (TV network)|Motor Trend Network]])\n* {{YouTube|u=WheelerDealersTV|''{{PAGENAMEBASE}}''|suffix='}}\n\n[[Category:2000s British television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British television series]]\n[[Category:2003 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Automotive television series]]\n[[Category:Discovery Channel original programming]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration of vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the 1963 film|The Wheeler Dealers}}\n{{Use|date=January 2015}}\n{{Infobox television\n | show_name = Wheeler Dealers\n | image = WheelerDealersTitleCard.jpg\n | caption = Series 14 title card\n | show_name_2 = Wheeler Dealers: On the Road <small>(Series 5)</small>\n | country = [[United Kingdom]]\n | network = [[Discovery Real Time]] <small>(2003-2010)</small><br/>[[Discovery Channel (UK TV channel)|Discovery Channel]] <small>(2011-2015)</small><br/> [[Motor Trend]]<small> (2016-present)</small>\n | creator = Daniel Allum<br/>Michael Wood\n | presenter = [[Mike Brewer]]<br/>[[Edd China]] <small>(Series 1-13)</small><br/>[[Ant Anstead]] <small>(Series 14-)</small>\n | num_series = 15 <small>(Wheeler Dealers)</small><br>2 <small>(Trading Up)</small>\n | num_episodes = 175 + 9 Specials <small>(as of 27 April 2020) </small> \n | list_episodes = List of Wheeler Dealers episodes\n | runtime = 30 minutes <small>(Series 1-6)</small><br/>60 minutes <small>(Series 7-)</small>\n | first_aired = {{Start date|2003|10|7|df=y}}\n | last_aired = present\n | company    = Attaboy TV <small>(Series 1-12)</small><br/>[[Discovery Studios]]\n | opentheme = \"[[Balaclava]]\"\n | theme_music_composer = [[The Wideboys]]\n}}\n\n\nWheeler Dealers is a British television series originally produced by Attaboy TV for the [[Discovery Channel]] in the UK and [[Motor Trend]] in the U.S. The programme is fronted by car enthusiast [[Mike Brewer]].[[Edd China]] served as the programmes mechanic for series 1 to 13; he was replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. The premise of the show has the presenters on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget then selling it to a new owner.\n\nThe programme was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood the founding directors of Attaboy TV both long-time car enthusiasts.\n\nThere have so far been 15 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being \"Balaclava\" by the [[Wideboys]]. The previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4.Series 1 originally aired in 2003. The second half of Series 6 was aired in autumn of 2009 on [[Discovery Real Time]].Series 5 was renamed to Wheeler Dealers On the Road in this series Brewer and China expanded their car search by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. Beginning with part 2 of Series 8, Brewer further expanded their horizon by touring the [[United States]]. In Series 12, Brewer and China set up a new workshop in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Series 12 also introduced the brand new workshop back in the UK.\n\nIn April 2013 a spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers Trading Up was launched. This series was produced by X2 Productions Ltd and has Brewer travelling around the world to buy and sell, but not repair or restore, used cars in different countries on a set budget. He begins with $3,000 and trades his way through the series up to a [[Porsche 911]]. It was recommissioned by Discovery Channel International for a second series where Brewer ends up buying a Ferrari.\n\n== Format ==\nIn each episode, Brewer buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it on. For the first series, the budget was \u00a31,000, for series 2, \u00a32,000, and for series 3, \u00a33,000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a \u00a310,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a [[Ferrari GT4|Ferrari Dino 308 GT4]] in series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as \"up to \u00a320,000\".\n\nThe presentation for each project usually follows a similar [[TV format]]. Through series 6, the project was presented in two 30-minute episodes. Starting with series 7, the format was changed to single 60 minute (including commercials) episodes.\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe programme was created with a [[Do-it-yourself|DIYer]] in mind. The costs, and thus any profit or loss for a given project, are assessed without consideration of the [[Wage|labour costs]] of the mechanic (the assumption is that a well-equipped and able enthusiast could complete all work him or herself) but if repairs require professional help, like body resprays, complicated electronics, or windscreen replacements, they are added to the final cost.\n\nAlso addressed on each vehicle are its service history, bodywork defects (e.g. rust, dents), worn-out interiors and accessories. Vehicles that have either been inactive for long periods of time or purchased from outside the UK are restored and modified to pass the country's mandatory [[MOT test]].\n\n=== Part one ===\n* Brewer starts with a budget to buy and then fix up a vehicle.\n* Brewer gives a brief history of the merits of the chosen model of vehicle.\n* Brewer locates, test drives, negotiates for and buys the vehicle (usually sealed with a handshake and Brewer triumphantly expressing to camera that he's just bought a <name of vehicle>).\n** (Starting from series 5, prospective cars Brewer wanted to buy, but needed too much work, were shown. This also took place in Series 1, Episode 7)\n* Brewer turns the vehicle over to the mechanic, and together they assess its needs.\n* The mechanic begins work, providing assessments of the work and its challenges.\n* Brewer stops by the workshop for an overview of progress, and expenditures are reviewed.\n\n=== Part two ===\n* A quick review of the first episode (for series where each project is split into two episodes).\n* Brewer goes on a field trip to procure some required parts.\n* Brewer interviews an owner of a similar vehicle in top condition, then drives and comments on the car. Brewer also assesses the merit and likelihood of getting the Wheeler Dealers example to the same condition as the example he is driving.\n** (This feature was dropped from series 5 onwards.)\n* The mechanic finishes the work on the project vehicle which is subsequently shown on a revolving turntable.\n* Brewer returns to the workshop and discusses the finished vehicle with the mechanic.\n* There is a final tally of expenditures.\n* Brewer drives the completed car, assessing improvements.\n** (Starting from series 5, Brewer and the mechanic test drive the finished vehicle together and discuss its resale value.)\n* Brewer sells the vehicle to a new owner (after the inevitable haggling). The deal is sealed when Brewer says, \"Hold out your hand, you've just bought a <name of vehicle>!\" and shakes the new buyer's hand.\n* Brewer summarises what the final selling price and profit is (or in rare instances what the loss is) and usually states that they have saved another vehicle to be enjoyed by the new owner.\n** (Starting from series 5, prospective buyers who failed to buy the car are shown.)\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Mike Brewer (television presenter)|Mike Brewer]] uses his skills as a former car trader to scout and buy used cars to be restored and sold for profit. He's also responsible for procuring replacement parts and sometimes specialists to refurbish expensive parts.\n\n[[Edd China]] as the show's mechanic from series 1 to 13, doing much of the restoration and mechanical/servicing work, and giving viewers tips on how to sort out and solve various car problems, as well as estimating how much a garage would charge for such repairs. On 21 March 2017, Velocity announced that China had left the show \"to pursue other projects\" and that he would be replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. He explained that he chose to leave because he was disagreeing with the channel, which wanted to cut down his fixes in the workshop. As, since series 13 the programme is produced by [[Discovery Studios]] (instead of Attaboy TV for the 12 previous seasons for Velocity (now [[Motor Trend (TV network)|Motor Trend Network]]), [[Discovery Communications]] has strengthened its control on ''Wheeler Dealers'' and according to China,<ref name=\"WantEdd\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IB15T1LYiY&list=PL1kPAxOddPS_4DNLIkRg5HT51KiFN_m8r/|title=Edd China on leaving Wheeler Dealers|date=21 March 2017|access-date=8 October 2017|website=youtube.com}}</ref> it would seem it found its production too expensive.\n\nPaul Brackley, the series' technical advisor, made sporadic appearances to assist China in carrying heavy parts or equipment in the garage, when China needed additional assistance (such as when China was bleeding brake/clutch fluid or checking an exhaust while a vehicle was running), and helping Brewer tow non-running or non-MOT-compliant vehicles to the shop.\n\n=== Guest appearances on other shows ===\nWhile buying more American cars for the show, Brewer dropped in on [[Chip Foose]] during the 2 June 2013 episode of ''[[Overhaulin']]'', where Foose showed Brewer the 1972 [[Lotus Europa]] he was customising.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Wheeler Dealers episodes}}\n\nAs of 27 April 2020 175 episodes have been shown covering 175 different vehicles with 9 recap episodes.\n\n=== ''Wheeler Dealers'' ===\nFor series 1 to 6, each car was covered in two half an hour episodes (including ad breaks). From series 7 onwards, each car was covered in a single 60 minute episode.\n\n<!-- Series overview table transcluded from [[List of Wheeler Dealers episodes]] \u2013 edits to the table need to be made at THAT article -->\n{{:List of Wheeler Dealers episodes}}\n\n=== ''Trading Up'' ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width: 40%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=5% |Series\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=5% | Episodes\n!colspan=\"2\" | Originally aired\n|-\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series premiere\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series finale\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#9932CC;\"|\n| '''[[#Series 1 (2013)|1]]'''\n| 6\n| 2 April 2013\n| 7 May 2013\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#25262a;\"|\n| '''[[#Series 2 (2014)|2]]'''\n| 6\n| 6 August 2014\n| 10 September 2014\n|}\n\n=== Sweden Special ===\nOn 2 April 2012, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] version of the Discovery Channel aired a special episode called ''Wheeler Dealers Sverige Special'' (''Wheeler Dealers Sweden Special''). In this episode, the Swedish presenters bought a [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]] for 55,000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]]. After having to refurbish the brake calipers, swap the engine and giving the car a new paint job, they were able to sell it for 135,000 SEK, giving them a total profit of 28,000 SEK.\n\n=== U.S. Top 5 Specials ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width: 40%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=5% |Series\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=5% |Episodes\n!colspan=\"2\" |Originally aired\n|-\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series premiere\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series finale\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#FF0000;\"|\n| '''1'''\n| 5\n| 5 June 2013\n| 3 July 2013\n|}\n[[Discovery (TV channel)|Discovery U.S.]]'s [[Motor Trend (TV network)|Velocity]] channel commissioned a series of one-hour ''Wheeler Dealers: Top 5'' Specials hosted by Mike Brewer, featuring the top five vehicles of each genre Brewer and China have worked on during the first nine years of the show.

When he returned to France in series 12b, he rented a French-registered grey [[Audi Q3]] to purchase the Citro\u00ebn HY.\n\n=== ''Trading Up'' ===\nFor ''Trading Up'', Brewer drove a white [[Toyota Fortuner]] owned by a used car dealer in India. In Dubai, Brewer's contact drove him around in a white [[Ferrari F430]]. In Texas, Brewer used a grey [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]]. Taxicabs featured in the series included a yellow Hindustan Ambassador Grand and a green and yellow [[Bajaj Auto|Bajaj]] RE in India, a black LTC TX4 in the UK, a black [[Toyota Crown Comfort]] in Japan, a yellow and red Volkswagen Sedan Type 1 in Mexico, a white [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] in Australia, a white Chevrolet Onix Sedan in Brazil, a yellow [[Dodge Charger]] in Texas, and a yellow [[Fiat 600 Multipla]] in Italy. For Hire Cars, he rented a Black [[Mitsubishi Pajero#Fourth generation (2006\u2013present)|Mitsubishi Shogun]] in the UK, a black [[Chrysler Grand Voyager]] in Brazil, a dark red [[GMC Yukon]] in Texas, a grey [[Land Rover Discovery#Discovery 3 / LR3|Land Rover Discovery 3]] in Poland, and a white [[Fiat 500 (2007)|Fiat 500]] in Italy. In Poland, when Brewer is taking the Fiat 126p to get vinyl wrapped, he borrowed a grey [[Opel Movano]], to carry the car to the vinyl wrapping shop.\n\nFor the ''Wheeler Dealers: Top 5'' US specials, Brewer stood in China's shop, in front of a red [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]].\n\n=== Intro/segment vehicles ===\nThe opening sequences and filler segments from series 1 to 9 featured the cars that were worked on throughout their corresponding seasons:\n\n*Series 1: All the vehicles done so far\n*Series 2 and 3: MGB GT\n*Series 4: Porsche 911 2.7S Targa\n*Series 5: Mercedes-Benz R107 280SL\n*Series 6: Ferrari Dino 308 GT4\n*Series 7: Lotus Elan S3\n*Series 8a: Jaguar E-Type Series 3\n*Series 8b: Dodge Charger\n*Series 9a: Fiat Dino\n*Series 9b: Gardner Douglas Cobra\n\nSeries 10 did away with using cars on the opening and commercial break sequences, instead using a title card with the series logo and the colour(s) of the episode's car on the background. The filler segments, however, used the following cars:\n\n*Series 10a: Aston Martin DB7\n*Series 10b: Lamborghini Urraco P250S\n\nStarting with series 11, ''Wheeler Dealers'' no longer uses cars on the filler segments.\n\n==International productions==\nThe popularity of the original UK series led to a French-language spinoff titled '''''Wheeler Dealers France''''', which premiered on 10 October 2016 on [[RMC D\u00e9couverte]]. The series is presented by Gerry Blyenberg and Aur\u00e9lien Letheux. Brewer made a special guest appearance on season 2 episode 1 of the series.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Deals on Wheels]]'' - An earlier programme presented by Brewer with a similar premise.\n*''[[Salvage Hunters]]'' - A similar concept series, related to buying and selling [[antique]]s\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://wheelerdealers.discoveryuk.com}} ([[Discovery (UK and Ireland)|Discovery UK]])\n* {{Official website|https://watch.motortrend.com/tv-shows/wheeler-dealers/}} ([[Motor Trend (TV network)|Motor Trend Network]])\n* {{YouTube|u=WheelerDealersTV|''{{PAGENAMEBASE}}''|suffix='}}\n\n[[Category:2000s British television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British television series]]\n[[Category:2003 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Automotive television series]]\n[[Category:Discovery Channel original programming]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration of vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:8cac:c000:31a8:61ee:18b9:2231", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_Dealers"}

{"title_page": "Surrogate model", "text_new": "A '''surrogate model''' is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured,{{disputed inline|Used when outcome cannot be directly measured?|date=January 2020}} so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.\n\nOne way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].\n\nThough using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.\n\n==Goals==\n\nThe scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:\n\n* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)\n* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias-variance trade-off)\n* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.\n\nThe accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.\n\n==Types of surrogate models==\n\nPopular surrogate modeling approaches are: polynomial [[response surface]]s; [[kriging]]; [[gradient-enhanced kriging]] (GEK); [[radial basis function]]; [[support vector machine]]s; [[space mapping]] <ref name=\"space mapping\">J.W.

In addition, there is no consensus on how to obtain the most reliable estimates of the accuracy of a given surrogate.\nMany other problems have known physics properties.

Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.\n\nOne way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].\n\nThough using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.\n\n==Goals==\n\nThe scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:\n\n* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)\n* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias-variance trade-off)\n* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.\n\nThe accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.\n\n==Types of surrogate models==\n\nPopular surrogate modeling approaches are: polynomial [[response surface]]s; [[kriging]]; [[gradient-enhanced kriging]] (GEK); [[radial basis function]]; [[support vector machine]]s; [[space mapping]] <ref name=\"space mapping\">[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1262727 J.W.

It is located off Belsize Avenue and can also be accessed from Glenloch Road. It is one of the many purpose built mansion blocks on Haverstock Hill between [[Chalk Farm]] and [[Hampstead]]. It is close to the amenities near [[Belsize Park tube station]], as well as the shops of Belsize Village, South End Green and Hampstead.\n\n== Site history ==\n\nHillfield Court sits on what was once a large country estate known as the Belsize Estate. The first recorded building on the site of what today is Hillfield Court was built in around 1646. It was known as the ''Blue House'' and was one of many rural abodes in the area belonging to wealthy merchants, who wanted a country residence within easy reach of London. The Blue House was accessed directly from Haverstock Hill. Little is known about the residents of the Blue House but evidence suggests that in 1650 it was occupied by one John Mascall and in 1679 by Thomas Butler. Between 1761 and 1773, the house was rebuilt and extended by merchant William Horsley.\n\nIn 1808, the Belsize Estate was split into 9 leasehold estates. The Hillfield leasehold, as well as the adjoining Belsize House leasehold (around {{convert|19|acre|m2}} in total) were bought by James Abel.[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/image.aspx?compid=22638&filename=fig09.gif]\n\nIn 1841 Basil Woodd, a [[Bond Street]] brandy merchant bought the lease from Abel, a {{convert|19|acre|m2|adj=on}} estate set within the boundaries of [[Belsize Avenue]], [[Belsize Park Gardens]] and [[Belsize Grove]]. By this time, the area to the west of Haverstock Hill was dotted with many country abodes. The former ''Blue House'' had by this stage been renovated, modernised and renamed ''Heathfield House'', a stuccoed 6-bedroom house with a library. Woodd acquired the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] of the land in 1857 and renamed the house ''Hillfield''. Sometime between 1864 and 1867 he built another house on the south end of the estate for his son Robert Ballard Woodd - This house was called Woodlands. Whilst Woodlands was demolished in 1901 to make way for higher density housing, Hillfield remained until 1928 when it was demolished.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22638 Hampstead - Belsize | British History Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The land was bought by Hillfield Estates Ltd, a company formed in 1933 by FL, WJ and AG Griggs (Frank, William and Alfred).\n\nThe activities of Griggs & Son Ltd of Victoria St, London included land development in Pinner, building theatres<ref>http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk</ref> for the Astoria group in London and in [[Astoria Theatre, Brighton|Brighton (1933)]] and building at least two other theatres in the West End. Griggs & Son developed the Hillfield site to cater for the high demand for mansion blocks. The destruction of the old house and the development of the estate was met with some local opposition, however.\n\n== The building ==\n\nHillfield Court, so named in commemoration of the grand house, was just one part of the development. The scheme also included two other mansion blocks - Tudor Close (1935) to the back of the estate; and on Haverstock Hill, a parade of shops with Hillfield Mansions above (1934), which remained in the ownership of Hillfield Estates Ltd for many years. The parade incorporated an Odeon cinema, one of the first in London, which opened in September 1934.<ref>http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/15082</ref> The flagship of the Odeon chain for several years, it was demolished in the 1970s. It was replaced by the highly regarded Screen on the Hill cinema (since changed hands & renamed the Everyman Belsize Park).\n\nThe architect for the flats (and the cinema) was [[Tp bennett]]; he also designed the block of flats on nearby Finchley Road, above what is now a Waitrose store. The practice he founded continues today. His design for Hillfield Court provided 113 flats over six storeys, in seven different layouts and intended to suit a variety of tenants. Bennett had given much thought to the planning of apartment buildings for London.<ref>Architectural Design and Construction, May\u2013June 1935</ref> At Hillfield Court, he adopted the 'dining-hall' in some layouts, for more efficient use of the available space. There were hand-operated hoists from the ground floor so groceries, etc. could be delivered direct to every kitchen. A boiler room provides hot water to all flats and heating to common parts. Originally there was a central store for tenants' own coal, carried up by porters to be burned on the open fires. From its inception Hillfield Court was considered a very prestigious block, not least because of its magnificent, spacious gardens.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] a [[barrage balloon]] was anchored on the Hillfield Court lawn. [[Royal Air Force]] personnel were housed in a ground floor flat ready to launch the balloon when necessary. These large, airborne barriers protected important installations against low-level air attack. A brick bunkhouse built for the crew remains, now used as the garden shed.\n\nThe flats were rented out on short leases until in 1969, [[inflation]] saw tenants for the first time being given the opportunity to purchase their flats on a 99-year [[lease]]. For a while the family firm continued to manage the block directly but in the mid-1970s, the building was placed in the hands of managing agents. By that stage the principal shareholder was FE (Francis) Griggs and when he died in 1977, control of the freehold passed to Mrs JL Griggs. Eventually, according to various residents, there came the shattering news that Hillfield Court had been sold - unfortunately, to \"unscrupulous experts at [[asset stripping]]\".<ref>Hillfield Court newsletter, 1998</ref> The twenty one flats that were still rented out were then sold on long leases to a property company. There was talk of building townhouses with garages and an access road on the much-loved gardens.\n\nFighting back vigorously, the [[Residents Association]] organised speeches, TV interviews and meetings with [[Camden Council (New South Wales)|Camden Council]] in the hope of saving their garden. Eventually they prevailed \u2013 a preservation order was placed on every tree. Camden Council effectively refused permission to build and the residents were elated.\n\nBy 1985 residents had ensured that the landlord's potential for making money was small. A group of leaseholders established Hillfield Court Limited to buy the freehold, an agreement was reached, 84 residents subscribed and they became the new owners. While the management of Hillfield Court has provided many highs and lows, the residents have always been very proud of their block and its garden with its high level of community spirit. Maintenance and improvement work continues year on year, still preserving the building's essential character.\n\n== Notable former residents ==\nAlthough no [[blue plaque]] appears on the building, Hillfield Court has been home to many interesting and famous people over the years. These include actress [[Diana Wynyard]], author [[Barnaby Williams]], novelist [[Kay Dick]] and the photographer [[Bill Brandt]]. The wet-stamp of many of Brandt's photos reads ''\"Bill Brandt, 58 Hillfield Court, Belsize Avenue, NW3\"'' and have sold at [[Christie's]] for many thousands of pounds. Additionally, directors of many films as well as one of the leading actresses in the [[West End theatre|West End]] [[Musical theatre|Musical]] [[Miss Saigon]] have also lived there. [[Sophie Turner]], the English actor who rose to international fame playing [[Sansa Stark]] in the [[HBO]] series [[Game of Thrones]] lived in the block in the early 2010s, as did media personality and paparazzo [[Darryn Lyons]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{coord|51.55039|N|0.16684|W|type:landmark_region:GB|display=title|format=dms}}\n\n[[Category:Art Deco architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Camden]]\n[[Category:Residential buildings completed in 1932]]\n[[Category:Apartment buildings in London]]\n[[Category:Belsize Park]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:Hillfield Court in the winter.jpg|thumb|right|Hillfield Court on a winter's morning]]\n\n'''Hillfield Court''' is a prominent [[art deco]] residential [[mansion block]] in [[Belsize Park]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], built in 1934.

Between 1761 and 1773, the house was rebuilt and extended by merchant William Horsley.\n\nIn 1808, the Belsize Estate was split into 9 leasehold estates. The Hillfield leasehold, as well as the adjoining Belsize House leasehold (around {{convert|19|acre|m2}} in total) were bought by James Abel.[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/image.aspx?compid=22638&filename=fig09.gif]\n\nIn 1841 Basil Woodd, a [[Bond Street]] brandy merchant bought the lease from Abel, a {{convert|19|acre|m2|sing=on}} estate set within the boundaries of [[Belsize Avenue]], [[Belsize Park Gardens]] and [[Belsize Grove]]. By this time, the area to the west of Haverstock Hill was dotted with many country abodes. The former ''Blue House'' had by this stage been renovated, modernised and renamed ''Heathfield House'', a stuccoed 6-bedroom house with a library. Woodd acquired the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] of the land in 1857 and renamed the house ''Hillfield''. Sometime between 1864 and 1867 he built another house on the south end of the estate for his son Robert Ballard Woodd - This house was called Woodlands. Whilst Woodlands was demolished in 1901 to make way for higher density housing, Hillfield remained until 1928 when it was demolished.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22638 Hampstead - Belsize | British History Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The land was bought by Hillfield Estates Ltd, a company formed in 1933 by FL, WJ and AG Griggs (Frank, William and Alfred).\n\nThe activities of Griggs & Son Ltd of Victoria St, London included land development in Pinner, building theatres<ref>http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk</ref> for the Astoria group in London and in [[Astoria Theatre, Brighton|Brighton (1933)]] and building at least two other theatres in the West End. Griggs & Son developed the Hillfield site to cater for the high demand for mansion blocks. The destruction of the old house and the development of the estate was met with some local opposition, however.\n\n== The building ==\n\nHillfield Court, so named in commemoration of the grand house, was just one part of the development. The scheme also included two other mansion blocks - Tudor Close (1935) to the back of the estate; and on Haverstock Hill, a parade of shops with Hillfield Mansions above (1934), which remained in the ownership of Hillfield Estates Ltd for many years. The parade incorporated an Odeon cinema, one of the first in London, which opened in September 1934.<ref>http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/15082</ref> The flagship of the Odeon chain for several years, it was demolished in the 1970s. It was replaced by the highly regarded Screen on the Hill cinema (since changed hands & renamed the Everyman Belsize Park).\n\nThe architect for the flats (and the cinema) was [[Tp bennett]]; he also designed the block of flats on nearby Finchley Road, above what is now a Waitrose store. The practice he founded continues today. His design for Hillfield Court provided 113 flats over six storeys, in seven different layouts and intended to suit a variety of tenants. Bennett had given much thought to the planning of apartment buildings for London.<ref>Architectural Design and Construction, May\u2013June 1935</ref> At Hillfield Court, he adopted the 'dining-hall' in some layouts, for more efficient use of the available space. There were hand-operated hoists from the ground floor so groceries, etc. could be delivered direct to every kitchen. A boiler room provides hot water to all flats and heating to common parts. Originally there was a central store for tenants' own coal, carried up by porters to be burned on the open fires. From its inception Hillfield Court was considered a very prestigious block, not least because of its magnificent, spacious gardens.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] a [[barrage balloon]] was anchored on the Hillfield Court lawn. [[Royal Air Force]] personnel were housed in a ground floor flat ready to launch the balloon when necessary. These large, airborne barriers protected important installations against low-level air attack. A brick bunkhouse built for the crew remains, now used as the garden shed.\n\nThe flats were rented out on short leases until in 1969, [[inflation]] saw tenants for the first time being given the opportunity to purchase their flats on a 99-year [[lease]]. For a while the family firm continued to manage the block directly but in the mid-1970s, the building was placed in the hands of managing agents. By that stage the principal shareholder was FE (Francis) Griggs and when he died in 1977, control of the freehold passed to Mrs JL Griggs. Eventually, according to various residents, there came the shattering news that Hillfield Court had been sold - unfortunately, to \"unscrupulous experts at [[asset stripping]]\".<ref>Hillfield Court newsletter, 1998</ref> The twenty one flats that were still rented out were then sold on long leases to a property company. There was talk of building townhouses with garages and an access road on the much-loved gardens.\n\nFighting back vigorously, the [[Residents Association]] organised speeches, TV interviews and meetings with [[Camden Council (New South Wales)|Camden Council]] in the hope of saving their garden. Eventually they prevailed \u2013 a preservation order was placed on every tree. Camden Council effectively refused permission to build and the residents were elated.\n\nBy 1985 residents had ensured that the landlord\u2019s potential for making money was small. A group of leaseholders established Hillfield Court Limited to buy the freehold, an agreement was reached, 84 residents subscribed and they became the new owners. While the management of Hillfield Court has provided many highs and lows, the residents have always been very proud of their block and its garden with its high level of community spirit. Maintenance and improvement work continues year on year, still preserving the building's essential character.\n\n== Notable former residents ==\nAlthough no [[blue plaque]] appears on the building, Hillfield Court has been home to many interesting and famous people over the years. These include actress [[Diana Wynyard]], author [[Barnaby Williams]], novelist [[Kay Dick]] and the photographer [[Bill Brandt]]. The wet-stamp of many of Brandt's photos reads ''\"Bill Brandt, 58 Hillfield Court, Belsize Avenue, NW3\"'' and have sold at [[Christie's]] for many thousands of pounds. Additionally,directors of many films as well as one of the leading actresses in the [[West End theatre|West End]] [[Musical theatre|Musical]] [[Miss Saigon]] have also lived there. [[Sophie Turner]], the English actor who rose to international fame playing [[Sansa Stark]] in the [[HBO]] series [[Game of Thrones]] lived in the block in the early 2010s, as did media personality and paparazzo [[Darryn Lyons]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{coord|51.55039|N|0.16684|W|type:landmark_region:GB|display=title|format=dms}}\n\n[[Category:Art Deco architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Camden]]\n[[Category:Residential buildings completed in 1932]]\n[[Category:Apartment buildings in London]]\n[[Category:Belsize Park]]\n", "name_user": "Danielt998", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: ,d \u2192 , d,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillfield_Court"}

These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Historically, in the warm Middle Eastern and [[Mediterranean climate]]s, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls, which required the use of numerous [[column]]s and [[Support (structure)|supports]].<ref name=\"Masdjid1\" /> One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, the building being supported by over 850 columns.<ref name = \"mit-handout\"/> Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] so that visitors can enjoy the shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, the mosques consequently losing popularity.<ref name=\"Masdjid1\" />\n\nThe first departure within mosque design started in Persia (Iran). The [[Persian people|Persians]] had inherited a rich [[Iranian architecture|architectural legacy]] from the earlier Persian dynasties, and they began incorporating elements from earlier [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] designs into their mosques, influenced by buildings such as the [[Palace of Ardashir]] and the [[Sarvestan Palace]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/arc/ind/2_meisaku/55_shah/sha_eng.htm |title=THE ROYAL MOSQUE (MASJED-e-EMAM) in Isfahan, Iran |publisher=Ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref> Thus, [[Islamic architecture]] witnessed the introduction of such structures as domes and large, arched entrances, referred to as ''[[iwan]]s''.

Soon, a distinctly [[Iranian architecture|Persian style]] of mosques started appearing that would significantly influence the designs of later [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]], and also [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]], mosque designs.\n\nThe Ottomans introduced central dome mosques in the 15th century. These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having a large central dome, a common feature is smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed.<ref name=\"mit-vocab\">{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060918221451/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |archivedate = September 18, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> This style was heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture with its use of large central domes.<ref name=\"Masdjid1\" /> Hajja Soad's mosque took a [[pyramid]] shape that is a creative style in Islamic architecture.\n\nThe [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan, in a relatively unusual design fuses contemporary lines with the more traditional look of an Arab [[Bedouin]]'s tent,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} with its large triangular prayer hall and four minarets. However, unlike traditional mosque designs, it lacks a dome.

The ones found in Europe and North America appear to have various styles but most are built on Western architectural designs, some are former churches or other buildings that were used by non-Muslims.

However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Hadith/H0002P0016.aspx |publisher=SunniPath |website=SunniPath Library |accessdate=July 12, 2006 |title=Chapter 16.

However, traditional rules have segregated women and men. By traditional rules, women are most often told to occupy the rows behind the men. In part, this was a practical matter as the traditional posture for prayer{{spaced ndash}}kneeling on the floor, head to the ground{{spaced ndash}}made mixed-gender prayer uncomfortably revealing for many women and distracting for some men. Traditionalists try to argue that Muhammad preferred women to pray at home rather than at a mosque, and they cite a ''[[hadith|\u1e25ad\u012bth]]'' in which Muhammad supposedly said: \"The best mosques for women are the inner parts of their houses,\" although women were active participants in the mosque started by Muhammad. Muhammad told Muslims not to forbid women from entering mosques. They are allowed to go in.

Mosques in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of American mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all due to the lack of space and the fact that some prayers, such as the Friday Jumu\u02bbah, are mandatory for men but optional for women.

The seventeenth verse of the chapter prohibits those who ''join gods with Allah''\u2014polytheists\u2014from maintaining mosques:\n{{Quote|It is not for such as join gods with Allah, to maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity.

However, the Umayyad caliph [[Umar II]] later forbade non-Muslims from entering mosques, and his ruling remains in practice in present-day Saudi Arabia.<ref name=\"Masdjid1\" /> Today, the decision on whether non-Muslims should be allowed to enter mosques varies.

These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Historically, in the warm Middle Eastern and [[Mediterranean climate]]s, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls, which required the use of numerous [[column]]s and [[Support (structure)|supports]].<ref name=\"Masdjid1\" /> One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, the building being supported by over 850 columns.<ref name = \"mit-handout\"/> Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] so that visitors can enjoy the shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, the mosques consequently losing popularity.<ref name=\"Masdjid1\" />\n\nThe first departure within mosque design started in Persia (Iran). The [[Persian people|Persians]] had inherited a rich [[Iranian architecture|architectural legacy]] from the earlier Persian dynasties, and they began incorporating elements from earlier [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] designs into their mosques, influenced by buildings such as the [[Palace of Ardashir]] and the [[Sarvestan Palace]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/arc/ind/2_meisaku/55_shah/sha_eng.htm |title=THE ROYAL MOSQUE (MASJED-e-EMAM) in Isfahan, Iran |publisher=Ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref> Thus, [[Islamic architecture]] witnessed the introduction of such structures as domes and large, arched entrances, referred to as ''[[iwan]]s''. During [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq rule]], as [[Sufism|Islamic mysticism]] was on the rise, the [[Shah Mosque (Isfahan)#Design \u2013 the four-iwan style|four-iwan]] arrangement took form. The four-iwan format, finalized by the Seljuqs, and later inherited by the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]]s, firmly established the courtyard fa\u00e7ade of such mosques, with the towering gateways at every side, as more important than the actual buildings themselves.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> They typically took the form of a square-shaped central courtyard with large entrances at each side, giving the impression of gateways to the spiritual world.<ref>{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Stephen P. |title=Half the world: the social architecture of Safavid Isfahan, 1590-1722|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVAqAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 February 2013|year=1999|publisher=Mazda Pub.|isbn=978-1-56859-087-5|pages=143\u2013144}}</ref> The Persians also introduced [[Persian gardens]] into mosque designs. Soon, a distinctly [[Iranian architecture|Persian style]] of mosques started appearing that would significantly influence the designs of later [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]], and also [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]], mosque designs.\n\nThe Ottomans introduced central dome mosques in the 15th century. These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having a large central dome, a common feature is smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed.<ref name=\"mit-vocab\">{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060918221451/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |archivedate = September 18, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> This style was heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture with its use of large central domes.<ref name=\"Masdjid1\" /> Hajja Soad's mosque took a [[pyramid]] shape that is a creative style in Islamic architecture.\n\nThe [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan, in a relatively unusual design fuses contemporary lines with the more traditional look of an Arab [[Bedouin]]'s tent,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} with its large triangular prayer hall and four minarets. However, unlike traditional mosque designs, it lacks a dome. The mosque's architecture is a departure from the long history of South Asian Islamic architecture.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMosques built in [[Southeast Asia]] often represent the [[Architecture of Indonesia|Indonesian-Javanese style architecture]], which are different from the ones found throughout the [[Greater Middle East]]. The ones found in Europe and North America appear to have various styles but most are built on Western architectural designs, some are former churches or other buildings that were used by non-Muslims.

The ''adhan'' is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a ''muezzin'' for each prayer to say the ''adhan'' as it is a recommended practice or ''[[Sunnah]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u064f\u0640\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0640\u0629}}) of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]].

According to the [[Hanafi]] [[Madh'hab|school]] of Islamic jurisprudence, the individual who built the mosque has a stronger claim to the title of imam, but this view is not shared by the other schools.<ref name=\"mawardi112\" />\n\nLeadership at prayer falls into three categories, depending on the type of prayer: five daily prayers, Friday prayer, or optional prayers.<ref name=\"mawardi112\" /> According to the Hanafi and [[Maliki]] school of Islamic jurisprudence, appointment of a prayer leader for Friday service is mandatory because otherwise the prayer is invalid. The [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools, however, argue that the appointment is not necessary and the prayer is valid as long as it is performed in a congregation. A slave may lead a Friday prayer, but Muslim authorities disagree over whether the job can be done by a minor.<ref name=\"mawardi112\" /> An imam appointed to lead Friday prayers may also lead at the five daily prayers; [[List of Islamic studies scholars|Muslim scholars]] agree to the leader appointed for five daily services may lead the Friday service as well.<ref name=\"mawardi112\" />\n\nAll Muslim authorities hold the consensus opinion that only men may lead prayer for men.<ref name=\"mawardi112\" /> Nevertheless, women prayer leaders are allowed to lead prayer in front of all-female congregations.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9WF1fRGOsQC&pg=PA63&dq=false#v=onepage&q=false&f=false |title=Karin van Nieuwkerk, \"Women Embracing Islam\" |page=63 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292773769 |year=2006}}</ref>\n\n===Cleanliness===\n{{see also|Ritual purity in Islam}}\n[[File:Zoetermeer Meerzicht Moskee Qibla (04).JPG|upright|thumb|Storage for shoes]]\n\nAll mosques have rules regarding cleanliness, as it is an essential part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as ''wudu''. However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Hadith/H0002P0016.aspx |publisher=SunniPath |website=SunniPath Library |accessdate=July 12, 2006 |title=Chapter 16.

Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not reveal the shape of the body.

However, traditional rules have segregated women and men. By traditional rules, women are most often told to occupy the rows behind the men. In part, this was a practical matter as the traditional posture for prayer{{spaced ndash}}kneeling on the floor, head to the ground{{spaced ndash}}made mixed-gender prayer uncomfortably revealing for many women and distracting for some men. Traditionalists try to argue that Muhammad preferred women to pray at home rather than at a mosque, and they cite a ''[[hadith|\u1e25ad\u012bth]]'' in which Muhammad supposedly said: \"The best mosques for women are the inner parts of their houses,\" although women were active participants in the mosque started by Muhammad. Muhammad told Muslims not to forbid women from entering mosques. They are allowed to go in. The second Sunni caliph '[[Umar]] at one time prohibited women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they may be sexually harassed or assaulted by men, so he required them to pray at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/womeninsociety.html#mosque |accessdate=April 15, 2006 |title=Women in Society |publisher=University of Southern California |website=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Doi |first=Abdur Rahman I. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409200739/http://usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/womeninsociety.html |archivedate=April 9, 2006 }}</ref> Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women; for example, the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women.<ref name=\"Masdjid1\" />\n\nMany mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room. Mosques in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of American mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all due to the lack of space and the fact that some prayers, such as the Friday Jumu\u02bbah, are mandatory for men but optional for women.

The seventeenth verse of the chapter prohibits those who ''join gods with Allah''\u2014polytheists\u2014from maintaining mosques:\n{{Quote|It is not for such as join gods with Allah, to maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity.

Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque.

However, the Umayyad caliph [[Umar II]] later forbade non-Muslims from entering mosques, and his ruling remains in practice in present-day Saudi Arabia.<ref name=\"Masdjid1\" /> Today, the decision on whether non-Muslims should be allowed to enter mosques varies. With few exceptions, mosques in the Arabian Peninsula as well as Morocco do not allow entry to non-Muslims. For example, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/25/morocco.travel.ap/index.html |title=Morocco travel |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012004112/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/25/morocco.travel.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are also many other places in the West as well as the Islamic world where non-Muslims are welcome to enter mosques.

Knox County was affected by this formation and Warrick and [[Gibson County, Indiana|Gibson]] Counties were both created out of this area of Knox County between the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] and the [[Ohio River]]. The boundaries of this area began at the mouth of the Wabash River; then up the Wabash River with the meanders thereof to the mouth of the White River; then up the White River with the meanders thereof to the Forks of the White River; then up  White River East Fork to where the line between Sections 20 and 29, Township 1 North, Range 4 West, strikes the same; then with that line to the then Gibson County line; then with that line dividing Gibson and Knox Counties to the Ohio River; then down the Ohio River, to the place of beginning.\nThe same was divided into two separate and distinct counties, by a line beginning on the Wabash River, known as Rector's Base Line (was surveyed by William Rector on the line between Townships 4 South and 5 South, from New Harmony, Posey County, and Alton, Crawford County, Indiana), and with that line east until it intersects the then Gibson County line and that tract of land falling within the southern division thereof was Warrick County. However, because Gibson County organized a month earlier on April 1, this entire territory fell under Gibson County's jurisdiction. Within Warrick County's original jurisdiction included large portions but not entire portions of Crawford, Perry, Posey, Vanderburgh, and roughly 2/3s of Warrick County's current jurisdiction. Evansville was the original county seat, followed by Yankeetown, Newburgh, and finally Boonville, the current seat.<ref>Indiana Atlas of Historical County Boundaries.

The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>\n\n'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>\n\n'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>\n\n'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[surveying|surveyor]], assessor, and circuit court [[Court clerk|clerk]].

Knox County was affected by this formation and Warrick and [[Gibson County, Indiana|Gibson]] Counties were both created out of this area of Knox County between the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] and the [[Ohio River]]. The boundaries of this area began at the mouth of the Wabash River; then up the Wabash River with the meanders thereof to the mouth of the White River; then up the White River with the meanders thereof to the Forks of the White River; then up  White River East Fork to where the line between Sections 20 and 29, Township 1 North, Range 4 West, strikes the same; then with that line to the then Gibson County line; then with that line dividing Gibson and Knox Counties to the Ohio River; then down the Ohio River, to the place of beginning.\nThe same was divided into two separate and distinct counties, by a line beginning on the Wabash River, known as Rector's Base Line (was surveyed by William Rector on the line between Townships 4 South and 5 South, from New Harmony, Posey County, and Alton, Crawford County, Indiana), and with that line east until it intersects the then Gibson County line and that tract of land falling within the southern division thereof was Warrick County. However, because Gibson County organized a month earlier on April 1, this entire territory fell under Gibson County's jurisdiction. Within Warrick County's original jurisdiction included large portions but not entire portions of Crawford, Perry, Posey, Vanderburgh, and roughly 2/3s of Warrick County's current jurisdiction. Evansville was the original county seat, followed by Yankeetown, Newburgh, and finally Boonville, the current seat.<ref>Indiana Atlas of Historical County Boundaries.

The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] had taken place seven months previous in August 1940. The British had withdrawn from the protectorate after a delaying action at the [[Battle of Tug Argan]]. The British withdrawal, after the disastrous conclusion of the [[Battle of France]] and the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, had repercussions among British leaders and began the loss of confidence in General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the British commander in the Middle East by the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], which culminated in his sacking on 20 June 1941.\n\nBritish, Empire and Commonwealth forces from the [[United Kingdom]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]] in Aden trained for a prospective invasion of British Somaliland. The [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Far Eastern Fleet]] provided Force D, comprising two cruisers, two destroyers and a collection of adapted troop transports. To deceive the Italians in Ethiopia about British intentions in East Africa, Operation Camilla was leaked, suggesting that troop movements to Sudan were for an invasion of British Somaliland and that a diversionary operation would come from Kenya in the south. In Operation Canvas, the real invasion plan, Kenya was the base for the main invasion.\n\nForce D and the Aden Striking Force conducted a [[amphibious warfare|beach landing]] at Berbera on 16 March 1941, taking the port by {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} The Italian garrison made a precipitate retreat back to Ethiopia and local troops deserted en masse. In a few days, Berbera was developed to receive troops and supplies for the operations against Ethiopia, reducing the supply distance to the fighting front by {{cvt|500|mi|km|0}}. A British military administration was imposed on the protectorate, the local police and the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] were re-established, civilians were disarmed and the economy was revived.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic situation, 1940===\n\n{{Main article|Italian conquest of British Somaliland}}\n\nOn 10 June 1940, when Italy declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], Italian military forces commanded by the viceroy and governor general of {{lang|it|[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]}} (AOI, Italian East Africa), the [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]] became a threat to the British and French holds on their colonies in East Africa. Italian forces in Eritrea endangered British sea routes along the coast of East Africa, to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[French Somaliland]], [[British Somaliland]] and [[Kenya Colony]] (British Kenya) were vulnerable to attacks from the AOI. The collapse in France and the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] drastically weakened the British strategic position in the Middle East and East Africa. The closure of the Mediterranean to British sea traffic left only the {{cvt|13000|mi|km|abbr=on}} voyage around Africa, to supply the British forces in the Middle East. On the eve of the Italian declaration of war, the Italian colonies in East Africa had {{nowrap|91,203 Italian}} members of the armed forces and police and {{nowrap|199,973 Eritrean,}} Ethiopian and Somali {{lang|it|[[Askari|ascari]]}}. In July, the British had {{nowrap|47,000 men}} in British Kenya, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and British Somaliland.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=48\u201370}}{{efn|Reinforcements later increased this to a peak of {{nowrap|254,000 men}} in East Africa.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=48\u201370}}}}\n\n===Italian invasion===\n\n{{wide image|File:Somaliland Italian invasion.png|600px|align-cap=center|Map showing the Italian invasion of the British Somaliland Protectorate (3\u201319 August 1940) and adjacent territories of [[French Somaliland]], [[Italian Ethiopia]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]}}\nOn 3 August 1940, British reconnaissance aircraft discovered that about {{nowrap|400 Italian}} troops had crossed the Ethiopian\u2013British Somaliland frontier at Biyad, near [[Borama]] (Boorama). The Italian invasion force moved in three widely dispersed columns, co-ordinated by wireless and liaison aircraft. The main (central) Italian column advanced from the region of [[Harar]] in Italian Ethiopia, crossed the border south of Borama and reached [[Hargeisa]] on 5 August. The [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] skirmished with the Italians as they advanced and the central column attacked Hargeisa with infantry and light tanks covered by artillery and air attacks. A Rhodesian infantry company blocking the road retreated, after knocking out three light tanks, while the main British force slowly retired from the town. On the same day, the northern invasion column captured the port of [[Zeila]] (Saylac), not far from French Somaliland and then slowly advanced the {{cvt|150|mi|km}} down the coast road to [[Berbera]], taking [[Bulhar]] (Bulaxaar), about {{cvt|50|mi|km}} from Berbera, on 17 August.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=71\u201377}}\n\nThe main Italian force advanced in the centre from Hargeisa along the road to Berbera, only slightly delayed by road demolitions and improvised land mines. British troops in advanced positions were withdrawn on 10 August and the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] took place from 11 to 15 August. The Italians had achieved air superiority by 6 August and the defenders held the gap against Italian attacks for 72 hours, eventually running out of ammunition. Italian artillery superiority led to the defenders gradually being overwhelmed. By the time that the northern Italian column reached Bulhar, the defence of the Tug Argan gap had begun to collapse. Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen]] had been sent to command the forces in British Somaliland and on 14 August, judged that the situation at Tug Argan was irretrievable and was instructed by the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] Middle East [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] to withdraw from the protectorate (Wavell was in Britain). The garrison retreated to Berbera and by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} 18 August, most of the contingent had been evacuated to Aden, with the HQ sailing in {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} on the morning of 19 August; Italian forces entered Berbera that evening.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=77\u201394}} The British suffered {{nowrap|38 men}} killed and {{nowrap|222 men}} wounded; the Italians {{nowrap|2,052 casualties.}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}}\n\n===Operation Camilla===\n[[File:Somalia Topography en.png|thumb|{{centre|Topographical map of post-war Somalia, the former protectorate of British Somaliland to the north}}]]\nAfter the retreat to Aden, the British established Military Mission No. 106 (Hamilton's Mission) to conduct sabotage and subversion operations in occupied British Somaliland. The former Senior Administrative Officer of the protectorate, Reginald Smith, made several secret journeys to the land to glean information. In Cairo, General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], GOC-in-C [[Middle East Command]] concocted Operation Camilla, a deception to mislead the Italians about the transfer of troops to Sudan. The operation was intended to convince the Italians that the troops movements were part of a plan to invade British Somaliland in February 1941 and then advance on Harar. Wavell wrote in a document that,\n\n{{quote|...the loss of British Somaliland has always rankled bitterly between my government and myself. I got a rocket from the government and nearly lost my job at the time.... I have orders to recapture it as soon as resources are available and am most anxious to remove this blot on my reputation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=116}}}}\n\nThe document purported Operation Canvas, the invasion of Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia from Kenya, to be a diversion; it was sent to the local commanders in East Africa using means by which the British expected it to leak to the Italians. The main invasion from Kenya required a huge supply effort and the plan to re-capture British Somaliland was intended to create a much closer supply route from Berbera for the southern invasion force. The port was rudimentary but improvements could quickly be effected. Aosta, the Italian commander of the AOI was convinced by February that an invasion of the colony was imminent.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=2016|1pp=116, 137\u2013138|2a1=Rankin|2y=2009|2pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Plan===\nThe British made use of such resources as were available to [[British Forces Aden]] (Air Vice-Marshal [[Ranald Reid]]) to re-capture Berbera and expand it into a bridgehead sufficient to supply {{nowrap|15,000 troops.}}{{sfnm|1a1=Rohwer|1a2=H\u00fcmmelchen|1y=1992|1p=54|2a1=Wavell|2y=1946|2p=3,529}} About {{nowrap|3,000 men}} of the Aden Striking Force, comprising the 1/[[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and 3/[[15th Punjab Regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]] (1895\u20131947), which had fought in the colony during the Italian invasion, a Somali commando detachment and the 1401/1402 (Aden) Companies, [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps Group]] and 150 [[motor transport]] (MT) would be transported {{conv|140|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} across the Gulf of Aden.{{sfnm|1a1=Rohwer|1a2=H\u00fcmmelchen|1y=1992|1p=54|2a1=Raugh|2y=1993|2p=178|3a1=Collins|3y=1964|3p=46}} The [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|East Indies Fleet]], comprising ships of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Royal Indian Navy]] were to contribute Force D (Captain Harold Hickling), the cruisers {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}} and {{HMS|Caledon|D53|2}}, the destroyers {{HMS|Kandahar|F28|6}} and {{HMS|Kipling|F91|2}}, the auxiliary cruisers ''Chakdina'' and ''Chantala'', Royal Indian Navy trawlers ''Netravati'' and ''Parvati'' (Lieutenant [[HMS Choudri]], R.I.N.), the troop transports S.S.

The second wave of Force D comprised ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kingston'' and M.L. 109, all transporting troops.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=46\u201347}}\n\n===Preparations===\nTraining began in January, ships were converted to carry troops, two of the lighters, designed by the Sea Transport Officer, Aden, Commander Vernon were to be used as floating piers, fitted with ramps to ease the unloading of the MT, including armoured cars. The RAF flew reconnaissance sorties to find suitable landing points, discover Italian defensive preparations and find potential landing grounds for their aircraft. With fire support from the cruisers and destroyers, the invasion force was to land on beaches between reefs to the east and west of Berbera, create a bridgehead and then re-occupy the protectorate.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139, 138}} The air photographs obtained were an incomplete set and the Navy considered that towing vessels from Aden was risky because the tows could part and delay the voyage. In poor visibility finding Berbera could not be guaranteed and approaching an unsurveyed, hostile and dark shore at night, then finding gaps in the reefs wide enough to tow through the lighters was a gamble.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=46}} The importance of Berbera to the British offensive against Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was such that the risks were accepted. On the three nights before the landings, the RAF bombed the big Italian base at [[Dire Dawa]] in Ethiopia.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139, 138}}\n\n===Voyage===\nOn 14 March the first echelon departed Aden at {{nowrap|10:45 p.m.}} but only {{conv|10|nmi|mi+km}} out, tows parted, some wrapping around the ships' propellers. To keep to the schedule a quick change of plan was made; ''Kandahar'' left the tugs and lighters for ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'' to tow. The naval ships went ahead to make rendezvous {{conv|10|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north of the Berbera Light at {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.}} on 16 March according to the plan. The [[Shoreham-class sloop|sloop]] {{HMS|Shoreham|L32|6}} was sent from Aden to assist ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'' by {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.}} on 15 March. The second echelon sailed an hour later and rendezvoused as planned. At {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.}} on 16 March ''Glasgow'', '' Caledon'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Netravati'', ''Parvati'' and M.L. 109 were to land the 1/2 and 3/15 Punjab at Main Beach, {{conv|2|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera Light covered by a bombardment from ''Glasgow'', along with ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'', which carried the 200 Somali commandos of Force G (R) who were to make the subsidiary landing east of Berbera, covered by ''Kandahar''. The ships were to close on the coast at {{conv|12|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Shoreham'', ''Beaconsfield'', ''Tuna'' with the three tugs and six lighters in tow were about midway between Aden and Berbera moving at {{conv|6|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=46\u201347}}\n\n==Invasion==\n\n===Landings===\nAt {{nowrap|1:01 a.m.}} on 16 March ''Glasgow'', ''Kandahar'', ''Kingston'' and M.L. 109 moved forward at {{conv|20|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} towards Berbera Light and to find the gaps in the reefs off the landing beaches. ''Caledon'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Netravati'' and ''Parvati'' were to arrive off the west beach at {{nowrap|2:30 a.m.}} and drop anchor near ''Glasgow'' which would be showing a red light out to sea. During the approach lights were seen ashore from vehicles on the Hargeisa Road, bound for Berbera. At {{nowrap|2:03 a.m.}} on 16 March, the Berbera Light was seen on a bearing 186\u00b0 at {{conv|3|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} distance. ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'' separated from the force and made for the eastern beach; ''Glasgow'' stopped and launched a motor boat and skiff for Commander Vernon to use to find the gap in the reef off the western beach. The gap was hard to find and there was a delay of 63 minutes in landing the first tows. ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'' found their gap in the reef off the eastern beach at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} although the reconnaissance photographs had shown this to be the harder of the two to find. The delay led to apprehension by Colonel Pollock and Captain Hickling (the captain of Glasgow) that the landing might occur in daylight.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=47}}\n\nThe landing at the eastern beach due at {{nowrap|3:30 a.m.}} was also delayed; at {{nowrap|3:26 a.m.}} a Somali fisherman in a canoe rowed up to ''Glasgow''. The fisherman said that Italians still occupied the town but some had left by lorry that night; there were Italians near the Berbera Light. The Somali was sent to find the gap in the reefs but Vernon found it at {{nowrap|3:58 a.m.}} At {{nowrap|4:13 a.m.}} the signal \"Land, follow Glasgow's boats\" was given and four minutes later ''Glasgow'' began to bombarded the main beach with H.E. from its 4-inch guns and [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder pom-poms]]. The fire from the 4-inch main armament was that used for E-boat attack, with half the shells bursting on impact and the other half bursting {{conv|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} over the target, until {{nowrap|4:20 a.m.}} when ''Kingston'' received the order to begin landing on the eastern beach. ''Kandahar'' bombarded the beach from {{nowrap|4:25\u20134:35 a.m.}} Tows moved through the gaps to the eastern and western beaches, success signals coming from at the western beach was made at {{nowrap|4:48 a.m.}} and at the eastern beach at {{nowrap|5:26 a.m.}} During the disembarkations shells burst among the tows and ships offshore, thought to be from four to six 4-inch guns and some ineffectual machine-gun fire; the 6-inch, 4-inch and pom-poms of the bombardment ships silenced the Italian artillery. ''Glasgow'' mainly engaged trenches near the Berbera Light and west of the aerodrome. ''Kandahar'' concentrated on the defences to the east of the town.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n===Berbera===\n{{wide image|File:Somaliland (6936711023) (2).jpg|700px|align-cap=center|Photograph of the Berbera landscape (2012)}}\nAnticipating a British landing, the Duke of Aosta, the Viceroy of the AOI, had agreed to the evacuation of the protectorate. On 14 March the Italian garrison began to evacuate the territory and the 17th Colonial Brigade retired to Dire Dawa. The 70th Colonial Brigade remained, except for its commander, Brigadier-General Arturo Bertello who passed through Dire Dawa just before it was captured.{{sfn|Del Boca|2001|p=506}} When the naval bombardment began, about {{nowrap|1,500 Somali}} troops in Italian service and their Italian officers and NCOs retreated from Berbera towards Hargeisa.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=138}} The first wave, comprising the 15th Punjab Regiment, was carried by ''Parvati'' which towed a tug and barge for the landing. ''Parvati'' was bracketed by three 4-inch shells but the landing was carried out without loss against scant opposition. The 2nd Punjab Regiment landed and advanced through the 15th Punjab towards the town, as a party of the 15th Punjab moved inland to cut the coast road. All of the troops involved got ashore before dawn. Little opposition was met with ashore and the town was captured by {{nowrap|9:20 a.m.}} on 16 March. The British and Indian troops suffered few casualties and over 100 prisoners were taken.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=49}} Due to a mistake, the Aden Pioneers, who were unarmed, had been ordered to attack with the Punjabis and their commander, Captain S. J. H. Harrison wrote later,\n\n{{quote|The sun was just peeping over the eastern skyline [;] we came under rifle fire...when to our utter amazement we saw the Italian enemy leaping out of their trenches and racing towards transport vehicles....The vehicles started up and the entire enemy column high-tailed in a great cloud of yellowish grey dust...southwards...to Hargeisa....{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=178}}}}\n\nA diversion to the east of Berbera was engaged by sixty members of the garrison but the landing party suffered only one Somali soldier killed and a British officer wounded. A wireless message sent to London that \"The British flag flies again over Berbera\" but the invaders had forgotten to bring one and had to borrow it from a resident. RAF fighters provided a standing patrol on the day of the invasion and for the next four days.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nThe second echelon ships had arrived by the time that Berbera fell and tugs checked the harbour for mines with [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|Oropesa sweeps]]. By {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} Force D was unloading; the special motor transport pier consisting of the two modified lighters was assembled at the spit and motor transport unloaded from ''Beaconsfield'' by {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} The landing force was well established ashore with adequate stores and rations, local water being available. Air reconnaissance reported the hinterland to be deserted (naval protection ended on 18 March when ''Glasgow'' departed; air cover continued until 20 March). The Shaad and customs piers had been damaged but couls be repaired with local materials; demolitions at the power station and refrigerating plant required assistance from Aden to make them operational. The water supply was about to be blown up but the occupation troops prevented it. Mining of the aerodrome had been carried out and the RAF was informed. The landing force sent 43 Italian prisoners of war to Aden in ''Parvati'' on the day of the landings, as the hospital ship Karapara which was not needed. About {{nowrap|5:33 a.m.}} on 17 March some aircraft were heard and a barrage was fired; no further Italian aircraft were seen during the day.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=50, 49}}\n\nOn 11 March the [[1st Infantry Brigade (South Africa)|1st South African Brigade Group]] and the [[22nd East African Brigade Group]] had been placed under the command of the [[1st (African) Division|11th (African) Division]], joining the [[1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade|3rd (Nigerian) Brigade Group]]. The division advanced from [[Barawa]] (Brava), south of Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland. On 25 February the division departed Mogadishu and on 17 March, patrols of the 3rd (Nigerian) Brigade reached [[Jijiga]], cutting the road to Harar, the Italian line of retreat from the protectorate.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=416\u2013418}} On 19 March, Brigadier Buchanan and a staff officer arrived by air at Berbera to take command of Bucforce, a temporary name for the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade, most of which had sailed from Mombasa on 16 March and was due on 22 March. On 20 March, a party of Nigerian troops reached [[Tug Wajale]], from whence two armoured cars drove to Berbera along the road from Hargeisa and joined with the Aden Striking Force.{{sfn|Orpen|1968|p=227}} The Italian 70th Colonial Brigade became one of the many units of the Italian colonial forces in the AOI that had begun to desert en masse.

S. O. Playfair]] wrote that the port was quickly prepared, despite a shortage of lighters, no electric lights, the heat and the ''Kharif'' (autumn wind) blowing sand and increasing the [[Breaking wave|surf]]. Within the week, the 11th African Division was receiving supplies through Berbera, shortening by {{cvt|500|mi|km|0}} its supply line.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=418}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart, in \"The First Victory...\" wrote that the British ascribed the success of Appearance to the extent of the preparations and training. He speculated that the use of ships as floating piers might have influenced the use of [[Mulberry harbour]]s in the [[Normandy landings]].{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\n===Subsequent events===\nAfter the Italian garrison fled, a prisoner of war camp was built, eventually big enough for {{nowrap|5,000 men,}} to accommodate Italian prisoners taken in the region.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=2016|1pp=138\u2013140|2a1=Rodd|2y=1970|2p=177}} Two battalions of the [[2nd Infantry Brigade (South Africa)|2nd South African Brigade]] arrived by sea from Kenya, the third battalion arriving two weeks later, after making a road march with the brigade transport. On 8 April, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater|Arthur Chater]], the former commander of the Somaliland Camel Corps was appointed Military Governor.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|p=177}} The Italians had abandoned Zeila on 18 March and a retired Somali police inspector uncovered a hidden British flag, raised it and began to collect abandoned Italian arms and equipment. On 23 March a Somaliland police officer landed and recalled the local police. The Somaliland Camel Corps had been disbanded after the British evacuation and by the time British returned to the headquarters in Burao on 18 April, 80 percent of the former members had made their way to Berbera. On 4 May a company of the corps began a mission to suppress a Mijjertein raiding party, the rest of the corps conducting disarmament operations with a motley of captured Italian weapons and equipment.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\n[[File:Another Dhow.JPG|thumb|left|{{centre|Dhow sailing in the Indian Ocean, 2009}}]]\nMany of the buildings in Berbera had been damaged, government stations demolished andthe civilian wireless and telephone networks were out of action. Army signals units had to carry civilian administration messages until the infrastructure had been restored. The economy of the protectorate had been greatly harmed by the war, internal trade had stopped, there were no regular shipping services with Aden and only [[dhow]]s were available. There was little food in the territory but the livestock herd had increased since 1939 and had suffered little from the Italians. The fall of Addis Ababa restored confidence, internal trade resumed and by the autumn the export trade had revived. Once Berbera replaced [[Mogadishu]] as an [[entrep\u00f4t]], demand for labour increased; payment in wages and in food acted as an economic stimulus and local businessmen immediately made use of the sea traffic to and from Berbera; a return to normal conditions did not occur Zeila and Boramo, near the border with French Somaliland, due to the need to blockade the pro-[[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|pp=180\u2013182}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Collins|1964}}\n|series=Official History of the Indian Armed Forces In the Second World War |title=The Royal Indian Navy 1939\u20131945 |last=Collins |first=D.

The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] had taken place seven months previous in August 1940. The British had withdrawn from the protectorate after a delaying action at the [[Battle of Tug Argan]]. The British withdrawal, after the disastrous conclusion of the [[Battle of France]] and the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, had repercussions among British leaders and began the loss of confidence in General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the British commander in the Middle East by the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], which culminated in his sacking on 20 June 1941.\n\nBritish, Empire and Commonwealth forces from the [[United Kingdom]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]] in Aden trained for a prospective invasion of British Somaliland. The [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Far Eastern Fleet]] provided Force D, comprising two cruisers, two destroyers and a collection of adapted troop transports. To deceive the Italians in Ethiopia about British intentions in East Africa, Operation Camilla was leaked, suggesting that troop movements to Sudan were for an invasion of British Somaliland and that a diversionary operation would come from Kenya in the south. In Operation Canvas, the real invasion plan, Kenya was the base for the main invasion.\n\nForce D and the Aden Striking Force conducted a [[amphibious warfare|beach landing]] at Berbera on 16 March 1941, taking the port by {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} The Italian garrison made a precipitate retreat back to Ethiopia and local troops deserted en masse. In a few days, Berbera was developed to receive troops and supplies for the operations against Ethiopia, reducing the supply distance to the fighting front by {{cvt|500|mi|km|0}}. A British military administration was imposed on the protectorate, the local police and the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] were re-established, civilians were disarmed and the economy was revived.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic situation, 1940===\n\n{{Main article|Italian conquest of British Somaliland}}\n\nOn 10 June 1940, when Italy declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], Italian military forces commanded by the viceroy and governor general of {{lang|it|[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]}} (AOI, Italian East Africa), the [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]] became a threat to the British and French holds on their colonies in East Africa. Italian forces in Eritrea endangered British sea routes along the coast of East Africa, to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[French Somaliland]], [[British Somaliland]] and [[Kenya Colony]] (British Kenya) were vulnerable to attacks from the AOI. The collapse in France and the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] drastically weakened the British strategic position in the Middle East and East Africa. The closure of the Mediterranean to British sea traffic left only the {{cvt|13000|mi|km|abbr=on}} voyage around Africa, to supply the British forces in the Middle East. On the eve of the Italian declaration of war, the Italian colonies in East Africa had {{nowrap|91,203 Italian}} members of the armed forces and police and {{nowrap|199,973 Eritrean,}} Ethiopian and Somali {{lang|it|[[Askari|ascari]]}}. In July, the British had {{nowrap|47,000 men}} in British Kenya, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and British Somaliland.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=48\u201370}}{{efn|Reinforcements later increased this to a peak of {{nowrap|254,000 men}} in East Africa.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=48\u201370}}}}\n\n===Italian invasion===\n\n{{wide image|File:Somaliland Italian invasion.png|600px|align-cap=center|Map showing the Italian invasion of the British Somaliland Protectorate (3\u201319 August 1940) and adjacent territories of [[French Somaliland]], [[Italian Ethiopia]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]}}\nOn 3 August 1940, British reconnaissance aircraft discovered that about {{nowrap|400 Italian}} troops had crossed the Ethiopian\u2013British Somaliland frontier at Biyad, near [[Borama]] (Boorama). The Italian invasion force moved in three widely dispersed columns, co-ordinated by wireless and liaison aircraft. The main (central) Italian column advanced from the region of [[Harar]] in Italian Ethiopia, crossed the border south of Borama and reached [[Hargeisa]] on 5 August. The [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] skirmished with the Italians as they advanced and the central column attacked Hargeisa with infantry and light tanks covered by artillery and air attacks. A Rhodesian infantry company blocking the road retreated, after knocking out three light tanks, while the main British force slowly retired from the town. On the same day, the northern invasion column captured the port of [[Zeila]] (Saylac), not far from French Somaliland and then slowly advanced the {{cvt|150|mi|km}} down the coast road to [[Berbera]], taking [[Bulhar]] (Bulaxaar), about {{cvt|50|mi|km}} from Berbera, on 17 August.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=71\u201377}}\n\nThe main Italian force advanced in the centre from Hargeisa along the road to Berbera, only slightly delayed by road demolitions and improvised land mines. British troops in advanced positions were withdrawn on 10 August and the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] took place from 11 to 15 August. The Italians had achieved air superiority by 6 August and the defenders held the gap against Italian attacks for 72 hours, eventually running out of ammunition. Italian artillery superiority led to the defenders gradually being overwhelmed. By the time that the northern Italian column reached Bulhar, the defence of the Tug Argan gap had begun to collapse. Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen]] had been sent to command the forces in British Somaliland and on 14 August, judged that the situation at Tug Argan was irretrievable and was instructed by the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] Middle East [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] to withdraw from the protectorate (Wavell was in Britain). The garrison retreated to Berbera and by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} 18 August, most of the contingent had been evacuated to Aden, with the HQ sailing in {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} on the morning of 19 August; Italian forces entered Berbera that evening.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=77\u201394}} The British suffered {{nowrap|38 men}} killed and {{nowrap|222 men}} wounded; the Italians {{nowrap|2,052 casualties.}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}}\n\n===Operation Camilla===\n[[File:Somalia Topography en.png|thumb|{{centre|Topographical map of post-war Somalia, the former protectorate of British Somaliland to the north}}]]\nAfter the retreat to Aden, the British established Military Mission No. 106 (Hamilton's Mission) to conduct sabotage and subversion operations in occupied British Somaliland. The former Senior Administrative Officer of the protectorate, Reginald Smith, made several secret journeys to the land to glean information. In Cairo, General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], GOC-in-C [[Middle East Command]] concocted Operation Camilla, a deception to mislead the Italians about the transfer of troops to Sudan. The operation was intended to convince the Italians that the troops movements were part of a plan to invade British Somaliland in February 1941 and then advance on Harar. Wavell wrote in a document that,\n\n{{quote|...the loss of British Somaliland has always rankled bitterly between my government and myself. I got a rocket from the government and nearly lost my job at the time.... I have orders to recapture it as soon as resources are available and am most anxious to remove this blot on my reputation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=116}}}}\n\nThe document purported Operation Canvas, the invasion of Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia from Kenya, to be a diversion; it was sent to the local commanders in East Africa using means by which the British expected it to leak to the Italians. The main invasion from Kenya required a huge supply effort and the plan to re-capture British Somaliland was intended to create a much closer supply route from Berbera for the southern invasion force. The port was rudimentary but improvements could quickly be effected. Aosta, the Italian commander of the AOI was convinced by February that an invasion of the colony was imminent.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=2016|1pp=116, 137\u2013138|2a1=Rankin|2y=2009|2pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Plan===\nThe British made use of such resources as were available to [[British Forces Aden]] (Air Vice-Marshal [[Ranald Reid]]) to re-capture Berbera and expand it into a bridgehead sufficient to supply {{nowrap|15,000 troops.}}{{sfnm|1a1=Rohwer|1a2=H\u00fcmmelchen|1y=1992|1p=54|2a1=Wavell|2y=1946|2p=3,529}} About {{nowrap|3,000 men}} of the Aden Striking Force, comprising the 1/[[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and 3/[[15th Punjab Regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]] (1895\u20131947), which had fought in the colony during the Italian invasion, a Somali commando detachment and the 1401/1402 (Aden) Companies, [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps Group]] and 150 [[motor transport]] (MT) would be transported {{conv|140|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} across the Gulf of Aden.{{sfnm|1a1=Rohwer|1a2=H\u00fcmmelchen|1y=1992|1p=54|2a1=Raugh|2y=1993|2p=178|3a1=Collins|3y=1964|3p=46}} The [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|East Indies Fleet]], comprising ships of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Royal Indian Navy]] were to contribute Force D (Captain Harold Hickling), the cruisers {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}} and {{HMS|Caledon|D53|2}}, the destroyers {{HMS|Kandahar|F28|6}} and {{HMS|Kipling|F91|2}}, the auxiliary cruisers ''Chakdina'' and ''Chantala'', Royal Indian Navy trawlers ''Netravati'' and ''Parvati'' (Lieutenant [[HMS Choudri]], R.I.N.), the troop transports S.S.

The second wave of Force D comprised ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kingston'' and M.L. 109, all transporting troops.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=46\u201347}}\n\n===Preparations===\nTraining began in January, ships were converted to carry troops, two of the lighters, designed by the Sea Transport Officer, Aden, Commander Vernon were to be used as floating piers, fitted with ramps to ease the unloading of the MT, including armoured cars. The RAF flew reconnaissance sorties to find suitable landing points, discover Italian defensive preparations and find potential landing grounds for their aircraft. With fire support from the cruisers and destroyers, the invasion force was to land on beaches between reefs to the east and west of Berbera, create a bridgehead and then re-occupy the protectorate.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139, 138}} The air photographs obtained were an incomplete set and the Navy considered that towing vessels from Aden was risky because the tows could part and delay the voyage. In poor visibility finding Berbera could not be guaranteed and approaching an unsurveyed, hostile and dark shore at night, then finding gaps in the reefs wide enough to tow through the lighters was a gamble.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=46}} The importance of Berbera to the British offensive against Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was such that the risks were accepted. On the three nights before the landings, the RAF bombed the big Italian base at [[Dire Dawa]] in Ethiopia.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139, 138}}\n\n===Voyage===\nOn 14 March the first echelon departed Aden at {{nowrap|10:45 p.m.}} but only {{conv|10|nmi|mi+km}} out, tows parted, some wrapping around the ships' propellers. To keep to the schedule a quick change of plan was made; ''Kandahar'' left the tugs and lighters for ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'' to tow. The naval ships went ahead to make rendezvous {{conv|10|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north of the Berbera Light at {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.}} on 16 March according to the plan. The [[Shoreham-class sloop|sloop]] {{HMS|Shoreham|L32|6}} was sent from Aden to assist ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'' by {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.}} on 15 March. The second echelon sailed an hour later and rendezvoused as planned. At {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.}} on 16 March ''Glasgow'', '' Caledon'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Netravati'', ''Parvati'' and M.L. 109 were to land the 1/2 and 3/15 Punjab at Main Beach, {{conv|2|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera Light covered by a bombardment from ''Glasgow'', along with ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'', which carried the 200 Somali commandos of Force G (R) who were to make the subsidiary landing east of Berbera, covered by ''Kandahar''. The ships were to close on the coast at {{conv|12|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Shoreham'', ''Beaconsfield'', ''Tuna'' with the three tugs and six lighters in tow were about midway between Aden and Berbera moving at {{conv|6|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=46\u201347}}\n\n==Invasion==\n\n===Landings===\nAt {{nowrap|1:01 a.m.}} on 16 March ''Glasgow'', ''Kandahar'', ''Kingston'' and M.L. 109 moved forward at {{conv|20|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} towards Berbera Light and to find the gaps in the reefs off the landing beaches. ''Caledon'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Netravati'' and ''Parvati'' were to arrive off the west beach at {{nowrap|2:30 a.m.}} and drop anchor near ''Glasgow'' which would be showing a red light out to sea. During the approach lights were seen ashore from vehicles on the Hargeisa Road, bound for Berbera. At {{nowrap|2:03 a.m.}} on 16 March, the Berbera Light was seen on a bearing 186\u00b0 at {{conv|3|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} distance. ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'' separated from the force and made for the eastern beach; ''Glasgow'' stopped and launched a motor boat and skiff for Commander Vernon to use to find the gap in the reef off the western beach. The gap was hard to find and there was a delay of 63 minutes in landing the first tows. ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'' found their gap in the reef off the eastern beach at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} although the reconnaissance photographs had shown this to be the harder of the two to find. The delay led to apprehension by Colonel Pollock and Captain Hickling (the captain of Glasgow) that the landing might occur in daylight.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=47}}\n\nThe landing at the eastern beach due at {{nowrap|3:30 a.m.}} was also delayed; at {{nowrap|3:26 a.m.}} a Somali fisherman in a canoe rowed up to ''Glasgow''. The fisherman said that Italians still occupied the town but some had left by lorry that night; there were Italians near the Berbera Light. The Somali was sent to find the gap in the reefs but Vernon found it at {{nowrap|3:58 a.m.}} At {{nowrap|4:13 a.m.}} the signal \"Land, follow Glasgow's boats\" was given and four minutes later ''Glasgow'' began to bombarded the main beach with H.E. from its 4-inch guns and [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder pom-poms]]. The fire from the 4-inch main armament was that used for E-boat attack, with half the shells bursting on impact and the other half bursting {{conv|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} over the target, until {{nowrap|4:20 a.m.}} when ''Kingston'' received the order to begin landing on the eastern beach. ''Kandahar'' bombarded the beach from {{nowrap|4:25\u20134:35 a.m.}} Tows moved through the gaps to the eastern and western beaches, success signals coming from at the western beach was made at {{nowrap|4:48 a.m.}} and at the eastern beach at {{nowrap|5:26 a.m.}} During the disembarkations shells burst among the tows and ships offshore, thought to be from four to six 4-inch guns and some ineffectual machine-gun fire; the 6-inch, 4-inch and pom-poms of the bombardment ships silenced the Italian artillery. ''Glasgow'' mainly engaged trenches near the Berbera Light and west of the aerodrome. ''Kandahar'' concentrated on the defences to the east of the town.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n===Berbera===\n{{wide image|File:Somaliland (6936711023) (2).jpg|700px|align-cap=center|Photograph of the Berbera landscape (2012)}}\nAnticipating a British landing, the Duke of Aosta, the Viceroy of the AOI, had agreed to the evacuation of the protectorate. On 14 March the Italian garrison began to evacuate the territory and the 17th Colonial Brigade retired to Dire Dawa. The 70th Colonial Brigade remained, except for its commander, Brigadier-General Arturo Bertello who passed through Dire Dawa just before it was captured.{{sfn|Del Boca|2001|p=506}} When the naval bombardment began, about {{nowrap|1,500 Somali}} troops in Italian service and their Italian officers and NCOs retreated from Berbera towards Hargeisa.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=138}} The first wave, comprising the 15th Punjab Regiment, was carried by ''Parvati'' which towed a tug and barge for the landing. ''Parvati'' was bracketed by three 4-inch shells but the landing was carried out without loss against scant opposition. The 2nd Punjab Regiment landed and advanced through the 15th Punjab towards the town, as a party of the 15th Punjab moved inland to cut the coast road. All of the troops involved got ashore before dawn. Little opposition was met with ashore and the town was captured by {{nowrap|9:20 a.m.}} on 16 March. The British and Indian troops suffered few casualties and over 100 prisoners were taken.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=49}} Due to a mistake, the Aden Pioneers, who were unarmed, had been ordered to attack with the Punjabis and their commander, Captain S. J. H. Harrison wrote later,\n\n{{quote|The sun was just peeping over the eastern skyline [;] we came under rifle fire...when to our utter amazement we saw the Italian enemy leaping out of their trenches and racing towards transport vehicles....The vehicles started up and the entire enemy column high-tailed in a great cloud of yellowish grey dust...southwards...to Hargeisa....{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=178}}}}\n\nA diversion to the east of Berbera was engaged by sixty members of the garrison but the landing party suffered only one Somali soldier killed and a British officer wounded. A wireless message sent to London that \"The British flag flies again over Berbera\" but the invaders had forgotten to bring one and had to borrow it from a resident. RAF fighters provided a standing patrol on the day of the invasion and for the next four days.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nThe second echelon ships had arrived by the time that Berbera fell and tugs checked the harbour for mines with [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|Oropesa sweeps]]. By {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} Force D was unloading; the special motor transport pier consisting of the two modified lighters was assembled at the spit and motor transport unloaded from ''Beaconsfield'' by {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} The landing force was well established ashore with adequate stores and rations, local water being available. Air reconnaissance reported the hinterland to be deserted (naval protection ended on 18 March when ''Glasgow'' departed; air cover continued until 20 March). The Shaad and customs piers had been damaged but couls be repaired with local materials; demolitions at the power station and refrigerating plant required assistance from Aden to make them operational. The water supply was about to be blown up but the occupation troops prevented it. Mining of the aerodrome had been carried out and the RAF was informed. The landing force sent 43 Italian prisoners of war to Aden in ''Parvati'' on the day of the landings, as the hospital ship Karapara which was not needed. About {{nowrap|5:33 a.m.}} on 17 March some aircraft were heard and a barrage was fired; no further Italian aircraft were seen during the day.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=50, 49}}\n\nOn 11 March the [[1st Infantry Brigade (South Africa)|1st South African Brigade Group]] and the [[22nd East African Brigade Group]] had been placed under the command of the [[1st (African) Division|11th (African) Division]], joining the [[1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade|3rd (Nigerian) Brigade Group]]. The division advanced from [[Barawa]] (Brava), south of Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland. On 25 February the division departed Mogadishu and on 17 March, patrols of the 3rd (Nigerian) Brigade reached [[Jijiga]], cutting the road to Harar, the Italian line of retreat from the protectorate.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=416\u2013418}} On 19 March, Brigadier Buchanan and a staff officer arrived by air at Berbera to take command of Bucforce, a temporary name for the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade, most of which had sailed from Mombasa on 16 March and was due on 22 March. On 20 March, a party of Nigerian troops reached [[Tug Wajale]], from whence two armoured cars drove to Berbera along the road from Hargeisa and joined with the Aden Striking Force.{{sfn|Orpen|1968|p=227}} The Italian 70th Colonial Brigade became one of the many units of the Italian colonial forces in the AOI that had begun to desert en masse.

On 23 March a Somaliland police officer landed and recalled the local police. The Somaliland Camel Corps had been disbanded after the British evacuation and by the time British returned to the headquarters in Burao on 18 April, 80 percent of the former members had made their way to Berbera. On 4 May a company of the corps began a mission to suppress a Mijjertein raiding party, the rest of the corps conducting disarmament operations with a motley of captured Italian weapons and equipment.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\n[[File:Another Dhow.JPG|thumb|left|{{centre|Dhow sailing in the Indian Ocean, 2009}}]]\nMany of the buildings in Berbera had been damaged, government stations demolished andthe civilian wireless and telephone networks were out of action. Army signals units had to carry civilian administration messages until the infrastructure had been restored. The economy of the protectorate had been greatly harmed by the war, internal trade had stopped, there were no regular shipping services with Aden and only [[dhow]]s were available. There was little food in the territory but the livestock herd had increased since 1939 and had suffered little from the Italians. The fall of Addis Ababa restored confidence, internal trade resumed and by the autumn the export trade had revived. Once Berbera replaced [[Mogadishu]] as an [[entrep\u00f4t]], demand for labour increased; payment in wages and in food acted as an economic stimulus and local businessmen immediately made use of the sea traffic to and from Berbera; a return to normal conditions did not occur Zeila and Boramo, near the border with French Somaliland, due to the need to blockade the pro-[[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|pp=180\u2013182}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Collins|1964}}\n|series=Official History of the Indian Armed Forces In the Second World War |title=The Royal Indian Navy 1939\u20131945 |last=Collins |first=D.
