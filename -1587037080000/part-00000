[[Website]]s can use TLS to secure all communications between their [[server (computing)|servers]] and [[web browser]]s.\n\nThe TLS protocol aims primarily to provide [[privacy]] and [[data integrity]] between two or more communicating computer applications.<ref name=RFC5246/>{{rp|3}} When secured by TLS, connections between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., wikipedia.org) should have one or more of the following properties:\n* The connection is ''private'' (or ''secure'') because [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric cryptography]] is used to [[Encryption|encrypt]] the data transmitted. The [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a [[shared secret]] that was negotiated at the start of the [[Session (computer science)|session]] (see [[#TLS handshake|\u00a7 TLS handshake]]). The server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first [[byte]] of data is transmitted (see [[#Algorithm|\u00a7 Algorithm]] below). The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdroppers]] and cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).\n* The identity of the communicating parties can be ''authenticated'' using [[public-key cryptography]]. This authentication can be made optional, but is generally required for at least one of the parties (typically the server).\n* The connection is ''reliable'' because each message transmitted includes a message integrity check using a [[message authentication code]] to prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during [[Data transmission|transmission]].<ref name=RFC5246/>{{rp|3}}\n\nIn addition to the properties above, careful [[Computer configuration|configuration]] of TLS can provide additional privacy-related properties such as [[forward secrecy]], ensuring that any future disclosure of encryption keys cannot be used to decrypt any TLS communications recorded in the past.<ref>[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/06/25/ssl-intercepted-today-decrypted-tomorrow.html SSL: Intercepted today, decrypted tomorrow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053551/http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/06/25/ssl-intercepted-today-decrypted-tomorrow.html |date=2013-09-21}}, Netcraft, 2013-06-25.</ref>\n\nTLS supports many different methods for exchanging keys, encrypting data, and authenticating message integrity (see [[#Algorithm|\u00a7 Algorithm]] below). As a result, secure configuration of TLS involves many configurable parameters, and not all choices provide all of the privacy-related properties described in the list above (see the [[#keyexchange-table|\u00a7 Key exchange]] (authentication), [[#cipher-table|\u00a7 Cipher security]], and [[#integrity-table|\u00a7 Data integrity]] tables).\n\nAttempts have been made to subvert aspects of the communications security that TLS seeks to provide, and the protocol has been revised several times to address these security threats (see [[#Security|\u00a7 Security]]). Developers of web browsers have also revised their products to defend against potential security weaknesses after these were discovered (see [[#Web browsers|TLS/SSL support history of web browsers]]).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe TLS protocol comprises two layers: the [[#TLS record|TLS record]] and the [[#TLS handshake|TLS handshake]] protocols.\n\nTLS is a proposed Internet Engineering Task Force ([[IETF]]) [[Internet Standard|standard]], first defined in 1999, and the current version is TLS 1.3 defined in {{IETF RFC|8446}} (August 2018). TLS builds on the earlier SSL specifications (1994, 1995, 1996) developed by [[Netscape|Netscape Communications]]<ref name=RFC6101>\n{{cite web |url= http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6101 |title= The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol Version 3.0 |date= August 2011 |author1= A. Freier |author2= P. Karlton |author3= P. Kocher |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120115032035/http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6101 |archivedate= 2012-01-15}}</ref>\nfor adding the [[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]] protocol to their [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]] web browser.\n\n{{toc limit}}\n\n==Description==\nClient-server applications use the TLS protocol to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.\n\nSince applications can communicate either with or without TLS (or SSL), it is necessary for the client to indicate to the server the setup of a TLS connection. One of the main ways of achieving this is to use a different port number for TLS connections, for example port 443 for HTTPS. Another mechanism is for the client to make a protocol-specific request to the server to switch the connection to TLS; for example, by making a STARTTLS request when using the mail and news protocols.\n\nOnce the client and server have agreed to use TLS, they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure. The protocols use a handshake with an asymmetric cipher to establish not only cipher settings but also a session-specific shared key with which further communication is encrypted using a symmetric cipher. During this handshake, the client and server agree on various parameters used to establish the connection's security:\n\n* The handshake begins when a client connects to a TLS-enabled server requesting a secure connection and the client presents a list of supported cipher suites (ciphers and hash functions).\n* From this list, the server picks a cipher and hash function that it also supports and notifies the client of the decision.\n* The server usually then provides identification in the form of a digital certificate. The certificate contains the server name, the trusted certificate authority (CA) that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate, and the server's public encryption key.\n* The client confirms the validity of the certificate before proceeding.\n* To generate the session keys used for the secure connection, the client either:\n** encrypts a random number with the server's public key and sends the result to the server (which only the server should be able to decrypt with its private key); both parties then use the random number to generate a unique session key for subsequent encryption and decryption of data during the session\n** uses Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange to securely generate a random and unique session key for encryption and decryption that has the additional property of forward secrecy: if the server's private key is disclosed in future, it cannot be used to decrypt the current session, even if the session is intercepted and recorded by a third party.\n\nThis concludes the handshake and begins the secured connection, which is encrypted and decrypted with the session key until the connection closes. If any one of the above steps fails, then the TLS handshake fails and the connection is not created.\n\nTLS and SSL do not fit neatly into any single layer of the OSI model or the TCP/IP model. TLS runs \"on top of some reliable transport protocol (e.g., TCP),\" which would imply that it is above the transport layer. It serves encryption to higher layers, which is normally the function of the presentation layer. However, applications generally use TLS as if it were a transport layer, even though applications using TLS must actively control initiating TLS handshakes and handling of exchanged authentication certificates.\n\n==History and development==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin-left:1em;\"\n|+SSL and TLS protocols\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Protocol\n!scope=\"col\"| Published\n!scope=\"col\"| Status\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| SSL 1.0\n| {{n/a|Unpublished}}\n| {{n/a|Unpublished}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| SSL 2.0\n| 1995\n|Deprecated in 2011 (RFC 6176)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| SSL 3.0\n| 1996\n|Deprecated in 2015 (RFC 7568)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| TLS 1.0\n| 1999\n|Deprecated in 2020<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghacks.net/2020/03/10/here-is-what-is-new-and-changed-in-firefox-74-0-stable/|title=Here is what is new and changed in Firefox 74.0 Stable - gHacks Tech News|website=www.ghacks.net|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://chromestatus.com/feature/5759116003770368|title=TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 - Chrome Platform Status|website=chromestatus.com|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref>\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| TLS 1.1\n| 2006\n|Deprecated in 2020<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| TLS 1.2\n| 2008\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| TLS 1.3\n| 2018\n|\n|}\n==={{Anchor|SDNS}}Secure Data Network System===\nThe Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLS) together with several other basic network security platforms, were developed through a joint initiative begun in August 1986, among the National Security Agency, the National Bureau of Standards, the Defense Communications Agency, and twelve communications and computer corporations who initiated a special project called the Secure Data Network System (SDNS). The program was described in September 1987 at the 10th National Computer Security Conference in an extensive set of published papers.  The innovative research program focused on designing the next generation of secure computer communications network and product specifications to be implemented for applications on public and private internets. It was intended to complement the rapidly emerging new OSI internet standards moving forward both in the U.S. government's GOSIP Profiles and in the huge ITU-ISO JTC1 internet effort internationally. Originally known as the SP4 protocol, it was renamed TLS and subsequently published in 1995 as international standard ITU-T X.274| ISO/IEC 10736:1995.\n\n==={{Anchor|SNP}}Secure Network Programming===\nEarly research efforts towards transport layer security included the [[Secure Network Programming]] (SNP) [[application programming interface]] (API), which in 1993 explored the approach of having a secure transport layer API closely resembling [[Berkeley sockets]], to facilitate retrofitting pre-existing network applications with security measures.<ref name=\"Woo94\">Thomas Y.

This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made by the private key that corresponds to the certified public key.\n\n===Certificate authorities===\n{{Main|Certificate authority}}\nTLS typically relies on a set of trusted third-party certificate authorities to establish the authenticity of certificates. Trust is usually anchored in a list of certificates distributed with user agent software,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/sec-t02_final.pdf|title=Alternatives to Certification Authorities for a Secure Web|last=Rea|first=Scott|date=2013|website=|publisher=RSA Conference Asia Pacific|access-date=7 September 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007222635/https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/sec-t02_final.pdf|archivedate=7 October 2016|df=}}</ref> and can be modified by the relying party.\n\nAccording to [[Netcraft]], who monitors active TLS certificates, the market-leading certificate authority (CA) has been [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]] since the beginning of their survey (or [[Verisign|VeriSign]] before the authentication services business unit was purchased by Symantec). Symantec currently accounts for just under a third of all certificates and 44% of the valid certificates used by the 1 million busiest websites, as counted by Netcraft.<ref>[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2015/05/13/counting-ssl-certificates.html Counting SSL certificates; netcraft; May 13, 2015.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516035536/http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2015/05/13/counting-ssl-certificates.html |date=May 16, 2015}}</ref>{{Update inline|reason=Symantec has since sold their CA business to DigiCert|date=August 2019}}\n\nAs a consequence of choosing [[X.509]] certificates, certificate authorities and a [[public key infrastructure]] are necessary to verify the relation between a certificate and its owner, as well as to generate, sign, and administer the validity of certificates. While this can be more convenient than verifying the identities via a [[web of trust]], the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] made it more widely known that certificate authorities are a weak point from a security standpoint, allowing [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s (MITM) if the certificate authority cooperates (or is compromised).<ref>[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/packet-forensics/ Law Enforcement Appliance Subverts SSL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315064727/http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/packet-forensics |date=2014-03-15}}, Wired, 2010-04-03.</ref><ref>[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/researchers-reveal-likelihood-governments-fake-ssl New Research Suggests That Governments May Fake SSL Certificates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104234608/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/researchers-reveal-likelihood-governments-fake-ssl |date=2016-01-04}}, EFF, 2010-03-24.</ref>\n\n==Algorithm==\n{{see also|Cipher suite}}\n\n===Key exchange or key agreement===\nBefore a client and server can begin to exchange information protected by TLS, they must securely exchange or agree upon an encryption key and a cipher to use when encrypting data (see [[#Cipher|\u00a7 Cipher]]). Among the methods used for key exchange/agreement are: public and private keys generated with [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] (denoted TLS_RSA in the TLS handshake protocol), [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (TLS_DH), ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman (TLS_DHE), [[elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (TLS_ECDH), ephemeral elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman (TLS_ECDHE), [[Key-agreement protocol#Exponential key exchange|anonymous Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (TLS_DH_anon),<ref name=\"RFC5246\"/> [[TLS-PSK|pre-shared key]] (TLS_PSK)<ref name=RFC4279>{{cite web|title=Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)|rfc=4279 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4279|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=9 September 2013|author=P.

Only TLS_DHE and TLS_ECDHE provide [[#Forward secrecy|forward secrecy]].\n\nPublic key certificates used during exchange/agreement also vary in the size of the public/private encryption keys used during the exchange and hence the robustness of the security provided. In July 2013, [[Google]] announced that it would no longer use 1024-bit public keys and would switch instead to 2048-bit keys to increase the security of the TLS encryption it provides to its users because the encryption strength is directly related to the [[key size]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last=Gothard|first=Peter|title=Google updates SSL certificates to 2048-bit encryption|url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2285984/google-updates-ssl-certificates-to-2048bit-encryption |work=Computing|publisher=Incisive Media|accessdate=9 September 2013|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922082322/http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2285984/google-updates-ssl-certificates-to-2048bit-encryption|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/From-1024-to-2048-bit-The-security-effect-of-encryption-key-length|title=The value of 2,048-bit encryption: Why encryption key length matters |work=SearchSecurity|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081141/http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/From-1024-to-2048-bit-The-security-effect-of-encryption-key-length|archivedate=2018-01-16|df=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|keyexchange-table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Key exchange/agreement and authentication\n!

However, it has also been implemented with datagram-oriented transport protocols, such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) and the [[Datagram Congestion Control Protocol]] (DCCP), usage of which has been standardized independently using the term [[Datagram Transport Layer Security]] (DTLS).\n\n===Websites===\nA primary use of TLS is to secure [[World Wide Web]] traffic between a [[website]] and a [[web browser]] encoded with the HTTP protocol. This use of TLS to secure HTTP traffic constitutes the [[https|HTTPS]] protocol.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/https.html |title=Http vs https |accessdate=2015-02-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212105201/https://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/https.html |archivedate=2015-02-12}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Website protocol support\n|-\n!Protocol<br />version\n!Website<br />support<ref name=\"trustworthy_ssl_pulse\">As of August 3, 2019. {{cite web |url=https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse/ |title=SSL Pulse: Survey of the SSL Implementation of the Most Popular Websites |website=[[Qualys]] |accessdate=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n!Security<ref name=\"trustworthy_ssl_pulse\"/><ref name=\"community.qualys\">{{cite web|url=https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/03/19/rc4-in-tls-is-broken-now-what|accessdate=2013-07-30|publisher=Qualsys Security Labs|author=ivanr|title=RC4 in TLS is Broken: Now What?|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827044512/https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/03/19/rc4-in-tls-is-broken-now-what|archivedate=2013-08-27}}</ref>\n|-\n!SSL 2.0\n|1.6%\n|{{Bad|Insecure}}\n|-\n!SSL 3.0\n|6.7%\n|{{Bad|Insecure<ref name=\"poodle_pdf\" />}}\n|-\n!TLS 1.0\n|65.0%\n|{{Depends|Depends on cipher<ref group=\"n\" name=\"ciphers\">see [[#Cipher|\u00a7 Cipher]] table above</ref> and client mitigations<ref group=\"n\" name=\"mitigations\">see [[#Web browsers|\u00a7 Web browsers]] and [[#Attacks against TLS/SSL|\u00a7 Attacks against TLS/SSL]] sections</ref>}}\n|-\n!TLS 1.1\n|75.1%\n|{{Depends|Depends on cipher<ref group=\"n\" name=\"ciphers\"/> and client mitigations<ref group=\"n\" name=\"mitigations\"/>}}\n|-\n!TLS 1.2\n|96.0%\n|{{Depends|Depends on cipher<ref group=\"n\" name=\"ciphers\"/> and client mitigations<ref group=\"n\" name=\"mitigations\"/>}}\n|-\n!TLS 1.3\n|18.4%\n|{{Good|Secure}}\n|}\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=\"n\"}}\n\n===Web browsers===\n{{Further|Comparison of web browsers}}\n{{As of|2016|04}}, the latest versions of all major web browsers support TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, and have them enabled by default. However, not all supported [[List of Microsoft operating systems|Microsoft operating systems]] support the latest version of IE. Additionally, many operating systems currently support multiple versions of IE, but this has changed according to Microsoft's [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/microsoft-internet-explorer Internet Explorer Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ], \"beginning January 12, 2016, only the most current version of Internet Explorer available for a supported operating system will receive technical support and security updates.\" The page then goes on to list the latest supported version of IE at that date for each operating system. The next critical date would be when an operating system reaches the end of life stage, which is in Microsoft's [https://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle Windows lifecycle fact sheet].\n\nMitigations against known attacks are not enough yet:\n* Mitigations against [[#POODLE attack|POODLE attack]]: some browsers already prevent fallback to SSL 3.0; however, this mitigation needs to be supported by not only clients but also servers. Disabling SSL 3.0 itself, implementation of \"anti-POODLE record splitting\", or denying CBC ciphers in SSL 3.0 is required.\n** Google Chrome: complete (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since version 33, fallback to SSL 3.0 is disabled since version 39, SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default since version 40. Support of SSL 3.0 itself was dropped since version 44.)\n** Mozilla Firefox: complete (support of SSL 3.0 itself is dropped since [[History of Firefox#Version 38\u201344|version 39]]. SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default and fallback to SSL 3.0 are disabled since [[History of Firefox#Version 31\u201337|version 34]], TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since version 35. In ESR, SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default and TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since ESR 31.3.)\n** Internet Explorer: partial (only in version 11, SSL 3.0 is disabled by default since April 2015. Version 10 and older are still vulnerable against POODLE.)\n** [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]: complete (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since version 20, \"anti-POODLE record splitting\", which is effective only with client-side implementation, is implemented since version 25, SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default since version 27. Support of SSL 3.0 itself will be dropped since version 31.)\n** Safari: complete (only on OS X 10.8 and later and iOS 8, CBC ciphers during fallback to SSL 3.0 is denied, but this means it will use RC4, which is not recommended as well. Support of SSL 3.0 itself is dropped on OS X 10.11 and later and iOS 9.)\n* Mitigation against [[#RC4 attacks|RC4 attacks]]:\n** Google Chrome disabled RC4 except as a fallback since version 43. RC4 is disabled since Chrome 48.\n** Firefox disabled RC4 except as a fallback since version 36. Firefox 44 disabled RC4 by default.\n** Opera disabled RC4 except as a fallback since version 30. RC4 is disabled since Opera 35.\n** Internet Explorer for [[Windows 7]] / Server 2008 R2 and for [[Windows 8]] / Server 2012 have set the priority of RC4 to lowest and can also disable RC4 except as a fallback through registry settings. Internet Explorer 11 Mobile 11 for [[Windows Phone 8.1]] disable RC4 except as a fallback if no other enabled algorithm works. Edge and IE 11 disable RC4 completely in August 2016.\n* Mitigation against [[Transport Layer Security#FREAK|FREAK attack]]:\n** The Android Browser included with [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|Android 4]] and older is still vulnerable to the FREAK attack.\n** Internet Explorer 11 Mobile is still vulnerable to the FREAK attack.\n** Google Chrome, Internet Explorer (desktop), Safari (desktop & mobile), and Opera (mobile) have FREAK mitigations in place.\n** Mozilla Firefox on all platforms and Google Chrome on Windows were not affected by FREAK.\n\n{{clear}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" id=\"browsersTLS\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: smaller; margin-top: 0px;\"\n|+'''TLS/SSL support history of web browsers'''\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Browser\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Platforms\n! colspan=\"2\" | SSL protocols\n! colspan=\"4\" | TLS protocols\n! colspan=\"3\" | Certificate support\n! colspan=\"6\" | Vulnerabilities fixed{{refn | group=\"n\" | name=\"note-sec\" |Does the browser have mitigations or is not vulnerable for the known attacks.

According to the authors\n<blockquote>\"the root cause of most of these vulnerabilities is the terrible design of the APIs to the underlying SSL libraries. Instead of expressing high-level security properties of network tunnels such as confidentiality and authentication, these APIs expose low-level details of the SSL protocol to application developers. As a consequence, developers often use SSL APIs incorrectly, misinterpreting and misunderstanding their manifold parameters, options, side effects, and return values.\"</blockquote>\n\n===Other uses===\nThe [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) can also be protected by TLS. These applications use [[public key certificate]]s to verify the identity of endpoints.\n\nTLS can also be used for tunnelling an entire network stack to create a [[virtual private network|VPN]], which is the case with [[OpenVPN]] and [[OpenConnect]]. Many vendors have by now married TLS's encryption and authentication capabilities with authorization. There has also been substantial development since the late 1990s in creating client technology outside of Web-browsers, in order to enable support for client/server applications. Compared to traditional [[IPsec]] VPN technologies, TLS has some inherent advantages in firewall and [[network address translation|NAT]] traversal that make it easier to administer for large remote-access populations.\n\nTLS is also a standard method for protecting [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) application signaling. TLS can be used for providing authentication and encryption of the SIP signalling associated with [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] and other SIP-based applications.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Security==\n\n===SSL 2.0===\nSSL 2.0 was flawed in a variety of ways:<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the Security of Today's Online Electronic Banking Systems|author1=Joris Claessens |author2=Valentin Dem |author3=Danny De Cock |author4=Bart Preneel |author5=Joos Vandewalle |journal=Computers & Security|volume=21|issue=3|year=2002|pages=253\u2013265|doi=10.1016/S0167-4048(02)00312-7}}</ref>\n* Identical cryptographic keys were used for [[message authentication]] and encryption. <!-- please explain how this affects security --> (In SSL 3.0, MAC secrets may be larger than encryption keys, so messages can remain tamper-resistant even if encryption keys are broken.<ref name=\"RFC6101\"/>)\n* SSL 2.0 had a weak MAC construction that used the MD5 hash function with a secret prefix, making it vulnerable to [[length extension attack]]s.\n* SSL 2.0 did not have any protection for the handshake, meaning a man-in-the-middle [[downgrade attack]] could go undetected.\n* SSL 2.0 used the TCP connection close to indicate the end of data. This meant that truncation attacks were possible: the attacker simply forges a TCP FIN, leaving the recipient unaware of an illegitimate end of data message (SSL 3.0 fixed this problem by having an explicit closure alert).\n* SSL 2.0 assumed a single service and a fixed domain certificate, which clashed with the standard feature of virtual hosting in Web servers. This means that most websites were practically impaired from using SSL.\n\nSSL 2.0 was disabled by default, beginning with [[Internet Explorer 7]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/22/483795.aspx|title=IEBlog: Upcoming HTTPS Improvements in Internet Explorer 7 Beta 2|accessdate=2007-11-25|last=Lawrence|first=Eric|date=2005-10-22|publisher=[[Microsoft Developer Network|MSDN]] Blogs|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FwL2ooJz?url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2005/10/22/483795.aspx|archivedate=2013-04-17|df=}}</ref> [[Mozilla Firefox]] 2,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236933|title=Bugzilla@Mozilla&nbsp;\u2014 Bug 236933 \u2013 Disable SSL2 and other weak ciphers|accessdate=2007-11-25|publisher=[[Mozilla Corporation]]}}</ref> [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 9.5,<ref>[http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/950/ \"Opera 9.5 for Windows Changelog\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626142453/http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/950/ |date=2009-06-26}} at [[Opera.com]]: \"Disabled SSL v2 and weak ciphers.\"</ref> and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].

The SSL 3.0 cipher suites have a weaker key derivation process; half of the master key that is established is fully dependent on the MD5 hash function, which is not resistant to collisions and is, therefore, not considered secure. Under TLS 1.0, the master key that is established depends on both MD5 and SHA-1 so its derivation process is not currently considered weak. It is for this reason that SSL 3.0 implementations cannot be validated under FIPS 140-2.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Institute of Standards and Technology |title=Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-2 and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program |date=December 2010 |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/fips140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106130105/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/fips140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf |archivedate=November 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2014, the vulnerability in the design of SSL 3.0 was reported, which makes CBC mode of operation with SSL 3.0 vulnerable to the padding attack (see [[#POODLE attack]]).\n\n===TLS===\nTLS has a variety of security measures:\n* Protection against a downgrade of the protocol to a previous (less secure) version or a weaker cipher suite.\n* Numbering subsequent Application records with a sequence number and using this sequence number in the [[message authentication code]]s (MACs).\n* Using a message digest enhanced with a key (so only a key-holder can check the MAC). The [[HMAC]] construction used by most TLS cipher suites is specified in {{IETF RFC|2104}} (SSL 3.0 used a different hash-based MAC).\n* The message that ends the handshake (\"Finished\") sends a hash of all the exchanged handshake messages seen by both parties.\n* The [[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] function splits the input data in half and processes each one with a different hashing algorithm ([[MD5]] and [[SHA-1]]), then [[exclusive or|XORs]] them together to create the MAC. This provides protection even if one of these algorithms is found to be vulnerable.\n\n===Attacks against TLS/SSL===\nSignificant attacks against TLS/SSL are listed below.\n\nIn February 2015, IETF issued an informational RFC<ref>{{cite web|rfc=7457 |title=Summarizing Known Attacks on Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS)|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201813/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}</ref> summarizing the various known attacks against TLS/SSL.\n\n====Renegotiation attack====\nA vulnerability of the renegotiation procedure was discovered in August 2009 that can lead to plaintext injection attacks against SSL 3.0 and all current versions of TLS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555|title=CVE \u2013 CVE-2009-3555|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104234608/http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555|archivedate=2016-01-04|df=}}</ref> For example, it allows an attacker who can hijack an https connection to splice their own requests into the beginning of the conversation the client has with the web server. The attacker can't actually decrypt the client\u2013server communication, so it is different from a typical man-in-the-middle attack. A short-term fix is for web servers to stop allowing renegotiation, which typically will not require other changes unless [[client certificate]] authentication is used. To fix the vulnerability, a renegotiation indication extension was proposed for TLS. It will require the client and server to include and verify information about previous handshakes in any renegotiation handshakes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Rescorla|title=Understanding the TLS Renegotiation Attack|work=Educated Guesswork|accessdate=2009-11-27|date=2009-11-05|url=http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2009/11/understanding_the_tls_renegoti.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65JSTKRCA?url=http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2009/11/understanding_the_tls_renegoti.html|archivedate=2012-02-09|df=}}</ref> This extension has become a proposed standard and has been assigned the number {{IETF RFC|5746}}.

This is done by way of a \"[[transparent proxy]]\": the interception software terminates the incoming TLS connection, inspects the HTTP plaintext, and then creates a new TLS connection to the destination.<ref name=\"Durumeric et al 2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Durumeric |first1=Zakir |last2=Ma |first2=Zane |last3=Springall |first3=Drew |last4=Barnes |first4=Richard |last5=Sullivan |first5=Nick |last6=Bursztein |first6=Elie |last7=Bailey |first7=Michael |last8=Halderman |first8=J.

Because it provides a point where network traffic is available unencrypted, attackers have an incentive to attack this point in particular in order to gain access to otherwise secure content. The interception also allows the network operator, or persons who gain access to its interception system, to perform [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s against network users. A 2017 study found that \"HTTPS interception has become startlingly widespread, and that interception products as a class have a dramatically negative impact on connection security\".<ref name=\"Durumeric et al 2017\" />\n\n==Protocol details==\nThe TLS protocol exchanges ''records'', which encapsulate the data to be exchanged in a specific format (see below). Each record can be compressed, padded, appended with a [[message authentication code]] (MAC), or encrypted, all depending on the state of the connection. Each record has a ''content type'' field that designates the type of data encapsulated, a length field and a TLS version field. The data encapsulated may be control or procedural messages of the TLS itself, or simply the application data needed to be transferred by TLS. The specifications (cipher suite, keys etc.) required to exchange application data by TLS, are agreed upon in the \"TLS handshake\" between the client requesting the data and the server responding to requests. The protocol therefore defines both the structure of payloads transferred in TLS and the procedure to establish and monitor the transfer.\n\n===TLS handshake===\nWhen the connection starts, the record encapsulates a \"control\" protocol \u2013 the handshake messaging protocol (''content type'' 22). This protocol is used to exchange all the information required by both sides for the exchange of the actual application data by TLS. It defines the format of messages and the order of their exchange. These may vary according to the demands of the client and server \u2013 i.e., there are several possible procedures to set up the connection. This initial exchange results in a successful TLS connection (both parties ready to transfer application data with TLS) or an alert message (as specified below).\n\n====Basic TLS handshake====\nA typical connection example follows, illustrating a [[Handshaking|handshake]] where the server (but not the client) is authenticated by its certificate:\n\n# Negotiation phase:\n#* A client sends a '''ClientHello''' message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested [[cipher suite]]s and suggested compression methods. If the client is attempting to perform a resumed handshake, it may send a ''session ID''. If the client can use [[Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation]], it may include a list of supported application [[Communications protocol|protocols]], such as [[HTTP/2]].\n#* The server responds with a '''ServerHello''' message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite and compression method from the choices offered by the client. To confirm or allow resumed handshakes the server may send a ''session ID''. The chosen protocol version should be the highest that both the client and server support. For example, if the client supports TLS version 1.1 and the server supports version 1.2, version 1.1 should be selected; version 1.2 should not be selected.\n#* The server sends its '''Certificate''' message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server).<ref name=\"openpgp\">These certificates are currently [[X.509]], but {{IETF RFC|6091}} also specifies the use of [[OpenPGP]]-based certificates.</ref>\n#* The server sends its '''ServerKeyExchange''' message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server). This message is sent for all DHE and DH_anon cipher suites.<ref name=\"RFC5246\"/>\n#* The server sends a '''ServerHelloDone''' message, indicating it is done with handshake negotiation.\n#* The client responds with a '''ClientKeyExchange''' message, which may contain a ''PreMasterSecret'', public key, or nothing. (Again, this depends on the selected cipher.) This ''PreMasterSecret'' is encrypted using the public key of the server certificate.\n#* The client and server then use the random numbers and ''PreMasterSecret'' to compute a common secret, called the \"master secret\". All other key data for this connection is derived from this master secret (and the client- and server-generated random values), which is passed through a carefully designed [[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] function.\n# The client now sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''' record, essentially telling the server, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted if encryption parameters were present in the server certificate).\" The ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol with content type of 20.\n#* The client sends an authenticated and encrypted '''Finished''' message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.\n#* The server will attempt to decrypt the client's ''Finished'' message and verify the hash and MAC. If the decryption or verification fails, the handshake is considered to have failed and the connection should be torn down.\n# Finally, the server sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''', telling the client, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted, if encryption was negotiated).\"\n#* The server sends its authenticated and encrypted '''Finished''' message.\n#* The client performs the same decryption and verification procedure as the server did in the previous step.\n# Application phase: at this point, the \"handshake\" is complete and the application protocol is enabled, with content type of 23. Application messages exchanged between client and server will also be authenticated and optionally encrypted exactly like in their ''Finished'' message. Otherwise, the content type will return 25 and the client will not authenticate.\n\n====Client-authenticated TLS handshake====\nThe following ''full'' example shows a client being authenticated (in addition to the server as in the example above) via TLS using certificates exchanged between both peers.\n\n# Negotiation Phase:\n#* A client sends a '''ClientHello''' message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested cipher suites and compression methods.\n#* The server responds with a '''ServerHello''' message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite and compression method from the choices offered by the client. The server may also send a ''session id'' as part of the message to perform a resumed handshake.\n#* The server sends its '''Certificate''' message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server).<ref name=\"openpgp\"/>\n#* The server sends its '''ServerKeyExchange''' message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server). This message is sent for all DHE and DH_anon ciphersuites.<ref name=\"RFC5246\"/>\n#* The server sends a '''CertificateRequest''' message, to request a certificate from the client so that the connection can be [[mutually authenticated]].\n#* The server sends a '''ServerHelloDone''' message, indicating it is done with handshake negotiation.\n#* The client responds with a '''Certificate''' message, which contains the client's certificate.\n#* The client sends a '''ClientKeyExchange''' message, which may contain a ''PreMasterSecret'', public key, or nothing. (Again, this depends on the selected cipher.) This ''PreMasterSecret'' is encrypted using the public key of the server certificate.\n#* The client sends a '''CertificateVerify''' message, which is a signature over the previous handshake messages using the client's certificate's private key. This signature can be verified by using the client's certificate's public key. This lets the server know that the client has access to the private key of the certificate and thus owns the certificate.\n#* The client and server then use the random numbers and ''PreMasterSecret'' to compute a common secret, called the \"master secret\". All other key data for this connection is derived from this master secret (and the client- and server-generated random values), which is passed through a carefully designed pseudorandom function.\n# The client now sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''' record, essentially telling the server, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted if encryption was negotiated). \" The ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol and has type 20 and not 22.\n#* Finally, the client sends an encrypted '''Finished''' message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.\n#* The server will attempt to decrypt the client's ''Finished'' message and verify the hash and MAC. If the decryption or verification fails, the handshake is considered to have failed and the connection should be torn down.\n# Finally, the server sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''', telling the client, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted if encryption was negotiated). \"\n#* The server sends its own encrypted '''Finished''' message.\n#* The client performs the same decryption and verification procedure as the server did in the previous step.\n# Application phase: at this point, the \"handshake\" is complete and the application protocol is enabled, with content type of 23. Application messages exchanged between client and server will also be encrypted exactly like in their ''Finished'' message.\n\n====Resumed TLS handshake====\nPublic key operations (e.g., RSA) are relatively expensive in terms of computational power. TLS provides a secure shortcut in the handshake mechanism to avoid these operations: resumed sessions. Resumed sessions are implemented using session IDs or session tickets.\n\nApart from the performance benefit, resumed sessions can also be used for [[single sign-on]], as it guarantees that both the original session and any resumed session originate from the same client. This is of particular importance for the [[FTPS|FTP over TLS/SSL]] protocol, which would otherwise suffer from a man-in-the-middle attack in which an attacker could intercept the contents of the secondary data connections.<ref>{{cite web |author=Chris |url=http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/02/vsftpd-210-released.html |title=vsftpd-2.1.0 released \u2013 Using TLS session resume for FTPS data connection authentication |publisher=Scarybeastsecurity. blogspot.com |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2012-05-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707213409/http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/02/vsftpd-210-released.html |archivedate=2012-07-07}}</ref>\n\n====TLS 1.3 handshake====\n\nThe TLS 1.3 handshake was condensed to only one round trip compared to the two round trips required in previous versions of TLS/SSL.\n\nFirst the client sends a clientHello message to the server that contains a list of supported ciphers in order of the client's preference and makes a guess on what key algorithm will be used so that it can send a secret key to share if needed. By making a guess at what key algorithm will be used, the server eliminates a round trip. After receiving the clientHello, the server sends a serverHello with its key, a certificate, the chosen cipher suite and the finished message.\n\nAfter the client receives the server's finished message, it now is coordinated with the server on which cipher suite to use.[https://blog.cloudflare.com/tls-1-3-overview-and-q-and-a/]\n\n=====Session IDs=====\nIn an ordinary ''full'' handshake, the server sends a ''session id'' as part of the '''ServerHello''' message. The client associates this ''session id'' with the server's IP address and TCP port, so that when the client connects again to that server, it can use the ''session id'' to shortcut the handshake. In the server, the ''session id'' maps to the cryptographic parameters previously negotiated, specifically the \"master secret\". Both sides must have the same \"master secret\" or the resumed handshake will fail (this prevents an eavesdropper from using a ''session id''). The random data in the '''ClientHello''' and '''ServerHello''' messages virtually guarantee that the generated connection keys will be different from in the previous connection. In the RFCs, this type of handshake is called an ''abbreviated'' handshake. It is also described in the literature as a ''restart'' handshake.\n\n# Negotiation phase:\n#* A client sends a '''ClientHello''' message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested cipher suites and compression methods. Included in the message is the ''session id'' from the previous TLS connection.\n#* The server responds with a '''ServerHello''' message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite and compression method from the choices offered by the client. If the server recognizes the ''session id'' sent by the client, it responds with the same ''session id''. The client uses this to recognize that a resumed handshake is being performed. If the server does not recognize the ''session id'' sent by the client, it sends a different value for its ''session id''. This tells the client that a resumed handshake will not be performed. At this point, both the client and server have the \"master secret\" and random data to generate the key data to be used for this connection.\n# The server now sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''' record, essentially telling the client, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be encrypted.\" The ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol and has type 20 and not 22.\n#* Finally, the server sends an encrypted '''Finished''' message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.\n#* The client will attempt to decrypt the server's ''Finished'' message and verify the hash and MAC. If the decryption or verification fails, the handshake is considered to have failed and the connection should be torn down.\n# Finally, the client sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''', telling the server, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be encrypted. \"\n#* The client sends its own encrypted '''Finished''' message.\n#* The server performs the same decryption and verification procedure as the client did in the previous step.\n# Application phase: at this point, the \"handshake\" is complete and the application protocol is enabled, with content type of 23. Application messages exchanged between client and server will also be encrypted exactly like in their ''Finished'' message.\n\n=====Session tickets=====\n{{IETF RFC|5077}} extends TLS via use of session tickets, instead of session IDs. It defines a way to resume a TLS session without requiring that session-specific state is stored at the TLS server.\n\nWhen using session tickets, the TLS server stores its session-specific state in a session ticket and sends the session ticket to the TLS client for storing. The client resumes a TLS session by sending the session ticket to the server, and the server resumes the TLS session according to the session-specific state in the ticket. The session ticket is encrypted and authenticated by the server, and the server verifies its validity before using its contents.\n\nOne particular weakness of this method with [[OpenSSL]] is that it always limits encryption and authentication security of the transmitted TLS session ticket to <code>AES128-CBC-SHA256</code>, no matter what other TLS parameters were negotiated for the actual TLS session.<ref name=\"ticketsecwp\">{{cite web|title=TLS \"Secrets\": Whitepaper presenting the security implications of the deployment of session tickets (RFC 5077) as implemented in OpenSSL|first=Florent|last=Daigni\u00e8re|publisher=Matta Consulting Limited|accessdate=7 August 2013|url=https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Daigniere-TLS-Secrets-WP.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806233112/https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Daigniere-TLS-Secrets-WP.pdf|archivedate=6 August 2013|df=}}</ref> This means that the state information (the TLS session ticket) is not as well protected as the TLS session itself.

Signalling explicitly the normal closure of a secure session before effectively closing its transport layer is useful to prevent or detect attacks (like attempts to truncate the securely transported data, if it intrinsically does not have a predetermined length or duration that the recipient of the secured data may expect).\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:85%\"\n|+Alert level types\n|-\n!

This means that the TLS handshake is usually (except in the [[STARTTLS]] case) performed before the application protocol can start. In the [[virtual hosting#Name-based|name-based virtual server]] feature being provided by the application layer, all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the ClientHello message. This is a big problem in hosting environments because it means either sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different IP address for each of them.\n\nThere are two known workarounds provided by [[X.509]]:\n* If all virtual servers belong to the same domain, a [[wildcard certificate]] can be used.<ref>{{citation |url=https://ssl.comodo.com/wildcard-ssl-certificates.php |title=Wildcard SSL Certificate overview |accessdate=2015-07-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623231035/https://ssl.comodo.com/wildcard-ssl-certificates.php |archivedate=2015-06-23}}</ref> Besides the loose host name selection that might be a problem or not, there is no common agreement about how to match wildcard certificates. Different rules are applied depending on the application protocol or software used.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.switch.ch/pki/meetings/2007-01/namebased_ssl_virtualhosts.pdf |title=Named-based SSL virtual hosts: how to tackle the problem |accessdate=2012-05-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803022659/https://www.switch.ch/pki/meetings/2007-01/namebased_ssl_virtualhosts.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n* Add every virtual host name in the subjectAltName extension. The major problem being that the certificate needs to be reissued whenever a new virtual server is added.\n\nTo provide the server name, {{IETF RFC|4366}} Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions allow clients to include a [[Server Name Indication]] extension (SNI) in the extended ClientHello message. This extension hints to the server immediately which name the client wishes to connect to, so the server\ncan select the appropriate certificate to send to the clients.\n\n{{IETF RFC|2817}} also documents a method to implement name-based virtual hosting by upgrading HTTP to TLS via an [[HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header]]. Normally this is to securely implement HTTP over TLS within the main \"http\" [[URI scheme]] (which avoids forking the URI space and reduces the number of used ports), however, few implementations currently support this.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Standards==\n\n===Primary standards===\n'''The current approved version of TLS is version 1.3, which is specified in:'''\n* {{IETF RFC|8446}}: \"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3\".\n\n'''The current standard replaces these former versions, which are now considered obsolete:'''\n* {{IETF RFC|2246}}: \"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0\".\n* {{IETF RFC|4346}}: \"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1\".\n* {{IETF RFC|5246}}: \"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2\".\n\n'''As well as the never standardized SSL 2.0 and 3.0, which are considered obsolete:'''\n* [//tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hickman-netscape-ssl-00 Internet Draft (1995)], SSL Version 2.0\n* {{IETF RFC|6101}}: \"The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol Version 3.0\".\n\n===Extensions===\nOther [[Request for comments|RFCs]] subsequently extended TLS.\n\n'''Extensions to TLS 1.0 include:'''\n* {{IETF RFC|2595}}: \"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP\".

[[Website]]s can use TLS to secure all communications between their [[server (computing)|servers]] and [[web browser]]s.\n\nThe TLS protocol aims primarily to provide [[privacy]] and [[data integrity]] between two or more communicating computer applications.<ref name=RFC5246/>{{rp|3}} When secured by TLS, connections between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., wikipedia.org) should have one or more of the following properties:\n* The connection is ''private'' (or ''secure'') because [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric cryptography]] is used to [[Encryption|encrypt]] the data transmitted. The [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a [[shared secret]] that was negotiated at the start of the [[Session (computer science)|session]] (see [[#TLS handshake|\u00a7 TLS handshake]]). The server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first [[byte]] of data is transmitted (see [[#Algorithm|\u00a7 Algorithm]] below). The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdroppers]] and cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).\n* The identity of the communicating parties can be ''authenticated'' using [[public-key cryptography]].

Updated July 31, 2003.</ref> The protocols use a handshake with an [[asymmetric cipher]] to establish not only cipher settings but also a session-specific shared key with which further communication is encrypted using a [[symmetric cipher]]. During this handshake, the client and server agree on various parameters used to establish the connection's security:\n* The handshake begins when a client connects to a TLS-enabled server requesting a secure connection and the client presents a list of supported [[cipher suite]]s ([[encryption|ciphers]] and [[cryptographic hash function|hash functions]]).\n* From this list, the server picks a cipher and hash function that it also supports and notifies the client of the decision.\n* The server usually then provides identification in the form of a [[Public key certificate|digital certificate]]. The certificate contains the [[Hostname|server name]], the trusted [[certificate authority]] (CA) that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate, and the server's public encryption key.\n* The client confirms the validity of the certificate before proceeding.\n* To generate the session keys used for the secure connection, the client either:\n** encrypts a [[Random number generation|random number]] with the server's public key and sends the result to the server (which only the server should be able to decrypt with its private key); both parties then use the random number to generate a unique session key for subsequent encryption and decryption of data during the session\n** uses [[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange]] to securely generate a random and unique session key for encryption and decryption that has the additional property of forward secrecy: if the server's private key is disclosed in future, it cannot be used to decrypt the current session, even if the session is intercepted and recorded by a third party.\nThis concludes the handshake and begins the secured connection, which is encrypted and decrypted with the session key until the connection closes. If any one of the above steps fails, then the TLS handshake fails and the connection is not created.\n\nTLS and SSL do not fit neatly into any single layer of the [[OSI model]] or the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP model]].<ref name=\"ccnp\">{{cite book\n |last1       = Hooper\n |first1      = Howard\n |title       = CCNP Security VPN 642-648 Official Cert Guide\n |date        = 2012\n |publisher   = Cisco Press\n |isbn        = 9780132966382\n |page        = 22\n |edition     = 2\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=5PJisOKJ0k8C&pg=PA22\n }}</ref><ref name=\"stackex_layer\">{{cite web|url=https://security.stackexchange.com/a/93338|title=What layer is TLS?|website=Information Security Stack Exchange|first1=Andrew|last1=Spott|first2=Tom |last2=Leek|display-authors=etal}}</ref> TLS runs \"on top of some reliable transport protocol (e.g., TCP),\"<ref name=\"rfc_intro\">{{cite IETF |rfc=5246|title=The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2|section=1|sectionname=Introduction|date=August 2008|author=T.

The program was described in September 1987 at the 10th National Computer Security Conference in an extensive set of published papers.  The innovative research program focused on designing the next generation of secure computer communications network and product specifications to be implemented for applications on public and private internets. It was intended to complement the rapidly emerging new OSI internet standards moving forward both in the U.S. government's GOSIP Profiles and in the huge ITU-ISO JTC1 internet effort internationally.

This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made by the private key that corresponds to the certified public key.\n\n===Certificate authorities===\n{{Main|Certificate authority}}\nTLS typically relies on a set of trusted third-party certificate authorities to establish the authenticity of certificates. Trust is usually anchored in a list of certificates distributed with user agent software,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/sec-t02_final.pdf|title=Alternatives to Certification Authorities for a Secure Web|last=Rea|first=Scott|date=2013|website=|publisher=RSA Conference Asia Pacific|access-date=7 September 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007222635/https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/sec-t02_final.pdf|archivedate=7 October 2016|df=}}</ref> and can be modified by the relying party.\n\nAccording to [[Netcraft]], who monitors active TLS certificates, the market-leading certificate authority (CA) has been [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]] since the beginning of their survey (or [[Verisign|VeriSign]] before the authentication services business unit was purchased by Symantec). Symantec currently accounts for just under a third of all certificates and 44% of the valid certificates used by the 1 million busiest websites, as counted by Netcraft.<ref>[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2015/05/13/counting-ssl-certificates.html Counting SSL certificates; netcraft; May 13, 2015.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516035536/http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2015/05/13/counting-ssl-certificates.html |date=May 16, 2015}}</ref>{{Update inline|reason=Symantec has since sold their CA business to DigiCert|date=August 2019}}\n\nAs a consequence of choosing [[X.509]] certificates, certificate authorities and a [[public key infrastructure]] are necessary to verify the relation between a certificate and its owner, as well as to generate, sign, and administer the validity of certificates. While this can be more convenient than verifying the identities via a [[web of trust]], the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] made it more widely known that certificate authorities are a weak point from a security standpoint, allowing [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s (MITM) if the certificate authority cooperates (or is compromised).<ref>[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/packet-forensics/ Law Enforcement Appliance Subverts SSL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315064727/http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/packet-forensics |date=2014-03-15}}, Wired, 2010-04-03.</ref><ref>[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/researchers-reveal-likelihood-governments-fake-ssl New Research Suggests That Governments May Fake SSL Certificates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104234608/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/researchers-reveal-likelihood-governments-fake-ssl |date=2016-01-04}}, EFF, 2010-03-24.</ref>\n\n==Algorithm==\n{{see also|Cipher suite}}\n\n===Key exchange or key agreement===\nBefore a client and server can begin to exchange information protected by TLS, they must securely exchange or agree upon an encryption key and a cipher to use when encrypting data (see [[#Cipher|\u00a7 Cipher]]). Among the methods used for key exchange/agreement are: public and private keys generated with [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] (denoted TLS_RSA in the TLS handshake protocol), [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (TLS_DH), ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman (TLS_DHE), [[elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (TLS_ECDH), ephemeral elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman (TLS_ECDHE), [[Key-agreement protocol#Exponential key exchange|anonymous Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (TLS_DH_anon),<ref name=\"RFC5246\"/> [[TLS-PSK|pre-shared key]] (TLS_PSK)<ref name=RFC4279>{{cite web|title=Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)|rfc=4279 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4279|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=9 September 2013|author=P.

Only TLS_DHE and TLS_ECDHE provide [[#Forward secrecy|forward secrecy]].\n\nPublic key certificates used during exchange/agreement also vary in the size of the public/private encryption keys used during the exchange and hence the robustness of the security provided. In July 2013, [[Google]] announced that it would no longer use 1024-bit public keys and would switch instead to 2048-bit keys to increase the security of the TLS encryption it provides to its users because the encryption strength is directly related to the [[key size]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last=Gothard|first=Peter|title=Google updates SSL certificates to 2048-bit encryption|url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2285984/google-updates-ssl-certificates-to-2048bit-encryption |work=Computing|publisher=Incisive Media|accessdate=9 September 2013|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922082322/http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2285984/google-updates-ssl-certificates-to-2048bit-encryption|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/From-1024-to-2048-bit-The-security-effect-of-encryption-key-length|title=The value of 2,048-bit encryption: Why encryption key length matters |work=SearchSecurity|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081141/http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/From-1024-to-2048-bit-The-security-effect-of-encryption-key-length|archivedate=2018-01-16|df=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|keyexchange-table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Key exchange/agreement and authentication\n!

However, it has also been implemented with datagram-oriented transport protocols, such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) and the [[Datagram Congestion Control Protocol]] (DCCP), usage of which has been standardized independently using the term [[Datagram Transport Layer Security]] (DTLS).\n\n===Websites===\nA primary use of TLS is to secure [[World Wide Web]] traffic between a [[website]] and a [[web browser]] encoded with the HTTP protocol. This use of TLS to secure HTTP traffic constitutes the [[https|HTTPS]] protocol.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/https.html |title=Http vs https |accessdate=2015-02-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212105201/https://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/https.html |archivedate=2015-02-12}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Website protocol support\n|-\n!Protocol<br />version\n!Website<br />support<ref name=\"trustworthy_ssl_pulse\">As of August 3, 2019. {{cite web |url=https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse/ |title=SSL Pulse: Survey of the SSL Implementation of the Most Popular Websites |website=[[Qualys]] |accessdate=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n!Security<ref name=\"trustworthy_ssl_pulse\"/><ref name=\"community.qualys\">{{cite web|url=https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/03/19/rc4-in-tls-is-broken-now-what|accessdate=2013-07-30|publisher=Qualsys Security Labs|author=ivanr|title=RC4 in TLS is Broken: Now What?|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827044512/https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/03/19/rc4-in-tls-is-broken-now-what|archivedate=2013-08-27}}</ref>\n|-\n!SSL 2.0\n|1.6%\n|{{Bad|Insecure}}\n|-\n!SSL 3.0\n|6.7%\n|{{Bad|Insecure<ref name=\"poodle_pdf\" />}}\n|-\n!TLS 1.0\n|65.0%\n|{{Depends|Depends on cipher<ref group=\"n\" name=\"ciphers\">see [[#Cipher|\u00a7 Cipher]] table above</ref> and client mitigations<ref group=\"n\" name=\"mitigations\">see [[#Web browsers|\u00a7 Web browsers]] and [[#Attacks against TLS/SSL|\u00a7 Attacks against TLS/SSL]] sections</ref>}}\n|-\n!TLS 1.1\n|75.1%\n|{{Depends|Depends on cipher<ref group=\"n\" name=\"ciphers\"/> and client mitigations<ref group=\"n\" name=\"mitigations\"/>}}\n|-\n!TLS 1.2\n|96.0%\n|{{Depends|Depends on cipher<ref group=\"n\" name=\"ciphers\"/> and client mitigations<ref group=\"n\" name=\"mitigations\"/>}}\n|-\n!TLS 1.3\n|18.4%\n|{{Good|Secure}}\n|}\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=\"n\"}}\n\n===Web browsers===\n{{Further|Comparison of web browsers}}\n{{As of|2016|04}}, the latest versions of all major web browsers support TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, and have them enabled by default. However, not all supported [[List of Microsoft operating systems|Microsoft operating systems]] support the latest version of IE. Additionally, many operating systems currently support multiple versions of IE, but this has changed according to Microsoft's [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/microsoft-internet-explorer Internet Explorer Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ], \"beginning January 12, 2016, only the most current version of Internet Explorer available for a supported operating system will receive technical support and security updates.\" The page then goes on to list the latest supported version of IE at that date for each operating system. The next critical date would be when an operating system reaches the end of life stage, which is in Microsoft's [https://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle Windows lifecycle fact sheet].\n\nMitigations against known attacks are not enough yet:\n* Mitigations against [[#POODLE attack|POODLE attack]]: some browsers already prevent fallback to SSL 3.0; however, this mitigation needs to be supported by not only clients but also servers. Disabling SSL 3.0 itself, implementation of \"anti-POODLE record splitting\", or denying CBC ciphers in SSL 3.0 is required.\n** Google Chrome: complete (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since version 33, fallback to SSL 3.0 is disabled since version 39, SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default since version 40. Support of SSL 3.0 itself was dropped since version 44.)\n** Mozilla Firefox: complete (support of SSL 3.0 itself is dropped since [[History of Firefox#Version 38\u201344|version 39]]. SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default and fallback to SSL 3.0 are disabled since [[History of Firefox#Version 31\u201337|version 34]], TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since version 35. In ESR, SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default and TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since ESR 31.3.)\n** Internet Explorer: partial (only in version 11, SSL 3.0 is disabled by default since April 2015. Version 10 and older are still vulnerable against POODLE.)\n** [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]: complete (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since version 20, \"anti-POODLE record splitting\", which is effective only with client-side implementation, is implemented since version 25, SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default since version 27. Support of SSL 3.0 itself will be dropped since version 31.)\n** Safari: complete (only on OS X 10.8 and later and iOS 8, CBC ciphers during fallback to SSL 3.0 is denied, but this means it will use RC4, which is not recommended as well. Support of SSL 3.0 itself is dropped on OS X 10.11 and later and iOS 9.)\n* Mitigation against [[#RC4 attacks|RC4 attacks]]:\n** Google Chrome disabled RC4 except as a fallback since version 43. RC4 is disabled since Chrome 48.\n** Firefox disabled RC4 except as a fallback since version 36. Firefox 44 disabled RC4 by default.\n** Opera disabled RC4 except as a fallback since version 30. RC4 is disabled since Opera 35.\n** Internet Explorer for [[Windows 7]] / Server 2008 R2 and for [[Windows 8]] / Server 2012 have set the priority of RC4 to lowest and can also disable RC4 except as a fallback through registry settings. Internet Explorer 11 Mobile 11 for [[Windows Phone 8.1]] disable RC4 except as a fallback if no other enabled algorithm works. Edge and IE 11 disable RC4 completely in August 2016.\n* Mitigation against [[Transport Layer Security#FREAK|FREAK attack]]:\n** The Android Browser included with [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|Android 4]] and older is still vulnerable to the FREAK attack.\n** Internet Explorer 11 Mobile is still vulnerable to the FREAK attack.\n** Google Chrome, Internet Explorer (desktop), Safari (desktop & mobile), and Opera (mobile) have FREAK mitigations in place.\n** Mozilla Firefox on all platforms and Google Chrome on Windows were not affected by FREAK.\n\n{{clear}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" id=\"browsersTLS\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: smaller; margin-top: 0px;\"\n|+'''TLS/SSL support history of web browsers'''\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Browser\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Platforms\n! colspan=\"2\" | SSL protocols\n! colspan=\"4\" | TLS protocols\n! colspan=\"3\" | Certificate support\n! colspan=\"6\" | Vulnerabilities fixed{{refn | group=\"n\" | name=\"note-sec\" |Does the browser have mitigations or is not vulnerable for the known attacks.

According to the authors\n<blockquote>\"the root cause of most of these vulnerabilities is the terrible design of the APIs to the underlying SSL libraries. Instead of expressing high-level security properties of network tunnels such as confidentiality and authentication, these APIs expose low-level details of the SSL protocol to application developers. As a consequence, developers often use SSL APIs incorrectly, misinterpreting and misunderstanding their manifold parameters, options, side effects, and return values.\"</blockquote>\n\n===Other uses===\nThe [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) can also be protected by TLS. These applications use [[public key certificate]]s to verify the identity of endpoints.\n\nTLS can also be used for tunnelling an entire network stack to create a [[virtual private network|VPN]], which is the case with [[OpenVPN]] and [[OpenConnect]]. Many vendors have by now married TLS's encryption and authentication capabilities with authorization. There has also been substantial development since the late 1990s in creating client technology outside of Web-browsers, in order to enable support for client/server applications. Compared to traditional [[IPsec]] VPN technologies, TLS has some inherent advantages in firewall and [[network address translation|NAT]] traversal that make it easier to administer for large remote-access populations.\n\nTLS is also a standard method for protecting [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) application signaling. TLS can be used for providing authentication and encryption of the SIP signalling associated with [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] and other SIP-based applications.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Security==\n\n===SSL 2.0===\nSSL 2.0 was flawed in a variety of ways:<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the Security of Today's Online Electronic Banking Systems|author1=Joris Claessens |author2=Valentin Dem |author3=Danny De Cock |author4=Bart Preneel |author5=Joos Vandewalle |journal=Computers & Security|volume=21|issue=3|year=2002|pages=253\u2013265|doi=10.1016/S0167-4048(02)00312-7}}</ref>\n* Identical cryptographic keys were used for [[message authentication]] and encryption. <!-- please explain how this affects security --> (In SSL 3.0, MAC secrets may be larger than encryption keys, so messages can remain tamper-resistant even if encryption keys are broken.<ref name=\"RFC6101\"/>)\n* SSL 2.0 had a weak MAC construction that used the MD5 hash function with a secret prefix, making it vulnerable to [[length extension attack]]s.\n* SSL 2.0 did not have any protection for the handshake, meaning a man-in-the-middle [[downgrade attack]] could go undetected.\n* SSL 2.0 used the TCP connection close to indicate the end of data. This meant that truncation attacks were possible: the attacker simply forges a TCP FIN, leaving the recipient unaware of an illegitimate end of data message (SSL 3.0 fixed this problem by having an explicit closure alert).\n* SSL 2.0 assumed a single service and a fixed domain certificate, which clashed with the standard feature of virtual hosting in Web servers. This means that most websites were practically impaired from using SSL.\n\nSSL 2.0 was disabled by default, beginning with [[Internet Explorer 7]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/22/483795.aspx|title=IEBlog: Upcoming HTTPS Improvements in Internet Explorer 7 Beta 2|accessdate=2007-11-25|last=Lawrence|first=Eric|date=2005-10-22|publisher=[[Microsoft Developer Network|MSDN]] Blogs|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FwL2ooJz?url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2005/10/22/483795.aspx|archivedate=2013-04-17|df=}}</ref> [[Mozilla Firefox]] 2,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236933|title=Bugzilla@Mozilla&nbsp;\u2014 Bug 236933 \u2013 Disable SSL2 and other weak ciphers|accessdate=2007-11-25|publisher=[[Mozilla Corporation]]}}</ref> [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 9.5,<ref>[http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/950/ \"Opera 9.5 for Windows Changelog\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626142453/http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/950/ |date=2009-06-26}} at [[Opera.com]]: \"Disabled SSL v2 and weak ciphers.\"</ref> and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].

The SSL 3.0 cipher suites have a weaker key derivation process; half of the master key that is established is fully dependent on the MD5 hash function, which is not resistant to collisions and is, therefore, not considered secure. Under TLS 1.0, the master key that is established depends on both MD5 and SHA-1 so its derivation process is not currently considered weak. It is for this reason that SSL 3.0 implementations cannot be validated under FIPS 140-2.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Institute of Standards and Technology |title=Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-2 and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program |date=December 2010 |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/fips140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106130105/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/fips140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf |archivedate=November 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2014, the vulnerability in the design of SSL 3.0 was reported, which makes CBC mode of operation with SSL 3.0 vulnerable to the padding attack (see [[#POODLE attack]]).\n\n===TLS===\nTLS has a variety of security measures:\n* Protection against a downgrade of the protocol to a previous (less secure) version or a weaker cipher suite.\n* Numbering subsequent Application records with a sequence number and using this sequence number in the [[message authentication code]]s (MACs).\n* Using a message digest enhanced with a key (so only a key-holder can check the MAC). The [[HMAC]] construction used by most TLS cipher suites is specified in {{IETF RFC|2104}} (SSL 3.0 used a different hash-based MAC).\n* The message that ends the handshake (\"Finished\") sends a hash of all the exchanged handshake messages seen by both parties.\n* The [[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] function splits the input data in half and processes each one with a different hashing algorithm ([[MD5]] and [[SHA-1]]), then [[exclusive or|XORs]] them together to create the MAC. This provides protection even if one of these algorithms is found to be vulnerable.\n\n===Attacks against TLS/SSL===\nSignificant attacks against TLS/SSL are listed below.\n\nIn February 2015, IETF issued an informational RFC<ref>{{cite web|rfc=7457 |title=Summarizing Known Attacks on Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS)|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201813/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}</ref> summarizing the various known attacks against TLS/SSL.\n\n====Renegotiation attack====\nA vulnerability of the renegotiation procedure was discovered in August 2009 that can lead to plaintext injection attacks against SSL 3.0 and all current versions of TLS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555|title=CVE \u2013 CVE-2009-3555|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104234608/http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555|archivedate=2016-01-04|df=}}</ref> For example, it allows an attacker who can hijack an https connection to splice their own requests into the beginning of the conversation the client has with the web server. The attacker can't actually decrypt the client\u2013server communication, so it is different from a typical man-in-the-middle attack. A short-term fix is for web servers to stop allowing renegotiation, which typically will not require other changes unless [[client certificate]] authentication is used. To fix the vulnerability, a renegotiation indication extension was proposed for TLS. It will require the client and server to include and verify information about previous handshakes in any renegotiation handshakes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Rescorla|title=Understanding the TLS Renegotiation Attack|work=Educated Guesswork|accessdate=2009-11-27|date=2009-11-05|url=http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2009/11/understanding_the_tls_renegoti.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65JSTKRCA?url=http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2009/11/understanding_the_tls_renegoti.html|archivedate=2012-02-09|df=}}</ref> This extension has become a proposed standard and has been assigned the number {{IETF RFC|5746}}.

This is done by way of a \"[[transparent proxy]]\": the interception software terminates the incoming TLS connection, inspects the HTTP plaintext, and then creates a new TLS connection to the destination.<ref name=\"Durumeric et al 2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Durumeric |first1=Zakir |last2=Ma |first2=Zane |last3=Springall |first3=Drew |last4=Barnes |first4=Richard |last5=Sullivan |first5=Nick |last6=Bursztein |first6=Elie |last7=Bailey |first7=Michael |last8=Halderman |first8=J.

Because it provides a point where network traffic is available unencrypted, attackers have an incentive to attack this point in particular in order to gain access to otherwise secure content. The interception also allows the network operator, or persons who gain access to its interception system, to perform [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s against network users. A 2017 study found that \"HTTPS interception has become startlingly widespread, and that interception products as a class have a dramatically negative impact on connection security\".<ref name=\"Durumeric et al 2017\" />\n\n==Protocol details==\nThe TLS protocol exchanges ''records'', which encapsulate the data to be exchanged in a specific format (see below). Each record can be compressed, padded, appended with a [[message authentication code]] (MAC), or encrypted, all depending on the state of the connection. Each record has a ''content type'' field that designates the type of data encapsulated, a length field and a TLS version field. The data encapsulated may be control or procedural messages of the TLS itself, or simply the application data needed to be transferred by TLS. The specifications (cipher suite, keys etc.) required to exchange application data by TLS, are agreed upon in the \"TLS handshake\" between the client requesting the data and the server responding to requests. The protocol therefore defines both the structure of payloads transferred in TLS and the procedure to establish and monitor the transfer.\n\n===TLS handshake===\nWhen the connection starts, the record encapsulates a \"control\" protocol \u2013 the handshake messaging protocol (''content type'' 22). This protocol is used to exchange all the information required by both sides for the exchange of the actual application data by TLS. It defines the format of messages and the order of their exchange. These may vary according to the demands of the client and server \u2013 i.e., there are several possible procedures to set up the connection. This initial exchange results in a successful TLS connection (both parties ready to transfer application data with TLS) or an alert message (as specified below).\n\n====Basic TLS handshake====\nA typical connection example follows, illustrating a [[Handshaking|handshake]] where the server (but not the client) is authenticated by its certificate:\n\n# Negotiation phase:\n#* A client sends a '''ClientHello''' message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested [[cipher suite]]s and suggested compression methods. If the client is attempting to perform a resumed handshake, it may send a ''session ID''. If the client can use [[Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation]], it may include a list of supported application [[Communications protocol|protocols]], such as [[HTTP/2]].\n#* The server responds with a '''ServerHello''' message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite and compression method from the choices offered by the client. To confirm or allow resumed handshakes the server may send a ''session ID''. The chosen protocol version should be the highest that both the client and server support. For example, if the client supports TLS version 1.1 and the server supports version 1.2, version 1.1 should be selected; version 1.2 should not be selected.\n#* The server sends its '''Certificate''' message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server).<ref name=\"openpgp\">These certificates are currently [[X.509]], but {{IETF RFC|6091}} also specifies the use of [[OpenPGP]]-based certificates.</ref>\n#* The server sends its '''ServerKeyExchange''' message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server). This message is sent for all DHE and DH_anon cipher suites.<ref name=\"RFC5246\"/>\n#* The server sends a '''ServerHelloDone''' message, indicating it is done with handshake negotiation.\n#* The client responds with a '''ClientKeyExchange''' message, which may contain a ''PreMasterSecret'', public key, or nothing. (Again, this depends on the selected cipher.) This ''PreMasterSecret'' is encrypted using the public key of the server certificate.\n#* The client and server then use the random numbers and ''PreMasterSecret'' to compute a common secret, called the \"master secret\". All other key data for this connection is derived from this master secret (and the client- and server-generated random values), which is passed through a carefully designed [[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] function.\n# The client now sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''' record, essentially telling the server, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted if encryption parameters were present in the server certificate).\" The ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol with content type of 20.\n#* The client sends an authenticated and encrypted '''Finished''' message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.\n#* The server will attempt to decrypt the client's ''Finished'' message and verify the hash and MAC. If the decryption or verification fails, the handshake is considered to have failed and the connection should be torn down.\n# Finally, the server sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''', telling the client, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted, if encryption was negotiated).\"\n#* The server sends its authenticated and encrypted '''Finished''' message.\n#* The client performs the same decryption and verification procedure as the server did in the previous step.\n# Application phase: at this point, the \"handshake\" is complete and the application protocol is enabled, with content type of 23. Application messages exchanged between client and server will also be authenticated and optionally encrypted exactly like in their ''Finished'' message. Otherwise, the content type will return 25 and the client will not authenticate.\n\n====Client-authenticated TLS handshake====\nThe following ''full'' example shows a client being authenticated (in addition to the server as in the example above) via TLS using certificates exchanged between both peers.\n\n# Negotiation Phase:\n#* A client sends a '''ClientHello''' message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested cipher suites and compression methods.\n#* The server responds with a '''ServerHello''' message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite and compression method from the choices offered by the client. The server may also send a ''session id'' as part of the message to perform a resumed handshake.\n#* The server sends its '''Certificate''' message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server).<ref name=\"openpgp\"/>\n#* The server sends its '''ServerKeyExchange''' message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server). This message is sent for all DHE and DH_anon ciphersuites.<ref name=\"RFC5246\"/>\n#* The server sends a '''CertificateRequest''' message, to request a certificate from the client so that the connection can be [[mutually authenticated]].\n#* The server sends a '''ServerHelloDone''' message, indicating it is done with handshake negotiation.\n#* The client responds with a '''Certificate''' message, which contains the client's certificate.\n#* The client sends a '''ClientKeyExchange''' message, which may contain a ''PreMasterSecret'', public key, or nothing. (Again, this depends on the selected cipher.) This ''PreMasterSecret'' is encrypted using the public key of the server certificate.\n#* The client sends a '''CertificateVerify''' message, which is a signature over the previous handshake messages using the client's certificate's private key. This signature can be verified by using the client's certificate's public key. This lets the server know that the client has access to the private key of the certificate and thus owns the certificate.\n#* The client and server then use the random numbers and ''PreMasterSecret'' to compute a common secret, called the \"master secret\". All other key data for this connection is derived from this master secret (and the client- and server-generated random values), which is passed through a carefully designed pseudorandom function.\n# The client now sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''' record, essentially telling the server, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted if encryption was negotiated). \" The ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol and has type 20 and not 22.\n#* Finally, the client sends an encrypted '''Finished''' message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.\n#* The server will attempt to decrypt the client's ''Finished'' message and verify the hash and MAC. If the decryption or verification fails, the handshake is considered to have failed and the connection should be torn down.\n# Finally, the server sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''', telling the client, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted if encryption was negotiated). \"\n#* The server sends its own encrypted '''Finished''' message.\n#* The client performs the same decryption and verification procedure as the server did in the previous step.\n# Application phase: at this point, the \"handshake\" is complete and the application protocol is enabled, with content type of 23. Application messages exchanged between client and server will also be encrypted exactly like in their ''Finished'' message.\n\n====Resumed TLS handshake====\nPublic key operations (e.g., RSA) are relatively expensive in terms of computational power. TLS provides a secure shortcut in the handshake mechanism to avoid these operations: resumed sessions. Resumed sessions are implemented using session IDs or session tickets.\n\nApart from the performance benefit, resumed sessions can also be used for [[single sign-on]], as it guarantees that both the original session and any resumed session originate from the same client. This is of particular importance for the [[FTPS|FTP over TLS/SSL]] protocol, which would otherwise suffer from a man-in-the-middle attack in which an attacker could intercept the contents of the secondary data connections.<ref>{{cite web |author=Chris |url=http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/02/vsftpd-210-released.html |title=vsftpd-2.1.0 released \u2013 Using TLS session resume for FTPS data connection authentication |publisher=Scarybeastsecurity. blogspot.com |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2012-05-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707213409/http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/02/vsftpd-210-released.html |archivedate=2012-07-07}}</ref>\n\n====TLS 1.3 handshake====\n\nThe TLS 1.3 handshake was condensed to only one round trip compared to the two round trips required in previous versions of TLS/SSL.\n\nFirst the client sends a clientHello message to the server that contains a list of supported ciphers in order of the client's preference and makes a guess on what key algorithm will be used so that it can send a secret key to share if needed. By making a guess at what key algorithm will be used, the server eliminates a round trip. After receiving the clientHello, the server sends a serverHello with its key, a certificate, the chosen cipher suite and the finished message.\n\nAfter the client receives the server's finished message, it now is coordinated with the server on which cipher suite to use.[https://blog.cloudflare.com/tls-1-3-overview-and-q-and-a/]\n\n=====Session IDs=====\nIn an ordinary ''full'' handshake, the server sends a ''session id'' as part of the '''ServerHello''' message. The client associates this ''session id'' with the server's IP address and TCP port, so that when the client connects again to that server, it can use the ''session id'' to shortcut the handshake. In the server, the ''session id'' maps to the cryptographic parameters previously negotiated, specifically the \"master secret\". Both sides must have the same \"master secret\" or the resumed handshake will fail (this prevents an eavesdropper from using a ''session id''). The random data in the '''ClientHello''' and '''ServerHello''' messages virtually guarantee that the generated connection keys will be different from in the previous connection. In the RFCs, this type of handshake is called an ''abbreviated'' handshake. It is also described in the literature as a ''restart'' handshake.\n\n# Negotiation phase:\n#* A client sends a '''ClientHello''' message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested cipher suites and compression methods. Included in the message is the ''session id'' from the previous TLS connection.\n#* The server responds with a '''ServerHello''' message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite and compression method from the choices offered by the client. If the server recognizes the ''session id'' sent by the client, it responds with the same ''session id''. The client uses this to recognize that a resumed handshake is being performed. If the server does not recognize the ''session id'' sent by the client, it sends a different value for its ''session id''. This tells the client that a resumed handshake will not be performed. At this point, both the client and server have the \"master secret\" and random data to generate the key data to be used for this connection.\n# The server now sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''' record, essentially telling the client, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be encrypted.\" The ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol and has type 20 and not 22.\n#* Finally, the server sends an encrypted '''Finished''' message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.\n#* The client will attempt to decrypt the server's ''Finished'' message and verify the hash and MAC. If the decryption or verification fails, the handshake is considered to have failed and the connection should be torn down.\n# Finally, the client sends a '''ChangeCipherSpec''', telling the server, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be encrypted. \"\n#* The client sends its own encrypted '''Finished''' message.\n#* The server performs the same decryption and verification procedure as the client did in the previous step.\n# Application phase: at this point, the \"handshake\" is complete and the application protocol is enabled, with content type of 23. Application messages exchanged between client and server will also be encrypted exactly like in their ''Finished'' message.\n\n=====Session tickets=====\n{{IETF RFC|5077}} extends TLS via use of session tickets, instead of session IDs. It defines a way to resume a TLS session without requiring that session-specific state is stored at the TLS server.\n\nWhen using session tickets, the TLS server stores its session-specific state in a session ticket and sends the session ticket to the TLS client for storing. The client resumes a TLS session by sending the session ticket to the server, and the server resumes the TLS session according to the session-specific state in the ticket. The session ticket is encrypted and authenticated by the server, and the server verifies its validity before using its contents.\n\nOne particular weakness of this method with [[OpenSSL]] is that it always limits encryption and authentication security of the transmitted TLS session ticket to <code>AES128-CBC-SHA256</code>, no matter what other TLS parameters were negotiated for the actual TLS session.<ref name=\"ticketsecwp\">{{cite web|title=TLS \"Secrets\": Whitepaper presenting the security implications of the deployment of session tickets (RFC 5077) as implemented in OpenSSL|first=Florent|last=Daigni\u00e8re|publisher=Matta Consulting Limited|accessdate=7 August 2013|url=https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Daigniere-TLS-Secrets-WP.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806233112/https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Daigniere-TLS-Secrets-WP.pdf|archivedate=6 August 2013|df=}}</ref> This means that the state information (the TLS session ticket) is not as well protected as the TLS session itself.

This means that the TLS handshake is usually (except in the [[STARTTLS]] case) performed before the application protocol can start. In the [[virtual hosting#Name-based|name-based virtual server]] feature being provided by the application layer, all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the ClientHello message. This is a big problem in hosting environments because it means either sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different IP address for each of them.\n\nThere are two known workarounds provided by [[X.509]]:\n* If all virtual servers belong to the same domain, a [[wildcard certificate]] can be used.<ref>{{citation |url=https://ssl.comodo.com/wildcard-ssl-certificates.php |title=Wildcard SSL Certificate overview |accessdate=2015-07-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623231035/https://ssl.comodo.com/wildcard-ssl-certificates.php |archivedate=2015-06-23}}</ref> Besides the loose host name selection that might be a problem or not, there is no common agreement about how to match wildcard certificates. Different rules are applied depending on the application protocol or software used.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.switch.ch/pki/meetings/2007-01/namebased_ssl_virtualhosts.pdf |title=Named-based SSL virtual hosts: how to tackle the problem |accessdate=2012-05-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803022659/https://www.switch.ch/pki/meetings/2007-01/namebased_ssl_virtualhosts.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n* Add every virtual host name in the subjectAltName extension. The major problem being that the certificate needs to be reissued whenever a new virtual server is added.\n\nTo provide the server name, {{IETF RFC|4366}} Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions allow clients to include a [[Server Name Indication]] extension (SNI) in the extended ClientHello message. This extension hints to the server immediately which name the client wishes to connect to, so the server\ncan select the appropriate certificate to send to the clients.\n\n{{IETF RFC|2817}} also documents a method to implement name-based virtual hosting by upgrading HTTP to TLS via an [[HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header]]. Normally this is to securely implement HTTP over TLS within the main \"http\" [[URI scheme]] (which avoids forking the URI space and reduces the number of used ports), however, few implementations currently support this.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Standards==\n\n===Primary standards===\n'''The current approved version of TLS is version 1.3, which is specified in:'''\n* {{IETF RFC|8446}}: \"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3\".\n\n'''The current standard replaces these former versions, which are now considered obsolete:'''\n* {{IETF RFC|2246}}: \"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0\".\n* {{IETF RFC|4346}}: \"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1\".\n* {{IETF RFC|5246}}: \"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2\".\n\n'''As well as the never standardized SSL 2.0 and 3.0, which are considered obsolete:'''\n* [//tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hickman-netscape-ssl-00 Internet Draft (1995)], SSL Version 2.0\n* {{IETF RFC|6101}}: \"The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol Version 3.0\".\n\n===Extensions===\nOther [[Request for comments|RFCs]] subsequently extended TLS.\n\n'''Extensions to TLS 1.0 include:'''\n* {{IETF RFC|2595}}: \"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP\".

To progress through the game, players are tasked with moving between various  platforms and solving intricate puzzles. The game world unfolds to the player in the form of a [[Metroidvania]], with new movement abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas. Unlike its predecessor ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest|The Blind Forest]]'', ''Will of the Wisps'' relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \"soul links\", and the sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a \"shard\" system that allows players to upgrade Ori in various ways, like sticking to walls and those that are equipped can be changed on the fly.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |title= Ori and the Will of the Wisps is taking serious inspiration from Zelda with its new focus on fluid combat |last= Loveridge |first= Sam |date= February 27, 2020 |accessdate= March 3, 2020 |work= [[GamesRadar+]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303061750/https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |title= Soul Links in Ori and the Will of the Wisps \"didn't make sense\", says developer |last= Donovan |first= Imogen |date= March 9, 2020 |accessdate= March 15, 2020 |work= VideoGamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200314191058/https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |archive-date= March 14, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nA new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2018.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and, while also continuing their life together, raise her as a family. Ku soon becomes the age to start flying, but being born with a damaged wing, she is unable to until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm causes them to be separated. \n\nRegaining consciousness from the fall, Ori's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of Niwen's inhabitants, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter the Silent Woods. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]] to find them. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods. There they soon reunite with Ku, but shortly after encounters Shriek, a deformed owl ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind, turning her cold and vicious. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku.\n\nAfter mourning over Ku, Kwolok explains to Ori that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's prior passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori with finding one of the wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born from out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the cause of their non-functionality. Ori breaks the spirit's control over Kwolok, allowing him to kill it but leaving him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though they would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek reappears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her parents' husks. \n\nDespite being injured by Shriek, Ori limps their way over to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they watch as a Spirit Tree begins to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together, as the Spirit Tree reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience.

He described the game as \"A hallmark of excellence\", saying that \"There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage\". Carter particularly praised the game's visuals, combat improvements from the game's predecessor, as well as the \"dramatic chase sequences\". However, he mentioned some [[frame rate]] issues regarding the Xbox One version of the game.<ref name=\"Carter\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s Michael Goroff stated positive opinions regarding the game, while pointing out the performance issues which the [[Xbox One]] edition of the game suffered from before the day-one [[patch (computing)|patch]] was released. Goroff further mentioned that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines ''The Blind Forest''{{'}}s mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with 'emotional platformers', ''Will of the Wisps'' doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience\".<ref name=\"EGMreview\"/> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner praised the game's graphics, story and combat, subsequently calling the game better than its predecessor. Reiner said that \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with ''Will of the Wisps'', delivering an experience that doesn't have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s critic Steve Watts gave the game a positive review, commending the combat, exploring elements, story as well as the \"Gorgeous animation and environments\". Moreover, he highlighted occasional visual bugs as negative aspects of the game.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> \n\nAustin Wood, reviewer for ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', acclaimed the game and its \"breathtaking music\", world and its platforming. Wood stated that \"There are a few minor stumbles here and there, but make no mistake: I ''adore'' ''Ori and The Will of the Wisps''. It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp[s]'' is an irresistible challenge.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and, while also continuing their life together, raise her as a family. Ku soon becomes the age to start flying, but being born with a damaged wing, she is unable to until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm causes them to be separated. \n\nRegaining consciousness from the fall, Ori's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of Niwen's inhabitants, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter the Silent Woods. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]] to find them. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods. There they soon reunite with Ku, but shortly after encounters Shriek, a deformed owl ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind, turning her cold and vicious. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku.\n\nAfter mourning over Ku, Kwolok explains to Ori that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's prior passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori with finding one of the wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born from out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the cause of their non-functionality. Ori breaks the spirit's control over Kwolok, allowing him to kill it but leaving him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though they would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek reappears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her parents' husks. \n\nDespite being injured by Shriek, Ori limps their way over to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they watch as a Spirit Tree begins to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together, as the Spirit Tree reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience,\" explains Daniel Smith, senior producer at Xbox Games Studios, who has been attached to the Ori projects since before the first title launched.\n\n\"But our community told us that there wasn't a lot of draw to come back in once they'd completed the title.

Reiner said that \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game.

It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\".

The series was broadcast from January 23, 1975, to May 20, 1982, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It was created by [[Danny Arnold]] and [[Theodore J. Flicker]]. [[Noam Pitlik]] directed the majority of the episodes.\n\n==Premise==\n''Barney Miller'' takes place almost entirely within the confines of the detectives' squad room and Captain Barney Miller's adjoining office of New York City's fictional 12th Precinct, located in Greenwich Village.<ref name=\"sjs750607\">{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Garson |work=[[St. Joseph News-Press]] |title=The Law Takes Time Out to Be Human on ABC's Barney Miller |page=S2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GPFbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=41MNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2161,1289410&dq=fish+vigoda&hl=en |date=June 7, 1975 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref> A typical episode featured the detectives of the 12th bringing in several complainants and/or suspects to the squad room. Usually, two or three separate subplots are in a given episode, with different officers dealing with different crimes. Rarely, about once a year, an episode would feature one or more of the detectives outside of the walls of the precinct, either on a stakeout or at their homes.\n\nPrimary characters:\n\n* '''Captain Bernard \"Barney\" Miller''' ([[Hal Linden]])  is the sensible captain of the precinct who uses his odd and dry sense of humor to retain his sanity while dealing with the foibles of his staff, an unending stream of budget problems, and paperwork that make up his job.  Several times during the series' run, he gets passed over for a promotion to deputy inspector before reaching that rank in the series finale.\n* '''Sgt. [[Phil Fish (fictional character)|Philip K. Fish]]''' ([[Abe Vigoda]]) is the senior detective on the squad. Crotchety, world-weary, and near retirement, he always seems to be suffering through some physical ailment, but his years of experience as a police officer make him a very good detective and mentor to other members of his squad. Frequently, he is on the phone dealing with a minor marital crisis with his wife Bernice. The character was eventually spun off into its own series.\n* '''Det. 3rd Grade (later Sgt.) Stanley Thaddeus \"Wojo\" Wojciehowicz''' ([[Max Gail]]){{Anchor|Stan Wojciehowicz}} is the naive, gung-ho but goodhearted [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Polish-American]], who gradually transforms from a macho former Marine into a decidedly humanitarian character (the squad's conscience, in many ways), while performing his duties as a detective. He takes and fails the sergeant's examination four times, but finally passes on his fifth try and gets promoted in season four. He is a very dedicated,  by-the-book police officer who at times tends to take his duties a little too seriously.  In the final season, his name is spelled \"Wojehowicz\" on the duty roster.\n* '''Det. 1st Grade (later Sgt.) Ron Nathan Harris''' ([[Ron Glass]]) is an ambitious, intellectual [[African American]] criminologist who has a taste for the finer things in life and thus lives well beyond his means, and who frequently seems more preoccupied with his attire and his career as a writer than with his police work. A long-running plotline about his various attempts to establish a writing career eventually has Harris emerge as a published author; his lurid memoir ''Blood on the Badge'' (originally titled ''Precinct Diary'') becomes a best seller and thus prompts him to become more serious about his work. Harris was educated by Jesuits and served in the Coast Guard (in the legal department) prior to becoming a police officer. He is a self-professed Republican, but also a former war protester and an ardent supporter of the police officers' union strike action.\n* '''Sgt. Nick Yemana''' ([[Jack Soo]]) is a surrealistically philosophical, wisecracking [[Japanese American]] detective. Though he is closely connected to his Japanese heritage, he is a native of Omaha, Nebraska. Yemana is noted for his \"off the wall\" sense of humor and wry observations about life, as well as for his gambling habits, extraordinarily poor paperwork filing skills, and for making the squad's coffee (which is disliked by everyone who drinks it). After the retirement of Fish, Yemana becomes the ranking detective. In the two-part episode \"Eviction,\" he becomes commanding officer, though he is replaced after a mere few hours. (Harris compares his tenure to that of President [[William Henry Harrison]], who served for one month.)\n* '''Sgt. Miguel \"Chano\" Amanguale''' ([[Gregory Sierra]]) is a dauntless, beleaguered [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] detective, who is very emotionally attached to his job; as such, he has a habit of getting worked up when things go awry and, when this happens, he tends to explode in rapid Spanish should it happen. His lowest moment comes in \"The Hero,\" when he kills two suspects who are robbing a bank.\n* '''Sgt. Arthur P. Dietrich''' ([[Steve Landesberg]]) is a detective with a calm, unflappable nature and a seemingly endless supply of knowledge on a wide array of subjects (he has, as Barney once observed, a \"flair for the esoteric\"), yet he enjoys elements of entertainment that can be seen as ironically simple, such as early morning cartoons and the Three Stooges (his personal favorite). He can usually find a topic to discuss with those he encounters in the squad room, whatever their interest or occupation, though his contribution usually comes out of him in an overly intellectual manner. In \"The Photographer,\" Barney goes so far as to suggest to Dietrich that he has a \"pedantic\" way of expressing himself. Despite his perspicacity, he seems to possess a deep-rooted sense of self-doubt, giving up on more than a few career paths (law and medical school, to name a few) when he finds he isn't a perfect representation of the position in his own eyes; that's why he \"became a cop.\"\n* '''Inspector Frank D. Luger''' ([[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]]) is Miller's rambling, out-of-touch, and unapologetically old-school superior who frequently drops by the precinct to \"chat with\" Barney \"in his office\". He refers to Harris as \"Har'\", Dietrich as \"Di-Di.\" and Levitt as \"Levine.\" As time goes by, Luger becomes more and more melancholy and his outdated approach to police work more and more problematic. He has a habit of getting lost in his thoughts, particularly when he reminisces about his old partners Foster, Kleiner and \"Brownie,\" which usually ends up with him getting worked up as he remembers how much he \"loved those guys.\"\n* '''Officer Carl Levitt''' ([[Ron Carey (actor)|Ron Carey]]) is a diminutive, obsequious (but competent and hard-working) uniformed officer who constantly, passive-aggressively badgers Miller about being promoted.  In the series finale, he is finally promoted to detective.\n[[File:Barney Miller 1975.JPG|thumb|170px|Barney and Liz Miller]]\n* '''Elizabeth \"Liz\" Miller''' ([[Barbara Barrie]]) is Barney's wife. A dedicated social worker, she was intended to be a regular character and, during seasons one and two, was listed in the opening credits.  Nevertheless, Liz is seen fairly infrequently.  She is, however, often referred to, and Barney is often seen (and heard) on the phone with her. Later on in the run of the show, she and Barney separate due to the ongoing tension between home life and his work at the 12th, but end up reconciling.\n\nThe show's focus was split between the detectives' interactions with each other and with the suspects and witnesses they detained, processed, and interviewed. Some typical conflicts and long-running plotlines included Miller's frustration with red tape and paperwork, his constant efforts to maintain peace, order, and discipline, and his numerous failed attempts to get a promotion; Harris' preoccupation with outside interests, such as his living arrangements but mainly his novel (''Blood on the Badge''), and his inability to remain focused on his police work; Fish's age-related health issues, marital problems, and reluctance to retire; Wojciehowicz's impulsive behavior and love life; Luger's nostalgia for the old days with partners Foster, Kleiner, and \"Brownie\" Brown; Levitt's quest to become a detective (which is eventually successful); the rivalry between the precinct's resident intellectuals, Harris and Dietrich; and continually\u2014but reliably\u2014bad coffee, usually made by Yemana.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Regulars===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n|-\n!Actor \n!Character\n!Seasons\n!Notes\n|-\n| [[Hal Linden]] \n| Captain Barney Miller\n| <center> 1\u20138 </center>\n|Main star and regular character throughout the series' run.

He was first shown to be a lieutenant from Manhattan South. Previously worked as a member of the [[vice squad]] for 17 years. His visits from headquarters involved trying to find corruption inside the precinct, especially in the detective squad, and he gradually became more and more obsessive in his determination to prove that Barney was not as upright and honest as he appeared.\n|-\n|[[Linda Lavin]] \n|Detective Janice Wentworth\n| <center> 1, 2 </center>\n|An extremely dedicated and enthusiastic (sometimes overly so) member of the squad who developed a romantic relationship with Wojo.

In Seasons 1, 3 and 4 she was played by [[Florence Stanley]] (in a total of seven appearances); in Bernice's only Season 2 appearance she was portrayed by [[Doris Belack]]. In that episode, Fish also had a grown daughter named Beverly played by Emily Levine. Also seen as recurring characters in Season 3 were group home children Jilly ([[Denise Miller]]) and Victor ([[John Cassisi]]), who would eventually become Fish's foster children. In 1977, the Fishes were [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into their own show, ''[[Fish (U.S. TV series)|Fish]]'' which also starred [[Barry Gordon]], who memorably played an embezzler who gets a pay raise and promotion in Season 5 and a lawyer representing Wojo in Season 8.\n\n====Barney's family====\nIn addition to Barney's wife Liz, Barney's son David (Michael Tessier) and daughter Rachel (Anne Wyndham) appeared in the pilot. Barney's son was written out of the show after the first episode (though was still occasionally mentioned), while his wife made appearances through the second season, and very sporadically thereafter. Wyndham also reprised her role in two later episodes, Season 1, episode 5 \"The Courtesans\", and Season 7, episode 140 \"Rachel\".\n\n====\"Wojo's Girl\"====\nDarlene Parks played Wojo's ex-prostitute girlfriend Nancy in a 2-episode arc in Season 5. The episodes focus on the 'period of adjustment' following Nancy's move into Stan's apartment.\n\n==Pilot==\n[[File:Barney Miller cast 1974.jpg|thumb|A scene from the series, presumably 1977]]\nThe series was born out of an unsold [[television pilot]], ''The Life and Times of Captain Barney Miller'', that aired on August 22, 1974, as part of an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] summer [[anthology series]], ''Just for Laughs''.  Linden and Vigoda were cast in their series roles; no other eventual cast members were present. [[Abby Dalton]] played Barney Miller's wife, Liz, while [[Val Bisoglio]], Rod Perry, and a pre-''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' [[Charles Haid]] rounded out the cast of the pilot. Guest stars included Mike Moore, Chu Chu Mulave, Henry Beckman, Buddy Lester, Michael Tessier and Anne Wyndham.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web|title=The Life and Times of Captain Barney Miller|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445529/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_64|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe pilot script was later largely reused in the debut episode ''Ramon''.  For this reworked episode, Bisoglio's lines were more or less evenly split between the new characters of Yemana and Chano, while Haid's character of Kazinski became Max Gail's Wojciehowicz.  Rod Perry's character, Sgt. Wilson, was replaced by Harris in the reworked episode, although Wilson would reappear one more time in the first-season episode ''Experience'' before disappearing from the series entirely.  Abby Dalton was replaced by Barbara Barrie as Liz, and Henry Beckman's character of Uncle Charlie was dropped entirely.  The rest of the guest cast (Moore, Malave, Lester, Tessier and Wyndham) reprised their roles in the debut episode.<ref name=\"Barney Miller - Ramon\">{{cite web|title=Barney Miller \u2013 \"Ramon\"|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519085/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the remainder of the series, the pilot was shot on film at [[CBS Studio Center]], where the sets of the 12th Precinct and the Miller apartment were originally built.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>  When the show went into regular production in late 1974, it was recorded on videotape. The sets were moved to the [[ABC Television Center]] in Hollywood, where they remained until production ended in 1982.<ref name=\"Barney Miller - Ramon\"/>\n\nThe pilot was never broadcast in syndication. It was released in 2011 as part of Shout Factory's complete series set on DVD.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Barney Miller episodes}}\n{{:List of Barney Miller episodes}}\n\n==Opening theme==\nThe show's [[instrumental]] [[jazz fusion]] theme music, written by [[Jack Elliott (composer)|Jack Elliott]] and [[Allyn Ferguson]], opens with a distinctive [[bass line]] performed by [[studio musician]] [[Chuck Berghofer]]. The bass line was improvised by Berghofer at the request of producer Dominik Hauser: \"Can you do something on the bass? This guy is a cop in New York. Can we just start it out with the bass?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2015/04/23/stories-behind-the-songs-chuck-berghofer/|title=Stories Behind the Songs: Chuck Berghofer|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>  The theme song was ranked #23 and #27, respectively, by ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' and ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazines, in their lists of \"best TV theme songs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/02/the-50-best-tv-show-theme-songs/barney-miller|title=The Best TV Theme Songs|website=Complex|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/the-50-best-tv-theme-songs.html?a=1|title=The 50 Best TV Theme Songs of All Time|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe theme plays over the Manhattan [[skyline]], followed by shots of the characters and opening credits.  Season 1 opened and closed with a shot of [[Midtown Manhattan]] as seen from [[Weehawken, New Jersey]].  Season 2 onward opened with a shot of [[Lower Manhattan]] as seen from [[Brooklyn Heights]], with a barge being towed in the foreground, and closed with a shot of the [[Midtown Manhattan]] skyline as seen from [[Long Island City]].  Several versions of the theme were used during different seasons, with minor variations in composition and performance.\n\n==Production==\nProduction of ''Barney Miller'' deliberately resembled a theatrical stage play; scenes rarely strayed from the precinct station's squad room, with its prominent open-barred [[jail cell|holding cell]], and Miller's adjoining office. The room was said to be on the second or third floor, depending on the episode. Clutter was plentiful and much of it seemed immobile over the years, including a coat hanging on a clothes rack near Harris' desk. A handful of episodes (fewer than a dozen of 170) were partially or fully set in other locations, including a stakeout location (\"Stakeout\"), a hospital room (\"Hair\"), an undercover operation (\"Grand Hotel\"), a jail (three separate rooms in \"Contempt\"), a hotel room (\"Chinatown\"), and the apartments of Barney (\"Ramon\" and \"Graft\"), Chano (\"The Hero\"), Fish (\"Fish\") and Wojo (\"Wojo's Girl\").  In \"The DNA Story,\" we finally see the inside of the men's room. ''Barney Miller'' tended to obey two of the three [[classical unities]] of drama: unity of place and unity of time. The third unity, unity of action, was not followed, since each episode had multiple subplots.\n\n''Barney Miller'' was one of the few sitcoms of the period that occasionally mentioned the then-current year or allowed the audience to infer the then-current year.\n\n''Barney Miller'' was notorious for its marathon taping sessions.<ref>[http://www.oldtvtickets.com/archives1/2010/04/barney_miller.html Barney Miller entry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504012907/http://www.oldtvtickets.com/archives1/2010/04/barney_miller.html |date=May 4, 2010 }}, Old TV Tickets blog</ref> Early seasons were recorded before a live studio audience and used a [[laugh track]] for sweetening reactions during post-production. Creator and executive producer [[Danny Arnold]] would then rewrite and restage entire scenes after the audience departed, actively looking for quieter, subtler moments that would not play well before a crowd; a taping session that began in the afternoon or early evening would then continue into the early morning hours. Max Gail referred to this in the Jack Soo retrospective episode aired on May 17, 1979, remarking that one of the clips shown was a scene that \"we finished around 2:30 in the morning.\" In a 1977 [[blooper]], a crew member mentions it being 3:15&nbsp;a.m.\n\nWriter Tom Reeder described working on the show:\n{{quote|text=Danny Arnold was the creator of the show, and especially in the early years, he was a marvel. When he was \"on\", he could spin out entire scenes, ad-libbing dialogue\u2014and great jokes\u2014for every character. By the time those scenes got to script form, though, he obsessively rewrote them.\n \nThat's true of a lot of showrunners, but Danny couldn't seem to stop himself. Sometime during season 2 (or maybe it was 3) the show was no longer taped in front of an audience, partly because the script was rarely done by show night. When one season began, six pages were in print. Not six scripts\u2014six pages of one script.\n \nThis meant that on the day the show was taped, the actors would hang around on the stage, waiting for pages to be sent down. Then\u2014sometimes at 2 a.m.\u2014they would have to learn new scenes. Ron Carey (Officer Levitt) would get his fairly quickly: \"Here's your mail, Captain.\" On the other hand, poor Steve Landesberg (Dietrich) might have to memorize long speeches explaining how nuclear fission works.\n \nIn the early years, Danny benefited from the heroic writing efforts of [[Chris Hayward]], who was a veteran writer, and rookies Tony Sheehan and [[Reinhold Weege]] who, like me, didn't know any better. They were the ''Barney Miller'' writing staff. My agent wisely turned down Danny's annual offers of staff jobs, negotiating freelance assignments (so-called \"multiple deals\") for me instead. Even so, the pace was frantic\u2014on one assignment I was given 3 hours to write the story outline. On another occasion, a friend came into my office at ABC-Vine Street and said, \"Hey, Reeder, want to go get some lunch?\" I pointed to the paper in my typewriter and said, \"This script is on the stage\u2014thanks anyway.\"<ref>[http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/10/barney-miller-inside-look.html Barney Miller: An Inside Look], By Ken Levine blog guest entry\"</ref>}}\n\nEmploying a live audience became impractical as lengthy reshoots became commonplace. By Season 4, only a quiet laugh track was used when necessary.\n\nMarty and Darryl were among the earliest recurring gay characters on American television. Danny Arnold worked closely with the Gay Media Task Force, an activist group that worked on LGBT representation in media, in developing the characters.<ref>Capsuto, p. 122</ref> Initially both characters were presented in a stereotypically effeminate manner but in later appearances Darryl began dressing and speaking in a more mainstream fashion.<ref>Capsuto, pp. 148\u201449</ref> Officer Zatelli's coming out was not the first gay storyline on American television, but was a memorable one.\n\nThe series took a while to become a hit, but ABC supported it anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/2013/07/24/the-state-of-tv-today-on-the-eve-of-the-tv-critics-association-summer-meeting-in-los-angeles-nobody-knows-anything/ |title=Netflix helps shift Hollywood\u2019s business model |publisher=O.canada.com |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>  Danny Arnold ended production of ''Barney Miller'' in 1982 after eight seasons for fear of repeating storylines; the show was not cancelled by the network.\n\n==Reception by police==\n''Barney Miller'' retains a devoted following among real-life police officers, who appreciate the show's emphasis on dialog and believably quirky characters, and its low-key portrayal of cops going about their jobs. In a 2005 op-ed for the ''New York Times'', real-life New York police detective Lucas Miller wrote:\n\n{{quote|text=Real cops are not usually fans of cop shows. [...] Many police officers maintain that the most realistic police show in the history of television was the sitcom ''Barney Miller'', [...] The action was mostly off screen, the squad room the only set, and the guys were a motley bunch of character actors who were in no danger of being picked for the N.Y.P.D. pin-up calendar. But they worked hard, made jokes, got hurt and answered to their straight-man commander. For real detectives, most of the action does happen off screen, and we spend a lot of time back in the squad room writing reports about it. Like Barney Miller's squad, we crack jokes at one another, at the cases that come in, and at the crazy suspect locked in the holding cell six feet from the new guy's desk. Life really is more like ''Barney Miller'' than ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', but our jokes aren't nearly as funny.<ref>Miller, Lucas (2005).

Usually, two or three separate subplots are in a given episode, with different officers dealing with different crimes. Rarely, about once a year, an episode would feature one or more of the detectives outside of the walls of the precinct, either on a stakeout or at their homes.\n\nPrimary characters:\n\n* '''Captain Bernard \"Barney\" Miller''' ([[Hal Linden]])  is the sensible captain of the precinct who uses his odd and dry sense of humor to retain his sanity while dealing with the foibles of his staff, an unending stream of budget problems, and paperwork that make up his job.  Several times during the series' run, he gets passed over for a promotion to deputy inspector before reaching that rank in the series finale.\n* '''Sgt. [[Phil Fish (fictional character)|Philip K. Fish]]''' ([[Abe Vigoda]]) is the senior detective on the squad. Crotchety, world-weary, and near retirement, he always seems to be suffering through some physical ailment, but his years of experience as a police officer make him a very good detective and mentor to other members of his squad. Frequently, he is on the phone dealing with a minor marital crisis with his wife Bernice. The character was eventually spun off into its own series.\n* '''Det. 3rd Grade (later Sgt.) Stanley Thaddeus \"Wojo\" Wojciehowicz''' ([[Max Gail]]){{Anchor|Stan Wojciehowicz}} is the naive, gung-ho but goodhearted [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Polish-American]], who gradually transforms from a macho former Marine into a decidedly humanitarian character (the squad's conscience, in many ways), while performing his duties as a detective. He takes and fails the sergeant's examination four times, but finally passes on his fifth try and gets promoted in season four. He is a very dedicated,  by-the-book police officer who at times tends to take his duties a little too seriously.  In the final season, his name is spelled \"Wojehowicz\" on the duty roster.\n* '''Det. 1st Grade (later Sgt.) Ron Nathan Harris''' ([[Ron Glass]]) is an ambitious, intellectual [[African American]] criminologist who has a taste for the finer things in life and thus lives well beyond his means, and who frequently seems more preoccupied with his attire and his career as a writer than with his police work. A long-running plotline about his various attempts to establish a writing career eventually has Harris emerge as a published author; his lurid memoir ''Blood on the Badge'' (originally titled ''Precinct Diary'') becomes a best seller and thus prompts him to become more serious about his work. Harris was educated by Jesuits and served in the Coast Guard (in the legal department) prior to becoming a police officer. He is a self-professed Republican, but also a former war protester and an ardent supporter of the police officers' union strike action.\n* '''Sgt. Nick Yemana''' ([[Jack Soo]]) is a surrealistically philosophical, wisecracking [[Japanese American]] detective. Though he is closely connected to his Japanese heritage, he is a native of Omaha, Nebraska. Yemana is noted for his \"off the wall\" sense of humor and wry observations about life, as well as for his gambling habits, extraordinarily poor paperwork filing skills, and for making the squad's coffee (which is disliked by everyone who drinks it). After the retirement of Fish, Yemana becomes the ranking detective. In the two-part episode \"Eviction,\" he becomes commanding officer, though he is replaced after a mere few hours. (Harris compares his tenure to that of President [[William Henry Harrison]], who served for one month.)\n* '''Sgt. Miguel \"Chano\" Amanguale''' ([[Gregory Sierra]]) is a dauntless, beleaguered [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] detective, who is very emotionally attached to his job; as such, he has a habit of getting worked up when things go awry and, when this happens, he tends to explode in rapid Spanish should it happen. His lowest moment comes in \"The Hero,\" when he kills two suspects who are robbing a bank.\n* '''Sgt. Arthur P. Dietrich''' ([[Steve Landesberg]]) is a detective with a calm, unflappable nature and a seemingly endless supply of knowledge on a wide array of subjects (he has, as Barney once observed, a \"flair for the esoteric\"), yet he enjoys elements of entertainment that can be seen as ironically simple, such as early morning cartoons and the Three Stooges (his personal favorite). He can usually find a topic to discuss with those he encounters in the squad room, whatever their interest or occupation, though his contribution usually comes out of him in an overly intellectual manner. In \"The Photographer,\" Barney goes so far as to suggest to Dietrich that he has a \"pedantic\" way of expressing himself. Despite his perspicacity, he seems to possess a deep-rooted sense of self-doubt, giving up on more than a few career paths (law and medical school, to name a few) when he finds he isn't a perfect representation of the position in his own eyes; that's why he \"became a cop.\"\n* '''Inspector Frank D. Luger''' ([[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]]) is Miller's rambling, out-of-touch, and unapologetically old-school superior who frequently drops by the precinct to \"chat with\" Barney \"in his office\". He refers to Harris as \"Har'\", Dietrich as \"Di-Di.\" and Levitt as \"Levine.\" As time goes by, Luger becomes more and more melancholy and his outdated approach to police work more and more problematic. He has a habit of getting lost in his thoughts, particularly when he reminisces about his old partners Foster, Kleiner and \"Brownie,\" which usually ends up with him getting worked up as he remembers how much he \"loved those guys.\"\n* '''Officer Carl Levitt''' ([[Ron Carey (actor)|Ron Carey]]) is a diminutive, obsequious (but competent and hard-working) uniformed officer who constantly, passive-aggressively badgers Miller about being promoted.  In the series finale, he is finally promoted to detective.\n[[File:Barney Miller 1975.JPG|thumb|170px|Barney and Liz Miller]]\n* '''Elizabeth \"Liz\" Miller''' ([[Barbara Barrie]]) is Barney's wife. A dedicated social worker, she was intended to be a regular character and, during seasons one and two, was listed in the opening credits.  Nevertheless, Liz is seen fairly infrequently.  She is, however, often referred to, and Barney is often seen (and heard) on the phone with her. Later on in the run of the show, she and Barney separate due to the ongoing tension between home life and his work at the 12th, but end up reconciling.\n\nThe show's focus was split between the detectives' interactions with each other and with the suspects and witnesses they detained, processed, and interviewed. Some typical conflicts and long-running plotlines included Miller's frustration with red tape and paperwork, his constant efforts to maintain peace, order, and discipline, and his numerous failed attempts to get a promotion; Harris' preoccupation with outside interests, such as his living arrangements but mainly his novel (''Blood on the Badge''), and his inability to remain focused on his police work; Fish's age-related health issues, marital problems, and reluctance to retire; Wojciehowicz's impulsive behavior and love life; Luger's nostalgia for the old days with partners Foster, Kleiner, and \"Brownie\" Brown; Levitt's quest to become a detective (which is eventually successful); the rivalry between the precinct's resident intellectuals, Harris and Dietrich; and continually\u2014but reliably\u2014bad coffee, usually made by Yemana.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Regulars===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n|-\n!Actor \n!Character\n!Seasons\n!Notes\n|-\n| [[Hal Linden]] \n| Captain Barney Miller\n| <center> 1\u20138 </center>\n|Main star and regular character throughout the series' run.

In Seasons 1, 3 and 4 she was played by [[Florence Stanley]] (in a total of seven appearances); in Bernice's only Season 2 appearance she was portrayed by [[Doris Belack]]. In that episode, Fish also had a grown daughter named Beverly played by Emily Levine. Also seen as recurring characters in Season 3 were group home children Jilly ([[Denise Miller]]) and Victor ([[John Cassisi]]), who would eventually become Fish's foster children. In 1977, the Fishes were [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into their own show, ''[[Fish (U.S. TV series)|Fish]]'' which also starred [[Barry Gordon]], who memorably played an embezzler who gets a pay raise and promotion in Season 5 and a lawyer representing Wojo in Season 8.\n\n====Barney's family====\nIn addition to Barney's wife Liz, Barney's son David (Michael Tessier) and daughter Rachel (Anne Wyndham) appeared in the pilot. Barney's son was written out of the show after the first episode (though was still occasionally mentioned), while his wife made appearances through the second season, and very sporadically thereafter. Wyndham also reprised her role in two later episodes, Season 1, episode 5 \"The Courtesans\", and Season 7, episode 140 \"Rachel\".\n\n====\"Wojo's Girl\"====\nDarlene Parks played Wojo's ex-prostitute girlfriend Nancy in a 2-episode arc in Season 5. The episodes focus on the 'period of adjustment' following Nancy's move into Stan's apartment.\n\n==Pilot==\n[[File:Barney Miller cast 1974.jpg|thumb|A scene from the series, presumably 1977]]\nThe series was born out of an unsold [[television pilot]], ''The Life and Times of Captain Barney Miller'', that aired on August 22, 1974, as part of an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] summer [[anthology series]], ''Just for Laughs''.  Linden and Vigoda were cast in their series roles; no other eventual cast members were present. [[Abby Dalton]] played Barney Miller's wife, Liz, while [[Val Bisoglio]], Rod Perry, and a pre-''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' [[Charles Haid]] rounded out the cast of the pilot. Guest stars included Mike Moore, Chu Chu Mulave, Henry Beckman, Buddy Lester, Michael Tessier and Anne Wyndham.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web|title=The Life and Times of Captain Barney Miller|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445529/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_64|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe pilot script was later largely reused in the debut episode ''Ramon''.  For this reworked episode, Bisoglio's lines were more or less evenly split between the new characters of Yemana and Chano, while Haid's character of Kazinski became Max Gail's Wojciehowicz.  Rod Perry's character, Sgt. Wilson, was replaced by Harris in the reworked episode, although Wilson would reappear one more time in the first-season episode ''Experience'' before disappearing from the series entirely.  Abby Dalton was replaced by Barbara Barrie as Liz, and Henry Beckman's character of Uncle Charlie was dropped entirely.

Season 1 opened and closed with a shot of [[Midtown Manhattan]] as seen from [[Weehawken, New Jersey]].  Season 2 onward opened with a shot of [[Lower Manhattan]] as seen from [[Brooklyn Heights]], with a barge being towed in the foreground, and closed with a shot of the [[Midtown Manhattan]] skyline as seen from [[Long Island City]].  Several versions of the theme were used during different seasons, with minor variations in composition and performance.\n\n==Production==\nProduction of ''Barney Miller'' deliberately resembled a theatrical stage play; scenes rarely strayed from the precinct station's squad room, with its prominent open-barred [[jail cell|holding cell]], and Miller's adjoining office. The room was said to be on the second or third floor, depending on the episode. Clutter was plentiful and much of it seemed immobile over the years, including a coat hanging on a clothes rack near Harris' desk. A handful of episodes (fewer than a dozen of 170) were partially or fully set in other locations, including a stakeout location (\"Stakeout\"), a hospital room (\"Hair\"), an undercover operation (\"Grand Hotel\"), a jail (three separate rooms in \"Contempt\"), a hotel room (\"Chinatown\"), and the apartments of Barney (\"Ramon\" and \"Graft\"), Chano (\"The Hero\"), Fish (\"Fish\") and Wojo (\"Wojo's Girl\").  In \"The DNA Story,\" we finally see the inside of the men's room. ''Barney Miller'' tended to obey two of the three [[classical unities]] of drama: unity of place and unity of time. The third unity, unity of action, was not followed, since each episode had multiple subplots.\n\n''Barney Miller'' was one of the few sitcoms of the period that occasionally mentioned the then-current year or allowed the audience to infer the then-current year.\n\n''Barney Miller'' was notorious for its marathon taping sessions.<ref>[http://www.oldtvtickets.com/archives1/2010/04/barney_miller.html Barney Miller entry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504012907/http://www.oldtvtickets.com/archives1/2010/04/barney_miller.html |date=May 4, 2010 }}, Old TV Tickets blog</ref> Early seasons were recorded before a live studio audience and used a [[laugh track]] for sweetening reactions during post-production. Creator and executive producer [[Danny Arnold]] would then rewrite and restage entire scenes after the audience departed, actively looking for quieter, subtler moments that would not play well before a crowd; a taping session that began in the afternoon or early evening would then continue into the early morning hours. Max Gail referred to this in the Jack Soo retrospective episode aired on May 17, 1979, remarking that one of the clips shown was a scene that \"we finished around 2:30 in the morning.\" In a 1977 [[blooper]], a crew member mentions it being 3:15&nbsp;a.m.\n\nWriter Tom Reeder described working on the show:\n{{quote|text=Danny Arnold was the creator of the show, and especially in the early years, he was a marvel. When he was \"on\", he could spin out entire scenes, ad-libbing dialogue\u2014and great jokes\u2014for every character. By the time those scenes got to script form, though, he obsessively rewrote them.\n \nThat's true of a lot of showrunners, but Danny couldn't seem to stop himself. Sometime during season 2 (or maybe it was 3) the show was no longer taped in front of an audience, partly because the script was rarely done by show night. When one season began, six pages were in print. Not six scripts\u2014six pages of one script.\n \nThis meant that on the day the show was taped, the actors would hang around on the stage, waiting for pages to be sent down. Then\u2014sometimes at 2 a.m.\u2014they would have to learn new scenes. Ron Carey (Officer Levitt) would get his fairly quickly: \"Here's your mail, Captain.\" On the other hand, poor Steve Landesberg (Dietrich) might have to memorize long speeches explaining how nuclear fission works.\n \nIn the early years, Danny benefited from the heroic writing efforts of [[Chris Hayward]], who was a veteran writer, and rookies Tony Sheehan and [[Reinhold Weege]] who, like me, didn't know any better. They were the ''Barney Miller'' writing staff. My agent wisely turned down Danny's annual offers of staff jobs, negotiating freelance assignments (so-called \"multiple deals\") for me instead. Even so, the pace was frantic\u2014on one assignment I was given 3 hours to write the story outline. On another occasion, a friend came into my office at ABC-Vine Street and said, \"Hey, Reeder, want to go get some lunch?\" I pointed to the paper in my typewriter and said, \"This script is on the stage\u2014thanks anyway.\"<ref>[http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/10/barney-miller-inside-look.html Barney Miller: An Inside Look], By Ken Levine blog guest entry\"</ref>}}\n\nEmploying a live audience became impractical as lengthy reshoots became commonplace. By Season 4, only a quiet laugh track was used when necessary.\n\nMarty and Darryl were among the earliest recurring gay characters on American television. Danny Arnold worked closely with the Gay Media Task Force, an activist group that worked on LGBT representation in media, in developing the characters.<ref>Capsuto, p. 122</ref> Initially both characters were presented in a stereotypically effeminate manner but in later appearances Darryl began dressing and speaking in a more mainstream fashion.<ref>Capsuto, pp. 148\u201449</ref> Officer Zatelli's coming out was not the first gay storyline on American television, but was a memorable one.\n\nThe series took a while to become a hit, but ABC supported it anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/2013/07/24/the-state-of-tv-today-on-the-eve-of-the-tv-critics-association-summer-meeting-in-los-angeles-nobody-knows-anything/ |title=Netflix helps shift Hollywood\u2019s business model |publisher=O.canada.com |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>  Danny Arnold ended production of ''Barney Miller'' in 1982 after eight seasons for fear of repeating storylines; the show was not cancelled by the network.\n\n==Reception by police==\n''Barney Miller'' retains a devoted following among real-life police officers, who appreciate the show's emphasis on dialog and believably quirky characters, and its low-key portrayal of cops going about their jobs. In a 2005 op-ed for the ''New York Times'', real-life New York police detective Lucas Miller wrote:\n\n{{quote|text=Real cops are not usually fans of cop shows. [...] Many police officers maintain that the most realistic police show in the history of television was the sitcom ''Barney Miller'', [...] The action was mostly off screen, the squad room the only set, and the guys were a motley bunch of character actors who were in no danger of being picked for the N.Y.P.D. pin-up calendar. But they worked hard, made jokes, got hurt and answered to their straight-man commander. For real detectives, most of the action does happen off screen, and we spend a lot of time back in the squad room writing reports about it. Like Barney Miller's squad, we crack jokes at one another, at the cases that come in, and at the crazy suspect locked in the holding cell six feet from the new guy's desk. Life really is more like ''Barney Miller'' than ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', but our jokes aren't nearly as funny.<ref>Miller, Lucas (2005).

It was built for, and won, the [[Rainhill Trials]] held by the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in October 1829 for demonstration of improved steam locomotive designs able to demonstrate fixed stationary engines would not be required.{{Sfnp|Carlson|1969|pp=214\u2013215, 219, 223}} \n\n''Rocket''  was designed by [[Robert Stephenson]] in 1829, and built at the [[Forth Street Works]] of his company in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].\n\nThough ''Rocket'' was not the first steam locomotive, it was the first to bring together several innovations to produce the most advanced locomotive of its day. It is the most famous example of an evolving design of locomotives by Stephenson that became the template for most steam engines in the following 150 years.\n\nThe locomotive was preserved and displayed in the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in London until 2018. It was loaned to [[Discovery Museum|Newcastle Discovery Museum]] between 22 June and 9 September 2018, to the [[Science and Industry Museum]] in Manchester from 25 September 2018 to 8 September 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scienceandindustrymuseum.org.uk/whats-on/stephensons-rocket |title=Stephenson's Rocket |publisher=Science and Industry Museum |date= |accessdate=2020-03-14}}</ref> and moved to the [[National Railway Museum]] in York later in 2019.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Basic layout ===\nThe locomotive had a tall smokestack chimney at the front, a cylindrical boiler in the middle, and a separate [[firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] at the rear.\nThe large front pair of wooden wheels was driven by two external cylinders set at an angle. The smaller rear wheels were not coupled to the driving wheels, giving an 0-2-2 wheel arrangement.<ref name=\"Burton\"/>\n\n===Design objectives===\nStephenson designed ''Rocket'' for the [[Rainhill Trials]], and the specific rules of that contest. As the first railway intended for passengers more than freight, the rules emphasised speed and would require reliability, but the weight of the locomotive was also tightly restricted. Six-wheeled locomotives were limited to six tons, four-wheeled locomotives to four and a half tons. In particular, the weight of the train expected to be hauled was to be no more than three times the actual weight of the locomotive. Stephenson realised that whatever the size of previously successful locomotives, this new contest would favour a fast, light locomotive of only moderate hauling power.<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 59\" >{{Cite book\n  |last=Snell  |first=J.B.\n  |title=Railways: Mechanical Engineering\n  |publisher=Arrow\n  |year=1973\n  |origyear=1971\n  |isbn=0-09-908170-9\n  |ref={{harvid|Snell|1971}}\n  |page=59\n}}</ref>\n\n===Innovations===\n====Single pair of driving wheels====\nStephenson's most visible decision was to use a single pair of driving wheels, with a small carrying axle behind. This was the first [[0-2-2]] and first single driver locomotive.{{efn|Although ''[[Novelty (locomotive)|Novelty]]'' would also bring a 0-2-2 arrangement to Rainhill}}<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 60\" >{{harvnb|Snell|1971|p=60}}</ref> The use of single drivers gave several advantages. The weight of [[coupling rods]] was avoided and the second axle could be smaller and lightweight, as it only carried a small proportion of the weight. Rocket placed just over {{frac|2|1|2}}&nbsp;tons of its {{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;ton total weight onto its driving wheels,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Michael R|last2=Glithero|first2=John P|title=The Engineering and History of Rocket: A Survey Report|year=2000|publisher=[[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]|location=London|isbn=1-900-747-18-9|page=17}}</ref> a higher axle load than ''[[Sans Pareil]]'', even though the [[0-4-0]] was heavier overall at 5&nbsp;ton, and officially disqualified by being over the {{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;ton limit.<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 60\" /> Early locomotive designers had been concerned that the adhesion of a locomotive's driving wheels would be inadequate, but Stephenson's past experience convinced him that this would not be a problem, particularly with the light trains of the trials contest.\n\n====Multiple boiler fire-tubes====\n''Rocket'' uses a multi-tubular boiler design. Previous locomotive boilers consisted of a single pipe surrounded by water (though the ''[[Lancashire Witch]]'' did have twin flues). ''Rocket'' had 25 copper<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 84\" >{{harvnb|Snell|1971|p=84}}</ref> fire-tubes that carry the hot exhaust gas from the firebox, through the wet boiler to the blast pipe and chimney.  This arrangement resulted in a greatly increased surface contact area of hot pipe with boiler water when compared to a [[flued boiler|single large flue]]. Additionally, radiant heating from the enlarged separate firebox helped deliver a further increase in steaming and hence boiler efficiency.\n\nThe original innovator of multiple fire-tubes is unclear, between Stephenson and [[Marc Seguin]]. It is known that Seguin visited Stephenson to observe [[Locomotion No 1|''Locomotion'']] and that he also built two multi-tubular locomotives of his own design for the [[Saint-\u00c9tienne\u2013Lyon railway]] before ''Rocket''. ''Rocket''{{'}}s boiler was of the more highly developed form, with the separate firebox and a blastpipe for draught, rather than Seguin's cumbersome fans, but ''Rocket'' was not the first multi-tubular boiler, although it remains unclear just whose invention it was.\n\nThe benefits of increasing the fire-tube area had also been attempted with [[John Ericsson|Ericsson]] and [[John Braithwaite (engineer)|Braithwaite]]'s [[Novelty (locomotive)|''Novelty'']] at Rainhill. Their design though used a single fire-tube, folded in three. This offered an increased surface area, but only at the cost of a proportionately increased length and so poor draught on the fire. Its arrangement also made tube cleaning impractical.\n\nThe advantages of the multiple-tube boiler were quickly recognised, even for heavy, slow freight locomotives. By 1830, Stephenson's past employee [[Timothy Hackworth]] had re-designed his [[return-flue boiler|return-flued]] [[Royal George (locomotive)|''Royal George'']] as the return-tubed ''Wilberforce'' class.<ref name=\"Snell, Railways:Mechanical\"  >{{cite book\n  |title=Railways: Mechanical Engineering\n  |last=Snell  |first=J. B.\n  |year=1971\n  |publisher=Longman\n  |isbn=0-582-12793-9\n  |pages=55\u201356\n}}</ref>\n\n====Blastpipe====\n''Rocket'' also used a [[blastpipe]], feeding the exhaust steam from the cylinders into the base of the chimney so as to induce a partial vacuum and pull air through the fire. Credit for the invention of the blastpipe is disputed, though Stephenson used it as early as 1814.<ref>\n{{citation|first=Samuel|last=Smiles|title=The lives of the engineers|volume=3|year=1862|chapter=ch 5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7rVmJMYQkoC&pg=PP5}}\n</ref>  The blastpipe worked well on the multi-tube boiler of ''Rocket'' but on earlier designs with a single flue through the boiler it had created so much suction that it tended to rip the top off the fire and throw burning cinders out of the chimney, vastly increasing the fuel consumption.<ref name=\"Burton\">{{cite book|author=Burton, Anthony|year=1980|title=The Rainhill Story|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|isbn=0-563-17841-8}}</ref>\n\n====Cylinders closer to the horizontal====\n[[File:Rocket Cylinder.jpg|thumb|A cutaway view of the cylinder and steam valve of the replica Rocket]]\nLike the ''Lancashire Witch'', ''Rocket'' had two cylinders set at angle from the horizontal, with the pistons driving a pair of {{convert|4|ft|8.5|in|m|abbr=on}} diameter wheels.<ref>{{citation|first=Michael|last=Bailey|title=The Engineering and History of \"Rocket\": A Survey Report|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFobmfrIKy0C}}</ref> Most previous designs had the cylinders positioned vertically, which gave the engines an uneven swaying motion as they progressed along the track. Subsequently, ''Rocket'' was modified so that the cylinders were set close to horizontal, a layout that influenced nearly all designs that followed.\n\n====Pistons directly connected to driving wheels====\nAgain like the ''Lancashire Witch'', the pistons were connected directly to the driving wheels, an arrangement which is found in subsequent steam locomotives.<ref name=RainhillTrials/>\n\n==== Separate firebox ====\nThe firebox was separate from the boiler and was double walled, with a water jacket between them. Stephenson recognised that the hottest part of the boiler, and thus the most effective for evaporating water, was that surrounding the fire itself. This firebox was heated by [[thermal radiation|radiant heat]] from the glowing [[coke (fuel)|coke]], not just [[convection]] from the hot exhaust gas.\n\nLocomotives of ''Rocket''{{'}}s era were fired by [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than coal. Local landowners were already familiar with the dark clouds of smoke from coal-fired stationary engines and had imposed regulations on most new railways that locomotives would 'consume their own smoke'.<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 59\" /> The smoke from a burning coke fire was much cleaner than that from coal. It was not until 30 years later and the development of the long firebox and [[Firebox (steam engine)#Brick arch|brick arch]] that locomotives would be effectively able to burn coal directly.\n\n''Rocket''{{'}}s first firebox was of copper sheet and of a somewhat triangular shape from the side.<ref name=\"LNWR postcard\" /> The throatplate was of firebrick, possibly the backhead too.<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 61\" >{{harvnb|Snell|1971|p=61}}</ref> When rebuilt around 1831,<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 61\" /> this was replaced by a [[wrought iron]] backhead and throatplate, with a drum wrapper (now missing), presumed to be of copper, between them. This gave a larger internal volume and encouraged better combustion within the firebox, rather than inside the tubes. These early fireboxes formed a separate water space from the boiler drum and were connected by prominent external copper pipes.\n\n===Credit for the design===\nThere have been differences in opinion on who should be given the credit for designing ''Rocket''. [[George Stephenson]] had designed several locomotives before but none as advanced as ''Rocket''. At the time that ''Rocket'' was being designed and built at the Forth Banks Works, he was living in Liverpool overseeing the building of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. His son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] had recently returned from a stint working in South America and resumed as managing director of [[Robert Stephenson and Company]]. He was in daily charge of designing and constructing the new locomotive. Although he was in frequent contact with his father in Liverpool and probably received advice from him, it is difficult not to give the majority of the credit for the design to Robert. A third person who may deserve a significant amount of credit is [[Henry Booth]], the treasurer of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. He is believed to have suggested to Robert Stephenson that a multi-tube boiler should be used.<ref name=\"Burton\"/><ref>{{Cite book\n  |title=The Willing Servant\n  |last=Ross  |first=David\n  |publisher=Tempus\n  |year=2004\n  |isbn=0-7524-2986-8\n  |ref={{harvid|Ross|2004}}\n  |pages=32\u201333\n}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution of the Stephenson locomotive design===\n\n====Before ''Rocket''====\n''Rocket'' was built at a time of rapid development of steam engine technology. It was based on experience gained from earlier designs by [[George Stephenson|George]] and [[Robert Stephenson]], including the [[Killingworth locomotives|Killingworth locomotive]] ''Bl\u00fccher'' (1814); ''[[Locomotion No. 1|Locomotion]]'' (1825); and the ''[[Lancashire Witch]]'' (1828).\n{{Gallery\n| File:Blucher engine.jpg | alt1=''Bl\u00fccher'' (1814) | ''Bl\u00fccher'' (1814)\n| File:Locomotion No. 1..jpg | alt2=''Locomotion No.1'' (1825), preserved | ''[[Locomotion No. 1|Locomotion]]'' (1825), preserved in the [[Head of Steam]] museum, [[Darlington]].\n| File:Lancashire Witch.jpg | alt3=''Lancashire Witch'' (1828) | ''[[Lancashire Witch]]'' (1828)\n}}\n\n====''Rocket'' type locomotives====\n''Rocket'' was followed by a number of other engines of similar [[0-2-2]] layout with rear-mounted cylinders built for the L&MR before it [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opened]] on 15 September 1830, culminating in the [[Northumbrian (locomotive)|''Northumbrian'']] (1830), by which time the cylinders were horizontal. Other engines of the ''Rocket'' design which were delivered to the Liverpool and Manchester railway included \"Arrow\", \"Comet\", \"Dart\" and \"Meteor\" all being delivered to the railway during 1830.\n{{Gallery\n| File:Rocket Tyseley (2).jpg | alt1=''Rocket'' (1829) Replica | ''Rocket'' (1829) Replica\n| File:Northumbrian.jpg | alt2=''Northumbrian'' (1830) | ''Northumbrian'' (1830)\n}}\n\n====After ''Rocket''====\nAt around the same time, Stephenson experimented with front-mounted cylinders. The unsuccessful [[0-4-0]] [[Invicta (locomotive)|''Invicta'']], built in 1829 immediately after ''Rocket'', still had them at an angle. The successful [[2-2-0]] locomotive [[Planet (locomotive)|''Planet'']] (1830) had internal front-mounted cylinders set to the horizontal.\n\nEngines built to the ''Planet'' design and the subsequent [[2-2-2]] [[Patentee locomotive|''Patentee'']] design of 1833 made the design of ''Rocket'' obsolete.\n{{Gallery\n| File:Planet replica.jpg | alt1=''Planet'' (1830) Replica | ''Planet'' (1830) Replica\n| File:Adler May 2008 Fuerth 3.jpg | alt2=''Adler'' (1835) Replica \u2013 ''Patentee'' type | ''Adler'' (1835) Replica \u2013 ''Patentee'' type\n}}\n\n==Rainhill Trials==\n{{Main|Rainhill Trials}}\nOn 20 April 1829 the board of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway project passed a resolution for a competition to be held to prove their railway could be reliably operated by steam locomotives, there being advice from eminent engineers of the age that stationary engines would be required.{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=44}}  A prize of \u00a3500 was offered as an incentive to the winner, with strict conditions a locomotive would need to meet to enter the trial.{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=46}}  Robert Stephenson was able to report to [[Henry Booth]] on 5 September 1829 that ''Rocket''{{efn|Originally ''Rocket'' was known by the Stephensons as the ''Premium Engine''{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=48}}}} had performed initial manufacturer tests with flying colours at [[Killingworth]].

The day started with a procession of eight trains setting out from Liverpool for Manchester. The parade was led by ''Northumbrian'' driven by George Stephenson, and included ''Phoenix'' driven by his son Robert, ''North Star'' driven by his brother Robert Sr. and ''Rocket'' driven by assistant engineer [[Joseph Locke]].

\"Adler, Rocket and Co.\"]]\n\n'''Stephenson's ''Rocket''''' was an early [[steam locomotive]] of [[0-2-2]] [[wheel arrangement]]. It was built for, and won, the [[Rainhill Trials]] held by the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in October 1829 for demonstration of improved steam locomotive designs able to demonstrate fixed stationary engines would not be required.{{Sfnp|Carlson|1969|pp=214\u2013215, 219, 223}} \n\n''Rocket''  was designed by [[Robert Stephenson]] in 1829, and built at the [[Forth Street Works]] of his company in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].\n\nThough ''Rocket'' was not the first steam locomotive, it was the first to bring together several innovations to produce the most advanced locomotive of its day. It is the most famous example of an evolving design of locomotives by Stephenson that became the template for most steam engines in the following 150 years.\n\nThe locomotive was preserved and displayed in the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in London until 2018. It was loaned to [[Discovery Museum|Newcastle Discovery Museum]] between 22 June and 9 September 2018, to the [[Science and Industry Museum]] in Manchester from 25 September 2018 to 8 September 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scienceandindustrymuseum.org.uk/whats-on/stephensons-rocket |title=Stephenson's Rocket |publisher=Science and Industry Museum |date= |accessdate=2020-03-14}}</ref> and moved to the [[National Railway Museum]] in York later in 2019.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Basic layout ===\nThe locomotive had a tall smokestack chimney at the front, a cylindrical boiler in the middle, and a separate [[firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] at the rear.\nThe large front pair of wooden wheels was driven by two external cylinders set at an angle. The smaller rear wheels were not coupled to the driving wheels, giving an 0-2-2 wheel arrangement.<ref name=\"Burton\"/>\n\n===Design objectives===\nStephenson designed ''Rocket'' for the [[Rainhill Trials]], and the specific rules of that contest. As the first railway intended for passengers more than freight, the rules emphasised speed and would require reliability, but the weight of the locomotive was also tightly restricted. Six-wheeled locomotives were limited to six tons, four-wheeled locomotives to four and a half tons. In particular, the weight of the train expected to be hauled was to be no more than three times the actual weight of the locomotive. Stephenson realised that whatever the size of previously successful locomotives, this new contest would favour a fast, light locomotive of only moderate hauling power.<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 59\" >{{Cite book\n  |last=Snell  |first=J.B.\n  |title=Railways: Mechanical Engineering\n  |publisher=Arrow\n  |year=1973\n  |origyear=1971\n  |isbn=0-09-908170-9\n  |ref={{harvid|Snell|1971}}\n  |page=59\n}}</ref>\n\n===Innovations===\n====Single pair of driving wheels====\nStephenson's most visible decision was to use a single pair of driving wheels, with a small carrying axle behind. This was the first [[0-2-2]] and first single driver locomotive.{{efn|Although ''[[Novelty (locomotive)|Novelty]]'' would also bring a 0-2-2 arrangement to Rainhill}}<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 60\" >{{harvnb|Snell|1971|p=60}}</ref> The use of single drivers gave several advantages. The weight of [[coupling rods]] was avoided and the second axle could be smaller and lightweight, as it only carried a small proportion of the weight. Rocket placed just over {{frac|2|1|2}}&nbsp;tons of its {{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;ton total weight onto its driving wheels,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Michael R|last2=Glithero|first2=John P|title=The Engineering and History of Rocket: A Survey Report|year=2000|publisher=[[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]|location=London|isbn=1-900-747-18-9|page=17}}</ref> a higher axle load than ''[[Sans Pareil]]'', even though the [[0-4-0]] was heavier overall at 5&nbsp;ton, and officially disqualified by being over the {{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;ton limit.<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 60\" /> Early locomotive designers had been concerned that the adhesion of a locomotive's driving wheels would be inadequate, but Stephenson's past experience convinced him that this would not be a problem, particularly with the light trains of the trials contest.\n\n====Multiple boiler fire-tubes====\n''Rocket'' uses a multi-tubular boiler design. Previous locomotive boilers consisted of a single pipe surrounded by water (though the ''[[Lancashire Witch]]'' did have twin flues). ''Rocket'' had 25 copper<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 84\" >{{harvnb|Snell|1971|p=84}}</ref> fire-tubes that carry the hot exhaust gas from the firebox, through the wet boiler to the blast pipe and chimney.  This arrangement resulted in a greatly increased surface contact area of hot pipe with boiler water when compared to a [[flued boiler|single large flue]]. Additionally, radiant heating from the enlarged separate firebox helped deliver a further increase in steaming and hence boiler efficiency.\n\nThe original innovator of multiple fire-tubes is unclear, between Stephenson and [[Marc Seguin]]. It is known that Seguin visited Stephenson to observe [[Locomotion No 1|''Locomotion'']] and that he also built two multi-tubular locomotives of his own design for the [[Saint-\u00c9tienne\u2013Lyon railway]] before ''Rocket''. ''Rocket''{{'}}s boiler was of the more highly developed form, with the separate firebox and a blastpipe for draught, rather than Seguin's cumbersome fans, but ''Rocket'' was not the first multi-tubular boiler, although it remains unclear just whose invention it was.\n\nThe benefits of increasing the fire-tube area had also been attempted with [[John Ericsson|Ericsson]] and [[John Braithwaite (engineer)|Braithwaite]]'s [[Novelty (locomotive)|''Novelty'']] at Rainhill. Their design though used a single fire-tube, folded in three. This offered an increased surface area, but only at the cost of a proportionately increased length and so poor draught on the fire. Its arrangement also made tube cleaning impractical.\n\nThe advantages of the multiple-tube boiler were quickly recognised, even for heavy, slow freight locomotives. By 1830, Stephenson's past employee [[Timothy Hackworth]] had re-designed his [[return-flue boiler|return-flued]] [[Royal George (locomotive)|''Royal George'']] as the return-tubed ''Wilberforce'' class.<ref name=\"Snell, Railways:Mechanical\"  >{{cite book\n  |title=Railways: Mechanical Engineering\n  |last=Snell  |first=J.

Credit for the invention of the blastpipe is disputed, though Stephenson used it as early as 1814.<ref>\n{{citation|first=Samuel|last=Smiles|title=The lives of the engineers|volume=3|year=1862|chapter=ch 5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7rVmJMYQkoC&pg=PP5}}\n</ref>  The blastpipe worked well on the multi-tube boiler of ''Rocket'' but on earlier designs with a single flue through the boiler it had created so much suction that it tended to rip the top off the fire and throw burning cinders out of the chimney, vastly increasing the fuel consumption.<ref name=\"Burton\">{{cite book|author=Burton, Anthony|year=1980|title=The Rainhill Story|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|isbn=0-563-17841-8}}</ref>\n\n====Cylinders closer to the horizontal====\n[[File:Rocket Cylinder.jpg|thumb|A cutaway view of the cylinder and steam valve of the replica Rocket]]\nLike the ''Lancashire Witch'', ''Rocket'' had two cylinders set at angle from the horizontal, with the pistons driving a pair of {{convert|4|ft|8.5|in|m|abbr=on}} diameter wheels.<ref>{{citation|first=Michael|last=Bailey|title=The Engineering and History of \"Rocket\": A Survey Report|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFobmfrIKy0C}}</ref> Most previous designs had the cylinders positioned vertically, which gave the engines an uneven swaying motion as they progressed along the track. Subsequently, ''Rocket'' was modified so that the cylinders were set close to horizontal, a layout that influenced nearly all designs that followed.\n\n====Pistons directly connected to driving wheels====\nAgain like the ''Lancashire Witch'', the pistons were connected directly to the driving wheels, an arrangement which is found in subsequent steam locomotives.<ref name=RainhillTrials/>\n\n==== Separate firebox ====\nThe firebox was separate from the boiler and was double walled, with a water jacket between them. Stephenson recognised that the hottest part of the boiler, and thus the most effective for evaporating water, was that surrounding the fire itself. This firebox was heated by [[thermal radiation|radiant heat]] from the glowing [[coke (fuel)|coke]], not just [[convection]] from the hot exhaust gas.\n\nLocomotives of ''Rocket''{{'}}s era were fired by [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than coal. Local landowners were already familiar with the dark clouds of smoke from coal-fired stationary engines and had imposed regulations on most new railways that locomotives would 'consume their own smoke'.<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 59\" /> The smoke from a burning coke fire was much cleaner than that from coal. It was not until 30 years later and the development of the long firebox and [[Firebox (steam engine)#Brick arch|brick arch]] that locomotives would be effectively able to burn coal directly.\n\n''Rocket''{{'}}s first firebox was of copper sheet and of a somewhat triangular shape from the side.<ref name=\"LNWR postcard\" /> The throatplate was of firebrick, possibly the backhead too.<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 61\" >{{harvnb|Snell|1971|p=61}}</ref> When rebuilt around 1831,<ref name=\"Snell, 1971, 61\" /> this was replaced by a [[wrought iron]] backhead and throatplate, with a drum wrapper (now missing), presumed to be of copper, between them. This gave a larger internal volume and encouraged better combustion within the firebox, rather than inside the tubes. These early fireboxes formed a separate water space from the boiler drum and were connected by prominent external copper pipes.\n\n===Credit for the design===\nThere have been differences in opinion on who should be given the credit for designing ''Rocket''. [[George Stephenson]] had designed several locomotives before but none as advanced as ''Rocket''. At the time that ''Rocket'' was being designed and built at the Forth Banks Works, he was living in Liverpool overseeing the building of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. His son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] had recently returned from a stint working in South America and resumed as managing director of [[Robert Stephenson and Company]]. He was in daily charge of designing and constructing the new locomotive. Although he was in frequent contact with his father in Liverpool and probably received advice from him, it is difficult not to give the majority of the credit for the design to Robert. A third person who may deserve a significant amount of credit is [[Henry Booth]], the treasurer of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. He is believed to have suggested to Robert Stephenson that a multi-tube boiler should be used.<ref name=\"Burton\"/><ref>{{Cite book\n  |title=The Willing Servant\n  |last=Ross  |first=David\n  |publisher=Tempus\n  |year=2004\n  |isbn=0-7524-2986-8\n  |ref={{harvid|Ross|2004}}\n  |pages=32\u201333\n}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution of the Stephenson locomotive design===\n\n====Before ''Rocket''====\n''Rocket'' was built at a time of rapid development of steam engine technology. It was based on experience gained from earlier designs by [[George Stephenson|George]] and [[Robert Stephenson]], including the [[Killingworth locomotives|Killingworth locomotive]] ''Bl\u00fccher'' (1814); ''[[Locomotion No. 1|Locomotion]]'' (1825); and the ''[[Lancashire Witch]]'' (1828).\n{{Gallery\n| File:Blucher engine.jpg | alt1=''Bl\u00fccher'' (1814) | ''Bl\u00fccher'' (1814)\n| File:Locomotion No. 1..jpg | alt2=''Locomotion No.1'' (1825), preserved | ''[[Locomotion No. 1|Locomotion]]'' (1825), preserved in the [[Head of Steam]] museum, [[Darlington]].\n| File:Lancashire Witch.jpg | alt3=''Lancashire Witch'' (1828) | ''[[Lancashire Witch]]'' (1828)\n}}\n\n====''Rocket'' type locomotives====\n''Rocket'' was followed by a number of other engines of similar [[0-2-2]] layout with rear-mounted cylinders built for the L&MR before it [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opened]] on 15 September 1830, culminating in the [[Northumbrian (locomotive)|''Northumbrian'']] (1830), by which time the cylinders were horizontal. Other engines of the ''Rocket'' design which were delivered to the Liverpool and Manchester railway included \"Arrow\", \"Comet\", \"Dart\" and \"Meteor\" all being delivered to the railway during 1830.\n{{Gallery\n| File:Rocket Tyseley (2).jpg | alt1=''Rocket'' (1829) Replica | ''Rocket'' (1829) Replica\n| File:Northumbrian.jpg | alt2=''Northumbrian'' (1830) | ''Northumbrian'' (1830)\n}}\n\n====After ''Rocket''====\nAt around the same time, Stephenson experimented with front-mounted cylinders. The unsuccessful [[0-4-0]] [[Invicta (locomotive)|''Invicta'']], built in 1829 immediately after ''Rocket'', still had them at an angle. The successful [[2-2-0]] locomotive [[Planet (locomotive)|''Planet'']] (1830) had internal front-mounted cylinders set to the horizontal.\n\nEngines built to the ''Planet'' design and the subsequent [[2-2-2]] [[Patentee locomotive|''Patentee'']] design of 1833 made the design of ''Rocket'' obsolete.\n{{Gallery\n| File:Planet replica.jpg | alt1=''Planet'' (1830) Replica | ''Planet'' (1830) Replica\n| File:Adler May 2008 Fuerth 3.jpg | alt2=''Adler'' (1835) Replica \u2013 ''Patentee'' type | ''Adler'' (1835) Replica \u2013 ''Patentee'' type\n}}\n\n==Rainhill Trials==\n{{Main|Rainhill Trials}}\nOn 20 April 1829 the board of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway project passed a resolution for a competition to be held to prove their railway could be reliably operated by steam locomotives, there being advice from eminent engineers of the age that stationary engines would be required.{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=44}}  A prize of \u00a3500 was offered as an incentive to the winner, with strict conditions a locomotive would need to meet to enter the trial.{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=46}}  Robert Stephenson was able to report to [[Henry Booth]] on 5 September 1829 that ''Rocket''{{efn|Originally ''Rocket'' was known by the Stephensons as the ''Premium Engine''{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=48}}}} had performed initial manufacturer tests with flying colours at [[Killingworth]].  ''Rocket'' was dismantled at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and began the long trip to Rainhill: by horse wagon to Carlisle; [[Lighter (barge)|lighter]] to [[Bowness-on-Solway]] then by the [[Cumberland (1826 ship)|''Cumberland'']] steamer to Liverpool for re-assembly on 18 September 1829.{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=49}}{{sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=66}}    ''Rocket'' passed the trial requirement of achieving an average speed of {{Convert|10|mph|kph}} over {{Convert|70|mi|km}} by over 40 percent.{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=55}}  Demonstrations also saw ''Rocket'' consistently and easily haul a carriage of over 20 person up the Whiston incline at over {{Convert|15|mph|kph}}, and light engine running of around {{Convert|30|mph|kph}}.{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=55}} No other locomotive at the trials was able to achieve anything like the level of performance reliably, with partners Booth and Stephensons sharing the \u00a3500 winnings, and perhaps more importantly the need for stationary engines being demonstrated as unnecessary with sceptics such as [[John Urpeth Rastrick|Rastrick]] on the way to conversion.{{Sfnp|Ferneyhough|1980|p=56\u201357}}\n\n==Operation and subsequent history==\n[[File:Replica Rocket and coach.jpg|thumb|right|A replica coach and ''Rocket'' at the [[Rocket 150|''Rocket'' 150]] event]]\n\n===Opening-day accident===\nThe [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening ceremony]] of the L&MR, on 15 September 1830, was a considerable event, drawing luminaries from the government and industry, including the Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].
