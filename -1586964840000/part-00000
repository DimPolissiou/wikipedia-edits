The building covers {{convert|16|acre|ha}}.{{sfn|Florida guide|page=205}} Among United States forts, only [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia and [[Fort Adams]] in Rhode Island are larger. The fort is located on [[Garden Key]] in the lower [[Florida Keys]] within the [[Dry Tortugas National Park]], {{convert|68|mi|km}} west of the island of [[Key West]]. The [[Dry Tortugas]] are part of [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]], [[Florida]], United States.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Construction ===\n\n=== Design ===\n[[File:Fort jefferson arches dry tortugas.jpg|thumb|Lower archways of one interior side of Fort Jefferson. Many of the arches were designed by Capt. [[Daniel P. Woodbury]], Superintending Engineer from 1856 to 1860.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|89,131}}]]\n\nThe design called for a two-tiered [[casemate]]s in a six-sided outline, with two [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls]] measuring {{convert|325|ft|m}}, and the other four measuring {{convert|477|ft|m}}. Corner [[bastion]]s, which are large projections designed to allow defensive fire along the faces of the walls they joined, contained gunrooms, [[gunpowder magazine]]s and a [[granite]] [[spiral staircase]]. Each tier of casemates contained 150 guns, and another 150 were placed on top of the fort itself. The heavy guns were mounted inside the walls in a string of open casemates, or gunrooms, facing outward toward the sea through large openings called [[embrasure]]s. The {{convert|13|acre|ha|adj=mid}} parade ground contained additional powder magazines, headquarters, a hospital, officer quarters and three large barracks.<ref name=Reid />\n\n[[File:Fort Jefferson Parade Ground.jpg|thumb|left|Interior wall, harbor light, and parade ground (2005)]]\n[[File:Fort Jefferson Ramparts.jpg|thumb|left|Ramparts on north wall, showing evidence of subsidence (2005)]]\n[[File:Fort Jefferson Courtyard Panorama.jpg|thumb|Courtyard, showing expanse of interior (2019)]]\nThe Army employed civilian carpenters, masons, general laborers, and Key West [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] to help construct the fort. By August 1855, 233 white contract laborers were employed, though the slaves \"... were the backbone of the labor gang ...,\" according to [[Albert Manucy]]. Bricks were provided by the Pensacola firm of Raiford and Abercrombie. In 1859, the scientist [[Joseph Bassett Holder]] assumed responsibility as the fort's physician.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|16\u201319,23\u201327}}\n\nIn order to support such a large population in an area lacking fresh water, an innovative system of [[cistern]]s was built into the walls of the fort. Sand-filled columns were placed at regular intervals in the inner walls, spanning their height from the roof to the foundation. The columns were intended to filter rainwater from the rooftop for long-term storage in a series of underground chambers. However, the rainwater dissolved salts in the sand, or the cisterns had not been made tight, making the water unfit for drinking, but usable for washing and cooking. Only the rainwater runoff stored under the parade ground was fresh for drinking. Two [[evaporator (marine)|steam condensers]] distilled {{convert|7,000|gal|l}} of sea water per day during the Civil War. The fort enjoyed \"... much better water than we have had heretofore,\" which was stored in the parade ground cisterns.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|40,62\u201363}}\n\n=== Civil War ===\nAt the onset of the Civil War, 62 men of the Second U.S. Artillery Regiment, under the command of Major [[Lewis Golding Arnold]], were moved to the fort, preventing it from falling into the hands of rebel forces. Capt. Meigs took over as the Superintending Engineer in 1860, and worked feverishly to improve the security and defenses so that the fort's heavy guns were first fired on 26 January 1861. The fort had a population of 168 persons at the time, including women and children.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|31\u201343}}\n\nTwo companies, 160 soldiers, of the 6th New York [[Zouaves]] arrived on 4 July 1861, under the command of Col. [[William Wilson (Zouave)|Bill Wilson]]. The [[7th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry]] arrived in March 1862, under the command of Col. [[Haldimand S. Putnam]], to relieve the Zouaves. The [[90th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], under the command of Lt. Col. Louis W. Tinelli relieved the New Hampshire soldiers in June 1862. They were relieved by the [[47th Pennsylvania Infantry]] in December 1862. They were relieved in March 1864 by the [[110th New York Volunteer Infantry]].<ref name=Reid />{{rp|49,55\u201357,63\u201365,78\u201379}}\n\nIn September 1861, the first prisoner soldiers appeared, those sentenced by [[Courts-martial in the United States|Courts-martial]] to confinement and hard labor for acts such as mutinous conduct. President Lincoln then substituted imprisonment on the Dry Tortugas, in lieu of execution, for those found guilty of desertion. By June 1863, only 22 black workers remained following the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. By November 1863, the number of military convicts reached 214, meeting the demands for unskilled labor, and the ratio of soldier to prisoners was about four to one. In June 1864, the ratio was almost equal, with 653 soldiers and 753 convicts. In November 1864, only 583 soldiers guarded 882 prisoners and eight were able to escape.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|50,68,80,83}}\n\n=== Post Civil War ===\n[[File:Drmudd4wiki.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Samuel Mudd]] as he appeared as a federal prisoner while working in the [[carpenter]]'s shop in the military prison at Fort Jefferson, circa 1866\u20131867.]]\nOn 24 July 1865 four special civilian prisoners arrived. These were [[Samuel Mudd]], [[Edmund Spangler]], [[Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)|Samuel Arnold]] and [[Michael O'Laughlen]], who had been convicted of conspiracy in the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination of President Abraham Lincoln]]. Mudd attempted to stowaway on a steam transport, when the 82nd [[U.S. Colored Troops]] relieved the [[161st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] on 25 September 1865. This led to his detention in the fort's \"dungeon,\" over which were the words \"Whoso entereth here leaveth all hope behind\" (from Canto III of Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''). Another state prisoner, Col. [[George St. Leger Grenfell]] arrived on 8 October 1865.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|88\u201389,93\u201395}}\n\nIn November 1865, the [[5th U.S. Artillery]] arrived and in December 1865, there were a total of 470 soldiers and 273 prisoners. By February 1866, the prisoners were reduced 207, and to 193 by May. Construction came to a near halt that summer and only 56 prisoners remained in January 1867. The [[3rd U.S. Artillery]] replaced the 5th in 1869.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|98\u201399,103,105\u2013107,123}}\n\nMudd helped provide medical care during a [[yellow fever]] epidemic at the fort in 1867. The epidemic killed many prisoners, including O'Laughlen, and Joseph Sim Smith, the 5th Artillery's surgeon. A monument to Smith and his son is still present on the parade grounds. Mudd, Arnold and Spangler were [[pardon]]ed by President [[Andrew Johnson]] and released.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|110\u2013113,120,124}}\n\nThe [[seawall]] was finally completed in 1872 and six {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=mid}} [[Rodman gun]]s were in place on [[barbette]] (third) tier.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|126}} The total number of large-caliber guns was 243. The guns were never fired.{{sfn|Florida guide|page=205}}\n\nFrequent [[hurricane]]s and yellow fever epidemics convinced the War Department to remove the garrison, leaving a small caretaker force for the armaments and ammunition in 1874. In 1889, the Army turned the fort over to the [[Marine Hospital Service]] to be operated as a [[quarantine]] station. The U.S. Navy used the Key as a [[coaling station]].\n\nNeglected, stripped by vandals, swept by repeated tropical storms that crushed brick and concrete and bent girders, Fort Jefferson deteriorated rapidly. It remained unoccupied until [[Spanish\u2013American War|war with Spain]] broke out in 1898. The American fleet was stationed there. One of the ships to load coal there was the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']] before her fateful trip to Havana.\n\nIn 1902, the property was transferred to the Navy Department, and coal rigs and water distilling plants were built. When these were destroyed by hurricanes in 1906, the fort was again abandoned. Two years later the entire group of islands was set aside as a Federal bird reservation. Until 1934 Garden Key and the crumbling ruins were merely a rendezvous for fishermen and tourists.<ref>{{cite book |title=Florida.

As a national park, primitive camping is permitted on the beach. Visitors by ferry typically spend four hours on the island, which is enough time for a guided tour of the fort, lunch on the boat and a swim (snorkel equipment provided) on the reef.

[[fortress]]. It is the largest brick [[masonry]] structure in the [[Americas]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/drto|title=Dry Tortugas National Park (U.S. National Park Service)}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0111/story.html#story_4 Trips: Florida\u2019s Dry Tortugas National Park]</ref> and is composed of over 16 million bricks. The building covers {{convert|16|acre|ha}}.{{sfn|Florida guide|page=205}} Among United States forts, only [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia and [[Fort Adams]] in Rhode Island are larger. The fort is located on [[Garden Key]] in the lower [[Florida Keys]] within the [[Dry Tortugas National Park]], {{convert|68|mi|km}} west of the island of [[Key West]]. The [[Dry Tortugas]] are part of [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]], [[Florida]], United States.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:Fort Jefferson Moat.JPG|thumb|left|Fort Jefferson Moat \u2013 Dry Tortugas]]\nIn late December 1824 and early January 1825, about five years after [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty|sold]] [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to the United States for $5 million, [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] inspected the [[Dry Tortugas]] islands. He was on the lookout for a site for a naval station that would help suppress [[piracy]] in the [[Caribbean]]. Unimpressed with what he saw, he notified the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] that the Dry Tortugas were unfit for any kind of naval establishment. He reported that they consist of small sand islands a little above the surface of the ocean, have no fresh water, scarcely enough land to place a fortification, and in any case are probably not solid enough to bear one.<ref name=\"Reid\">{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=Thomas |title=America's Fortress|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville|isbn=978-0-8130-3019-7|pages=10\u201314}}</ref>\n\nWhile Commodore Porter thought the Dry Tortugas were unfit for a naval station, others in the U.S. government thought the islands were a good location for a [[lighthouse]] to guide ships around the area's reefs and small islands. A small island called Bush Key, later called [[Garden Key]], was selected as the site for the lighthouse, which became known as [[Garden Key Light]]. Construction began in 1825 and was completed in 1826. The {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=mid}} lighthouse was constructed of brick with a whitewashed exterior. A small white cottage for the lighthouse keeper was constructed beside the lighthouse.\n\nIn 1829, under recommendations from Commodore [[John Rodgers (naval officer, War of 1812)|John Rodgers]], the survey ship ''Florida'' stopped at the Dry Tortugas to evaluate the anchorage. Contrary to Commodore Porter's experience, [[Josiah Tattnall]] was delighted with what he found. The Dry Tortugas, he reported, consisted of 11 small keys and surrounding reefs and [[bank (sea floor)|banks]], over which the sea broke. There was an outer and an inner harbor. The former afforded a safe anchorage during all seasons and was large enough to let a large number of ships ride at anchor. Of more importance, the inner harbor combined a sufficient depth of water for [[ship of the line|ships-of-the-line]], with a narrow entrance of not more than {{convert|120|yd|m}}. Tattnall noted that if a hostile power should occupy the Dry Tortugas, United States shipping in the Gulf would be in deadly peril, and nothing but absolute naval superiority could prevail. However, if occupied and fortified by the U.S., the Dry Tortugas would constitute the advance post for a defense of the Gulf Coast. Capt. [[John G. Barnard]] then made a detailed reconnaissance in November 1844 and on 17 September 1845, the Dry Tortugas became a national military reservation.<ref name=Reid />\n\n[[File:Fort Jefferson 4 wiki.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Jefferson]]\nConstruction of Fort Jefferson (named after the third U.S. President, [[Thomas Jefferson]]) was finally begun on Garden Key in December 1846, under the supervision of 2nd Lt. [[Horatio Wright]], after plans drawn up by Lt. [[Montgomery C. Meigs]] were approved in November. Meigs' plans were based on a design by [[Joseph Totten]].<ref name=Reid /> Chief of Engineers Totten eventually visited the fort in 1855, accompanying [[Louis Agassiz]].<ref name=Reid />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe new fort was built so that the existing Garden Key lighthouse and the lighthouse keeper's cottage were contained within the walls of the fort. The lighthouse continued to serve a vital function in guiding ships through the waters of the Dry Tortugas Islands until the current metal light tower was installed atop an adjacent wall of the fort in 1876. The original brick lighthouse tower was taken down in 1877.\n\n=== Design ===\n[[File:Fort jefferson arches dry tortugas.jpg|thumb|Lower archways of one interior side of Fort Jefferson. Many of the arches were designed by Capt. [[Daniel P. Woodbury]], Superintending Engineer from 1856 to 1860.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|89,131}}]]\n\nThe design called for a two-tiered [[casemate]]s in a six-sided outline, with two [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls]] measuring {{convert|325|ft|m}}, and the other four measuring {{convert|477|ft|m}}. Corner [[bastion]]s, which are large projections designed to allow defensive fire along the faces of the walls they joined, contained gunrooms, [[gunpowder magazine]]s and a [[granite]] [[spiral staircase]]. Each tier of casemates contained 150 guns, and another 150 were placed on top of the fort itself. The heavy guns were mounted inside the walls in a string of open casemates, or gunrooms, facing outward toward the sea through large openings called [[embrasure]]s. The {{convert|13|acre|ha|adj=mid}} parade ground contained additional powder magazines, headquarters, a hospital, officer quarters and three large barracks.<ref name=Reid />\n\n[[File:Fort Jefferson Parade Ground.jpg|thumb|left|Interior wall, harbor light, and parade ground (2005)]]\n[[File:Fort Jefferson Ramparts.jpg|thumb|left|Ramparts on north wall, showing evidence of subsidence (2005)]]\n[[File:Fort Jefferson Courtyard Panorama.jpg|thumb|Courtyard, showing expanse of interior (2019)]]\nThe Army employed civilian carpenters, masons, general laborers, and Key West [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] to help construct the fort. By August 1855, 233 white contract laborers were employed, though the slaves \"... were the backbone of the labor gang ...,\" according to [[Albert Manucy]]. Bricks were provided by the Pensacola firm of Raiford and Abercrombie. In 1859, the scientist [[Joseph Bassett Holder]] assumed responsibility as the fort's physician.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|16\u201319,23\u201327}}\n\nIn order to support such a large population in an area lacking fresh water, an innovative system of [[cistern]]s was built into the walls of the fort. Sand-filled columns were placed at regular intervals in the inner walls, spanning their height from the roof to the foundation. The columns were intended to filter rainwater from the rooftop for long-term storage in a series of underground chambers. However, the rainwater dissolved salts in the sand, or the cisterns had not been made tight, making the water unfit for drinking, but usable for washing and cooking. Only the rainwater runoff stored under the parade ground was fresh for drinking. Two [[evaporator (marine)|steam condensers]] distilled {{convert|7,000|gal|l}} of sea water per day during the Civil War. The fort enjoyed \"... much better water than we have had heretofore,\" which was stored in the parade ground cisterns.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|40,62\u201363}}\n\n=== Civil War ===\nAt the onset of the Civil War, 62 men of the Second U.S. Artillery Regiment, under the command of Major [[Lewis Golding Arnold]], were moved to the fort, preventing it from falling into the hands of rebel forces. Capt. Meigs took over as the Superintending Engineer in 1860, and worked feverishly to improve the security and defenses so that the fort's heavy guns were first fired on 26 January 1861. The fort had a population of 168 persons at the time, including women and children.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|31\u201343}}\n\nTwo companies, 160 soldiers, of the 6th New York [[Zouaves]] arrived on 4 July 1861, under the command of Col. [[William Wilson (Zouave)|Bill Wilson]]. The [[7th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry]] arrived in March 1862, under the command of Col. [[Haldimand S. Putnam]], to relieve the Zouaves. The [[90th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], under the command of Lt. Col. Louis W. Tinelli relieved the New Hampshire soldiers in June 1862. They were relieved by the [[47th Pennsylvania Infantry]] in December 1862. They were relieved in March 1864 by the [[110th New York Volunteer Infantry]].<ref name=Reid />{{rp|49,55\u201357,63\u201365,78\u201379}}\n\nIn September 1861, the first prisoner soldiers appeared, those sentenced by [[Courts-martial in the United States|Courts-martial]] to confinement and hard labor for acts such as mutinous conduct. President Lincoln then substituted imprisonment on the Dry Tortugas, in lieu of execution, for those found guilty of desertion. By June 1863, only 22 black workers remained following the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. By November 1863, the number of military convicts reached 214, meeting the demands for unskilled labor, and the ratio of soldier to prisoners was about four to one. In June 1864, the ratio was almost equal, with 653 soldiers and 753 convicts. In November 1864, only 583 soldiers guarded 882 prisoners and eight were able to escape.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|50,68,80,83}}\n\n=== Post Civil War ===\n[[File:Drmudd4wiki.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Samuel Mudd]] as he appeared as a federal prisoner while working in the [[carpenter]]'s shop in the military prison at Fort Jefferson, circa 1866\u20131867.]]\nOn 24 July 1865 four special civilian prisoners arrived. These were [[Samuel Mudd]], [[Edmund Spangler]], [[Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)|Samuel Arnold]] and [[Michael O'Laughlen]], who had been convicted of conspiracy in the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination of President Abraham Lincoln]]. Mudd attempted to stowaway on a steam transport, when the 82nd [[U.S. Colored Troops]] relieved the [[161st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] on 25 September 1865. This led to his detention in the fort's \"dungeon,\" over which were the words \"Whoso entereth here leaveth all hope behind\" (from Canto III of Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''). Another state prisoner, Col. [[George St. Leger Grenfell]] arrived on 8 October 1865.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|88\u201389,93\u201395}}\n\nIn November 1865, the [[5th U.S. Artillery]] arrived and in December 1865, there were a total of 470 soldiers and 273 prisoners. By February 1866, the prisoners were reduced 207, and to 193 by May. Construction came to a near halt that summer and only 56 prisoners remained in January 1867. The [[3rd U.S. Artillery]] replaced the 5th in 1869.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|98\u201399,103,105\u2013107,123}}\n\nMudd helped provide medical care during a [[yellow fever]] epidemic at the fort in 1867. The epidemic killed many prisoners, including O'Laughlen, and Joseph Sim Smith, the 5th Artillery's surgeon. A monument to Smith and his son is still present on the parade grounds. Mudd, Arnold and Spangler were [[pardon]]ed by President [[Andrew Johnson]] and released.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|110\u2013113,120,124}}\n\nThe [[seawall]] was finally completed in 1872 and six {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=mid}} [[Rodman gun]]s were in place on [[barbette]] (third) tier.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|126}} The total number of large-caliber guns was 243. The guns were never fired.{{sfn|Florida guide|page=205}}\n\nFrequent [[hurricane]]s and yellow fever epidemics convinced the War Department to remove the garrison, leaving a small caretaker force for the armaments and ammunition in 1874. In 1889, the Army turned the fort over to the [[Marine Hospital Service]] to be operated as a [[quarantine]] station. The U.S. Navy used the Key as a [[coaling station]].\n\nNeglected, stripped by vandals, swept by repeated tropical storms that crushed brick and concrete and bent girders, Fort Jefferson deteriorated rapidly. It remained unoccupied until [[Spanish\u2013American War|war with Spain]] broke out in 1898. The American fleet was stationed there. One of the ships to load coal there was the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']] before her fateful trip to Havana.\n\nIn 1902, the property was transferred to the Navy Department, and coal rigs and water distilling plants were built. When these were destroyed by hurricanes in 1906, the fort was again abandoned. Two years later the entire group of islands was set aside as a Federal bird reservation. Until 1934 Garden Key and the crumbling ruins were merely a rendezvous for fishermen and tourists.<ref>{{cite book |title=Florida. A Guide to the Southernmost State |year=1939 |author=Federal Writers' Project |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |ref={{harvid|Florida guide}} |page=206}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[WWI]], the lighthouse was decommissioned, but a wireless station and naval seaplane facility was operational.<ref name=Reid />{{rp|128\u2013129}}\n\n=== Park designation ===\nOn January 4, 1935, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], designated the area as Fort Jefferson [[List of National Monuments of the United States|National Monument]].<ref name=Reid />{{rp|129}} It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 10, 1970.\n\nOn October 26, 1992, the Dry Tortugas, including Fort Jefferson, was established as a [[United States National Park|National Park]].<ref name=Reid />{{rp|129}}\n\n== Accessibility ==\nFort Jefferson can be reached by a daily ferry from [[Key West]], as well as by chartered seaplane and private boat. As a national park, primitive camping is permitted on the beach.

The town was a center of the Hittite kingdom in the [[Iron Age]]. The region was conquered by Sargon in 708 BC and became a province of [[Assyria]]. In 605 BCE, the [[Babylon]]ians took over. Then, respectively, the [[Medes]], the [[Persian Empire|Persian]]s (533 BC). Alexander the great extended the kingdom of Macedonia in 333 BC from which the town was ceded to the domination of the [[Seleucid]]s.\n\nAfter which Samsat became known as \"Antiochia in Commagene\", and was made the walled capital of the [[Commagene]] kingdom, a [[Hellenistic]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] realm, from c. 160 BC until it was surrendered to [[Rome]] in 72. Under Antichus I (69 - 34 BC) the town was a center of caravan routes and [[Emporium (antiquity)|a trading center]]. Located on the upper [[Euphrates River]], it was fortified so as to protect a major crossing point of the river on the east\u2013west trade route.  It also served as a station on another route running from [[Damascus]], [[Palmyra]], and [[Sura (city)|Sura]] up to [[Armenia]] and the [[Black Sea|Euxine Sea]]. King [[Antiochus III of Commagene|Antichos III]] was the last effective ruler,<ref>Chahin, Mark (2001). The Kingdom of Armenia.

[[Safwan bin Muattal]] died and is buried in Samsat.  The [[13th century]] was very hard for the town. [[S\u00fcleyman II|R\u00fcknettin S\u00fcleyman II]] of the Anatolian [[Seljuks]] took the town in 1203, and Samsat was looted in 1237 by the [[Harzem\u015fah Sultanate|Harzem\u015fah]] and was invaded by the Mongol Emperor [[Hulagu Khan|H\u00fclag\u00fc Khan]] in 1240 and later by the [[Dulkadiro\u011fullar\u0131]].\n\nIt was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire by [[Beyaz\u0131t I|Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Beyaz\u0131t]] in 1392 and in 1401 it is destroyed by [[Timur]]. In 1516, Yavuz Sultan Selim retook it for the Ottomans. It lost its old importance in the Ottoman administration and became the center of the sanjak.\n\n===Modern times===\nDuring the republican period, it became smaller and became a center of the parish. In 1960, Samsat was transformed into a district center and connected to the province of Ad\u0131yaman.\n\nThe city of Samsat was evacuated from the old settlement on 05.03.1988 due to the Atat\u00fcrk Dam being left under the lake waters and the center was changed and moved to its present location with the law numbered 3433 dated 21.04.1988. The old town of Samsat and all its history were flooded behind the [[Atat\u00fcrk Dam]] in 1989. The new town was built beside the new waterline by the Turkish government to house the displaced residents.\n\n=== In Christianity ===\nIn the Christian [[martyrology]], seven [[Christianity|Christian]] [[martyr]]s were crucified in 297 in Samosata for refusing to perform a pagan rite in celebration of the victory of [[Maximian]] over the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]]: Abibus, Hipparchus, James, Lollian, Paragnus, Philotheus, and Romanus.\n[[Daniel the Stylite|Saint Daniel the Stylite]] was born in a village near Samosata; [[Rabulas of Samosata|Saint Rabbulas]], venerated on 19 February, who lived in the 6th century at [[Constantinople]], was also a native of Samosata.

The town was a center of the Hittite kingdom in the [[Iron Age]]. The region was conquered by Sargon in 708 BC and became a province of [[Assyria]]. In 605 BCE, the [[Babylon]]ians took over. Then, respectively, the [[Medes]], the [[Persian Empire|Persian]]s (533 BC). Alexander the great extended the kingdom of Macedonia in 333 BC from which the town was ceded to the domination of the [[Seleucid]]s.\n\nAfter which Samsat became known as \"Antiochia in Commagene\", and was made the walled capital of the [[Commagene]] kingdom, a [[Hellenistic]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] realm, from c. 160 BC until it was surrendered to [[Rome]] in 72. Under Antichus I (69 - 34 BC) the town was a center of caravan routes and [[Emporium (antiquity)|a trading center]]. Located on the upper [[Euphrates River]], it was fortified so as to protect a major crossing point of the river on the east\u2013west trade route.  It also served as a station on another route running from [[Damascus]], [[Palmyra]], and [[Sura (city)|Sura]] up to [[Armenia]] and the [[Black Sea|Euxine Sea]]. King [[Antiochus III of Commagene|Antichos III]] was the last effective ruler,<ref>Chahin, Mark (2001). The Kingdom of Armenia.

[[Safwan bin Muattal]] died and is buried in Samsat.  The [[13th century]] was very hard for the town. [[S\u00fcleyman II|R\u00fcknettin S\u00fcleyman II]] of the Anatolian [[Seljuks]] took the town in 1203, and Samsat was looted in 1237 by the [[Harzem\u015fah Sultanate|Harzem\u015fah]] and was invaded by the Mongol Emperor [[Hulagu Khan|H\u00fclag\u00fc Khan]] in 1240 and later by the [[Dulkadiro\u011fullar\u0131]].\n\nIt was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire by [[Beyaz\u0131t I|Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Beyaz\u0131t]] in 1392 and in 1401 it is destroyed by [[Timur]]. In 1516, Yavuz Sultan Selim retook it for the Ottomans. It lost its old importance in the Ottoman administration and became the center of the sanjak.\n\n===Modern times===\nDuring the republican period, it became smaller and became a center of the parish. In 1960, Samsat was transformed into a district center and connected to the province of Ad\u0131yaman.\n\nThe city of Samsat was evacuated from the old settlement on 05.03.1988 due to the Atat\u00fcrk Dam being left under the lake waters and the center was changed and moved to its present location with the law numbered 3433 dated 21.04.1988. The old town of Samsat and all its history were flooded behind the [[Atat\u00fcrk Dam]] in 1989. The new town was built beside the new waterline by the Turkish government to house the displaced residents.\n\n=== In Christianity ===\nIn the Christian [[martyrology]], seven [[Christianity|Christian]] [[martyr]]s were crucified in 297 in Samosata for refusing to perform a pagan rite in celebration of the victory of [[Maximian]] over the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]]: Abibus, Hipparchus, James, Lollian, Paragnus, Philotheus, and Romanus.\n[[Daniel the Stylite|Saint Daniel the Stylite]] was born in a village near Samosata; [[Rabulas of Samosata|Saint Rabbulas]], venerated on 19 February, who lived in the 6th century at [[Constantinople]], was also a native of Samosata.

It is their last studio album recorded with drummer and singer [[Phil Collins]] before his departure in 1996 to pursue solo projects full time. Production began after a four-year period of inactivity from the group, following the commercial success of ''[[Invisible Touch (album)|Invisible Touch]]'' (1986) and [[Invisible Touch Tour|its tour]].\n \n''We Can't Dance'' was a worldwide commercial success for the band. It became the band's fifth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK and reached No. 4 in the U.S., where it sold over 4 million copies. Between 1991 and 1993, six tracks from the album were released as singles, including \"[[No Son of Mine]]\" and \"[[I Can't Dance]]\". The latter received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals#Recipients|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals]] in [[35th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|1993]]. Genesis toured in support of ''We Can't Dance'' in 1992 which saw the band play large stadiums and arenas across North America and Europe.\n\n==Background==\nIn July 1987, the Genesis line-up of drummer and singer [[Phil Collins]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], and bassist and guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] wrapped their 1986\u20131987 world tour in support of their thirteenth studio album, ''[[Invisible Touch]]'' (1986). The 112-date tour, attended by an estimated 3.5 million people, was extremely taxing on the group, particularly for Rutherford following his father's death and almost losing his son Harry due to a difficult birth.<ref name=mcall1992/><ref name=vox1991/> The band then entered a three-and-a-half year period of inactivity, during which each member continued with their respective solo projects. Collins achieved further worldwide commercial success with his following the release of ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989), while Rutherford's band, [[Mike and the Mechanics]], had also begun to have hits.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=208, 210}} Banks and Rutherford expected Collins to leave the band during this time, but he stayed on to record another Genesis studio album with them.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=217}} The band had initially agreed to enter production in 1990, but it was pushed to 1991 because of Collins's lengthy solo tour.<ref name=detroitpress1991/><ref name=cincinnati1991/> The album's title derived partly from the popularity of dance music and its presence in the charts at the time.<ref name=vox1991/><ref name=mcall1992/>\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:The Farm recording studio 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]], where ''We Can't Dance'' was written and recorded]]\nGenesis recorded ''We Can't Dance'' from March to September 1991 at their private recording studio named [[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]] in [[Chiddingfold]], [[Surrey]].<ref name=1991CD/>{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=217}} The trio were keen to work together after such an extensive break, and after two-and-a-half months of what Collins described as \"chopping away, fine-tuning, and honing down all these ideas\", they had completed some fifteen tracks.<ref name=1991presskit>{{cite book|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/we-cant-dance-press-kit/|title=Genesis: We Can't Dance \u2013 Atlantic Press Kit|publisher=Atlantic Records|date=1991|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=mcall1992/> They originally considered releasing a [[double album]], but realised most people would be listening to their work on CD which gave them the additional time they wanted to present more of their musical ideas.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=219}} As with ''[[Genesis (Genesis album)|Genesis]]'' (1983) and ''Invisible Touch'', none of the material on ''We Can't Dance'' was conceived beforehand, and the band instead developed songs through lengthy improvisational jams in the studio. This was a deciding factor for Collins to remain in the band despite his solo success as he enjoyed the task of writing songs with his bandmates from nothing.<ref name=detroitpress1991>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17947277/|title=Genesis: Free to be secure in a group|first=Gary|last=Graff|date=10 November 1991|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|pages=Q1, Q6|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> A typical session would involve Banks and Rutherford playing chords on the keyboard or guitar, respectively, with Collins devising a drum pattern with a [[drum machine]] which allows him to sing notes and dummy lyrics.

Banks later admitted that the band avoided \"any creative work\" with the film crew present because they found it difficult, adding: \"As soon as they were there, we shut off\".<ref name=musician1992/> Collins supported his view and pointed out a change in the atmosphere of working when someone from the filming crew entered the room.<ref name=detroitpress1991/>\n\nIn a departure from their previous albums, Rutherford avoided playing a [[guitar synthesiser]] and only plays a [[Fender Stratocaster]] and two [[Steinberger]]s, one of them a GM series model that was new for the time, but on the song ''Tell Me Why'', he is playing a [[Rickenbacker]] 12-string electric guitar.<ref>https://www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/meaning-tell-genesis/</ref> He had asked the manufacturer to customise one with a larger body to suit his tall frame but they declined, leaving him to use a cardboard cutout of a body he wished for and sending it to luthier [[Roger Giffin]] to make it.<ref name=guitarmag1992/> He played all his guitar parts with a Groove Tubes amplifier that was suggested to him by his roadie and technician Geoff Banks.<ref name=guitarmag1992/>\n\nFor recording, they enlisted then 28-year-old [[Nick Davis (record producer)|Nick Davis]] as co-producer and engineer who had previously worked with Banks and Rutherford on their solo projects, with the band also handing production duties.<ref name=1991CD/><ref name=1991presskit/> This marked the end of their association with [[Hugh Padgham]] which had begun with ''[[Abacab]]'' (1981). Rutherford said the group decided to switch producers before work on the album had begun, and insisted they were pleased with Padgham's contributions, but felt it was the right time for a change after having done three albums with him(Hugh had also produced Collins's four solo albums throughout the 80's).<ref name=guitarmag1992>{{cite magazine|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/guitar-magazine-interviews-mike-rutherford-we-cant-dance-february/|title=Rutherford's Revelations|first=Theresa|last=Fowler|date=February 1992|magazine=The Guitar Magazine|volume=1|issue=10|pages=27, 28, 30|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=vox1991>{{cite magazine|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/interview-genesis-vox-magazine-december/|title=We Can't Dance|magazine=Vox|date=December 1991|pages=12\u2013|first=Martin|last=Townsend|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> Davis was keen to feature Rutherford's guitar more prominently as an instrument than previous Genesis albums, and felt his approach was successful on some of the tracks on ''We Can't Dance''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=220}} Banks took a liking to some of Davis's strong opinions towards certain aspects of recording and instruments which presented him the challenge of finding other ways of recording.<ref name=vox1991/>\n\nFollowing a six-week break during the summer of 1991 the band reconvened and completed the mixing in late September, selecting a final 12-track running order that spanned 71 minutes.<ref name=1991presskit/> Banks said that compared to the more direct nature of ''Invisible Touch'', the style of ''We Can't Dance'' offered more of a sense of mystery with effort put into each track having its own \"individual quality\", yet have an atmosphere that runs through the entire album.<ref name=1991presskit/>\n\n==Songs==\nIn a similar way to the writing of \"Invisible Touch\", the band initially allocated roughly one third of the album to each member who were then responsible for the lyrics to their collection of songs. Banks said having one person work on a set of lyrics was a better way of carrying an idea through.<ref name=1991presskit/> In the end \"We Can't Dance\" saw Collins contribute a greater amount of lyrics than before, his efforts praised by Rutherford who considered his words for its songs among his best in Genesis history. Collins went further and rated his lyrics on \"We Can't Dance\" as some of the best of his career and said, \"Obviously, the music stimulated me\".<ref name=1991presskit/> In a week during which Banks and Rutherford left the studio for promotional work, Collins started to write lyrical ideas; according to Rutherford \"he just couldn't stop himself after that. He found he had dead time on his hands\".<ref name=vox1991/>\n\nSeveral songs deal with more serious and social issues; \"[[No Son of Mine]]\" tackles the subject of the [[domestic abuse]] of a 15-year-old boy which originated with Collins repeating the phrase \"no son of mine\" as a dummy lyric during the writing sessions, rather than a song concerning social commentary.<ref name=vox1991/> \"Dreaming While You Sleep\" concerns a hit-and-run driver and his guilt after failing to stop at the scene of the accident. The former contains a sample of a sound that Rutherford achieved as he was \"messing about bending two notes\" that Banks had recorded from a microphone on his E-mu Emulator which he then sampled and slowed down, creating a noise he compared to an elephant's trumpeting.<ref name=guitarmag1992/><ref name=keyboard1992/> The ten-minute \"Driving The Last Spike\" is about 19th-century Irish [[navvies]] who helped built the railways in the UK, and the poor and unsafe working conditions they had to endure. Collins wrote it after being given a book on the subject by a correspondent who sought to produce a television show about it.<ref name=vox1991/> Banks used a [[Hammond organ]] patch on the track, which referenced his prominent use of the instrument early in Genesis' career. The other long track, \"[[Fading Lights]]\", came out of group improvisation.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=220-221}} \"Since I Lost You\" was written by Collins for his friend [[Eric Clapton]]. On 20 March 1991, Clapton's four-year-old son Conor died after falling from the 53rd-story window of his mother's friend's New York City apartment, landing on the roof of an adjacent four-story building.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=221}} Banks and Rutherford were the only members in the studio that day, and played what music they had written to Collins the following day. Collins said, \"Straight away, I was singing the things you hear on the record\", and wrote a set of lyrics based on the incident, not revealing what they were about to his bandmates until he had finished them.<ref name=cincinnati1991/> Some lines were from a real-life conversation Collins had with Clapton following the incident.<ref name=boston1991/> \"Tell Me Why\" criticises the [[Gulf War]] and the plight of the Kurdish people in its aftermath.

They criticised \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Way of the World\" for being soulless and impersonal social commentaries, but regarded most of the songs as outstanding, and summarised \"Although ''We Can't Dance'' doesn't quite achieve the vulnerable grace of ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' or the exuberance of ''[[Abacab]]'', Genesis has nevertheless delivered an elegantly spare \u2013 and even adventurous \u2013 album.\"<ref name=\"stones\"/> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave a lacklustre review, stating: \"At a time when everything is uncertain&nbsp;... you almost have to admire a record like ''We Can't Dance''.&nbsp;... You know there will be a couple of fleeting moments when the band breaks out of its torpor \u2013 for instance, on the very polite primal stomp of 'I Can't Dance' \u2013 and that such moments will just as quickly be subsumed by the rest of the musical quicksand.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\n[[AllMusic]] also criticised the lyrics of \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Way of the World\", calling them \"paeans for world understanding that sound miles away from any immediacy\". However, they praised the album for returning to a less pop-oriented direction, and especially complimented the grittiness of \"[[No Son of Mine]]\", \"[[Jesus He Knows Me]]\", and \"[[I Can't Dance]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] ranked ''We Can't Dance'' as the 14th best album by Genesis, stating \"Collins' final album with Genesis is full of obnoxious, overproduced pop pap; most of the tracks sound like castoffs from one of his solo albums.

It is their last studio album recorded with drummer and singer [[Phil Collins]] before his departure in 1996 to pursue solo projects full time. Production began after a four-year period of inactivity from the group, following the commercial success of ''[[Invisible Touch (album)|Invisible Touch]]'' (1986) and [[Invisible Touch Tour|its tour]].\n \n''We Can't Dance'' was a worldwide commercial success for the band. It became the band's fifth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK and reached No. 4 in the U.S., where it sold over 4 million copies. Between 1991 and 1993, six tracks from the album were released as singles, including \"[[No Son of Mine]]\" and \"[[I Can't Dance]]\". The latter received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals#Recipients|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals]] in [[35th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|1993]]. Genesis toured in support of ''We Can't Dance'' in 1992 which saw the band play large stadiums and arenas across North America and Europe.\n\n==Background==\nIn July 1987, the Genesis line-up of drummer and singer [[Phil Collins]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], and bassist and guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] wrapped their 1986\u20131987 world tour in support of their thirteenth studio album, ''[[Invisible Touch]]'' (1986). The 112-date tour, attended by an estimated 3.5 million people, was extremely taxing on the group, particularly for Rutherford following his father's death and almost losing his son Harry due to a difficult birth.<ref name=mcall1992/><ref name=vox1991/> The band then entered a three-and-a-half year period of inactivity, during which each member continued with their respective solo projects. Collins achieved further worldwide commercial success with his following the release of ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989), while Rutherford's band, [[Mike and the Mechanics]], had also begun to have hits.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=208, 210}} Banks and Rutherford expected Collins to leave the band during this time, but he stayed on to record another Genesis studio album with them.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=217}} The band had initially agreed to enter production in 1990, but it was pushed to 1991 because of Collins's lengthy solo tour.<ref name=detroitpress1991/><ref name=cincinnati1991/> The album's title derived partly from the popularity of dance music and its presence in the charts at the time.<ref name=vox1991/><ref name=mcall1992/>\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:The Farm recording studio 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]], where ''We Can't Dance'' was written and recorded]]\nGenesis recorded ''We Can't Dance'' from March to September 1991 at their private recording studio named [[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]] in [[Chiddingfold]], [[Surrey]].<ref name=1991CD/>{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=217}} The trio were keen to work together after such an extensive break, and after two-and-a-half months of what Collins described as \"chopping away, fine-tuning, and honing down all these ideas\", they had completed some fifteen tracks.<ref name=1991presskit>{{cite book|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/we-cant-dance-press-kit/|title=Genesis: We Can't Dance \u2013 Atlantic Press Kit|publisher=Atlantic Records|date=1991|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=mcall1992/> They originally considered releasing a [[double album]], but realised most people would be listening to their work on CD which gave them the additional time they wanted to present more of their musical ideas.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=219}} As with ''[[Genesis (Genesis album)|Genesis]]'' (1983) and ''Invisible Touch'', none of the material on ''We Can't Dance'' was conceived beforehand, and the band instead developed songs through lengthy improvisational jams in the studio. This was a deciding factor for Collins to remain in the band despite his solo success as he enjoyed the task of writing songs with his bandmates from nothing.<ref name=detroitpress1991>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17947277/|title=Genesis: Free to be secure in a group|first=Gary|last=Graff|date=10 November 1991|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|pages=Q1, Q6|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> A typical session would involve Banks and Rutherford playing chords on the keyboard or guitar, respectively, with Collins devising a drum pattern with a [[drum machine]] which allows him to sing notes and dummy lyrics.

Banks later admitted that the band avoided \"any creative work\" with the film crew present because they found it difficult, adding: \"As soon as they were there, we shut off\".<ref name=musician1992/> Collins supported his view and pointed out a change in the atmosphere of working when someone from the filming crew entered the room.<ref name=detroitpress1991/>\n\nIn a departure from their previous albums, Rutherford avoided playing a [[guitar synthesiser]] and only plays a [[Fender Stratocaster]] and two [[Steinberger]]s, one of them a GM series model that was new for the time, but on the song ''Tell Me Why'', he is playing a [[Rickenbacker]] 12-string electric guitar.<ref>https://www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/meaning-tell-genesis/</ref> He had asked the manufacturer to customise one with a larger body to suit his tall frame but they declined, leaving him to use a cardboard cutout of a body he wished for and sending it to luthier [[Roger Giffin]] to make it.<ref name=guitarmag1992/> He played all his guitar parts with a Groove Tubes amplifier that was suggested to him by his roadie and technician Geoff Banks.<ref name=guitarmag1992/>\n\nFor recording, they enlisted then 28-year-old [[Nick Davis (record producer)|Nick Davis]] as co-producer and engineer who had previously worked with Banks and Rutherford on their solo projects, with the band also handing production duties.<ref name=1991CD/><ref name=1991presskit/> This marked the end of their association with [[Hugh Padgham]] which had begun with ''[[Abacab]]'' (1981). Rutherford said the group decided to switch producers before work on the album had begun, and insisted they were pleased with Padgham's contributions, but felt it was the right time for a change after having done three albums with him(Hugh had also produced Collins's four solo albums throughout the 80's).<ref name=guitarmag1992>{{cite magazine|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/guitar-magazine-interviews-mike-rutherford-we-cant-dance-february/|title=Rutherford's Revelations|first=Theresa|last=Fowler|date=February 1992|magazine=The Guitar Magazine|volume=1|issue=10|pages=27, 28, 30|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=vox1991>{{cite magazine|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/interview-genesis-vox-magazine-december/|title=We Can't Dance|magazine=Vox|date=December 1991|pages=12\u2013|first=Martin|last=Townsend|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> Davis was keen to feature Rutherford's guitar more prominently as an instrument than previous Genesis albums, and felt his approach was successful on some of the tracks on ''We Can't Dance''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=220}} Banks took a liking to some of Davis's strong opinions towards certain aspects of recording and instruments which presented him the challenge of finding other ways of recording.<ref name=vox1991/>\n\nFollowing a six-week break during the summer of 1991 the band reconvened and completed the mixing in late September, selecting a final 12-track running order that spanned 71 minutes.<ref name=1991presskit/> Banks said that compared to the more direct nature of ''Invisible Touch'', the style of ''We Can't Dance'' offered more of a sense of mystery with effort put into each track having its own \"individual quality\", yet have an atmosphere that runs through the entire album.<ref name=1991presskit/>\n\n==Songs==\nIn a similar way to the writing of \"Invisible Touch\", the band initially allocated roughly one third of the album to each member who were then responsible for the lyrics to their collection of songs. Banks said having one person work on a set of lyrics was a better way of carrying an idea through.<ref name=1991presskit/> In the end \"We Can't Dance\" saw Collins contribute a greater amount of lyrics than before, his efforts praised by Rutherford who considered his words for its songs among his best in Genesis history. Collins went further and rated his lyrics on \"We Can't Dance\" as some of the best of his career and said, \"Obviously, the music stimulated me\".<ref name=1991presskit/> In a week during which Banks and Rutherford left the studio for promotional work, Collins started to write lyrical ideas; according to Rutherford \"he just couldn't stop himself after that. He found he had dead time on his hands\".<ref name=vox1991/>\n\nSeveral songs deal with more serious and social issues; \"[[No Son of Mine]]\" tackles the subject of the [[domestic abuse]] of a 15-year-old boy which originated with Collins repeating the phrase \"no son of mine\" as a dummy lyric during the writing sessions, rather than a song concerning social commentary.<ref name=vox1991/> \"Dreaming While You Sleep\" concerns a hit-and-run driver and his guilt after failing to stop at the scene of the accident. The former contains a sample of a sound that Rutherford achieved as he was \"messing about bending two notes\" that Banks had recorded from a microphone on his E-mu Emulator which he then sampled and slowed down, creating a noise he compared to an elephant's trumpeting.<ref name=guitarmag1992/><ref name=keyboard1992/> The ten-minute \"Driving The Last Spike\" is about 19th-century Irish [[navvies]] who helped built the railways in the UK, and the poor and unsafe working conditions they had to endure. Collins wrote it after being given a book on the subject by a correspondent who sought to produce a television show about it.<ref name=vox1991/> Banks used a [[Hammond organ]] patch on the track, which referenced his prominent use of the instrument early in Genesis' career. The other long track, \"[[Fading Lights]]\", came out of group improvisation.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=220-221}} \"Since I Lost You\" was written by Collins for his friend [[Eric Clapton]]. On 20 March 1991, Clapton's four-year-old son Conor died after falling from the 53rd-story window of his mother's friend's New York City apartment, landing on the roof of an adjacent four-story building.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=221}} Banks and Rutherford were the only members in the studio that day, and played what music they had written to Collins the following day. Collins said, \"Straight away, I was singing the things you hear on the record\", and wrote a set of lyrics based on the incident, not revealing what they were about to his bandmates until he had finished them.<ref name=cincinnati1991/> Some lines were from a real-life conversation Collins had with Clapton following the incident.<ref name=boston1991/> \"Tell Me Why\" criticises the [[Gulf War]] and the plight of the Kurdish people in its aftermath. Collins got the idea from a television news report while he was having dinner with his wife and daughter. \"So I just mixed my feelings with previous thoughts about Bangladesh and Ethiopia\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=221}}<ref name=boston1991>{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7685241.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311201855/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7685241.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 March 2018|title=Latest Genesis reunion proves that democracy does work|first=Steve|last=Morse|date=10 November 1991|newspaper=The Boston Globe|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-access=subscription |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe serious material was balanced by shorter and lighter songs. \"[[I Can't Dance]]\" was a criticism of models who appeared in jeans adverts then popular at the time, and built around a heavy Rutherford guitar riff.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=221-222}} Banks noted his electric piano part was one of the most minimal riffs he has played on record and had thought of a style heard on the 1968 song \"[[Feelin' Alright?]]\" by [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]].<ref name=keyboard1992/> \"[[Jesus He Knows Me]]\" was a barbed parody of the [[televangelist]] movement in the US, which the band members had seen while touring the country.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=221-222}} \"Living Forever\" deals with a cynical view of society's obsession with modern diets and lifestyles.<ref name=1991presskit/> Its original working title was \"Hip-Hop Brushes\" after Collins acquired new drum disks for his [[E-mu SP-1200]] drum machine and devised a hip-hop oriented drum pattern using its brush sound, as he recalled, in around ten minutes which the group then played from and developed the song from it.<ref name=keyboard1992/>\n\nTwo songs, \"On the Shoreline\" and \"Hearts on Fire\", were cut from the album due to time constraints, and instead, both songs were released as B-sides for the singles \"I Can't Dance\" and \"Jesus He Knows Me\" respectively, as well as appearing in the ''[[Genesis Archive 2: 1976\u20131992]]'' box set.\n\nAmong the keyboards Banks plays on the album are the [[Korg 01/W]] Music Workstation, [[Korg Wavestation]], [[Ensoniq VFX]], [[Roland JD-800]], Roland Rhodes VK-1000, and [[E-mu Emulator III]]; the latter enabled Banks to create samples in stereo.<ref name=keyboard1992>{{cite magazine|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/keyboard-magazine-february-1992-genesis-feature/|title=Genesis: We Can't Dance|first=Robert L.|last=Doerschuk|date=February 1992|issue=62|pages=82\u201394|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''We Can't Dance'' was released on 28 October 1991 by [[Atlantic Records]] in the United States<ref name=RIAA>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Genesis&ti=We+Can%27t+Dance#search_section|title=American album certifications \u2013 Genesis \u2013 We Can't Dance|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> and 11 November 1991 on [[Virgin Records]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name=BPI>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards/search.aspx|title=British album certifications \u2013 Genesis \u2013 We Can't Dance|publisher=British Phonographic Industry|accessdate=15 September 2016}} Enter \"We Can't Dance\" in the field 'Keywords'.

They criticised \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Way of the World\" for being soulless and impersonal social commentaries, but regarded most of the songs as outstanding, and summarised \"Although ''We Can't Dance'' doesn't quite achieve the vulnerable grace of ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' or the exuberance of ''[[Abacab]]'', Genesis has nevertheless delivered an elegantly spare \u2013 and even adventurous \u2013 album.\"<ref name=\"stones\"/> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave a lacklustre review, stating: \"At a time when everything is uncertain&nbsp;... you almost have to admire a record like ''We Can't Dance''.&nbsp;... You know there will be a couple of fleeting moments when the band breaks out of its torpor \u2013 for instance, on the very polite primal stomp of 'I Can't Dance' \u2013 and that such moments will just as quickly be subsumed by the rest of the musical quicksand.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\n[[AllMusic]] also criticised the lyrics of \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Way of the World\", calling them \"paeans for world understanding that sound miles away from any immediacy\".

The album followed a period of inactivity for the band in early 1979. [[Phil Collins]] moved to [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, in an effort to salvage his failing first marriage, while [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] and [[Mike Rutherford]] recorded solo albums. Collins returned to the UK after his marriage ended and wrote a significant amount of material, some of which was used for ''Duke'' and some was later reworked for his first solo album, ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]''. ''Duke'' contained a mix of individually-written songs and tracks that evolved from [[jam session]]s in mid-1979, while recording took place at the end of the year. The break in activity rejuvenated the band, and they found the album an easy one to work on.\n\n''Duke'' was positively received by music critics, who praised the album for bridging the band's [[progressive rock]]-oriented past, via experimental pieces such as the closing ten-minute \"Duke's Travels\"/\"Duke's End\" [[suite (music)|suite]], with their more [[new wave]] and [[pop rock]]-oriented, commercially accessible direction, as displayed on the hit singles \"[[Turn It On Again]]\", \"[[Duchess (Genesis song)|Duchess]]\", and \"[[Misunderstanding (Genesis song)|Misunderstanding]]\". It was the first album by the group to reach No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts and has since been certified Platinum in both the UK and U.S.\n\n==Background==\nBy 1978, Genesis were a trio of lead singer and drummer [[Phil Collins]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] and guitarist/bassist [[Mike Rutherford]]. They had survived the departure of original frontman [[Peter Gabriel]] and guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] and released the album ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'', which included the top ten single \"[[Follow You Follow Me]]\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=148}} The group were still touring successfully, and enjoyed the songwriting collaborations between the three of them. They decided to take a break before writing and recording a new album, which would be largely group-written in a rehearsal room, without many pre-conceived ideas.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nThe group's touring schedule had put particular pressure on Collins, whose marriage was at risk of collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned him that if he committed himself to the full [[...And Then There Were Three... Tour]], she would not be there when he returned.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=151}} Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis were on the verge of an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=154}} By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realizing that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager [[Tony Smith (manager)|Tony Smith]]. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=155}} In an interview for ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', Collins said, \"I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently.\"<ref name=sounds1979/> He also noted that the individual members of his side project [[Brand X]] were geographically dispersed.<ref name=sounds1979>{{Cite journal|title=The return of...

With time to spare before working on the next Genesis album, he gigged with Brand X, and began work on demo tracks for what became his first solo album ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' at his home in [[Shalford, Surrey|Shalford]], [[Surrey]]. As well as playing [[piano]] and [[synthesizers]], he had recently picked up a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] drum machine and become interested in the possibilities of electronic drums.<ref name=sounds1979/>{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=160}}{{efn|Collins later said he had approached [[Pete Townshend]], asking if he could replace [[Keith Moon]], who had died a few months earlier, in [[the Who]], but the group had already recruited [[Kenney Jones]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=160}}}}\n\n==Writing and recording==\n[[File:David Hentschel at Scott Frankfurt Studio, Woodland Hills, CA.jpg|thumb|upright|''Duke'' was the last Genesis album to be co-produced by [[David Hentschel]].]]\nIn autumn 1979, Banks and Rutherford moved in with Collins in Shalford to start rehearsals on ''Duke''. Collins had written a large number of songs, but he felt many of them would not suit Genesis, while Banks and Rutherford were short of material having just recorded their solo albums.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=162}} The three decided each member should contribute two of their own songs for the band to work on. Banks put forward \"Heathaze\" and \"Cul-de-Sac\", Rutherford used \"Man of Our Times\" and \"Alone Tonight\", and Collins had \"[[Misunderstanding (Genesis song)|Misunderstanding]]\" and \"Please Don't Ask\". The remainder of the songs were written together in rehearsals.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=162\u2013163}} Banks later regretted not choosing Collins' \"[[In the Air Tonight]]\" for the album.{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=94}} His track \"Cul-de-Sac\" became a problem for Collins to get into as its overall style and lyrical content no longer interested him, and realised that he should have kept the song for his solo output.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/genesis-information-19/|publisher=Genesis Information \u2013 Issue 19|date=April 1981|title=Phil on Genesis|page=2|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe group found the writing process easier and more enjoyable than ''...And Then There Were Three...'', which was primarily songs written in advance individually by the members. Rutherford summarised his time writing songs for ''Duke'' as \"getting back to the basic stage of ideas being worked on jointly\".<ref name=sounds1979/> Banks reasoned much of the band's refreshed attitude was \"down to not having worked together in a while\" which resulted in \"good ideas\" being put forward, something that he said had not \"happened for some time.\"<ref name=sounds1979/> Collins felt the band interacted \"as a group much better ... there's definitely a side to us coming out which wasn't on the last album; the playing side\".<ref name=sounds1979/> Rutherford would later describe the writing process for the album, alongside the one for ''[[Abacab]]'', as a \"rethink\" of Genesis' approach, refocusing their output to group writing and improvisation.<ref>{{cite episode|last1=Fischer|first1=Mark (host)|last2=Rutherford|first2=Mike|last3=Collins|first3=Phil|date=September 2006|orig-year=3 September 2001|title=\"Duke/Abacab\" 25th Anniversary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_Xs1dhJp8o|series=[[In the Studio with Redbeard]]|number=689|publisher=Beardedfisch|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> In contrast to earlier Genesis albums, most tracks were short with the exception of the ten-minute \"Duke's Travels\"/\"Duke's End\" suite that closed the album.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=164}}\n\n\"Behind the Lines\" was the first song arranged for the album and \"[[Duchess (Genesis song)|Duchess]]\" came about from rhythms that Collins had played on his set of drum pads.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/genesis-look-at-themselves-trouser-press-march/ |magazine=Trouser Press |date=March 1982 |first=Jon |last=Young |title=The Genesis Autodiscography|volume=71 |pages=16\u201321 |accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref> In its original form, \"Behind the Lines\", \"Duchess\", \"Guide Vocal\", \"[[Turn It On Again]]\", \"Duke's Travels\", and \"Duke's End\" were one 30-minute track that told a story of a fictional character named Albert which had a working title of \"Duke\".

(band)|Genesis]], released in March 1980 on [[Charisma Records]]. The album followed a period of inactivity for the band in early 1979. [[Phil Collins]] moved to [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, in an effort to salvage his failing first marriage, while [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] and [[Mike Rutherford]] recorded solo albums. Collins returned to the UK after his marriage ended and wrote a significant amount of material, some of which was used for ''Duke'' and some was later reworked for his first solo album, ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]''. ''Duke'' contained a mix of individually-written songs and tracks that evolved from [[jam session]]s in mid-1979, while recording took place at the end of the year. The break in activity rejuvenated the band, and they found the album an easy one to work on.\n\n''Duke'' was positively received by music critics, who praised the album for bridging the band's [[progressive rock]]-oriented past, via experimental pieces such as the closing ten-minute \"Duke's Travels\"/\"Duke's End\" [[suite (music)|suite]], with their more [[pop rock]]-oriented, commercially accessible direction, as displayed on the hit singles \"[[Turn It On Again]]\", \"[[Duchess (Genesis song)|Duchess]]\", and \"[[Misunderstanding (Genesis song)|Misunderstanding]]\". It was the first album by the group to reach No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts and has since been certified Platinum in both the UK and U.S.\n\n==Background==\nBy 1978, Genesis were a trio of lead singer and drummer [[Phil Collins]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] and guitarist/bassist [[Mike Rutherford]]. They had survived the departure of original frontman [[Peter Gabriel]] and guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] and released the album ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'', which included the top ten single \"[[Follow You Follow Me]]\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=148}} The group were still touring successfully, and enjoyed the songwriting collaborations between the three of them. They decided to take a break before writing and recording a new album, which would be largely group-written in a rehearsal room, without many pre-conceived ideas.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nThe group's touring schedule had put particular pressure on Collins, whose marriage was at risk of collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned him that if he committed himself to the full [[...And Then There Were Three... Tour]], she would not be there when he returned.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=151}} Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis were on the verge of an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=154}} By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realizing that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager [[Tony Smith (manager)|Tony Smith]]. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=155}} In an interview for ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', Collins said, \"I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently.\"<ref name=sounds1979/> He also noted that the individual members of his side project [[Brand X]] were geographically dispersed.<ref name=sounds1979>{{Cite journal|title=The return of...

With time to spare before working on the next Genesis album, he gigged with Brand X, and began work on demo tracks for what became his first solo album ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' at his home in [[Shalford, Surrey|Shalford]], [[Surrey]]. As well as playing [[piano]] and [[synthesizers]], he had recently picked up a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] drum machine and become interested in the possibilities of electronic drums.<ref name=sounds1979/>{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=160}}{{efn|Collins later said he had approached [[Pete Townshend]], asking if he could replace [[Keith Moon]], who had died a few months earlier, in [[the Who]], but the group had already recruited [[Kenney Jones]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=160}}}}\n\n==Writing and recording==\n[[File:David Hentschel at Scott Frankfurt Studio, Woodland Hills, CA.jpg|thumb|upright|''Duke'' was the last Genesis album to be co-produced by [[David Hentschel]].]]\nIn autumn 1979, Banks and Rutherford moved in with Collins in Shalford to start rehearsals on ''Duke''. Collins had written a large number of songs, but he felt many of them would not suit Genesis, while Banks and Rutherford were short of material having just recorded their solo albums.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=162}} The three decided each member should contribute two of their own songs for the band to work on. Banks put forward \"Heathaze\" and \"Cul-de-Sac\", Rutherford used \"Man of Our Times\" and \"Alone Tonight\", and Collins had \"[[Misunderstanding (Genesis song)|Misunderstanding]]\" and \"Please Don't Ask\". The remainder of the songs were written together in rehearsals.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=162\u2013163}} Banks later regretted not choosing Collins' \"[[In the Air Tonight]]\" for the album.{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=94}} His track \"Cul-de-Sac\" became a problem for Collins to get into as its overall style and lyrical content no longer interested him, and realised that he should have kept the song for his solo output.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/genesis-information-19/|publisher=Genesis Information \u2013 Issue 19|date=April 1981|title=Phil on Genesis|page=2|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe group found the writing process easier and more enjoyable than ''...And Then There Were Three...'', which was primarily songs written in advance individually by the members. Rutherford summarised his time writing songs for ''Duke'' as \"getting back to the basic stage of ideas being worked on jointly\".<ref name=sounds1979/> Banks reasoned much of the band's refreshed attitude was \"down to not having worked together in a while\" which resulted in \"good ideas\" being put forward, something that he said had not \"happened for some time.\"<ref name=sounds1979/> Collins felt the band interacted \"as a group much better ... there's definitely a side to us coming out which wasn't on the last album; the playing side\".<ref name=sounds1979/> Rutherford would later describe the writing process for the album, alongside the one for ''[[Abacab]]'', as a \"rethink\" of Genesis' approach, refocusing their output to group writing and improvisation.<ref>{{cite episode|last1=Fischer|first1=Mark (host)|last2=Rutherford|first2=Mike|last3=Collins|first3=Phil|date=September 2006|orig-year=3 September 2001|title=\"Duke/Abacab\" 25th Anniversary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_Xs1dhJp8o|series=[[In the Studio with Redbeard]]|number=689|publisher=Beardedfisch|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> In contrast to earlier Genesis albums, most tracks were short with the exception of the ten-minute \"Duke's Travels\"/\"Duke's End\" suite that closed the album.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=164}}\n\n\"Behind the Lines\" was the first song arranged for the album and \"[[Duchess (Genesis song)|Duchess]]\" came about from rhythms that Collins had played on his set of drum pads.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/genesis-look-at-themselves-trouser-press-march/ |magazine=Trouser Press |date=March 1982 |first=Jon |last=Young |title=The Genesis Autodiscography|volume=71 |pages=16\u201321 |accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref> In its original form, \"Behind the Lines\", \"Duchess\", \"Guide Vocal\", \"[[Turn It On Again]]\", \"Duke's Travels\", and \"Duke's End\" were one 30-minute track that told a story of a fictional character named Albert which had a working title of \"Duke\".

Indoors, there is a drain in the floor. Most showers have temperature, spray pressure and adjustable showerhead nozzle. The simplest showers have a swivelling nozzle aiming down on the user, while more complex showers have a showerhead connected to a hose that has a mounting bracket. This allows the showerer to hold the showerhead by hand to spray the water at different parts of their body. A shower can be installed in a small shower stall or bathtub with a plastic shower curtain or door. Showering is common in [[Western culture]] due to the efficiency of using it compared with a [[bathtub]]. Its use in [[hygiene]] is, therefore, common practice.{{sfn|Shove|2004|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2010}} A shower uses less water on average than a bath: {{convert|80|l}} for a shower compared with {{convert|150|l}} for a bath.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gillespie|first1=Ed|title=Let's talk dirty\u2026how long do you spend in the shower?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2009/sep/04/power-shower-blog|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=4 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe original showers were neither indoor structures nor man-made but were common natural formations: [[waterfall]]s.<ref name=\"stand-upbath\">{{cite web|title=The Stand-Up Bath|url=http://theplumber.com/standup.html|publisher=theplumber.com|accessdate=5 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130180409/http://theplumber.com/standup.html|archivedate=30 November 2010}}</ref> The falling water rinsed the bathers completely clean and was more efficient than bathing in a traditional basin, which required manual transport of both fresh and waste water. Ancient people began to reproduce these natural phenomena by pouring [[jug (container)|jugs of water]], often very cold, over themselves after washing. There has been evidence of early upper class [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Mesopotamia]]ns having indoor shower rooms where servants would bathe them in the privacy of their own homes.{{sfn|James|Thorpe|1995|p=460}} However, these were rudimentary by modern standards, having rudimentary drainage systems and water was carried, not pumped, into the room. The [[ancient Greeks]] were the first people to have showers. Their [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] and [[sewage system]]s made of lead pipes allowed water to be pumped both into and out of large [[communal shower]] rooms used by elites and common citizens alike.{{sfn|Humphrey|Olsen|Sherwood|1998|p=280}} These rooms have been discovered at the site of the city [[Pergamum]] and can also be found represented in pottery of the era. The depictions are very similar to modern locker room showers, and even included bars to hang up clothing.{{sfn|James|Thorpe|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2010}} The ancient Romans also followed this convention; their famous [[bathhouse]]s ([[Thermae]]) can be found all around the Mediterranean and as far out as modern-day England. The Romans not only had these showers but also believed in bathing multiple times a week, if not every day. The water and sewage systems developed by the Greeks and Romans broke down and fell out of use after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n===Modern showers===\nThe first mechanical shower, operated by a hand pump, was patented in England in 1767 by William Feetham,{{cn|date=August 2019}} a [[stove]] maker from [[Ludgate Hill]] in London. His shower contraption used a pump to force the water into a vessel above the user's head and a chain would then be pulled to release the water from the vessel. Although the system dispensed with the servant labour of filling up and pouring out buckets of water, the showers failed to catch on with the rich as a method for piping hot water through the system was not available. The system would also recycle the same dirty water through every cycle.\n\nThis early start was greatly improved in the anonymously invented [[Regency era|English Regency]] shower design of circa 1810 (there is some ambiguity among the sources).<ref name=\"stand-upbath\"/> The original design was over {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} tall, and was made of several metal pipes painted to look like [[bamboo]]. A basin suspended above the pipes fed water into a [[nozzle]] that distributed the water over the user's shoulders. The water on the ground was drained and pumped back through the pipes into the basin, where the cycle would repeat itself.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The original prototype was steadily improved upon in the following decades until it began to approximate the shower of today in its mode of operation. Hand-pumped models became fashionable at one point as well as the use of adjustable sprayers for different water flow.

The water was heated by a steam engine and in less than five minutes, up to eight prisoners could wash simultaneously with only twenty liters of water. The French system of communal showers was adopted by other armies, the first being that of Prussia in 1879, and by prisons in other jurisdictions. They were also adopted by boarding schools, before being installed in public bathhouses. The first shower in a public bathhouse was in 1887 in [[Vienna]], Austria. In France, public bathhouses and showers were established by Charles Cazalet, firstly in [[Bordeaux]] in 1893 and then in [[Paris]] in 1899.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.chu-rouen.fr/NR/rdonlyres/A49A08FD-BA50-4B11-AA92-ECE9492BC247/0/2000_feltgen.pdf |title=Dr. Merry Delabost, inventor of the shower? |first=Dr. |last=Feltgen |date=8 November 2000 |publisher=Hopitaux de Rouen |accessdate=30 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112085519/http://www3.chu-rouen.fr/NR/rdonlyres/A49A08FD-BA50-4B11-AA92-ECE9492BC247/0/2000_feltgen.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Domestic===\nDomestic showers are most commonly stall showers or showers over a bathtub. A stall shower is a dedicated shower area which uses a door or curtain to contain water spray. The shower over a bathtub saves bathroom space and enables the area to be used for either a bath or a shower and commonly uses a sliding shower curtain to contain the water spray. Showers may also be in a wet room, in which there is no contained shower area, or in a dedicated shower room, which does not require containment of water spray.  Most domestic showers have a single overhead shower head, which may be adjustable.\n\n===Public===\nMany modern athletic and aquatic facilities provide showers for use by patrons, commonly in [[sex segregation|gender segregated]] [[changing room]]s. These can be in the form of individual stalls shielded by curtains or a door or communal shower rooms. The latter are generally large open rooms with any number of shower heads installed either directly into the walls or on posts throughout the shower area.

Advances in science and medicine in the 19th century began to realize the benefit of regular bathing to an individual's health. As a result, most modern cultures encourage a daily personal hygiene regimen. Showering has also developed the reputation as a relaxing and generally therapeutic activity.{{sfn|Shove|2004|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n==Structure and design==\n[[File:Repairing shower stall with grout applicator.jpg|thumb|Repairing damaged tile in a shower stall with a [[caulking gun]]]]\nDesigns for shower facilities vary by location and purpose. There are free-standing showers, but also showers which are integrated into a bathtub. Showers are separated from the surrounding area through watertight curtains ([[#Shower curtain|shower curtain]]), [[sliding door]]s, or [[folding door]]s, or [[shower blinds]], in order to protect the space from spraying water. Showers with a level entry [[#Wet room|wet room]] are becoming very popular, especially due to improvements in waterproofing systems and prefabricated components. Places such as a [[swimming pool]], a [[locker room]], or a military facility have multiple showers. There may be communal shower rooms without divisions, or shower stalls (typically open at the top). Many types of showers are available, including complete shower units which are all encompassing showers that include the pan, walls, and often the shower head, as well as pieced together units in which the pan, shower head, and doors are purchased separately. Each type of shower poses different installation issues.\n\n===Installation===\nThough the installation requirements of each of shower will differ, the installation of a shower in general requires the laying of several [[Plumbing|water transportation pipes]], including a pipe for hot water and for cold water, and a drainage pipe. It is important that the wet areas of a bathroom be waterproof, and multiple layers of waterproofing can be employed.  [[Grout]] is used to fill gaps between tiles, but grout and tile setting materials are generally porous. Tiles are generally waterproof, though a shower pan must be installed beneath them as a safety to prevent water leakage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curbless Showers - An Installation Guide|url=https://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/pubs_p/docs/Curbless.pdf|publisher=NC State University|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> Thus small mosaic tiles offer less of a defense than large format tiles. Sub-tile waterproofing is important when tiles are being used. Best practice requires a waterproofing material to cover the walls and floor of the shower area that are then covered with tile, or in some countries with a sheet material like vinyl.\n\n===Drainage===\n[[File:Shower Repair.jpg|thumb|Shower repair showing drain piping with trap]]\n[[File:Shower project new diverter valve with connector about to be added.jpg|thumb|This diverter valve about to be installed behind a shower mixes hot and cold water.]]\nSome shower areas utilize a second emergency drain outside of the shower in case of overflow. In Australia and some European countries, plumbing codes require this second emergency drain (but not in the United Kingdom nor North America). {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Shower head===\n[[File:Showerhead.JPG|thumb|A shower head.]]\n\nA shower head is a perforated [[nozzle]] that distributes water over [[solid angle]] a focal point of use, generally overhead the bather. A shower uses less water than a full immersion in a [[bathtub|bath]]. Some shower heads can be adjusted to spray different patterns of water, such as massage, gentle spray, strong spray, and intermittent pulse or combination modes. [[Hard water]] may result in [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] deposits clogging the head, reducing the flow and changing the spray pattern. For [[descaling]], various acidic chemicals or brushes can be used or some heads have rubber-like jets that can be manually descaled. A homemade remedy is to immerse it in a solution of water and vinegar for a while, since the vinegar is able to dissolve limescale. Some governments around the world set standards for [[water usage]] and regulate shower heads. For example, in the [[United States]], residential and most commercial shower heads must flow no more than 9.5 liters per minute (2.5 gallons per minute) per the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] ruling 10 CFR 430. Low-flow shower heads, less than or equal 7.6 liters per minute (2.0 gallons per minute), can use water more efficiently by [[aerating]] the water stream, altering nozzles through advanced flow principles or by high-speed [[oscillation]] of the spray stream. USEPA administers a voluntary water saving program, [[WaterSense]], which can certify low-flow shower heads.\n\n===Shower and bathtub curtains===\n{{Redirect|Shower curtain|the physical phenomenon|shower-curtain effect}}\n[[File:BernheimerHouseTub.jpg|thumb|Bathtub curtain]]\n[[File:A typical American bathroom.jpg|thumb|Shower curtain]]\n\n[[Curtain]]s can be used in shower or bathtub enclosures with two main purposes: to provide privacy and to prevent water from flooding or spraying outside the shower or bathtub area. Shower and bathtub curtains usually surround the bath inside the tub or shower area and are held up with [[wikt:railing|railing]]s or [[curtain rod]]s high on the wall or ceiling. To accommodate the different types of bathtub shapes, railings can come in different sizes and are flexible in their design. \n\nSome people use two shower curtains: one that is inside the tub, which is mainly functional or decorative as well, and an outer shower curtain, which is purely decorative. The bottom portion of the inner curtain often comes with magnetic discs or suction cups which adhere to the bathtub itself.\n\nThese curtains are usually made from [[wikt:vinyl|vinyl]], cloth or plastic.\n\n===Shower and bathtub doors===\n[[File:Raisable shower door.JPG|thumb|225px|[[Up-N-Away (down-sliding shower door)|Raisable shower door.]]]]\n[[File:The Lygon Arms, bathroom.jpg|thumb|Bathtub door.]]\nShower or bathtub doors are [[door]]s (also called screens) used in [[bathroom]]s that help keep water inside a shower or bathtub and are alternatives to shower curtains. They are available in many different styles such as framed or frameless, sliding or swing. They are usually constructed of aluminium, clear glass, plexi-glass or [[tempered glass]]. Shower doors can come in many different hardware finishes and glass patterns that can match other bathroom hardware such as faucets and shower heads. There are also shower doors that are in a neo angle design for use on shower pans that have the neo design as well. The design of the shower pan is extremely important as the shower door must be the type required for the pan in order to work. A shower door requires plastic lining along the edges of the door to protect against water [[leaking]] out.\n\n==Equipment==\n* [[Pressure balanced valve]], a device to provide constant shower water pressure and prevent temperature fluctuations\n* [[Shower cap]], a cap worn while showering or bathing, to protect hair from becoming wet\n* [[Shower radio]], a radio that is waterproofed to allow it to be used in a bathroom or other wet environment\n* [[Sunshower (commercial product)|Sunshower]], a device to locally heat shower water with solar power\n* [[Soap]]\n* [[Shampoo]]\n* [[Washing mitt]], a tool for applying soap to the body\n* [[Water heat recycling]] units to reclaim much of the waste water's heat and recycle it to the shower head and minimize heat lost to the drain\n* Shower Caddy, a storage system inside the shower, typically for shampoo and conditioner\n*[[Shower speaker]], a little Bluetooth speaker designed to listen to music while showering\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bathing]]\n* [[Bathroom]]\n* [[Bathtub]]\n* [[Navy shower]]\n* [[Solar water heating|Solar heated shower]]\n* [[Steam shower]]\n* [[Transfer bench]]\n* [[Water recycling shower]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Refbegin}}\n;Books\n*{{Cite book\n |last=Brauer |first=Roger L B |year=2006\n |title=Safety and health for engineers |chapter=Personal protective equipment\n |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-471-29189-3 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n |last1=Humphrey |first1=John W |last2=Olsen |first2=John P |last3=Sherwood |first3=Andrew N |year=1998\n |title=Greek and Roman Technology: A Sourcebook\n |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-06136-0 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=James |first1=Peter |last2=Thorpe |first2=Nick |year=1995 |title=Ancient Inventions |location=New York |publisher=Ballantine |isbn=978-0-345-40102-1 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ancientinvention00jame }}\n*{{Cite book\n |last=Mayer |first=Leonard |year=1995\n |title=Design and planning of research and clinical laboratory facilities |chapter=Emergency systems\n |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-30623-8 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite encyclopedia\n |editor=Oxford University Press |year=2009\n |encyclopedia=Oxford New Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus\n |publisher=Berkley |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-425-22862-3 |ref={{harvid|OUP|2009}}\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n |last=Shove |first=Elizabeth |year=2004\n |title=Comfort, Cleanliness and Convenience The Social Organization of Normality (New Technologies/New Cultures)\n |location=New York |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-1-85973-630-2 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Vincoli |first=Jeffrey W |year=2000 |title=Lewis' dictionary of occupational and environmental safety and health |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-56670-399-4 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lewisdictionaryo00jeff }}\n;Web pages\n*{{Cite web\n |last=Jones |first=Jerry |date=29 October 2004\n |title=Decontamination shower system revamped |work=Reporter\n |url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/reporter/index.html?ID=3590\n |location=Nashville, TN |publisher=Vanderbilt University Medical Center |accessdate=5 December 2010 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite web\n |last=Mullick |first=Abir |year=2005\n |title=Bathing for Older people with Disabilities\n |url=http://www.ap.buffalo.edu/idea/Publications/Bathing%20for%20Older%20People.htm\n |publisher=UB School of Architecture and Planning |accessdate=5 December 2010 |ref=harv\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Bathing]]\n[[Category:Bathrooms]]\n[[Category:Greek inventions]]\n[[Category:Hygiene]]\n[[Category:Plumbing]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{short description|place in which a person bathes under a spray of water}}\n{{Other uses}}{{Redirect|Showering|the English brewer|Francis Showering}}\n[[File:Dusche-cut-w025-h025.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A typical stall shower with height-adjustable [[nozzle]] and [[Folding screen|folding doors]]]]\n[[File:Badewanne fcm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A combination shower and bathtub, with movable screen]]\nA '''shower''' is a place in which a person [[bathing|bathes]] under a [[spray (liquid drop)|spray]] of typically warm or hot water. Indoors, there is a drain in the floor. Most showers have temperature, spray pressure and adjustable showerhead nozzle. The simplest showers have a swivelling nozzle aiming down on the user, while more complex showers have a showerhead connected to a hose that has a mounting bracket. This allows the showerer to hold the showerhead by hand to spray the water at different parts of their body. A shower can be installed in a small shower stall or bathtub with a plastic shower curtain or door. Showering is common in [[Western culture]] due to the efficiency of using it compared with a [[bathtub]]. Its use in [[hygiene]] is, therefore, common practice.{{sfn|Shove|2004|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2010}} A shower uses less water on average than a bath: {{convert|80|l}} for a shower compared with {{convert|150|l}} for a bath.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gillespie|first1=Ed|title=Let's talk dirty\u2026how long do you spend in the shower?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2009/sep/04/power-shower-blog|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=4 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe original showers were neither indoor structures nor man-made but were common natural formations: [[waterfall]]s.<ref name=\"stand-upbath\">{{cite web|title=The Stand-Up Bath|url=http://theplumber.com/standup.html|publisher=theplumber.com|accessdate=5 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130180409/http://theplumber.com/standup.html|archivedate=30 November 2010}}</ref> The falling water rinsed the bathers completely clean and was more efficient than bathing in a traditional basin, which required manual transport of both fresh and waste water. Ancient people began to reproduce these natural phenomena by pouring [[jug (container)|jugs of water]], often very cold, over themselves after washing. There has been evidence of early upper class [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Mesopotamia]]ns having indoor shower rooms where servants would bathe them in the privacy of their own homes.{{sfn|James|Thorpe|1995|p=460}} However, these were rudimentary by modern standards, having rudimentary drainage systems and water was carried, not pumped, into the room. The [[ancient Greeks]] were the first people to have showers. Their [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] and [[sewage system]]s made of lead pipes allowed water to be pumped both into and out of large [[communal shower]] rooms used by elites and common citizens alike.{{sfn|Humphrey|Olsen|Sherwood|1998|p=280}} These rooms have been discovered at the site of the city [[Pergamum]] and can also be found represented in pottery of the era. The depictions are very similar to modern locker room showers, and even included bars to hang up clothing.{{sfn|James|Thorpe|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2010}} The ancient Romans also followed this convention; their famous [[bathhouse]]s ([[Thermae]]) can be found all around the Mediterranean and as far out as modern-day England. The Romans not only had these showers but also believed in bathing multiple times a week, if not every day. The water and sewage systems developed by the Greeks and Romans broke down and fell out of use after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n===Modern showers===\nThe first mechanical shower, operated by a hand pump, was patented in England in 1767 by William Feetham,{{cn|date=August 2019}} a [[stove]] maker from [[Ludgate Hill]] in London. His shower contraption used a pump to force the water into a vessel above the user's head and a chain would then be pulled to release the water from the vessel. Although the system dispensed with the servant labour of filling up and pouring out buckets of water, the showers failed to catch on with the rich as a method for piping hot water through the system was not available. The system would also recycle the same dirty water through every cycle.\n\nThis early start was greatly improved in the anonymously invented [[Regency era|English Regency]] shower design of circa 1810 (there is some ambiguity among the sources).<ref name=\"stand-upbath\"/> The original design was over {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} tall, and was made of several metal pipes painted to look like [[bamboo]]. A basin suspended above the pipes fed water into a [[nozzle]] that distributed the water over the user's shoulders. The water on the ground was drained and pumped back through the pipes into the basin, where the cycle would repeat itself.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The original prototype was steadily improved upon in the following decades until it began to approximate the shower of today in its mode of operation. Hand-pumped models became fashionable at one point as well as the use of adjustable sprayers for different water flow.

They were also adopted by boarding schools, before being installed in public bathhouses. The first shower in a public bathhouse was in 1887 in [[Vienna]], Austria. In France, public bathhouses and showers were established by Charles Cazalet, firstly in [[Bordeaux]] in 1893 and then in [[Paris]] in 1899.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.chu-rouen.fr/NR/rdonlyres/A49A08FD-BA50-4B11-AA92-ECE9492BC247/0/2000_feltgen.pdf |title=Dr. Merry Delabost, inventor of the shower? |first=Dr. |last=Feltgen |date=8 November 2000 |publisher=Hopitaux de Rouen |accessdate=30 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112085519/http://www3.chu-rouen.fr/NR/rdonlyres/A49A08FD-BA50-4B11-AA92-ECE9492BC247/0/2000_feltgen.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Domestic===\nDomestic showers are most commonly stall showers or showers over a bathtub. A stall shower is a dedicated shower area which uses a door or curtain to contain water spray. The shower over a bathtub saves bathroom space and enables the area to be used for either a bath or a shower and commonly uses a sliding shower curtain to contain the water spray. Showers may also be in a wet room, in which there is no contained shower area, or in a dedicated shower room, which does not require containment of water spray.  Most domestic showers have a single overhead shower head, which may be adjustable.\n\n===Public===\nMany modern athletic and aquatic facilities provide showers for use by patrons, commonly in [[sex segregation|gender segregated]] [[changing room]]s. These can be in the form of individual stalls shielded by curtains or a door or communal shower rooms. The latter are generally large open rooms with any number of shower heads installed either directly into the walls or on posts throughout the shower area.

In an average home, showers are typically the third largest water use after toilets and clothes washers. The average American shower uses 17.2 gallons (65.1 liters) and lasts for 8.2 minutes at average flow rate of 2.1 gallons per minute (gpm) (7.9 lpm).<ref>{{Cite web\n |title       = Indoor Water Use\n |work        = Alliance for Water Efficiency \n |url         = https://www.home-water-works.org/indoor-use/showers\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20181024170532/https://www.home-water-works.org/indoor-use/showers\n |archivedate = 2018-10-24\n |publisher   = [[Alliance for Water Efficiency]]\n |accessdate  = 30 October 2018\n}}</ref> Showering is one of the leading ways people use water in the home, accounting for nearly 17 percent of residential indoor water use, roughly equals to 1.2 trillion gallons of water annually just for showering.<ref>{{Cite web\n |title       = Showerheads\n |work        = U.S.EPA\n |url         = https://www.epa.gov/watersense/showerheads\n |publisher   = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]\n |accessdate  = 30 October 2018\n}}\n</ref>  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommend to retrofit home showers with a shower head that uses less than 2.0 gallons per minute to conserve water.

Advances in science and medicine in the 19th century began to realize the benefit of regular bathing to an individual's health. As a result, most modern cultures encourage a daily personal hygiene regimen. Showering has also developed the reputation as a relaxing and generally therapeutic activity.{{sfn|Shove|2004|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n==Structure and design==\n[[File:Repairing shower stall with grout applicator.jpg|thumb|Repairing damaged tile in a shower stall with a [[caulking gun]]]]\nDesigns for shower facilities vary by location and purpose. There are free-standing showers, but also showers which are integrated into a bathtub. Showers are separated from the surrounding area through watertight curtains ([[#Shower curtain|shower curtain]]), [[sliding door]]s, or [[folding door]]s, or [[shower blinds]], in order to protect the space from spraying water. Showers with a level entry [[#Wet room|wet room]] are becoming very popular, especially due to improvements in waterproofing systems and prefabricated components. Places such as a [[swimming pool]], a [[locker room]], or a military facility have multiple showers. There may be communal shower rooms without divisions, or shower stalls (typically open at the top). Many types of showers are available, including complete shower units which are all encompassing showers that include the pan, walls, and often the shower head, as well as pieced together units in which the pan, shower head, and doors are purchased separately. Each type of shower poses different installation issues.\n\n===Installation===\nThough the installation requirements of each of shower will differ, the installation of a shower in general requires the laying of several [[Plumbing|water transportation pipes]], including a pipe for hot water and for cold water, and a drainage pipe. It is important that the wet areas of a bathroom be waterproof, and multiple layers of waterproofing can be employed.  [[Grout]] is used to fill gaps between tiles, but grout and tile setting materials are generally porous. Tiles are generally waterproof, though a shower pan must be installed beneath them as a safety to prevent water leakage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curbless Showers - An Installation Guide|url=https://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/pubs_p/docs/Curbless.pdf|publisher=NC State University|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> Thus small mosaic tiles offer less of a defense than large format tiles. Sub-tile waterproofing is important when tiles are being used. Best practice requires a waterproofing material to cover the walls and floor of the shower area that are then covered with tile, or in some countries with a sheet material like vinyl.\n\n===Drainage===\n[[File:Shower Repair.jpg|thumb|Shower repair showing drain piping with trap]]\n[[File:Shower project new diverter valve with connector about to be added.jpg|thumb|This diverter valve about to be installed behind a shower mixes hot and cold water.]]\nSome shower areas utilize a second emergency drain outside of the shower in case of overflow. In Australia and some European countries, plumbing codes require this second emergency drain (but not in the United Kingdom nor North America). {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Shower head===\n[[File:Showerhead.JPG|thumb|A shower head.]]\n\nA shower head is a perforated [[nozzle]] that distributes water over [[solid angle]] a focal point of use, generally overhead the bather. A shower uses less water than a full immersion in a [[bathtub|bath]]. Some shower heads can be adjusted to spray different patterns of water, such as massage, gentle spray, strong spray, and intermittent pulse or combination modes. [[Hard water]] may result in [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] deposits clogging the head, reducing the flow and changing the spray pattern. For [[descaling]], various acidic chemicals or brushes can be used or some heads have rubber-like jets that can be manually descaled. A homemade remedy is to immerse it in a solution of water and vinegar for a while, since the vinegar is able to dissolve limescale. Some governments around the world set standards for [[water usage]] and regulate shower heads. For example, in the [[United States]], residential and most commercial shower heads must flow no more than 9.5 liters per minute (2.5 gallons per minute) per the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] ruling 10 CFR 430. Low-flow shower heads, less than or equal 7.6 liters per minute (2.0 gallons per minute), can use water more efficiently by [[aerating]] the water stream, altering nozzles through advanced flow principles or by high-speed [[oscillation]] of the spray stream. USEPA administers a voluntary water saving program, [[WaterSense]], which can certify low-flow shower heads.\n\n===Shower and bathtub curtains===\n{{Redirect|Shower curtain|the physical phenomenon|shower-curtain effect}}\n[[File:BernheimerHouseTub.jpg|thumb|Bathtub curtain]]\n[[File:A typical American bathroom.jpg|thumb|Shower curtain]]\n\n[[Curtain]]s can be used in shower or bathtub enclosures with two main purposes: to provide privacy and to prevent water from flooding or spraying outside the shower or bathtub area. Shower and bathtub curtains usually surround the bath inside the tub or shower area and are held up with [[wikt:railing|railing]]s or [[curtain rod]]s high on the wall or ceiling. To accommodate the different types of bathtub shapes, railings can come in different sizes and are flexible in their design. \n\nSome people use two shower curtains: one that is inside the tub, which is mainly functional or decorative as well, and an outer shower curtain, which is purely decorative. The bottom portion of the inner curtain often comes with magnetic discs or suction cups which adhere to the bathtub itself.\n\nThese curtains are usually made from [[wikt:vinyl|vinyl]], cloth or plastic.\n\n===Shower and bathtub doors===\n[[File:Raisable shower door.JPG|thumb|225px|[[Up-N-Away (down-sliding shower door)|Raisable shower door.]]]]\n[[File:The Lygon Arms, bathroom.jpg|thumb|Bathtub door.]]\nShower or bathtub doors are [[door]]s (also called screens) used in [[bathroom]]s that help keep water inside a shower or bathtub and are alternatives to shower curtains. They are available in many different styles such as framed or frameless, sliding or swing. They are usually constructed of aluminium, clear glass, plexi-glass or [[tempered glass]]. Shower doors can come in many different hardware finishes and glass patterns that can match other bathroom hardware such as faucets and shower heads. There are also shower doors that are in a neo angle design for use on shower pans that have the neo design as well. The design of the shower pan is extremely important as the shower door must be the type required for the pan in order to work. A shower door requires plastic lining along the edges of the door to protect against water [[leaking]] out.\n\n==Equipment==\n* [[Pressure balanced valve]], a device to provide constant shower water pressure and prevent temperature fluctuations\n* [[Shower cap]], a cap worn while showering or bathing, to protect hair from becoming wet\n* [[Shower radio]], a radio that is waterproofed to allow it to be used in a bathroom or other wet environment\n* [[Sunshower (commercial product)|Sunshower]], a device to locally heat shower water with solar power\n* [[Soap]]\n* [[Shampoo]]\n* [[Washing mitt]], a tool for applying soap to the body\n* [[Water heat recycling]] units to reclaim much of the waste water's heat and recycle it to the shower head and minimize heat lost to the drain\n* Shower Caddy, a storage system inside the shower, typically for shampoo and conditioner\n*[[Shower speaker]], a little Bluetooth speaker designed to listen to music whle showering\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bathing]]\n* [[Bathroom]]\n* [[Bathtub]]\n* [[Navy shower]]\n* [[Solar water heating|Solar heated shower]]\n* [[Steam shower]]\n* [[Transfer bench]]\n* [[Water recycling shower]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Refbegin}}\n;Books\n*{{Cite book\n |last=Brauer |first=Roger L B |year=2006\n |title=Safety and health for engineers |chapter=Personal protective equipment\n |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-471-29189-3 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n |last1=Humphrey |first1=John W |last2=Olsen |first2=John P |last3=Sherwood |first3=Andrew N |year=1998\n |title=Greek and Roman Technology: A Sourcebook\n |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-06136-0 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=James |first1=Peter |last2=Thorpe |first2=Nick |year=1995 |title=Ancient Inventions |location=New York |publisher=Ballantine |isbn=978-0-345-40102-1 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ancientinvention00jame }}\n*{{Cite book\n |last=Mayer |first=Leonard |year=1995\n |title=Design and planning of research and clinical laboratory facilities |chapter=Emergency systems\n |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-30623-8 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite encyclopedia\n |editor=Oxford University Press |year=2009\n |encyclopedia=Oxford New Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus\n |publisher=Berkley |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-425-22862-3 |ref={{harvid|OUP|2009}}\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n |last=Shove |first=Elizabeth |year=2004\n |title=Comfort, Cleanliness and Convenience The Social Organization of Normality (New Technologies/New Cultures)\n |location=New York |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-1-85973-630-2 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Vincoli |first=Jeffrey W |year=2000 |title=Lewis' dictionary of occupational and environmental safety and health |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-56670-399-4 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lewisdictionaryo00jeff }}\n;Web pages\n*{{Cite web\n |last=Jones |first=Jerry |date=29 October 2004\n |title=Decontamination shower system revamped |work=Reporter\n |url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/reporter/index.html?ID=3590\n |location=Nashville, TN |publisher=Vanderbilt University Medical Center |accessdate=5 December 2010 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite web\n |last=Mullick |first=Abir |year=2005\n |title=Bathing for Older people with Disabilities\n |url=http://www.ap.buffalo.edu/idea/Publications/Bathing%20for%20Older%20People.htm\n |publisher=UB School of Architecture and Planning |accessdate=5 December 2010 |ref=harv\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Bathing]]\n[[Category:Bathrooms]]\n[[Category:Greek inventions]]\n[[Category:Hygiene]]\n[[Category:Plumbing]]\n", "name_user": "Tillu Talla", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower"}

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

of the qualifier \"tantamount\" was seen as inappropriate, and the use of the word \"consequences\" was seen as an attempt to circumvent the international legal definition of genocide by avoiding any language that would imply intent, a crucial aspect of the 1948 UN [[Genocide Convention]] definition.\n\nOn May 13, 2016, [[Jonathan Greenblatt]], then ADL's CEO and National Director for less than a year, published a blog post in which he wrote \"What happened to the Armenian people was unequivocally genocide\" and urged the U.S. to take a position recognizing the Armenian

These are Jewish organizations that believe they should keep people who disagree with them on the Middle East away from anyone who might listen.\"<ref name=\"WP sparks\" /> ADL denied the charges. According to Foxman, \"I think they made the right decision... He's taken the position that Israel shouldn't exist. That puts him on our radar.\"<ref name=\"WP sparks\" />\n\n=== Denver defamation suit ===\nIn 1994, ADL became embroiled in a dispute between neighbors in Denver, Colorado. Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in \"anti-Semitic conduct or harassment.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe Quigleys brought a lawsuit against ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.<ref>{{cite news  |title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple |date=March 12, 2004 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |last=Abbott |first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n=== New antisemitism controversy ===\n{{Main|New antisemitism}}\nA book entitled ''The [[New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974) by ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R. Epstein argued that a new kind of anti-Semitism is on the rise. A subsequent book, ''The Real Anti-Semitism in America'' (New York, 1982) was written by ADL national leader Nathan Perlmutter and his wife, Ruth Ann Perlmutter. In ''Never Again? The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), by ADL's national director Abraham Foxman, he states on page 4: \"We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s\u2014if not a greater one.\"<ref name=\"adl.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again?

Therefore, under these unique circumstances, we believe the City of New York would be better served if an alternative location could be found.\"<ref name=\"berk\" /> ADL denounced what it saw as bigoted attacks on the project.

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940).

of the qualifier \"tantamount\" was seen as inappropriate, and the use of the word \"consequences\" was seen as an attempt to circumvent the international legal definition of genocide by avoiding any language that would imply intent, a crucial aspect of the 1948 UN [[Genocide Convention]] definition.\n\nOn May 13, 2016, [[Jonathan Greenblatt]], then ADL's CEO and National Director for less than a

These are Jewish organizations that believe they should keep people who disagree with them on the Middle East away from anyone who might listen.\"<ref name=\"WP sparks\" /> ADL denied the charges. According to Foxman, \"I think they made the right decision... He's taken the position that Israel shouldn't exist. That puts him on our radar.\"<ref name=\"WP sparks\" />\n\n=== Denver defamation suit ===\nIn 1994, ADL became embroiled in a dispute between neighbors in Denver, Colorado. Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in \"anti-Semitic conduct or harassment.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe Quigleys brought a lawsuit against ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.<ref>{{cite news  |title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple |date=March 12, 2004 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |last=Abbott |first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n=== New antisemitism controversy ===\n{{Main|New antisemitism}}\nA book entitled ''The [[New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974) by ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R.

The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), by ADL's national director Abraham Foxman, he states on page 4: \"We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s\u2014if not a greater one.\"<ref name=\"adl.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again?

Some lived in what used to be Inarado (now Licod or San Rafael), others in Ilihan, some in Pinayagan, and still a number lived in Capangihan \u2014 a place near the Paghasaan and Bayugin Rivers. These settlements are distant from the seacoast and upland. The reason could be the presence of Moro pirates who used to attack the town, especially the coastal areas, robbing the natives of their [[gold]] and whatever else came to be lying around, and burning the houses afterwards. Due to these Moro-related disasters, it was a wise move to locate the settlements on higher ground.<ref>\"Bulusan Town Fiesta Souvenir Programme, 1993\". Municipality of Bulusan, 1993</ref>\n\nRecent excavations yielded artifacts such as [[platter (dishware)|platters]], [[Jug (container)|jugs]], [[Plate (dishware)|plates]], and [[vases]] made from china and earthen burial jars in what used to be Inarado. These finds further strengthened some claims that the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and the people in this part of the country were already engaged in trade even before the 'Cross & Sword' reached them.<ref>Prado, Mariano Goyena del, ''Ibalon: Ethnohistory of the Bicol Region''.

Retrieved on 2010-06-05.</ref> In Inarado, the fourth ''parroquia'' ([[parish]]) of the present Province of Sorsogon, was established in 1630. After being merely a part of [[Casiguran, Sorsogon|Casiguran]] (established in 1600), Bulusan became an independent parish following [[Bacon, Sorsogon|Bacon]] (established in 1617) and the parish of [[Sorsogon, Sorsogon|Sorsogon]] (established in 1628). It became a separate ''pueblo civil'' (town) in 1631. The new parish was then placed under the [[Patron saint|tutelary]] of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James, the Greater]] \u2014 the patron saint of Spain. Fr. Miguel de Santa Ana became its first parish priest, exercising one-man authority over ecclesiastical and civil functions. The people also selected the first executive of the place, a ''gobernadorcillo''.\n\nIn 1760, the town was transferred from Inarado to its present site at the mouth of Bulusan River. This was triggered by the need to trade with neighboring settlements. The relocation was done through the efforts of Fr. Joaquin de los Santos, the parish priest. Under the friar's guidance, the people chose Bernardino Pasion as first head of the town. The natives started building a church in the place where a new one now stands. This initial development formed the nucleus of the present ''poblacion'' (town center).\n\n====Division====\nThe Bulusan parish then encompassed all lands that includes the vicinities of Gubat, Matnog, Bulan, Barcelona and Santa Magdalena. Eventually, either new parishes were born out of the Mother parish and became a town of its own or these communities grew into separate towns of their own and, in turn, established their own parishes.

In 1799, as a defense and warning measure against the Moro pirates, the ''principalias'' (leaders) of the coastal towns of Albay convened in their respective town halls and drew up plans for the building of ''lanchas ca\u00f1oneras'' (armed ships). On April 20, 1799, Bulusan's leaders decided to build two ''lanchas ca\u00f1oneras'' to be commanded by actual gobernadorcillo Don Juan Macsimiano and ex-gobernadorcillo Don Juan Tomas.\n\nThe town of Bulusan built the most ''baluartes de piedra'' (stone watchtowers). The town erected watchtowers, one each in Macabare, Tawog and Layog (now a part of Barcelona).<ref name=glimp>[http://webspace.webring.com/people/eh/hello/history.html History of Bulusan] ''Glimpses of Bulusan website'' Retrieved August 17, 2013</ref>\n\nNear the community of Dapdap, a bigger triangular ''muralla'' [fortification] called [[Punta Diamante]] which encloses the church and rectory of the parish of St. James the Greater was erected. Punta Diamante has five watchtowers with high, thick walls, making it an ideal place for refuge during Moro attacks. Unlike the other watchtowers which are cylindrical and have circular bases, the one facing the sea is of a triangular plan, a smaller version of the main complex. The biggest watchtower has an octagon shaped base  (with eight sides) and tapers upward in alternating tiers.  This watchtower now serves as the church's bell tower, with the old bells comparably intact.<ref name=glimp/>\n\n====Growth and wealth====\nAmong the province's other towns, Bulusan was comparatively well-off.  Being a major port of ''armadillas'' (small ships) patrolling the high seas \u2014 equivalent to present-day [[Philippine Coast Guard]] \u2014 it was well protected from the Moro pirates. As a consequence, people from other towns came, earned their living, and paid tributes to the Spanish Government. In 1809, when the governor of [[Albay]] ordered the construction of a [[cemetery]] outside each town, Bulusan reported the highest construction cost (200 pesos) in a display of its considerable wealth.\n\nSpain's control over the ''Buluse\u00f1os'' \u2014 the locals of Bulusan \u2014 and the rest of the natives throughout the islands brought a significant change in their community life. They were made to embrace [[Catholic]] faith more by force than by conviction. ''Polos y servicios'' ([[forced labor]]) was widely used especially in the building of buildings like churches and rectories with its dungeons, and the ''casa tribunal'' (town hall). It could be presumed that a forced labor was likewise employed in the construction of Punta Diamante and the other watchtowers.\n\n===American period===\nBulusan had its own share of heroes in the revolution against Spain. These same individuals would later find themselves in the war against the Americans. Colonel Emeterio Funes, a Buluse\u00f1o, was one of the foremost revolutionary leaders in the province. Coming home from a military service under General Miguel Malvar, he was aware of the immediate plans of the Americans to invade the rest of the country. Upon his arrival in Bulusan, he met with the town's prominent figures, with the parish priest in attendance, in the church rectory. Together, they drew up plans for a revolutionary movement in the province. In 1900, Emeterio Funes was appointed colonel of the revolutionary forces in Sorsogon by General Vito Belarmino of Albay.\n\nThe revolutionary forces in the province had been quite a success, what with the natives and the elected officials on their side. On April 25, 1900, the Americans waged a battle with the Filipino revolutionaries in Sitio Boco, San Francisco. The Americans suffered three casualties: one lieutenant was killed and two soldiers were wounded. Meanwhile, only two soldiers were wounded on the defender's side. Due to lack of ammunition, the revolutionaries were unable to make a second attack and had to flee to safety. The Americans, enraged with the loss of a comrade and the failure to capture Colonel Funes,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} later on burned the entire town. After two years of effective resistance, on February 21, 1901, Colonel Funes took the oath of allegiance to the United States in a ceremony done in Bulan. Knowing that the inhabitants were getting weary of the war, he decided to end it peacefully.\n\nUnder the Americans, the first municipal president was Braulio Ganzo. However, the first local executive elected in Bulusan by popular suffrage was Juan Fortades.<ref>Dery, Luis C, ''From Ibalon to Sorsogon: A Historical Survey of Sorsogon Province to 1905''. New Day Publishers, Quezon City, 1991.</ref>\n\nFrom 1900 to 1940, Bulusan experienced major developments in education, government, communication, agriculture, and public health. From the very start of the American regime, free public instruction commenced. Public schools in almost all barrios were opened. In 1927, the municipal building (now housing the post office, court room, and municipal jail) and public market (undergoing another major renovation \u2014 this time a vertical development) were built. In 1930, the provincial road connecting Bulusan to the adjoining towns of Barcelona and Irosin was opened to traffic. Telegraph and mail services began. Qualified voters began enjoying the right to suffrage. A system of municipal government was instituted. Trade and commerce flourished. Development in agricultural methods was initiated. In public health, cholera and smallpox were contained. In 1939, the first municipal waterworks system was constructed.\n\nAt about this period, two Buluse\u00f1os rose to places of prominence. Juan S. Reyes was elected governor of Sorsogon (1929\u20131931). His younger brother, Dr. Jose S. Reyes, who obtained his doctorate degree from Columbia University, was elected delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention. Referred to as a political genius, he contributed immensely in the drafting of the 1935 Constitution. He also became a member of the Philippine Independence Mission and was the Secretary of Education of both the Quirino and Osme\u00f1a administrations. In 1945, he became executive secretary to President Sergio Osme\u00f1a.<ref>Jose, Cristina D., \"Facts About Sorsogon\". National Media Production Center, Manila, 1971.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nThis period of relative peace and prosperity in Bulusan was disturbed when the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out in the Philippines on December 8, 1941. Like the rest of the islands, Bulusan was overrun by the Japanese Imperial Army. This triggered nationalism once more among Buluse\u00f1os with the re-emergence of organized guerilla resistance. The Japanese later succeeded in establishing a semblance of local government to administer the town, but the loyalty of those appointed to these positions remained with the resistance group.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bulusan\n| 1903 = 5578\n| 1918 = 8046\n| 1939 = 10430\n| 1948 = 12144\n| 1960 = 15539\n| 1970 = 16217\n| 1975 = 16393\n| 1980 = 18050\n| 1990 = 18009\n| 1995 = 19501\n| 2000 = 20469\n| 2007 = 21374\n| 2010 = 22089\n| 2015 = 22884\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n=== Language ===\nBulusan people are speakers of the [[Bisakol]] language.

During his term, the Bulusan Cultural and Sports Center was constructed in what used to be the site of the old Central School's Gabaldon building.

Some lived in what used to be Inarado (now Licod or San Rafael), others in Ilihan, some in Pinayagan, and still a number lived in Capangihan \u2014 a place near the Paghasaan and Bayugin Rivers. These settlements are distant from the seacoast and upland. The reason could be the presence of Moro pirates who used to attack the town, especially the coastal areas, robbing the natives of their [[gold]] and whatever else came to be lying around, and burning the houses afterwards. Due to these Moro-related disasters, it was a wise move to locate the settlements on higher ground.<ref>\"Bulusan Town Fiesta Souvenir Programme, 1993\". Municipality of Bulusan, 1993</ref>\n\nRecent excavations yielded artifacts such as [[platter (dishware)|platters]], [[Jug (container)|jugs]], [[Plate (dishware)|plates]], and [[vases]] made from china and earthen burial jars in what used to be Inarado. These finds further strengthened some claims that the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and the people in this part of the country were already engaged in trade even before the 'Cross & Sword' reached them.<ref>Prado, Mariano Goyena del, ''Ibalon: Ethnohistory of the Bicol Region''.

Retrieved on 2010-06-05.</ref> In Inarado, the fourth ''parroquia'' ([[parish]]) of the present Province of Sorsogon, was established in 1630. After being merely a part of [[Casiguran, Sorsogon|Casiguran]] (established in 1600), Bulusan became an independent parish following [[Bacon, Sorsogon|Bacon]] (established in 1617) and the parish of [[Sorsogon, Sorsogon|Sorsogon]] (established in 1628). It became a separate ''pueblo civil'' (town) in 1631. The new parish was then placed under the [[Patron saint|tutelary]] of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James, the Greater]] \u2014 the patron saint of Spain. Fr. Miguel de Santa Ana became its first parish priest, exercising one-man authority over ecclesiastical and civil functions. The people also selected the first executive of the place, a ''gobernadorcillo''.\n\nIn 1760, the town was transferred from Inarado to its present site at the mouth of Bulusan River. This was triggered by the need to trade with neighboring settlements. The relocation was done through the efforts of Fr. Joaquin de los Santos, the parish priest. Under the friar's guidance, the people chose Bernardino Pasion as first head of the town. The natives started building a church in the place where a new one now stands. This initial development formed the nucleus of the present ''poblacion'' (town center).\n\n====Division====\nThe Bulusan parish then encompassed all lands that includes the vicinities of Gubat, Matnog, Bulan, Barcelona and Santa Magdalena. Eventually, either new parishes were born out of the Mother parish and became a town of its own or these communities grew into separate towns of their own and, in turn, established their own parishes. See table below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Former Communities of Bulusan\n|-\n! Name !! Year the Parish Was Established !!

In 1799, as a defense and warning measure against the Moro pirates, the ''principalias'' (leaders) of the coastal towns of Albay convened in their respective town halls and drew up plans for the building of ''lanchas ca\u00f1oneras'' (armed ships). On April 20, 1799, Bulusan's leaders decided to build two ''lanchas ca\u00f1oneras'' to be commanded by actual gobernadorcillo Don Juan Macsimiano and ex-gobernadorcillo Don Juan Tomas.\n\nThe town of Bulusan built the most ''baluartes de piedra'' (stone watchtowers). The town erected watchtowers, one each in Macabare, Tawog and Layog (now a part of Barcelona).<ref name=glimp>[http://webspace.webring.com/people/eh/hello/history.html History of Bulusan] ''Glimpses of Bulusan website'' Retrieved August 17, 2013</ref>\n\nNear the community of Dapdap, a bigger triangular ''muralla'' [fortification] called [[Punta Diamante]] which encloses the church and rectory of the parish of St. James the Greater was erected. Punta Diamante has five watchtowers with high, thick walls, making it an ideal place for refuge during Moro attacks. Unlike the other watchtowers which are cylindrical and have circular bases, the one facing the sea is of a triangular plan, a smaller version of the main complex. The biggest watchtower has an octagon shaped base  (with eight sides) and tapers upward in alternating tiers.  This watchtower now serves as the church's bell tower, with the old bells comparably intact.<ref name=glimp/>\n\n====Growth and wealth====\nAmong the province's other towns, Bulusan was comparatively well-off.  Being a major port of ''armadillas'' (small ships) patrolling the high seas \u2014 equivalent to present-day [[Philippine Coast Guard]] \u2014 it was well protected from the Moro pirates. As a consequence, people from other towns came, earned their living, and paid tributes to the Spanish Government. In 1809, when the governor of [[Albay]] ordered the construction of a [[cemetery]] outside each town, Bulusan reported the highest construction cost (200 pesos) in a display of its considerable wealth.\n\nSpain's control over the ''Buluse\u00f1os'' \u2014 the locals of Bulusan \u2014 and the rest of the natives throughout the islands brought a significant change in their community life. They were made to embrace [[Catholic]] faith more by force than by conviction. ''Polos y servicios'' ([[forced labor]]) was widely used especially in the building of buildings like churches and rectories with its dungeons, and the ''casa tribunal'' (town hall). It could be presumed that a forced labor was likewise employed in the construction of Punta Diamante and the other watchtowers.\n\n===American period===\nBulusan had its own share of heroes in the revolution against Spain. These same individuals would later find themselves in the war against the Americans. Colonel Emeterio Funes, a Buluse\u00f1o, was one of the foremost revolutionary leaders in the province. Coming home from a military service under General Miguel Malvar, he was aware of the immediate plans of the Americans to invade the rest of the country. Upon his arrival in Bulusan, he met with the town's prominent figures, with the parish priest in attendance, in the church rectory. Together, they drew up plans for a revolutionary movement in the province. In 1900, Emeterio Funes was appointed colonel of the revolutionary forces in Sorsogon by General Vito Belarmino of Albay.\n\nThe revolutionary forces in the province had been quite a success, what with the natives and the elected officials on their side. On April 25, 1900, the Americans waged a battle with the Filipino revolutionaries in Sitio Boco, San Francisco. The Americans suffered three casualties: one lieutenant was killed and two soldiers were wounded. Meanwhile, only two soldiers were wounded on the defender's side. Due to lack of ammunition, the revolutionaries were unable to make a second attack and had to flee to safety. The Americans, enraged with the loss of a comrade and the failure to capture Colonel Funes,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} later on burned the entire town. After two years of effective resistance, on February 21, 1901, Colonel Funes took the oath of allegiance to the United States in a ceremony done in Bulan. Knowing that the inhabitants were getting weary of the war, he decided to end it peacefully.\n\nUnder the Americans, the first municipal president was Braulio Ganzo. However, the first local executive elected in Bulusan by popular suffrage was Juan Fortades.<ref>Dery, Luis C, ''From Ibalon to Sorsogon: A Historical Survey of Sorsogon Province to 1905''. New Day Publishers, Quezon City, 1991.</ref>\n\nFrom 1900 to 1940, Bulusan experienced major developments in education, government, communication, agriculture, and public health. From the very start of the American regime, free public instruction commenced. Public schools in almost all barrios were opened. In 1927, the municipal building (now housing the post office, court room, and municipal jail) and public market (undergoing another major renovation \u2014 this time a vertical development) were built. In 1930, the provincial road connecting Bulusan to the adjoining towns of Barcelona and Irosin was opened to traffic. Telegraph and mail services began. Qualified voters began enjoying the right to suffrage. A system of municipal government was instituted. Trade and commerce flourished. Development in agricultural methods was initiated. In public health, cholera and smallpox were contained. In 1939, the first municipal waterworks system was constructed.\n\nAt about this period, two Buluse\u00f1os rose to places of prominence. Juan S. Reyes was elected governor of Sorsogon (1929\u20131931). His younger brother, Dr. Jose S. Reyes, who obtained his doctorate degree from Columbia University, was elected delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention. Referred to as a political genius, he contributed immensely in the drafting of the 1935 Constitution. He also became a member of the Philippine Independence Mission and was the Secretary of Education of both the Quirino and Osme\u00f1a administrations. In 1945, he became executive secretary to President Sergio Osme\u00f1a.<ref>Jose, Cristina D., \"Facts About Sorsogon\". National Media Production Center, Manila, 1971.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nThis period of relative peace and prosperity in Bulusan was disturbed when the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out in the Philippines on December 8, 1941. Like the rest of the islands, Bulusan was overrun by the Japanese Imperial Army. This triggered nationalism once more among Buluse\u00f1os with the re-emergence of organized guerilla resistance. The Japanese later succeeded in establishing a semblance of local government to administer the town, but the loyalty of those appointed to these positions remained with the resistance group.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bulusan\n| 1903 = 5578\n| 1918 = 8046\n| 1939 = 10430\n| 1948 = 12144\n| 1960 = 15539\n| 1970 = 16217\n| 1975 = 16393\n| 1980 = 18050\n| 1990 = 18009\n| 1995 = 19501\n| 2000 = 20469\n| 2007 = 21374\n| 2010 = 22089\n| 2015 = 22884\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Bulusan, Sorsogon\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 27\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 28\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 30\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 24\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 28\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 27\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 65\n| Feb precipitation mm = 44\n| Mar precipitation mm = 42\n| Apr precipitation mm = 39\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 150\n| Jul precipitation mm = 184\n| Aug precipitation mm = 153\n| Sep precipitation mm = 163\n| Oct precipitation mm = 154\n| Nov precipitation mm = 127\n| Dec precipitation mm = 100\n| Jan rain days        = 13.9\n| Feb rain days        = 9.2\n| Mar rain days        = 11.0\n| Apr rain days        = 12.5\n| May rain days        = 19.6\n| Jun rain days        = 24.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.5\n| Aug rain days        = 25.0\n| Sep rain days        = 25.5\n| Oct rain days        = 24.4\n| Nov rain days        = 19.4\n| Dec rain days        = 15.1\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/forecast/modelclimate/bulusan_philippines_1722769\n| title =  Bulusan, Sorsogon : Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 December 2018}}</ref>\n| date = 29 December 2018\n}}\n\n== Language ==\nBulusan people are speakers of the [[Bisakol]] language.

In addition to several other renditions, the song was again a hit in 1991 when [[Reba McEntire]] recorded it for her album ''[[For My Broken Heart]].'' McEntire's version was a chart single as well, reaching number 12 on [[Hot Country Songs]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nReturning home from a two-week trip to a place called Candletop, a man called \"Brother\" stops for a drink at Webb's Bar before going home to his wife. While at the bar, he is encountered by his friend Andy Wolloe, who informs him that while he was gone his wife was having an affair with \"that Amos boy, Seth\", and then admits that he himself had been with her as well.  Brother leaves the bar angry, and a frightened Andy makes his way home.\n\nAssuming his wife had left town, Brother goes home to find the gun his father had left him and quietly makes his way through the backwoods to Andy's house. On the way there he notices a set of footprints leading to and from the house, but they are too small to have been made by Andy.  Arriving at the back door, Brother finds Andy inside lying dead on the floor from a gunshot. In a panic, he fires a shot in the air to get the attention of the sheriff, only to find himself arrested for Andy's murder. In a [[show trial]], the judge wastes little time declaring Brother guilty and sentences him to [[capital punishment|death]] by [[hanging]], which is carried out in short order. \n\nThe story wraps up as the [[first person narrative|narrator]] identifies herself as Brother's \"Little Sister\" and reveals that it was ''her'' footprints that Brother saw on his way to Andy's house.  Little Sister then admits that she had not only killed Andy with her own gun, but Brother's adulterous wife as well, disposing of the latter's body where she is certain nobody will ever find it.\n\nIn the song's chorus, Little Sister blames the local criminal justice system for her brother's death, warning the listener, \"Don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer, 'cause the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands.\"<ref>[http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-night-the-lights-went-out-in-georgia-lyrics-vicki-lawrence.html Vicki Lawrence - The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia] at [[MetroLyrics]]</ref>\n\n==History and original recording==\nAlthough Bobby Russell both wrote the lyrics and composed the music for the song, he was reluctant to record even a demonstration because he \"didn't like it.\" According to Lawrence, who was married to Russell at the time, she believed it was destined to be successful and recorded the demo herself. The publishers and the record label did not quite know how to pitch the song, as it was not really a country or a pop song. The first thought was to offer the song to actress/singer [[Liza Minnelli]], but eventually it was offered to singer [[Cher]], but her then-husband and manager [[Sonny Bono]] reportedly refused it, as he was said to be concerned that the song might offend Cher's southern fans.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fred |last=Bronson |authorlink=Fred Bronson |chapter=The Night The Lights Went Out in Georgia |chapterurl=http://www.superseventies.com/sw_nightthelightswoig.html |title=The Billboard book of number one hits |publisher=Billboard Publications |location=New York |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=0-8230-7545-1 |oclc=17918476 |accessdate=2009-01-22 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/billboardbookofnbro00bron }}</ref> Without a singer to record the song, Lawrence went into a studio and recorded it professionally herself, with the instrumental backing of L.A. session musicians from the [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|Wrecking Crew]],<ref>{{cite book |first=Kent |last=Hartman |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312619749/page/261 261\u2013263] |year=2012 |title=The Wrecking Crew |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312619749 |url-access=registration |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin\u2019s Griffin]] |isbn=978-1-250-03046-7}}</ref> then pressed the label to release it as a single.\n\n==Release and reception==\nReleased as a single in November 1972, the song would ultimately, and surprisingly, become a number-one success for Lawrence, topping the Hot 100 chart in early 1973.

Tucker's cover appears on the film's soundtrack album.\n\n=== Reba McEntire ===\nDuring 1991, the song was sung as a cover version by [[Reba McEntire]] on her album ''For My Broken Heart.'' It reached number 12 on ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart.  While still a commercially successful release, it broke a string of 24 consecutive top 10 country singles by McEntire.\n\nThe song also had a successful music video, directed by Jack Cole, wherein the older brother of the story is given the name \"Raymond Brody;\" the video for McEntire's version also contained spoken dialogue that expanded on several of the song's plot points, by suggesting that the judge knew that the narrator's brother did not commit the crime, but was nonetheless anxious to convict him, since he (the judge) had also been having sex with the wife (played by [[Playboy]] centerfold/pin up model [[Barbara Moore (model)|Barbara Moore]]) and was worried that a long, involved trial would cause this fact to become known. It also establishes that the little sister (played by McEntire, both as a young woman in flashbacks and as a 60-year-old woman using heavy makeup) had caught Andy (who was her fianc\u00e9) in the act with her brother's wife.\n\nDuring a promotional tour for the song, Lawrence and McEntire performed the song as a duet on Lawrence's talk show ''[[Vicki!]]'' using the McEntire backing track.\n\n=== Schneider & Cole ===\n[[Melinda Schneider]] and [[Beccy Cole]] covered the song on their 2014 album ''[[Great Women of Country]]''.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*It is a prime example of a [[twist ending]] in a song, and in the 1992 film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]],'' the mobster named Nice Guy Eddie (played by [[Chris Penn]]) says, \"...this is the first time I ever realized that the girl singin' the song is the one who shot Andy.\"\n*The opening motif is sampled in \"[[The Time Is Now (John Cena song)|The Time Is Now]],\" which the American professional wrestler [[John Cena]] currently{{when|date=July 2019}} uses as his entrance music; specifically, the song samples Pete Schofield's and The Canadians's rendition.\n*The 2011 book ''The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia'' by Jeremy G.

It reached number 12 on ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart.  While still a commercially successful release, it broke a string of 24 consecutive top 10 country singles by McEntire.\n\nThe song also had a successful music video, directed by Jack Cole, wherein the older brother of the story is given the name \"Raymond Brody;\" the video for McEntire's version also contained spoken dialogue that expanded on several of the song's plot points, by suggesting that the judge knew that the narrator's brother did not commit the crime, but was nonetheless anxious to convict him, since he (the judge) had also been having sex with the wife (played by [[Playboy]] centerfold/pin up model [[Barbara Moore (model)|Barbara Moore]]) and was worried that a long, involved trial would cause this fact to become known. It also establishes that the little sister (played by McEntire, both as a young woman in flashbacks and as a 60-year-old woman using heavy makeup) had caught Andy (who was her fianc\u00e9) in the act with her brother's wife.\n\nDuring a promotional tour for the song, Lawrence and McEntire performed the song as a duet on Lawrence's talk show ''[[Vicki!]]'' using the McEntire backing track.\n\n=== Schneider & Cole ===\n[[Melinda Schneider]] and [[Beccy Cole]] covered the song on their 2014 album ''[[Great Women of Country]]''.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*It is a prime example of a [[twist ending]] in a song, and in the 1992 film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]],'' the mobster named Nice Guy Eddie (played by [[Chris Penn]]) says, \"...this is the first time I ever realized that the girl singin' the song is the one who shot Andy.\"\n*The opening motif is sampled in \"[[The Time Is Now (John Cena song)|The Time Is Now]],\" which the American professional wrestler [[John Cena]] currently{{when|date=July 2019}} uses as his entrance music; specifically, the song samples Pete Schofield's and The Canadians's rendition.\n*The 2011 book ''The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia'' by Jeremy G. T. Reuschling is loosely based on the McEntire rendition and music video.\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Vicki Lawrence version===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1972\u201373)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|Australia [[Kent Music Report|KMR]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|25\n|-\n|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20listener&qartistid=1430#n_view_location Flavour of New Zealand, 18 June 1973]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n{{single chart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Vicki Lawrence}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Billboardadultcontemporary|6|artist=Vicki Lawrence}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Billboardcountrysongs|36|artist=Vicki Lawrence}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1973)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.100214&URLjpg=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f4/nlc008388.100214.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.100214|title=Image : RPM Weekly|first=Library and Archives|last=Canada|date=February 8, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1973.htm |title=Top 100 Hits of 1973/Top 100 Songs of 1973 |website=Musicoutfitters.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-07}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|11\n|}\n\n====All-time charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
