This is the official version of events as determined by that investigation.\n\nInvestigators determined that the two pilots were exploring the performance limits of the empty CRJ-200 on the flight.  The pilots decided to test the limits of the CRJ and join the \"410 club\", referring to pilots who pushed CRJs to their maximal approved altitude of [[flight level]] 410 (FL410; {{convert|41000|ft}}).\n\nThe accident sequence started when the pilots performed several non-standard maneuvers at {{convert|15000|ft}}, including a pitch-up at 2.3[[g-force|''g'']] (23&nbsp;m/s\u00b2) that induced a [[Stall (flight)|stall]] warning.  They set the [[autopilot]] to climb at {{convert|500|ft/min|abbr=on}} to FL410.  This exceeded the manufacturer's recommended climb rate at altitudes above FL380.  In the attempt to reach FL410, the plane was pulled up at over 1.2''g'', and the [[angle of attack]] became excessive to maintain climb rate in the thinner upper atmosphere.  After reaching FL410, the plane was cruising at 150 knots indicated airspeed (IAS), barely above [[stall speed]], and had over-stressed the engines.\n\nThe anti-stall devices activated while they were at altitude, but the pilots overrode the automatic nose-down that would increase speed to prevent stall.  After four overrides, both engines experienced [[flameout]] and shut down.  The plane then stalled, and the pilots recovered from the stall at FL380 while still having no engine thrust. At that altitude, there were six airports within reach for a forced landing. This led the pilots to pitch nose down in an attempt to restart the engines, which requires a dive sharp enough to attain the required 300 knots IAS for a [[windmill restart]] to make the blades in the turbines windmill at 10% N2 (turbine rotational speed).  The captain did not take the necessary steps to ensure that the first officer achieved the 300 knots IAS or greater airspeed required for the windmill engine restart procedure and then did not demonstrate command authority by taking control of the airplane and accelerating it to at least that speed.\n\nThe turbine blades expanded, however, contacting the honeycomb labyrinth seals and allowing the metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the static interstage static seal (ISS), contracts at a faster rate than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller thermal time constant.  The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the static seal.  If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the static and rotating seal elements.  The resulting [[stiction]] can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the core.  Air turbine starter (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction.<ref>[[NTSB]] Accident Information Brief [http://www.ntsb.gov/events/2005/Pinnacle/exhibits/324035.pdf Update for October 29, 2004].</ref> Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely. The crew ended the descent when they had reached 230 knots indicated airspeed but neither engine core (N2) ever indicated any rotation during the entire descent.  Since they were too high for an [[Auxiliary Power Unit|APU]] start, the [[ram air turbine]] (known as an \"air-driven generator\" on [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] products) was deployed to provide electric power for the aircraft, and the crew donned [[oxygen mask]]s, as the cabin slowly depressurized due to loss of pressurization air from the engines.\n\nThe crew glided for several minutes and then tried to restart engines using the APU at {{convert|13000|ft}}. This was again unsuccessful. They then declared to [[Air Traffic Control]] (ATC) that they had a single-engine flameout.  At this point they had four [[diversion airports]] available to them.  They lost considerable altitude while continuing unsuccessfully to attempt to restart both the left engine (two times) and the right engine (two times) for over 14 minutes, using the emergency restart procedure. Despite their four auxiliary power-unit-assisted engine restart attempts, the pilots were unable to restart the engines because their [[Core lock|cores had locked]]. Without core rotation, recovery from the double engine failure was not possible.

This is the official version of events as determined by that investigation.\n\nInvestigators determined that the two pilots were exploring the performance limits of the empty CRJ-200 on the flight.  The pilots decided to test the limits of the CRJ and join the \"410 club\", referring to pilots who pushed CRJs to their maximal approved altitude of [[flight level]] 410 (FL410; {{convert|41000|ft}}).\n\nThe accident sequence started when the pilots performed several non-standard maneuvers at {{convert|15000|ft}}, including a pitch-up at 2.3[[g-force|''g'']] (23&nbsp;m/s\u00b2) that induced a [[Stall (flight)|stall]] warning.  They set the [[autopilot]] to climb at {{convert|500|ft/min|abbr=on}} to FL410.  This exceeded the manufacturer's recommended climb rate at altitudes above FL380.  In the attempt to reach FL410, the plane was pulled up at over 1.2''g'', and the [[angle of attack]] became excessive to maintain climb rate in the thinner upper atmosphere.  After reaching FL410, the plane was cruising at 150 knots indicated airspeed (IAS), barely above [[stall speed]], and had over-stressed the engines.\n\nThe anti-stall devices activated while they were at altitude, but the pilots overrode the automatic nose-down that would increase speed to prevent stall.  After four overrides, both engines experienced [[flameout]] and shut down.  The plane then stalled, and the pilots recovered from the stall at FL380 while still having no engine thrust. At that altitude, there were six airports within reach for a forced landing. This led the pilots to pitch nose down in an attempt to restart the engines, which requires a dive sharp enough to attain the required 300 knots IAS for a [[windmill restart]] to make the blades in the turbines windmill at 10% N2 (turbine rotational speed).  The captain did not take the necessary steps to ensure that the first officer achieved the 300 knots IAS or greater airspeed required for the windmill engine restart procedure and then did not demonstrate command authority by taking control of the airplane and accelerating it to at least that speed.\n\nThe turbine blades expanded, however, contacting the honeycomb labyrinth seals and allowing the metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the static interstage static seal (ISS), contracts at a faster rate than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller thermal time constant.  The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the static seal.  If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the static and rotating seal elements.  The resulting [[stiction]] can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the core.  Air turbine starter (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction.<ref>[[NTSB]] Accident Information Brief [http://www.ntsb.gov/events/2005/Pinnacle/exhibits/324035.pdf Update for October 29, 2004].</ref> Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely. The crew ended the descent when they had reached 230 knots indicated airspeed but neither engine core (N2) ever indicated any rotation during the entire descent.  Since they were too high for an [[Auxiliary Power Unit|APU]] start, the [[ram air turbine]] (known as an \"air-driven generator\" on [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] products) was deployed to provide electric power for the aircraft, and the crew donned [[oxygen mask]]s, as the cabin slowly depressurized due to loss of pressurization air from the engines.\n\nThe crew glided for several minutes and then tried to restart engines using the APU at {{convert|13000|ft}}. This was again unsuccessful. They then declared to [[Air Traffic Control]] (ATC) that they had a single-engine flameout.  At this point they had four [[diversion airports]] available to them.  They lost considerable altitude while continuing unsuccessfully to attempt to restart both the left engine (two times) and the right engine (two times) for over 14 minutes, using the emergency restart procedure. Despite their four auxiliary power-unit-assisted engine restart attempts, the pilots were unable to restart the engines because their [[Core lock|cores had locked]]. Without core rotation, recovery from the double engine failure was not possible.  At that point, the pilots finally declared to ATC that they had in fact lost both engines.\n\nThe NTSB also determined from flight data recorder information that the [[turbofan]] [[jet engine]] ([[General Electric CF34]]-3B1) engine 2 turbine was operating at 300&nbsp;\u00b0C above the maximal redline temperature of 900&nbsp;\u00b0C at {{convert|41000|ft}}. Engine 1 HPT stayed 100&nbsp;\u00b0C below the redline.\n\nOn January 9, 2007, the NTSB issued its final report on Flight 3701.

Students are then required to spend the second semester at one of either Temple University Japan in Tokyo, Jindal Global Law School in the National Capital Region (Delhi) of India, or Tsinghua University Law School in Beijing, China. Students must maintain a G.P.A. of at least 2.50 (out of 4.0) over the course of the 24 credits they must earn to graduate.\n\n===General LL.M. for International Lawyers===\nTemple offers a general studies LL.M. program for foreign-trained lawyers. With the exception of two required research and writing courses, students can design their own curriculum from more than 180 courses offered annually in American and International law.  General LL.M. degree candidates must successfully complete 24 credit hours of course work with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (out of a possible 4.0).  The program can be completed in two semesters beginning in August and continuing through May.  In addition to the main campus in Philadelphia, the General LL.M. is offered in [[Tokyo]] and [[Beijing]]. Students can also earn up to 6 credits at Temple's six-week summer law program in Rome, Italy. Students in this program must complete classes at the main campus.\n\n===Doctor of Juridical Science===\nThe Doctor of Juridical Science is a research-oriented degree program designed for those seeking to pursue careers as law teachers and scholars of law. Candidates enrolled in the S.J.D. program are required to spend their initial academic year in residence at the main campus in Philadelphia.\n\n===Estate Planning and Employee Benefits Certificates===\nAn Estate Planning Certificate and Employee Benefits Certificate is offered through the Graduate Tax Program for practitioners who do not wish to pursue an LL.M. degree. The ''Estate Planning Certificate'' (EPCERT) exposes students to federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping taxation issues, as well as federal income taxation of trusts and estates.\n\n==Law School Organizations==\n\n===Moot Court===\n[[File:Shusterman Hall - The James E.

The Tokyo program is perhaps the most notable, as it is the only ABA-accredited semester program for law students in [[Japan]].\n\nAdditionally, Temple JD students are eligible to study at the following partner institutions:[[Tsinghua University]], [[University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork|University College Cork]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[Utrecht University]], Jindal Global Law School, [[University of Lucerne]], [[Interamerican University of Puerto Rico School of Law|InterAmerican University]], [[Bocconi University]], and [[University of M\u00fcnster|University of Muenster]].\n\nStudy abroad credits from any program can be used toward the J.D. program or the joint JD/LL.M. in Transnational Law.\n\n==Graduate Law Programs (LL.M., S.J.D., Certificate, Teaching Fellowship)==\nThe Law School offers several advanced degree programs, including Master of Laws Degree (LL.M.) in Trial Advocacy, Transnational Law, Asian Law or Taxation. Certificate programs in Estate Planning and Employee Benefits are offered through the Taxation program.  International lawyers also have the opportunity to design their own curriculum through Temple's General LL.M. program. In addition to the LL.M., Temple offers an advanced degree for aspiring scholars, the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.), and a Graduate Teaching Fellowship program.\n\n*LL.M. in Trial Advocacy\n*LL.M. in Transnational Law\n*LL.M. in Taxation\n\nThe Graduate Tax Program is designed to provide understanding of complex taxation issues.  The program provides candidates with a strong foundation in tax law, as well as the opportunity to develop expertise beyond the level of study offered in J.D. programs. A degree candidate must satisfactorily complete 24 credit hours of course work, including all core curriculum requirements and a writing seminar. Candidates may study on a full-time or part-time basis and all coursework must be completed within four years of matriculation. Applicants must have satisfactorily completed a basic income tax course in law school or demonstrated comparable work experience. An applicant who cannot meet this requirement must take the basic course in taxation offered in Temple's J.D. program in the student's first term after admission to the LL.M. program.\n\n===LL.M. in Asian Law===\nTemple's LL.M. in Asian law is designed for J.D. holders and students who wish to focus on the law of Asian countries, particularly China, Japan and India, the more powerful economies of the region. Students complete the first of two semesters at the Philadelphia campus, taking foundational courses such as Chinese Law, Japanese Law, and Law in Asia. Students are then required to spend the second semester at one of either Temple University Japan in Tokyo, Jindal Global Law School in the National Capital Region (Delhi) of India, or Tsinghua University Law School in Beijing, China. Students must maintain a G.P.A. of at least 2.50 (out of 4.0) over the course of the 24 credits they must earn to graduate.\n\n===General LL.M. for International Lawyers===\nTemple offers a general studies LL.M. program for foreign-trained lawyers. With the exception of two required research and writing courses, students can design their own curriculum from more than 180 courses offered annually in American and International law.  General LL.M. degree candidates must successfully complete 24 credit hours of course work with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (out of a possible 4.0).  The program can be completed in two semesters beginning in August and continuing through May.  In addition to the main campus in Philadelphia, the General LL.M. is offered in [[Tokyo]] and [[Beijing]]. Students can also earn up to 6 credits at Temple's six-week summer law program in Rome, Italy. Students in this program must complete classes at the main campus.\n\n===Doctor of Juridical Science===\nThe Doctor of Juridical Science is a research-oriented degree program designed for those seeking to pursue careers as law teachers and scholars of law. Candidates enrolled in the S.J.D. program are required to spend their initial academic year in residence at the main campus in Philadelphia.\n\n===Estate Planning and Employee Benefits Certificates===\nAn Estate Planning Certificate and Employee Benefits Certificate is offered through the Graduate Tax Program for practitioners who do not wish to pursue an LL.M. degree. The ''Estate Planning Certificate'' (EPCERT) exposes students to federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping taxation issues, as well as federal income taxation of trusts and estates.\n\n==Law School Organizations==\n\n===Moot Court===\n[[File:Shusterman Hall - The James E. Beasley School of Law.jpg|thumb|Shusterman Hall - The James E. Beasley School of Law]]\n[[File:Shusterman Hall.jpg|thumb|Side view of Shusterman Hall]]\nTemple Law's [[Moot court|Moot Court]] was started in the 1950s. Moot Court members are selected as second-year law students through the Samuel L. Polsky Selection Competition, which is held during the fall semester. Polsky participants research and write an appellate brief, then argue both sides of the case before experienced attorneys who serve as appellate court justices. Students receiving the highest scores for brief writing and oral argument are invited to join the Society.\n\n===Law journals===\nTemple Law is home to two student-edited journals and law reviews. The [[Temple Law Review]] is published quarterly, and the [[Temple International and Comparative Law Journal]] is published on a bi-annual basis.\n\n==Employment statistics==\nAccording to Temple's official 2017 ABA-required disclosures, 86% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment ten months after graduation, excluding solo practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.temple.edu/documents/CareerPlanning/ABA-Summary-Report_2013.pdf |title=Annual Placement Reports}}</ref> Temple's [[Law School Transparency]] under-employment score is 16.3%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2016 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job ten months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lstscorereports.com/schools/temple/2013/ |title=Temple University Profile}}</ref>\n\n==Rankings and recognition==\n* In 2018, Temple Beasley School of Law was ranked the 47th best law school overall and 2nd best for Trial Advocacy training by ''[[U.S. News & World Report|US News & World Report]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools|title=2018 Top Law Schools}}</ref>\n* [[Above the Law (blog)|Above the Law]] ranked Temple Law in its annual '''''Top 50 Law Schools''''' report for legal employment outcomes in 2015, 2016 and 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abovethelaw.com/law-school-rankings/top-law-schools/?rf=1|title=The 2017 ATL Top 50 Law School Rankings|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref>\n* [[The National Law Journal|National Law Journal]] ranked Temple Law as the 34th best school in its annual Top 50 Go-To La''w'' Schools report for 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2018/03/08/the-top-50-go-to-law-schools/|title=The Top 50 Go-To Law Schools|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref> The law school ranked 19th for alumni who were promoted to partnership in 2015.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202751499299?slreturn=20160628094526|title=The Top 50 Go-To Law Schools|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref>''\n* ''Super Lawyer'' ranks Temple Law as 6th in Highest Caliber Graduate and Most Prepared to Practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Can you get a job after graduation|url= http://lawschools.superlawyers.com/services-view/job_accessibility|publisher= Super Lawyer|date=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n* As of July 2017, Temple's Pennsylvania Bar Examination passage rate is 84.57% for first time takers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pabarexam.org/pdf/statistics/july/j2017.pdf|title=July 2017 Pennsylvania Bar Examination Statistics|date=2013-10-18|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref>\n[[File:Back entrance of Barrack Hall.jpg|thumb|Back entrance of Barrack Hall]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Lynne Abraham]] (1965), former district attorney of [[Philadelphia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* [[Mari Carmen Aponte]] (1975), appointed by President Barack Obama to the position of U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* [[Amy Banse]] (1987), president of [[Comcast Interactive Media]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* [[Susan Paradise Baxter]] (1983), Judge of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Louis Charles Bechtle]] (1954), Judge of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Edward G.
