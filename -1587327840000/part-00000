It is the second sequel to the 2000 film ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', following the [[direct-to-video]] release of the film ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' in 2005. The series centers on [[Kuzco]], who must graduate from Kuzco Academy to become emperor of the [[Inca Empire]]. [[Yzma]], his former advisor, schemes to sabotage him so she can be empress instead. She is aided by her henchman [[Kronk Pepikrankenitz|Kronk]], while Kuzco is aided by the villager [[Pacha (character)|Pacha]] and fellow student [[Malina (The Emperor's New School)|Malina]]. The series combines [[physical comedy]] with a [[Self-referential humor|self-aware tone]], illustrated by Kuzco frequently [[fourth wall|addressing the viewer directly]].\n\n[[The Walt Disney Company]] developed the series after ''The Emperor's New Groove'' received high ratings in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. Most of the film's cast reprised their roles for the series. [[J. P. Manoux]] replaced [[David Spade]] as Kuzco, and [[Fred Tatasciore]] played Pacha until the original actor, [[John Goodman]], returned for the second season. ''New School'' used [[Traditional animation|traditional 2D animation]] to preserve elements of the film's distinctive art style. The choice of a [[High school (North America)|high school]] setting was made to explore Kuzco's lack of [[social etiquette]] and provide for storylines based on the everyday challenges of adolescence. \n\nIn January{{nbsp}}2006, ''New School'' premiered on four platforms: Disney Channel, ABC, [[Toon Disney]], and [[Disney Channel On Demand]]. The series was canceled after Kitt's death in 2008. Both seasons have been distributed via [[Digital distribution|digital download]] on the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Streaming media|streaming]] through [[Disney+]]. ''New School'' received mixed reviews from critics; several reviewers praised Kitt's voice acting but others found the characters unlikable and critiqued the [[Sexism|sexist]] objectification of Malina. ''New School'' was also criticized for its minimal educational value and frequent displays of socially aggressive behavior.\n\n==Premise==\n\n=== Story and characters ===\n{{See also|List of The

Gannaway had previously worked on television adaptations of other Disney properties, including [[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|''Timon & Pumbaa'']] (a spin-off of ''[[The Lion King]]'' centered on the [[Timon and Pumbaa|two titular characters]]) and ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' (from [[Lilo & Stitch|the film of the same name]]). His work on these shows had established his reputation as the \"go-to guy\" for expanding on pre-existing films.<ref name=\"Source23\" /> ''New Groove'' director [[Mark Dindal]] approved the selection of Gannaway, as the two had become friends following their collaboration on the 1997 animated film ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]''.

According to Gannaway, episodes of the show would feature \"socially redeeming stories\", in which Kuzco works through problems with his teachers and classmates. He also said ''New School'' would be unique because of the unusual character dynamic in the source material: unlike most of Disney's other animated features, which tend to pair serious lead characters with comic sidekicks, ''The Emperor's New Groove'' features a comedic lead character among \"well-defined\" side characters.<ref name=\"Source23\" /> While Gannaway acknowledged viewers might initially dislike Kuzco because of his selfish attitude, he hoped the series would portray him as a \"sympathetic jerk\" who \"really doesn't know any better\".<ref name=\"Source9\" />\n\n=== Cast ===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = [[Patrick Warburton]] (''pictured left in 2010'') was one of several voice actors who reprised their roles for ''New School'', while [[Jessica DiCicco]] (''pictured right in 2014'') voiced a new character in [[The Emperor's New Groove (franchise)|''The Emperor's New Groove'']] franchise.<ref name=\"Source23\" /> \n| image1 = Patrick Warburton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width1 = 203\n| alt1 = = A man with a black shirt and baseball cap is smiling towards the camera.\n| image2 = JessicaDiCicco.jpg\n| width2 = 190\n| alt2 = A woman holding a microphone and smiling towards the camera.\n| align = right}}\n\nA majority of the film's voice cast returned for the series.<ref name=\"August2019Source2\">{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/best-disney-tv-shows-movie-adaptations/|title=10 Best Disney TV Shows That Started As Movies|last=Daley|first=Katerina|date=May 18, 2019|website=[[Screen Rant]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706084107/https://screenrant.com/best-disney-tv-shows-movie-adaptations/|archive-date=July 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Eartha Kitt]] and [[Patrick Warburton]] reprised their roles as Yzma and Kronk, respectively.<ref name=\"Source23\" /> Kitt repeatedly expressed her enthusiastic attachment to the character.

According to filings made in accordance with [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] rules, the [[target audience|target age]] of ''New School'' is 8{{en dash}}11 years old.<ref name=\"FCC1\" />\n\nThe series was criticized in a 2007 survey by Children's Media Policy Coalition (CMPC), an [[advocacy group]] made up of member organizations Children Now, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[Benton Foundation]], the [[Parent\u2013teacher_association#PTA|National PTA]], and Office of Communication of the [[United Church of Christ]]. The CMPC's survey of 25 shows identified ''New School'' as one of 17 that \"contained only social-emotional messages\" without any academic or informational content. The report judged the moral messages in ''New School'' to be unsuccessful, as the characters either fail to learn the ostensible lessons or learn them only on a superficial level, without any meaningful reason or corresponding character development.<ref name=\"FCC1\" /> While analyzing the episode \"Officer Kronk\", the CMPC noted that \"Kuzco never has to face a personal conflict or find a resolution, nor are there any real repercussions for Kuzco's anti-social behavior (other than his eventual loneliness).\"<ref name=\"FCC1\" /><ref name=\"FCC2\">[[#Response2007|MacBride, Mago, & Timmerman (2007)]]: p. 8 (fn. 26)</ref> A reply from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] criticized the CMPC's findings as \"unabashedly subjective\".<ref name=\"FCC3\">[[#Response2007|MacBride, Mago, & Timmerman (2007)]]: pp. 7{{en dash}}8.</ref>\n\nIn a 2008 report for Children Now by [[Communication studies|communication]] professor Barbara Wilson and her colleagues, ''New School'' was among 30 television programs surveyed because they were supposed to be \"educational or informational for preschoolers, elementary-school kids and teenagers as part of federal 'core educational programming' requirements\". According to the report, the characters in ''New School'' displayed some of the highest levels of [[Relational aggression|social aggression]], which the report defined as \"any behavior designed to harm an animate being's self-esteem or social status,\" including \"derisive [[Name calling|name-calling]], [[Social rejection|socially ostracizing someone]], [[gossip]]ing, and spreading hurtful [[rumor]]s.\"<ref>[[#Report2008|Wilson, Kunkel, & Drogos (2008)]]: p. 10</ref> It was one of three series deemed to have high levels of social aggression, alongside ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[Jacob Two-Two (TV series)|Jacob Two-Two]]''.<ref>[[#Report2008|Wilson, Kunkel, & Drogos (2008)]]: pp. 26{{en dash}}27</ref> Wilson noted that, in principle, a children's series could highlight characters who exhibit socially aggressive behaviors to teach children to avoid such behavior, but she doubted whether that message would be adequately conveyed by shows with repeated instances of social aggression, which would be \"far more likely\" to feature such content \"for laughs and to entertain\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/hannah-montana-schools-curious-george/article17974601/|title=Hannah Montana schools Curious George|last=Pearce|first=Tralee|date=November 18, 2008|website=[[The Globe and Mail]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211033602/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/hannah-montana-schools-curious-george/article17974601/|archive-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe show's values as an educational resource has also been assessed in light of its historical setting. Common Sense Media found that it represented a missed opportunity because \"despite the potentially interesting and educational setting (an Incan empire), there's no learning about history or the culture of these people.\"<ref name=\"Source5\" /> Conversely, a review in a [[Spain|Spanish]] journal of [[pedagogy]] believed the series provided an opportunity to introduce students to topics like the cultures and peoples of the pre-Columbian era, as well as the subsequent period of [[European colonization of the Americas]].<ref name=\"Aliaga Serrano p57\">[[#CITEREFAliaga_Serrano2008|Aliaga Serrano (2008)]]: p. 57</ref>\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n''New School'' received several awards and nominations.

It is the second sequel to the 2000 film ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', following the [[direct-to-video]] release of the film ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' in 2005. The series centers on [[Kuzco]], who must graduate from Kuzco Academy to become emperor of the [[Inca Empire]]. [[Yzma]], his former advisor, schemes to sabotage him so she can be empress instead. She is aided by her henchman [[Kronk Pepikrankenitz|Kronk]], while Kuzco is aided by the villager [[Pacha (character)|Pacha]] and fellow student [[Malina (The Emperor's New School)|Malina]]. The series combines [[physical comedy]] with a [[Self-referential humor|self-aware tone]], illustrated by Kuzco frequently [[fourth wall|addressing the viewer directly]].\n\n[[The Walt Disney Company]] developed the series after ''The Emperor's New Groove'' received high ratings in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. Most of the film's cast reprised their roles for the series. [[J. P. Manoux]] replaced [[David Spade]] as Kuzco, and [[Fred Tatasciore]] played Pacha until the original actor, [[John Goodman]], returned for the second season. ''New School'' used [[Traditional animation|traditional 2D animation]] to preserve elements of the film's distinctive art style. The choice of a [[High school (North America)|high school]] setting was made to explore Kuzco's lack of [[social etiquette]] and provide for storylines based on the everyday challenges of adolescence. \n\nIn January{{nbsp}}2006, ''New School'' premiered on four platforms: Disney Channel, ABC, [[Toon Disney]], and [[Disney Channel On Demand]]. The series was canceled after Kitt's death in 2008. Both seasons have been distributed via [[Digital distribution|digital download]] on the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Streaming media|streaming]] through [[Disney+]]. ''New School'' received mixed reviews from critics; several reviewers praised Kitt's voice acting but others found the characters unlikable and critiqued the [[Sexism|sexist]] objectification of Malina. ''New School'' was also criticized for its minimal educational value and frequent displays of socially aggressive behavior.\n\n==Premise==\n\n=== Story and characters ===\n{{See also|List of The

Gannaway had previously worked on television adaptations of other Disney properties, including [[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|''Timon & Pumbaa'']] (a spin-off of ''[[The Lion King]]'' centered on the [[Timon and Pumbaa|two titular characters]]) and ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' (from [[Lilo & Stitch|the film of the same name]]). His work on these shows had established his reputation as the \"go-to guy\" for expanding on pre-existing films.<ref name=\"Source23\" /> ''New Groove'' director [[Mark Dindal]] approved the selection of Gannaway, as the two had become friends following their collaboration on the 1997 animated film ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]''.

According to Gannaway, episodes of the show would feature \"socially redeeming stories\", in which Kuzco works through problems with his teachers and classmates. He also said ''New School'' would be unique because of the unusual character dynamic in the source material: unlike most of Disney's other animated features, which tend to pair serious lead characters with comic sidekicks, ''The Emperor's New Groove'' features a comedic lead character among \"well-defined\" side characters.<ref name=\"Source23\" /> While Gannaway acknowledged viewers might initially dislike Kuzco because of his selfish attitude, he hoped the series would portray him as a \"sympathetic jerk\" who \"really doesn't know any better\".<ref name=\"Source9\" />\n\n=== Cast ===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = [[Patrick Warburton]] (''pictured left in 2010'') was one of several voice actors who reprised their roles for ''New School'', while [[Jessica DiCicco]] (''pictured right in 2014'') voiced a new character in [[The Emperor's New Groove (franchise)|''The Emperor's New Groove'']] franchise.<ref name=\"Source23\" /> \n| image1 = Patrick Warburton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width1 = 203\n| alt1 = = A man with a black shirt and baseball cap is smiling towards the camera.\n| image2 = JessicaDiCicco.jpg\n| width2 = 190\n| alt2 = A woman holding a microphone and smiling towards the camera.\n| align = right}}\n\nA majority of the film's voice cast returned for the series.<ref name=\"August2019Source2\">{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/best-disney-tv-shows-movie-adaptations/|title=10 Best Disney TV Shows That Started As Movies|last=Daley|first=Katerina|date=May 18, 2019|website=[[Screen Rant]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706084107/https://screenrant.com/best-disney-tv-shows-movie-adaptations/|archive-date=July 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Eartha Kitt]] and [[Patrick Warburton]] reprised their roles as Yzma and Kronk, respectively.<ref name=\"Source23\" /> Kitt repeatedly expressed her enthusiastic attachment to the character.

According to filings made in accordance with [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] rules, the [[target audience|target age]] of ''New School'' is 8{{en dash}}11 years old.<ref name=\"FCC1\" />\n\nThe series was criticized in a 2007 survey by Children's Media Policy Coalition (CMPC), an [[advocacy group]] made up of member organizations Children Now, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[Benton Foundation]], the [[Parent\u2013teacher_association#PTA|National PTA]], and Office of Communication of the [[United Church of Christ]]. The CMPC's survey of 25 shows identified ''New School'' as one of 17 that \"contained only social-emotional messages\" without any academic or informational content. The report judged the moral messages in ''New School'' to be unsuccessful, as the characters either fail to learn the ostensible lessons or learn them only on a superficial level, without any meaningful reason or corresponding character development.<ref name=\"FCC1\" /> While analyzing the episode \"Officer Kronk\", the CMPC noted that \"Kuzco never has to face a personal conflict or find a resolution, nor are there any real repercussions for Kuzco's anti-social behavior (other than his eventual loneliness).\"<ref name=\"FCC1\" /><ref name=\"FCC2\">[[#Response2007|MacBride, Mago, & Timmerman (2007)]]: p. 8 (fn. 26)</ref> A reply from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] criticized the CMPC's findings as \"unabashedly subjective\".<ref name=\"FCC3\">[[#Response2007|MacBride, Mago, & Timmerman (2007)]]: pp. 7{{en dash}}8.</ref>\n\nIn a 2008 report for Children Now by [[Communication studies|communication]] professor Barbara Wilson and her colleagues, ''New School'' was among 30 television programs surveyed because they were supposed to contain \"educational or informational for preschoolers, elementary-school kids and teenagers as part of federal 'core educational programming' requirements\".

He later became a member of the British Union of Fascists in the 1930s and was an active recruiter. With the outbreak of the Second World War, he was arrested and interned under Defence Regulations and held first at [[Brixton Prison]], and afterwards at [[Camp 020]] at Latchmere House. He was moved to Ascot internment camp in Berkshire, where he became the unofficial camp leader, producing a newspaper titled ''The Flame'' and negotiating with the camp authorities on behalf of the inmates.\n\nHe was released in 1941 and the following year he was one of those who organised a party to mark [[Oswald Mosley]]'s birthday at which he made a plea for unity and the Britishness of the BUF. He remained involved with British fascism after the war but admitted that the movement was blocked from reconstituting because of its association in the public mind with the Nazis. His memoir of his wartime detention, ''\"It Has Happened Here\"'' is part of the British Union Collection at the University of Sheffield library.\n\n==Early life==\nCharlie Watts was born in [[Croydon]], Surrey,<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2F67-486 Charles Frederick Watts England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837\u20132008.] Family Search.
