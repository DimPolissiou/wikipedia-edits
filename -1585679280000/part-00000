Stone circles and earth barrows on the moors above the present village have largely been destroyed, although some remain and more are recorded. The most notable site is the [[Wet Withens]] stone circle on Eyam Moor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/wetwithens.htm|title=Wet Withens Embanked Stone Circle - Northwest of Grindleford, Derbyshire|website=www.stone-circles.org.uk}}</ref> Coins bearing the names of many emperors provide evidence of Roman lead-mining locally.<ref>Roger Ridgeway, [http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mining.htm Eyam village site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103002644/http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mining.htm |date=3 November 2014 }}</ref> However, the village's name derives from [[Old English]] and is first recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as Aium. It is a [[dative]] form of the noun ''\u0113g'' (an island) and probably refers to a patch of cultivable land amidst the moors,<ref>Kenneth Cameron, English Place Names, London 1996, p.172</ref> or else to the settlement's situation between two brooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Derbyshire/Eyam|title=Eyam|quote=Probably referring to its situation between Hollow Brook and Jumber Brook|work=Key to English Place-names|publisher=[[English Place Name Society]] at the [[University of Nottingham]]|accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Celtic Cross, Eyam churchyard - geograph.org.uk - 50830.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The Anglo-Saxon cross]]\nIn the churchyard is an [[Anglo-Saxon cross]] in [[Mercia]]n style dated to the 8th century, moved there from its original location beside a moorland cart track.

Sharpe, ''Crosses of the Peak District'' (Landmark Collectors Library, 2002)</ref>\n\nThe present [[parish church]] of St. Lawrence dates from the 14th century, but evidence of an earlier church there can be found in the Saxon font, a Norman window at the west end of the north aisle, and Norman pillars that are thought to rest on Saxon foundations. There have been alterations since the Middle Ages, including a large [[sun dial]] dated 1775 mounted on a wall outside. Some of the Rectors at the church have had contentious histories, none less so than the fanatically [[Cavalier|Royalist]] Sherland Adams who, it was accused, \"gave tythe of lead ore to the King against the Parliament\", and as a consequence was removed from the living and imprisoned.\n\nThe lead mining tithe was due to the rectors by ancient custom. They received one penny for every 'dish' of ore and twopence farthing for every load of hillock-stuff. Owing to the working of a newly discovered rich vein during the 18th century, the Eyam living was a valuable one. Mining continued into the 19th century, after which better sources were discovered and a change-over was made to the working and treatment of [[fluorspar]] as a slagging agent in [[smelting]]. The last to close was the Ladywash Mine, which was operative between 1948\u201379. Within a 3 miles radius of the village there are 439 known mines, (some running beneath the village itself), that are drained by 49 drainage levels ('soughs').<ref>Doug Nash, [http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mines.htm Eyam village site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323052939/http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mines.htm |date=23 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 1841 Census for Eyam, there were 954 inhabitants living in the parish, chiefly employed in agriculture, lead mining, and cotton and silk weaving. By the 1881 Census, most men either worked as lead miners or in the manufacture of boots and shoes, a trade that only ended in the 1960s. The transition from industrial village to tourist based economy is underlined by Roger Ridgeway's statement that, at the beginning of the 20th century, \"a hundred horses and carts would have been seen taking fluorspar to Grindleford and Hassop stations. Today, up to a dozen coach loads of visiting children arrive each day in the village.\"<ref>Eyam Village site, [http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mining.htm \"Mining and Industry\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103002644/http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mining.htm |date=3 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==1665 plague outbreak==\n{{main|Great Plague of London}}\n{{see also|Protective sequestration}}\nThe history of the plague in the village began in 1665 when a [[flea]]-infested bundle of cloth arrived from London\nfor the local tailor.<ref name=\"pbs\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/case_plague/index.html |title=Mystery of the Black Death |accessdate=12 April 2007 |work=[[Secrets of the Dead]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] }}</ref> Within a week his assistant George Viccars was dead and more began dying in the household soon after.<ref name=Clifford>Clifford (1989)</ref>\n\nAs the disease spread, the villagers turned for leadership to their [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], the [[Reverend William Mompesson]], and the [[Great Ejection|ejected]] [[Puritan]] minister Thomas Stanley. They introduced a number of precautions to slow the spread of the illness from May 1666. The measures included the arrangement that families were to bury their own dead and relocation of church services to the natural amphitheatre of Cucklett Delph,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://picturethepast.org.uk/image-library/image-details/poster/DCHQ002441/posterid/DCHQ002441.html|title=Eyam - Cucklett Church in the Delph|website=Picture the Past}}</ref> allowing villagers to separate themselves and so reducing the risk of infection. Perhaps the best-known decision was to [[quarantine]] the entire village to prevent further spread of the disease.\n\nThe plague ran its course over 14 months and one account states that it killed at least 260 villagers, with only 83 surviving out of a population of 350.<ref name=Clifford /> That figure has been challenged on a number of occasions, with alternative figures of 430 survivors from a population of around 800 being given.<ref name=Clifford /> The church in Eyam has a record of 273 individuals who were victims of the plague.<ref name=\"victims\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyamplaguevillage.co.uk/index.php/eyam-plague/plague-victims|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311041739/http://www.eyamplaguevillage.co.uk/index.php/eyam-plague/plague-victims|url-status=dead|title=List of plague victims|archivedate=11 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nSurvival among those affected appeared random, as many who remained alive had close contact with those who died but never caught the disease. For example, Elizabeth Hancock was uninfected despite burying six children and her husband in eight days. The graves are known as the Riley graves after the farm where they lived.<ref name=\"pbs\" /> The unofficial village [[gravedigger]], Marshall Howe, also survived, despite handling many infected bodies.<ref name=Clifford />\n\nThe village's actions prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Brown|first=Zach Purser|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/03/02/bubonic-plague-coronavirus-quarantine-eyam-england/|title=Bubonic plague was so deadly an English village quarantined itself to save others|date=2 March 2020|work=The Washington Post|access-date=18 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plague Sunday===\nPlague Sunday has been celebrated in the village since the plague's bicentenary in 1866. Originally celebrated in mid-August, it now takes place in Cucklett Delph on the last Sunday in August, coinciding with the (much older) [[Wakes Week]] and [[well dressing]] ceremonies.<ref> Wallis (2006).</ref>\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[Image:Boundary Stone, Eyam.jpg|thumb|right|The Boundary Stone]]\nToday Eyam has various plague-related places of interest. One is the Coolstone in which money, usually soaked in vinegar, which was believed to kill the infection, was placed in exchange for food and medicine. It is just one of several 'plague stones' that served to make the boundary that should not be crossed by either inhabitant or outsider. Another site is the isolated enclosure of the Riley graves mentioned above, which is now under the guardianship of the [[National Trust]].\n\nA reminder of the village's industrial past remains in the name of its only pub, the Miner's Arms. Built in 1630, before the plague, it was originally called The Kings Arms.

Up the main street is the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]]-styled [[Eyam Hall]], built just after the plague. It was leased and managed by the National Trust for five years until December 2017 but is now run by the owners (the Wright Family). The green opposite has an ancient set of village [[stocks]] reputedly used to punish the locals for minor crimes.\n\nCatherine Mompesson's tabletop grave is in the churchyard and has a wreath laid on it every Plague Sunday. This is in remembrance of her constancy in staying by her husband, rather than moving away with the rest of her family, and dying in the very last days of the plague. The church's burial register also records \"Anna the traveller, who according to her own account, was 136 years of age\" and was interred on 30 December 1663. A more recent arrival there is the cricketer [[Harry Bagshaw]], who played for Derbyshire and then acted as a respected umpire after retiring. At the apex of his headstone is a hand with a finger pointing upwards. Underneath the lettering a set of stumps is carved, with the bails flying off and a bat which has just hit the wicket.<ref name=GENUKI>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/DBY/Eyam/HarryBagshaw.html |first=Alan |last=Jacques |title=''Harry the Umpire'' (Harry Bagshaw, 1859\u20131927) |publisher=UK & Ireland Genealogy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010115537/http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/DBY/Eyam/HarryBagshaw.html |archivedate=10 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\nRespect for its heritage has not always been a priority in Eyam. In his ''Peak Scenery'' (1824), [[Ebenezer Rhodes]] charges that by the start of the 19th century many former gravestones of plague victims had been pulled up to floor houses and barns and that ploughing was allowed to encroach on the Riley Graves (pp.&nbsp;34\u20135); that the lime trees planted on either side of Mrs Mompesson's grave had been cut down for timber (39\u201340); that the missing piece from the shaft of the Saxon Cross had been broken up for domestic use (p.&nbsp;44); and that in general the profit of the living was put before respect for the dead (46\u20137).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/peaksceneryorder00rhodrich|title=Peak scenery; or, The Derbyshire tourist|first=Ebenezer|last=Rhodes|date=28 March 1824|publisher=London, Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green, and the author, Sheffield|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural representations==\n===Paintings===\n[[Eyam Museum]] was opened in 1994 and, besides its focus on the plague, includes exhibits on the village's local history in general.

Stone circles and earth barrows on the moors above the present village have largely been destroyed, although some remain and more are recorded. The most notable site is the Wet Withens stone circle on Eyam Moor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/wetwithens.htm|title=Wet Withens Embanked Stone Circle - Northwest of Grindleford, Derbyshire|website=www.stone-circles.org.uk}}</ref> Coins bearing the names of many emperors provide evidence of Roman lead-mining locally.<ref>Roger Ridgeway, [http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mining.htm Eyam village site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103002644/http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mining.htm |date=3 November 2014 }}</ref> However, the village's name derives from [[Old English]] and is first recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as Aium.

Sharpe, ''Crosses of the Peak District'' (Landmark Collectors Library, 2002)</ref>\n\nThe present [[parish church]] of St. Lawrence dates from the 14th century, but evidence of an earlier church there can be found in the Saxon font, a Norman window at the west end of the north aisle, and Norman pillars that are thought to rest on Saxon foundations. There have been alterations since the Middle Ages, including a large [[sun dial]] dated 1775 mounted on a wall outside. Some of the Rectors at the church have had contentious histories, none less so than the fanatically [[Cavalier|Royalist]] Sherland Adams who, it was accused, \"gave tythe of lead ore to the King against the Parliament\", and as a consequence was removed from the living and imprisoned.\n\nThe lead mining tithe was due to the rectors by ancient custom. They received one penny for every 'dish' of ore and twopence farthing for every load of hillock-stuff. Owing to the working of a newly discovered rich vein during the 18th century, the Eyam living was a valuable one. Mining continued into the 19th century, after which better sources were discovered and a change-over was made to the working and treatment of [[fluorspar]] as a slagging agent in [[smelting]]. The last to close was the Ladywash Mine, which was operative between 1948\u201379. Within a 3 miles radius of the village there are 439 known mines, (some running beneath the village itself), that are drained by 49 drainage levels ('soughs').<ref>Doug Nash, [http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mines.htm Eyam village site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323052939/http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mines.htm |date=23 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 1841 Census for Eyam, there were 954 inhabitants living in the parish, chiefly employed in agriculture, lead mining, and cotton and silk weaving. By the 1881 Census, most men either worked as lead miners or in the manufacture of boots and shoes, a trade that only ended in the 1960s. The transition from industrial village to tourist based economy is underlined by Roger Ridgeway's statement that, at the beginning of the 20th century, \"a hundred horses and carts would have been seen taking fluorspar to Grindleford and Hassop stations. Today, up to a dozen coach loads of visiting children arrive each day in the village.\"<ref>Eyam Village site, [http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mining.htm \"Mining and Industry\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103002644/http://www.eyamvillage.org.uk/mining.htm |date=3 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==1665 plague outbreak==\n{{main|Great Plague of London}}\n{{see also|Protective sequestration}}\nThe history of the plague in the village began in 1665 when a [[flea]]-infested bundle of cloth arrived from London\nfor the local tailor.<ref name=\"pbs\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/case_plague/index.html |title=Mystery of the Black Death |accessdate=12 April 2007 |work=[[Secrets of the Dead]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] }}</ref> Within a week his assistant George Viccars was dead and more began dying in the household soon after.<ref name=Clifford>Clifford (1989)</ref>\n\nAs the disease spread, the villagers turned for leadership to their [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], the [[Reverend William Mompesson]], and the [[Great Ejection|ejected]] [[Puritan]] minister Thomas Stanley. They introduced a number of precautions to slow the spread of the illness from May 1666. The measures included the arrangement that families were to bury their own dead and relocation of church services to the natural amphitheatre of Cucklett Delph,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://picturethepast.org.uk/image-library/image-details/poster/DCHQ002441/posterid/DCHQ002441.html|title=Eyam - Cucklett Church in the Delph|website=Picture the Past}}</ref> allowing villagers to separate themselves and so reducing the risk of infection. Perhaps the best-known decision was to [[quarantine]] the entire village to prevent further spread of the disease.\n\nThe plague ran its course over 14 months and one account states that it killed at least 260 villagers, with only 83 surviving out of a population of 350.<ref name=Clifford /> That figure has been challenged on a number of occasions, with alternative figures of 430 survivors from a population of around 800 being given.<ref name=Clifford /> The church in Eyam has a record of 273 individuals who were victims of the plague.<ref name=\"victims\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyamplaguevillage.co.uk/index.php/eyam-plague/plague-victims|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311041739/http://www.eyamplaguevillage.co.uk/index.php/eyam-plague/plague-victims|url-status=dead|title=List of plague victims|archivedate=11 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nSurvival among those affected appeared random, as many who remained alive had close contact with those who died but never caught the disease. For example, Elizabeth Hancock was uninfected despite burying six children and her husband in eight days. The graves are known as the Riley graves after the farm where they lived.<ref name=\"pbs\" /> The unofficial village [[gravedigger]], Marshall Howe, also survived, despite handling many infected bodies.<ref name=Clifford />\n\nThe village's actions prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Brown|first=Zach Purser|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/03/02/bubonic-plague-coronavirus-quarantine-eyam-england/|title=Bubonic plague was so deadly an English village quarantined itself to save others|date=2 March 2020|work=The Washington Post|access-date=18 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plague Sunday===\nPlague Sunday has been celebrated in the village since the plague's bicentenary in 1866. Originally celebrated in mid-August, it now takes place in Cucklett Delph on the last Sunday in August, coinciding with the (much older) [[Wakes Week]] and [[well dressing]] ceremonies.<ref> Wallis (2006).</ref>\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[Image:Boundary Stone, Eyam.jpg|thumb|right|The Boundary Stone]]\nToday Eyam has various plague-related places of interest. One is the Coolstone in which money, usually soaked in vinegar, which was believed to kill the infection, was placed in exchange for food and medicine. It is just one of several 'plague stones' that served to make the boundary that should not be crossed by either inhabitant or outsider. Another site is the isolated enclosure of the Riley graves mentioned above, which is now under the guardianship of the [[National Trust]].\n\nA reminder of the village's industrial past remains in the name of its only pub, the Miner's Arms. Built in 1630, before the plague, it was originally called The Kings Arms. Opposite the church is the [[Mechanics' Institute]], originally established in 1824,<ref>White (1857), p.570.</ref> although the present building with its handsome pillared portico dates from 1859 and was enlarged in 1894. At one time it held a library paid for by subscription, which then contained 766 volumes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wishful-thinking.org.uk/genuki/DBY/Eyam/MechanicsInstitute.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070824201348/http://www.wishful-thinking.org.uk/genuki/DBY/Eyam/MechanicsInstitute.html|url-status=dead|title=Wishful Thinking|archivedate=24 August 2007}}</ref> The premises now double as the village club. Up the main street is the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]]-styled [[Eyam Hall]], built just after the plague. It was leased and managed by the National Trust for five years until December 2017 but is now run by the owners (the Wright Family). The green opposite has an ancient set of village [[stocks]] reputedly used to punish the locals for minor crimes.\n\nCatherine Mompesson's tabletop grave is in the churchyard and has a wreath laid on it every Plague Sunday. This is in remembrance of her constancy in staying by her husband, rather than moving away with the rest of her family, and dying in the very last days of the plague. The church's burial register also records \"Anna the traveller, who according to her own account, was 136 years of age\" and was interred on 30 December 1663. A more recent arrival there is the cricketer [[Harry Bagshaw]], who played for Derbyshire and then acted as a respected umpire after retiring. At the apex of his headstone is a hand with a finger pointing upwards. Underneath the lettering a set of stumps is carved, with the bails flying off and a bat which has just hit the wicket.<ref name=GENUKI>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/DBY/Eyam/HarryBagshaw.html |first=Alan |last=Jacques |title=''Harry the Umpire'' (Harry Bagshaw, 1859\u20131927) |publisher=UK & Ireland Genealogy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010115537/http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/DBY/Eyam/HarryBagshaw.html |archivedate=10 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\nRespect for its heritage has not always been a priority in Eyam. In his ''Peak Scenery'' (1824), [[Ebenezer Rhodes]] charges that by the start of the 19th century many former gravestones of plague victims had been pulled up to floor houses and barns and that ploughing was allowed to encroach on the Riley Graves (pp.&nbsp;34\u20135); that the lime trees planted on either side of Mrs Mompesson's grave had been cut down for timber (39\u201340); that the missing piece from the shaft of the Saxon Cross had been broken up for domestic use (p.&nbsp;44); and that in general the profit of the living was put before respect for the dead (46\u20137).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/peaksceneryorder00rhodrich|title=Peak scenery; or, The Derbyshire tourist|first=Ebenezer|last=Rhodes|date=28 March 1824|publisher=London, Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green, and the author, Sheffield|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural representations==\n===Paintings===\n[[Eyam Museum]] was opened in 1994 and, besides its focus on the plague, includes exhibits on the village's local history in general.

During the 18th century the place was notable for having no fewer than four poets associated with it. [[Reverend Peter Cunningham]], curate there between 1775 and 1790, published two sermons during that time as well as several poems of a political nature.

[[Jeremy Siegel]] uses the term \"return to the mean\" to describe a general principle, a financial [[time series]] in which \"returns can be very unstable in the short run but very stable in the long run.\" Quantitatively,  it is the [[standard deviation]] of average annual returns that declines faster than the inverse of the holding period, implying that the process is not a [[random walk]], but that periods of lower returns are then  followed by compensating periods of higher returns, for example in seasonal businesses.<sup>[[Regression toward the mean#cite note-8|[8]]]</sup>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Convergence trade]]\n* [[Cointegration]]\n* [[Regression toward the mean]]\n* [[Pairs trade]]\n* [[Ornstein&ndash;Uhlenbeck process]]\n* [[Trend following]]\n* [[Gambler's fallacy]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bus.lsu.edu/economics/papers/pap03_10.pdf A Mean-Reversion Theory of Stock-Market Crashes]\n*[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1608822 Reversion to the Mean, Taken to the Extreme]\n\n{{stock market}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mean Reversion (Finance)}}\n[[Category:Market trends]]\n", "name_user": "VlPetrov", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a clear note that the mean reversion serves as the cornerstone of multiple trading models.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reversion_(finance)"}

The purpose of the Act was to address gender inequality and the diminished rights of women in customary marriages. The Act was passed in order to improve the position of such women by using measures which brought customary law in line with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, as well as South Africa\u2019s international human rights commitments. \n\nA key requirements for a customary marriage to be recognised as a valid marriage is that the marriage must be negotiated, entered into or celebrated in accordance with customary law. Furthermore, the prospective spouses must be of the age of 18 years, and both prospective spouses must consent to the marriage. Until the recent Johannesburg High Court judgement in [[Sengadi v Tsambo]] 3 November 2018 <ref>{{cite  web|title=Sengadi v Tsambo (40344/2018) [2018] ZAGPJHC 613 (3 November 2018)|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPJHC/2018/613.html|website=SAFLII}}</ref>, there has been contention and confusion as to what constitutes a valid customary marriage. In the case involving the widow of renowned hip hop musician Jabulani Tsambo, also known as HHP, her status as the legally recognised customary wife was primarily what was in question. Here the family of the deceased refused to acknowledge Lerato Sengadi as the customary wife on the basis that there had not been a customary \u2018handover ceremony\u2019 of the bride to the family of the groom, which would meet the requirements of a \u2018\u2019celebration\u2019\u2019 in accordance with customary law, and therefore no customary law marriage was concluded or came into existence between the deceased and Sengadi. On examination of the evidence, the Judge concluded that in fact, there had been a tacit  waiver of this custom because a \u2018\u2019symbolic\u2019\u2019 handing over of the applicant to the Tsambo family occurred after the conclusion of the customary law marriage. As the Judge put it:\n{{cquote|The respondent's insistence that the most crucial part of a customary law marriage is the handing over of the bride to the bridegrooms family, that if this did not occur no valid customary law marriage comes into existence despite the couple having complied with the requirements of section 3(1) of the Recognition Act cannot be sustainable because the respondent incorrectly assumes that customary law custom of the handing over since its original conceptualisation has not changed, that customary is rigid, static, immutable and ossified. On the contrary African Customary Law, it's a living law because, its practices, customs and usages have evolved over the centuries. The handing over custom as practised in the pre- colonial era has also evolved and adapted to the changed socio economic and cultural norms practised in the modern era.}}<ref>''Sengadi. v. Tsambo'', at para.20 [2018]</ref>\nIn what can be described as a [[Landmark cases|landmark case]], the Judge ruled against the family and declared Sengadi as the lawful spouse of the deceased.\n\n==Negotiations==\nIn South African law, certain requirements must be complied with in order to conclude a valid customary marriage, including the negotiation of the Lobolo. This negotiation is a crucial step towards a valid customary marriage, in law and in culture. A distinction is made between \u2018Lobolo\u2019 or \u2018Lobola\u2019, the tangible form of asset that constitutes an agreed upon dowry, and the Lobola negotiations, the set of legal customary processes that constitutes the fundamental dialogues between the two families and is necessary to establish  the Lobolo and the conclusion of the negotiation. The latter always precedes the former.   \n\nThe process of Lobolo negotiations can be culturally varied, long and complex, and involves many members from both the bride and the groom's extended families;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-341131821.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008194747/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-341131821.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 October 2016|title=Bride Abductions 'A Distortion' of South Africa's Culture|last=Dixon|first=Robyn|date=1 August 2012|work=Investigate HERS|url-access=subscription |access-date=19 September 2016|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> normally, this would just be the uncles of the marrying parties, as well as the fathers, where custom allows. The groom is not allowed to participate directly in the actual negotiations. In some cultures women may be present in the negotiations, while some households hold on to a tradition of not allowing women to actively take part in the negotiations.\n''Ivulamlomo'' is a key process to the negotiation as negotiations cannot begin until this traditional act has been observed. Often, to dispel any tensions between the families, in modern times a bottle of [[brandy]] is placed on the table; however, this is not required nor is the ''vulamlomo'' limited to brandy, and it can be traditional sorghum beer or cash. This is usually not drunk; it is simply a gesture to welcome the guest family and make everyone feel more relaxed, and it is known as ''ivulamlomo'', which, literally translated, is [[Xhosa language|isiXhosa]] for ''mouth opener'' ([[Sotho language|Sotho]] ''pulamolomo'') i.e. price for opening your mouth (to speak) to express the purpose of your visit. It is up to the potential wife\u2019s delegation to decide as to whether to make use of the alcohol or keep it closed.\nLobola cannot be paid in full in one go, the groom's delegation will need to come again after the first negotiations to finish paying for their bride to be. Once the Lobola has been ''paid in full'' then the next step follows which is called Izibizo, which can happen on the day when lobola negotiations are concluded. This step involves the groom's delegation giving the bride's family according to the list that was issued presents, which may include blankets, pinafores, doeks, shawls and three foot pots or grass mats for women and coat, walking stick, hat, beer pots for men. There is then a celebration to mark the occasion.\n\n==Amount==\nIt is generally accepted that cows, at a minimum, are required in a lobolo within the [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] cultures. While differing customs within various regions may contribute in determining an amount of the cash value of each cow, it also depends on the negotiation prowess of the representatives, or ''oonozakuzaku''.\nIn modern times, there has been growing controversy around the amount demanded in certain families deemed by spectators as unreasonably excessive. <ref> name=\"Daily Dispatch\">{{cite news|last1=Mgwatyu|first1=Xolisa|title=Average lobolo about R20,000|work=Daily Dispatch|agency=SA Media|date=24 February 2009}}</ref> Today, negotiations involve setting a price for a single cow and then multiplying the agreed price by the number of cows the new bride is deemed to be worth.<ref name=\"Derby, 2006\">{{cite web|last1=Derby|first1=Ron|title=SA bride price moves from cattle to cash|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2006-12-06-sa-bride-price-moves-from-cattle-to-cash|website=Mail & Guardian|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> The amount due is affected by many different factors including, but not limited to, the education level of the prospective bride, the financial means of the prospective spouses, and whether the prospective bride (or groom) already has children.

A man is seen to love his partner when he strives to save and pay for lobolo. In the Shona and Ndebele cultures in Zimbabwe, Lobolo takes place in a number of stages. At each stage of the ceremony, there are traditions to observe and small amounts to pay. Lobolo is not paid at once, but is a culmination of many different amounts. The amount paid is determined during negotiations and is dependent on various factors. If the groom has been saving up in preparation for the marriage, after hints from his beloved of what the lobolo might be, the process can be concluded in two short stages - the first stage, the mouth opener stage or \"isivulamlomo\", where the groom is given a chance to state his intentions to marry his beloved after putting money in a woven basket, and the bride's family tells the grooms family what they want as lobolo. A date is then set, agreeable to both parties, to meet again. At the time of writing, a cow in Zimbabwe costs $500 and the bride's family can ask for a cash equivalent of the number of cows they want. This is convenient to most families because keeping cattle can be time and labor intensive. The second stage, where the groom's family present themselves on the agreed date, money is again placed in a woven basket to be allowed to speak and fulfills the bride's family requests by presenting all of the lobolo.~~~~</nowiki>\n\nThe price and ceremony for meeting the in-laws is called \"Mbonano\" and is entry to the house. This is followed by \"Guzvi\", a second price for greeting the in-laws and accompanied by the traditional greeting (special clapping depending on culture, noting that the Shona people are 12 different ethnic groups). Subsequent gifts of cash or food are then placed into a special plate that is used for the occasion. This is either bought or borrowed and has a price and ceremonial reference as well: \"Kubvisa ndiro\" (the price of buying or borrowing the plate).\n\nOther gifts or prices include \"Vhuramuromo\" (meaning opening of mouth) for the greeting of the guests, similar to the Xhosa Loloba ''mvulamlomo''. \"Dare\" for calling of the witnesses to the marriage and \"Matsvakirai kuno\" for the explanation of \"How did you meet my daughter\" or \"Who told you that I have a daughter?\"\n\nGifts for the mother of the bride then include \"Mbereko\", for carrying the bride in a pouch or sling when she was a baby, and \"Mafukidzadumbu\" for \"covering of the belly\"; this is alternately translated as \"carrying the baby in the womb\" or \"tucking the baby in with a blanket (when she wakes in the night)\". Among the various stages of the lobolo ceremony, the groom-to-be has to provide outfits for the mother of the bride. These are called \"Nhumbi dzaamai\" and will traditionally include a blanket alongside a standard outfit, while the outfits for the father are called \"Nhumbi dzababa\" and will often be a suit of choice to later wear for the European wedding ceremony (if the couple has one).\n\nA special gift for the father of the bride is the \"Matekenyandebvu\", to acknowledge him for \"the scratching and pulling of the beard\" as she sat on his lap, or putting up with the playful antics of his daughter as a child.\n\nThis is followed by a small allowance for \"Mari inouhongwa nemusihare\" (the purchase of household or cooking utensils), and this amount is given to the bride. If there are younger sisters or siblings, she may give them a portion of the money. This money is for all the cooking that will have taken place for the party which the groom will finance after the ceremony is concluded.\n\nNext comes the actual \"bride price\". This is called \"Rusambo\" and although the process described above is referred to or called \"roora\", this is the name given to the whole ceremony and all of the gifts, not just the bride price or dowry. Traditionally a gift of cattle, this is most commonly paid in cash, although the amounts will still be representative of fair market price for cattle.\n\nThe new groom will also pay for \"Munongedzi wedanga\", a stick used for driving the cattle into the corral. If the cattle are cash equivalents, the stick will also be its cash equivalent. Normally this is given in the form of a walking stick.\n\nGrocery items and outfits are at the discretion of the bride's parents, and will be included and inspected after the Rusambo. Adhering to the stated requirements of the new in-laws is a show of respect from the new son-in-law. It is often advisable to do exactly as stated or better, to ensure smooth relations between the newly united families.\n\nThe final stage includes a party financed by the newly acquired groom.\n\nAfter the gifts are presented, the groom greets the in-laws as a new groom (no longer a prospective groom or stranger, but a member of the family) with the special traditional clapping greeting and is permitted to be a part of the household. In some traditional circumstances, the younger siblings of the new bride may also see the groom as an alternate husband and he may be responsible for their welfare. In the past, the younger sisters could also be offered as alternate wives in the case of death of the bride (older daughter), in similar fashion to ancient (Mosaic) Jewish tradition. This tradition has fast fallen away due to urbanisation, migration and HIV/AIDS (no source provided). Once welcomed to the family, the groom ''may'' be given an animal totem depending on the ethnic group he marries into. He would be given a respectful title such as 'MUKWASHA' which means son-in-law. Other titles could be 'babamukuru' or 'babamunini' depending on the relationships in the family (if he marries an older sister, he becomes \"babamukuru\" to the younger siblings and if he is married to a younger sister, he is \"babamunini\" to those sisters who are older than his wife).\n\nIn certain Shona groups, even after the main ceremony, lobolo still needs to be paid in small amounts after the birth of a child or after 20 years, this is to continually thank and acknowledge the wife's family.\n\n==Negative effects==\nLobolo may have some unintended negative effects. It may create a financial barrier for some young men looking to take a bride. It is common for a couple that is emotionally ready to commit to each other to stay unmarried if the man does not have the financial resources to satisfy the impeding traditional ritual, and in some cases the bride-to-be who has the financial resources secretly pays her own Lobolo by giving the money to the man who in turn hands it over to the brides family. For those who do have the financial means, the issue can be Lobolo's [[opportunity cost]]. Young men who are in the wealth-creation stage of life may feel that their future is better secured if they invest their money elsewhere to receive significant financial returns.\n\nLobolo is seen by some as an extravagance that has little relevance in a society where young Africans are trying to lift themselves out of poverty. However, the tradition is still adhered to as strongly as ever, and in families where tradition and intention override greed, Lobolo can be a great way of showing commitment between families, not just between the bride and groom. Lobolo is also seen by some rural South African woman as a sign of respect in that it symbolises their worth and reinforces their dignity.<ref name=Shope>{{cite journal|last1=Shope|first1=Janet Hinson|title=\"Lobola is here to stay\": rural black women and the contradictory meanings of lobolo in post-apartheid South Africa|journal=Agenda: Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2006|issue=68|pages=64\u201372|jstor = 4066766}}</ref> Many traditional marriages utilise a cash-based Lobolo; this can be then followed by a European-style wedding ceremony, where the Lobolo funds are used to pay for expenses. In this way, any outlaid costs are returned to the payer in another form, preserving tradition, honour and finances.\n\nRecently, the meaning of lobolo has been abused. The bride's families are demanding huge amounts of money from the groom's family and in turn, lobolo is now more of a money-generating-scheme from most families. Instead of simple gifts for lobolo payment-as it was in the 20th century and beyond, fathers are demanding outrageous amounts for their daughters. This has given some men in the African society the 'right' to abuse and ill-treat their wives because they feel that they bought them. There is no gender equality because (in some views) the system  \"promotes male superiority\" where the voices of women do not matter nor their importance acknowledged.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chiweshe|first1=Manase Kudzai|title=Wives At the Market Place: Commercialization Lobola and Commodification Of Women's Bodies In Zimbabwe|journal=The Oriental Anthropologist|date=1 July 2016|volume=16|issue=2|pages=229\u2013243}}</ref>\n\nUsually African men are keen to marry their girlfriends, however there are hindrances which may prevent this. As mentioned in the above paragraph finance is the main one. Other potential hindrances are family members not approving their future son-in-law, a bitter past where the parents dig out dirt.\nIt is important that a couple communicates these issues openly with each other so that they can protect their other half should anything occur\n\n==Dissolution==\nThe dissolution of a customary marriage occurs on the death of the husband or wife. However, the marriage could continue if the woman is transferred to a brother of the deceased to sire an heir. In the event that the woman returns to her father\u2019s house as a result of alleged abuse, the husband may have to pay a fine to the father, prior to fetching (phutuma) her. If the husband does not fetch her within reasonable time, then it would be assumed that he had intended to dissolve the marriage. If the wife refuses to return to the husband, then the husband may make a claim to a portion of the lobola. If the husband wishes to end the marriage, he could send her back to her father\u2019s house. Should the wife initiate the divorce, the father will have to repay some of the lobola.<ref name=\"Herbst and Du Plessis\">{{cite journal|last1=Herbst|first1=Marissa|last2=Du Plessis|first2=Willemien|title=Customary Law v Common Law Marriages: A Hybrid Approach in South Africa|journal=Electronic J of Comparative Law|date=2008|volume=410|issue=1989|pages=1\u201315}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Umtsimba]] - Swazi marriage ceremony\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://chora.virtualave.net/lobola-hiv.htm Lobola, AIDS and Africa]\n* [http://www.zimdiaspora.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2796:ma-hangs-at-in-laws-home-after-lobala-dispute&catid=38:travel-tips&Itemid=18 Man hangs at in-laws home after lobola dispute]\n* [http://www.africanbookscollective.com/books/lobola-its-implications-for-womens-reproductive-rights Lobola: Its Implications for Women's Reproductive Rights]\n\n[[Category:Xhosa culture]]\n[[Category:Zulu culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{moresources|date=February 2017}}\n{{tone|date=September 2014}}\n\n'''Lobola''' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Swazi language|Swazi]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Silozi]] and [[Northern Ndebele language|northern]] and [[Southern Ndebele language|southern Ndebele]] ('''''Mahadi''''' in [[Sesotho]], '''''Roora''''' in [[Shona language|Shona]], '''''Magadi''''' in [[Tswana language|Setswana]], '''''Lovola''''' in [[Tsonga language|Xitsonga]]), and '''''Mamalo''''' in Tshivenda Language,  sometimes referred to as \"bride wealth\"<ref name=\"Herbst and Du Plessis\"/> <ref name=Matthews>{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=Z.

Here the family of the deceased refused to acknowledge Lerato Sengadi as the customary wife on the basis that there had not been a customary \u2018handover ceremony\u2019 of the bride to the family of the groom, which would meet the requirements of a \u2018\u2019celebration\u2019\u2019 in accordance with customary law, and therefore no customary law marriage was concluded or came into existence between the deceased and Sengadi. On examination of the evidence, the Judge concluded that in fact, there had been a tacit  waiver of this custom because a \u2018\u2019symbolic\u2019\u2019 handing over of the applicant to the Tsambo family occurred after the conclusion of the customary law marriage. As the Judge put it:\n{{cquote|The respondent's insistence that the most crucial part of a customary law marriage is the handing over of the bride to the bridegrooms family, that if this did not occur no valid customary law marriage comes into existence despite the couple having complied with the requirements of section 3(1) of the Recognition Act cannot be sustainable because the respondent incorrectly assumes that customary law custom of the handing over since its original conceptualisation has not changed, that customary is rigid, static, immutable and ossified. On the contrary African Customary Law, it's a living law because, its practices, customs and usages have evolved over the centuries. The handing over custom as practised in the pre- colonial era has also evolved and adapted to the changed socio economic and cultural norms practised in the modern era.}}<ref>''Sengadi. v. Tsambo'', at para.20 [2018]</ref>\nIn what can be described as a [[Landmark cases|landmark case]], the Judge ruled against the family and declared Sengadi as the lawful spouse of the deceased.\n\n==Negotiations==\nIn South African law, certain requirements must be complied with in order to conclude a valid customary marriage, including the negotiation of the Lobolo. This negotiation is a crucial step towards a valid customary marriage, in law and in culture. A distinction is made between \u2018Lobolo\u2019 or \u2018Lobola\u2019, the tangible form of asset that constitutes an agreed upon dowry, and the Lobola negotiations, the set of legal customary processes that constitutes the fundamental dialogues between the two families and is necessary to establish  the Lobolo and the conclusion of the negotiation. The latter always precedes the former.   \n\nThe process of Lobolo negotiations can be culturally varied, long and complex, and involves many members from both the bride and the groom's extended families;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-341131821.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008194747/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-341131821.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 October 2016|title=Bride Abductions 'A Distortion' of South Africa's Culture|last=Dixon|first=Robyn|date=1 August 2012|work=Investigate HERS|url-access=subscription |access-date=19 September 2016|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> normally, this would just be the uncles of the marrying parties, as well as the fathers, where custom allows. The groom is not allowed to participate directly in the actual negotiations. In some cultures women may be present in the negotiations, while some households hold on to a tradition of not allowing women to actively take part in the negotiations.\n''Ivulamlomo'' is a key process to the negotiation as negotiations cannot begin until this traditional act has been observed. Often, to dispel any tensions between the families, in modern times a bottle of [[brandy]] is placed on the table; however, this is not required nor is the ''vulamlomo'' limited to brandy, and it can be traditional sorghum beer or cash. This is usually not drunk; it is simply a gesture to welcome the guest family and make everyone feel more relaxed, and it is known as ''ivulamlomo'', which, literally translated, is [[Xhosa language|isiXhosa]] for ''mouth opener'' ([[Sotho language|Sotho]] ''pulamolomo'') i.e. price for opening your mouth (to speak) to express the purpose of your visit. It is up to the potential wife\u2019s delegation to decide as to whether to make use of the alcohol or keep it closed.\nLobola cannot be paid in full in one go, the groom's delegation will need to come again after the first negotiations to finish paying for their bride to be. Once the Lobola has been ''paid in full'' then the next step follows which is called Izibizo, which can happen on the day when lobola negotiations are concluded. This step involves the groom's delegation giving the bride's family according to the list that was issued presents, which may include blankets, pinafores, doeks, shawls and three foot pots or grass mats for women and coat, walking stick, hat, beer pots for men. There is then a celebration to mark the occasion.\n\n==Amount==\nIt is generally accepted that cows, at a minimum, are required in a lobolo within the [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] cultures. While differing customs within various regions may contribute in determining an amount of the cash value of each cow, it also depends on the negotiation prowess of the representatives, or ''oonozakuzaku''.\nIn modern times, there has been growing controversy around the amount demanded in certain families deemed by spectators as unreasonably excessive. <ref> name=\"Daily Dispatch\">{{cite news|last1=Mgwatyu|first1=Xolisa|title=Average lobolo about R20,000|work=Daily Dispatch|agency=SA Media|date=24 February 2009}}</ref> Today, negotiations involve setting a price for a single cow and then multiplying the agreed price by the number of cows the new bride is deemed to be worth.<ref name=\"Derby, 2006\">{{cite web|last1=Derby|first1=Ron|title=SA bride price moves from cattle to cash|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2006-12-06-sa-bride-price-moves-from-cattle-to-cash|website=Mail & Guardian|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> The amount due is affected by many different factors including, but not limited to, the education level of the prospective bride, the financial means of the prospective spouses, and whether the prospective bride (or groom) already has children.

A man is seen to love his partner when he strives to save and pay for lobolo. In the Shona and Ndebele cultures in Zimbabwe, Lobolo takes place in a number of stages. At each stage of the ceremony, there are traditions to observe and small amounts to pay. Lobolo is not paid at once, but is a culmination of many different amounts. The amount paid is determined during negotiations and is dependent on various factors. If the groom has been saving up in preparation for the marriage, after hints from his beloved of what the lobolo might be, the process can be concluded in two short stages - the first stage, the mouth opener stage or \"isivulamlomo\", where the groom is given a chance to state his intentions to marry his beloved after putting money in a woven basket, and the bride's family tells the grooms family what they want as lobolo. A date is then set, agreeable to both parties, to meet again. At the time of writing, a cow in Zimbabwe costs $500 and the bride's family can ask for a cash equivalent of the number of cows they want. This is convenient to most families because keeping cattle can be time and labor intensive. The second stage, where the groom's family present themselves on the agreed date, money is again placed in a woven basket to be allowed to speak and fulfills the bride's family requests by presenting all of the lobolo.~~~~</nowiki>\n\nThe price and ceremony for meeting the in-laws is called \"Mbonano\" and is entry to the house. This is followed by \"Guzvi\", a second price for greeting the in-laws and accompanied by the traditional greeting (special clapping depending on culture, noting that the Shona people are 12 different ethnic groups). Subsequent gifts of cash or food are then placed into a special plate that is used for the occasion. This is either bought or borrowed and has a price and ceremonial reference as well: \"Kubvisa ndiro\" (the price of buying or borrowing the plate).\n\nOther gifts or prices include \"Vhuramuromo\" (meaning opening of mouth) for the greeting of the guests, similar to the Xhosa Loloba ''mvulamlomo''. \"Dare\" for calling of the witnesses to the marriage and \"Matsvakirai kuno\" for the explanation of \"How did you meet my daughter\" or \"Who told you that I have a daughter?\"\n\nGifts for the mother of the bride then include \"Mbereko\", for carrying the bride in a pouch or sling when she was a baby, and \"Mafukidzadumbu\" for \"covering of the belly\"; this is alternately translated as \"carrying the baby in the womb\" or \"tucking the baby in with a blanket (when she wakes in the night)\". Among the various stages of the lobolo ceremony, the groom-to-be has to provide outfits for the mother of the bride. These are called \"Nhumbi dzaamai\" and will traditionally include a blanket alongside a standard outfit, while the outfits for the father are called \"Nhumbi dzababa\" and will often be a suit of choice to later wear for the European wedding ceremony (if the couple has one).\n\nA special gift for the father of the bride is the \"Matekenyandebvu\", to acknowledge him for \"the scratching and pulling of the beard\" as she sat on his lap, or putting up with the playful antics of his daughter as a child.\n\nThis is followed by a small allowance for \"Mari inouhongwa nemusihare\" (the purchase of household or cooking utensils), and this amount is given to the bride. If there are younger sisters or siblings, she may give them a portion of the money. This money is for all the cooking that will have taken place for the party which the groom will finance after the ceremony is concluded.\n\nNext comes the actual \"bride price\". This is called \"Rusambo\" and although the process described above is referred to or called \"roora\", this is the name given to the whole ceremony and all of the gifts, not just the bride price or dowry. Traditionally a gift of cattle, this is most commonly paid in cash, although the amounts will still be representative of fair market price for cattle.\n\nThe new groom will also pay for \"Munongedzi wedanga\", a stick used for driving the cattle into the corral. If the cattle are cash equivalents, the stick will also be its cash equivalent. Normally this is given in the form of a walking stick.\n\nGrocery items and outfits are at the discretion of the bride's parents, and will be included and inspected after the Rusambo. Adhering to the stated requirements of the new in-laws is a show of respect from the new son-in-law. It is often advisable to do exactly as stated or better, to ensure smooth relations between the newly united families.\n\nThe final stage includes a party financed by the newly acquired groom.\n\nAfter the gifts are presented, the groom greets the in-laws as a new groom (no longer a prospective groom or stranger, but a member of the family) with the special traditional clapping greeting and is permitted to be a part of the household. In some traditional circumstances, the younger siblings of the new bride may also see the groom as an alternate husband and he may be responsible for their welfare. In the past, the younger sisters could also be offered as alternate wives in the case of death of the bride (older daughter), in similar fashion to ancient (Mosaic) Jewish tradition. This tradition has fast fallen away due to urbanisation, migration and HIV/AIDS (no source provided). Once welcomed to the family, the groom ''may'' be given an animal totem depending on the ethnic group he marries into. He would be given a respectful title such as 'MUKWASHA' which means son-in-law. Other titles could be 'babamukuru' or 'babamunini' depending on the relationships in the family (if he marries an older sister, he becomes \"babamukuru\" to the younger siblings and if he is married to a younger sister, he is \"babamunini\" to those sisters who are older than his wife).\n\nIn certain Shona groups, even after the main ceremony, lobolo still needs to be paid in small amounts after the birth of a child or after 20 years, this is to continually thank and acknowledge the wife's family.\n\n==Negative effects==\nLobolo may have some unintended negative effects. It may create a financial barrier for some young men looking to take a bride. It is common for a couple that is emotionally ready to commit to each other to stay unmarried if the man does not have the financial resources to satisfy the impeding traditional ritual, and in some cases the bride-to-be who has the financial resources secretly pays her own Lobolo by giving the money to the man who in turn hands it over to the brides family. For those who do have the financial means, the issue can be Lobolo's [[opportunity cost]]. Young men who are in the wealth-creation stage of life may feel that their future is better secured if they invest their money elsewhere to receive significant financial returns.\n\nLobolo is seen by some as an extravagance that has little relevance in a society where young Africans are trying to lift themselves out of poverty. However, the tradition is still adhered to as strongly as ever, and in families where tradition and intention override greed, Lobolo can be a great way of showing commitment between families, not just between the bride and groom. Lobolo is also seen by some rural South African woman as a sign of respect in that it symbolises their worth and reinforces their dignity.<ref name=Shope>{{cite journal|last1=Shope|first1=Janet Hinson|title=\"Lobola is here to stay\": rural black women and the contradictory meanings of lobolo in post-apartheid South Africa|journal=Agenda: Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2006|issue=68|pages=64\u201372|jstor = 4066766}}</ref> Many traditional marriages utilise a cash-based Lobolo; this can be then followed by a European-style wedding ceremony, where the Lobolo funds are used to pay for expenses. In this way, any outlaid costs are returned to the payer in another form, preserving tradition, honour and finances.\n\nRecently, the meaning of lobolo has been abused. The bride's families are demanding huge amounts of money from the groom's family and in turn, lobolo is now more of a money-generating-scheme from most families. Instead of simple gifts for lobolo payment-as it was in the 20th century and beyond, fathers are demanding outrageous amounts for their daughters. This has given some men in the African society the 'right' to abuse and ill-treat their wives because they feel that they bought them. There is no gender equality because (in some views) the system  \"promotes male superiority\" where the voices of women do not matter nor their importance acknowledged.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chiweshe|first1=Manase Kudzai|title=Wives At the Market Place: Commercialization Lobola and Commodification Of Women's Bodies In Zimbabwe|journal=The Oriental Anthropologist|date=1 July 2016|volume=16|issue=2|pages=229\u2013243}}</ref>\n\nUsually African men are keen on getting married to their girlfriends, however there are hindrances that may stop them from doing so. As mentioned in the above paragraph finance is the main one. Other potential hindrances are family members not approving their future son in law, a bitter past where the parents dig out dirt.\nIt is important that a couple communicates these issues openly with each other so that they can protect their other half should anything occur\n\n==Dissolution==\nThe dissolution of a customary marriage occurs on the death of the husband or wife. However, the marriage could continue if the woman is transferred to a brother of the deceased to sire an heir. In the event that the woman returns to her father\u2019s house as a result of alleged abuse, the husband may have to pay a fine to the father, prior to fetching (phutuma) her. If the husband does not fetch her within reasonable time, then it would be assumed that he had intended to dissolve the marriage. If the wife refuses to return to the husband, then the husband may make a claim to a portion of the lobola. If the husband wishes to end the marriage, he could send her back to her father\u2019s house. Should the wife initiate the divorce, the father will have to repay some of the lobola.<ref name=\"Herbst and Du Plessis\">{{cite journal|last1=Herbst|first1=Marissa|last2=Du Plessis|first2=Willemien|title=Customary Law v Common Law Marriages: A Hybrid Approach in South Africa|journal=Electronic J of Comparative Law|date=2008|volume=410|issue=1989|pages=1\u201315}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Umtsimba]] - Swazi marriage ceremony\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://chora.virtualave.net/lobola-hiv.htm Lobola, AIDS and Africa]\n* [http://www.zimdiaspora.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2796:ma-hangs-at-in-laws-home-after-lobala-dispute&catid=38:travel-tips&Itemid=18 Man hangs at in-laws home after lobola dispute]\n* [http://www.africanbookscollective.com/books/lobola-its-implications-for-womens-reproductive-rights Lobola: Its Implications for Women's Reproductive Rights]\n\n[[Category:Xhosa culture]]\n[[Category:Zulu culture]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobolo"}
