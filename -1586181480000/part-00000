She bore him three children, being:\n* [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby]] (21 April 1775 \u2013 30 June 1851); married his cousin Charlotte Margaret Hornby, daughter of Reverend Geoffrey Hornby by his wife, the Hon.

In 1779, the countess moved out of Lord Derby's house, leaving their children behind, apparently expecting that her husband would agree to a divorce and that the Duke would then marry her. About one year after she left his house, Lord Derby made it known that he had no intention of divorcing his wife; at the same time, he continued to deny her access to her children. The countess was socially ostracised for the remainder of her life. Historian Peter Thomson suggests that the third of the couple's children, Lady Elizabeth Henrietta, was the result of Lady Derby's affair with Dorset. Despite this, the Earl of Derby cared for the child after his wife left him.{{sfn|Thomson|2004}}\n\nLady Derby died at the age of 44 on 14 March 1797. Only six weeks later, on 1 May 1797, Lord Derby married the actress [[Elizabeth Farren]], daughter of George Farren. She bore him a daughter, Lady Mary Margaret Stanley,  (who married [[Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton]]) and died on 23 April 1829. Lord Derby survived her by five years and died on 21 October 1834, aged 82.

Elizabeth Hornby (n\u00e9e Smith-Stanley)\n* Lady Charlotte (17 October 1776 \u2013 25 November 1805); married her cousin Edmund Hornby, Esq., son of Reverend Geoffrey Hornby by his wife, the Hon. Elizabeth Hornby (n\u00e9e Smith-Stanley)\n* Lady Elizabeth Henrietta (29 April 1778 \u2013 ca. 1857); married Thomas Cole, Esq., and had issue.\n\nIn the late 1770s, Lady Derby had a very public affair with [[John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]]. In 1779, the countess moved out of Lord Derby's house, leaving their children behind, apparently expecting that her husband would agree to a divorce and that the Duke would then marry her. About one year after she left his house, Lord Derby made it known that he had no intention of divorcing his wife; at the same time, he continued to deny her access to her children. The countess was socially ostracised for the remainder of her life. Historian Peter Thomson suggests that the third of the couple's children, Lady Elizabeth Henrietta, was the result of Lady Derby's affair with Dorset. Despite this, the Earl of Derby cared for the child after his wife left him.{{sfn|Thomson|2004}}\n\nLady Derby died at the age of 44 on 14 March 1797. Only six weeks later, on 1 May 1797, Lord Derby married the actress [[Elizabeth Farren]], daughter of George Farren. She bore him a daughter, Lady Mary Margaret Stanley,  (who married [[Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton]]) and died on 23 April 1829. Lord Derby survived her by five years and died on 21 October 1834, aged 82. He was succeeded in the earldom by his son from his first marriage, [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|Edward, Lord Stanley]].<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Lady Elizabeth Hamilton (1753\u20131797), Countess of Derby.jpg|''Portrait of Lady Elizabeth Hamilton, countess of Derby'', by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], ca 1776-1778\nFile:Portrait of Elizabeth Farren, by Thomas Lawrence.jpg|''Portrait of Elizabeth Farren'', by [[Thomas Lawrence]], 1790\nFile:Arms of the Earl of Derby 02666.jpg|Arms of Stanley,  Earl of Derby: ''Argent, on a bend azure three buck's heads cabossed or''.

It was the 28th edition of the [[Hong Kong Sevens]] and was the fifth tournament of the [[2002\u201303 IRB Sevens World Series]]. Twenty-four teams competed in the tournament and were separated into six groups of four with the top eight teams qualifying through to the cup tournament.\n\nDue to the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak|SARS outbreak]] that was occuring in Hong Kong, some teams delayed their arrival to the country with three teams ([[Argentina national rugby sevens team|Argentina]], [[France national rugby sevens team|France]] and [[Italy national rugby sevens team|Italy]] withdrawing from the competition.\n\n[[England national rugby sevens team|England]] defended their Hong Kong title that they won the [[2002 Hong Kong Sevens|previous year]] defeating [[New Zealand national rugby sevens team|New Zealand]] in the final by a score of 22\u201317. The plate-final saw [[Canada national rugby sevens team|South Africa]] defeat [[Scotland national rugby sevens team|Scotland]] while the [[United States national rugby sevens team|United States]] took home the bowl defeating [[Japan national rugby sevens team|Japan]].\n\n==Teams==\nCompared to other tournament of the series, the Hong Kong Sevens had 24 teams compete for the title instead of the regular sixteen teams that usually competed in a World Series event. The tournament saw three teams withdraw after the official draw was revealed on February 27 due to the SARS outbreak that was occuring in South-East Asia. On March 21, France and Italy withdrew from the competition with Argentina withdrawing two days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/45645.html|title=Italy and France pull out of 7s|date=21 March 2003|publisher=ESPN Scrumn|access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/45690.html|title=Pumas latest to pull out of Hong Kong\n|date=23 March 2003|publisher=ESPN Scrumn|access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> They were replaced by [[Namibia national rugby sevens team|Namibia]], [[Tonga national rugby sevens team|Tonga]] and the [[Netherlands national rugby sevens team|Netherlands]] repectively.

Each team played the other teams in their pool once, with three points awarded for a win, two points for a draw, and one point for a loss (no points awarded for a forfeit). The pool stage was played over the first two days of the tournament. The top team from each pool along with the two best runners-up advanced to the Cup quarter finals.

Annual, published mainly under the Fleetway imprint, continued to appear every year: the final Annual, cover-dated 1976, was published in the autumn of 1975.\n\nDuring 1967 and 1968 ''Smash!'' was part of Odhams' [[Power Comics]] line (from #44 to #143), absorbing its sister titles ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' on 14 September 1968 (issue&nbsp;137) and ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' on 2 November 1968 (issue&nbsp;144). As ''Pow!'' and ''Fantastic'' had themselves already merged with ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham!]]'' and ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]'' respectively, ''Smash!'' became the last survivor of the ''Power Comics''.\n\nUntil March 1969, alongside British humour strips, it included black-and-white reprints of superhero strips originally published in America by [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics|DC]]. The last of these, the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', ended in issue&nbsp;162. Thereafter it featured solely British content: a mixture of humour, sporting and adventure strips.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2008/01/crikey-its-another-hit-and-miss-issue.html|title=BLIMEY!

The ''Fleetway'' name, a holdover from AP, was used to identify that part of IPC's comics publishing arm which derived from AP.

The ''Power Comics'' logo, printed on the cover of each issue, was a gimmick dreamed up by Odhams to unify their five titles under a common banner. ''Smash'' remained part of that lineup for 100 issues; the logo was quietly dropped after #143 when the last of the other comics forming part of the lineup was cancelled (so that there was no longer a group of titles needing to be unified).\n\nThe other Power Comics were all ultimately absorbed into ''Smash'', which became the last survivor. On 14 September 1968, with issue 137, it merged with ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow''. On 2 November 1968, with issue&nbsp;144, it merged with ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic''.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=3 Covers Gallery for 1968] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' ceased to be published by Odhams Press Ltd, and was thereafter published by IPC Magazines Ltd (an IPC subsidiary formed during 1968). On 15 March 1969 it was relaunched without its American superhero strips. Further changes followed during the course of 1969, and then a 2nd relaunch at the start of 1970.

Holiday Special in 1971.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1966 the initial success of ''Wham!'' (which had launched in 1964 and quickly built up strong circulation figures) encouraged Odhams' London management to publish a second title, conceived by Alf Wallace (Managing Editor of Odhams' juveniles \u2014 ''Eagle'', ''Swift'' and ''Boy's World'') and Albert Cosser.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984)</ref> Leo Baxendale, who had created ''Wham!'' for Odhams in 1964, was too heavily embroiled with on-going production on it, providing much of the art for each issue, so had little time for anything else. Also, Baxendale was then still working at long range from Dundee.<ref>DC Thompson Ltd, Baxendale's former employers, were based in Dundee, Scotland</ref>\n\nAccordingly, it was Alf Wallace and Albert Cosser (soon to be known to their young audience as Alf and Cos) who determined the initial format of ''Smash!''. They also recruited the artists who would draw the early issues, as it was plain that Baxendale was fully occupied with the art for ''Wham!''. Baxendale's initial contribution to ''Smash'' was thus limited to providing a list of titles and situations for the humour strips, together with brief written scenarios (script ideas for the individual weekly issues), which he gave to Wallace to be farmed-out to other artists. ''The Swots and The Blots'' was one of these.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984),p.4-5</ref>\n\nBaxendale was asked only to create the ''Bad Penny'' strip, and to give ''Grimly Feendish'' (a character from his ''Eagle Eye, Junior Spy'' strip then running in ''Wham!'') a strip of his own. Wallace also had Baxendale draw the covers for the first three issues.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\"/>\n\n''Smash'' launched with the same format as the early issues of ''Wham'', namely 24 pages per issue, four of which were in colour; but it was printed on lower-quality paper than ''Wham''.\n\nThe initial line-up of strips mixed humour and adventure freely, with the comedic ''Ronnie Rich'' featuring on the cover of the first issue, inside which were adventure strips including the World War Two based ''Ghost Patrol'' \u2014 this latter a reprint strip which lasted only until issue 25. ''Ghost Patrol'' proved symptomatic of the problem with adventure strips which plagued ''Smash'' during the Odhams years, which tended to be ''sloppy in presentation and possessed of little real character or emotion''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984), p.6</ref>\n\nThe root of the problem with ''Smash'' was that it went through many changes in its early days \u2014 far too many. Particularly in its adventure strips: ''The Ghost Patrol'' came and went; ''The Legend Testers'' came and went; ''Moon Madness'' was particularly short-lived; and there were numerous others, equally forgettable. None proved popular enough to last.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Undeniably, none enjoyed the tremendous popularity of the American superhero strips which the comic would shortly feature, which genuinely had sufficient popularity to rival that of television.<ref>Marvel Comics as an independent UK publisher, in the 1970s, demonstrated that their superhero comics were capable of strong sales even in the face of competition from the newest rival -- colour television. ''Smash'' might have survived into that 1970s era of colour tv if it could have managed to retain its popular superhero strips.</ref>\n\nThose readers old enough to have become emotionally attached to comics before Odhams introduced American superhero strips to British readers tended to dislike those superhero strips.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Whereas, according to the letters pages each week, those same Marvel and DC heroes were enormously popular among the younger age group which had not been reading comics previously. Accordingly, ''Wham'' readers tended to resent the changes made in 1966, because British strips were cancelled in ''Wham'' and replaced with US superheroes, whereas ''Smash'' readers did not resent the superheroes, because in 1966 that comic had only just launched, so there were no real changes \u2014 ''Smash'' more or less teemed with American strips from the very beginning.\n\n==Odhams Years==\n===Superheroes===\nBlack-and-white reprints of [[Marvel Comics]] strips<ref>All the Marvel stories were written by Stan Lee</ref> were introduced into ''Smash'' with issue&nbsp;16, when the ''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' began.<ref>Issue 16 saw the first appearance of Marvel's ''[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=1 Incredible Hulk]'' strip, drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html|title=BLIMEY!

In July&nbsp;1967 ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''<ref>Drawn at various times by Bill Everett, Wally Wood and Gene Colan</ref> replaced the Hulk, from issue&nbsp;76 onwards \u2014 ''Smash'' having exhausted all Hulk stories, from all sources, which had been published in the USA up to that time.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the significance of the introduction of ''The Hulk'', in the issue dated 21 May 1966. It was the first ''Marvel Comics'' strip featured by Odhams, the success of which led to the introduction of ''Fantastic Four'' into ''Wham'' on 6 August of that year, and to the launching of two entire comics entirely dedicated to Marvel superheroes \u2014 ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' \u2014 in 1967. The Hulk's initial appearance in ''Smash'' took up a massive 6 pages, one-quarter of each 24 page issue, pushing fully five existing strips out of that issue, and causing the permanent cancellation of \"Space Jinx\" and \"Brian's Brain\" (although the latter would be revived much later).<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.11</ref>\n\nPrior to this, [[DC Comics|DC]]'s ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]]'' had become the second American superhero to debut in ''Smash'', crashing onto the front cover of issue&nbsp;20 a month after the Hulk's debut, in re-edited reprints from American daily and Sunday newspaper strips: these were credited in-page to ''Batman'' creator Bob Kane, but were actually drawn by [[Al Plastino]] and ghost-written by [[Whitney Ellsworth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/368494/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Smash! #75|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> This was a response to the sudden and enormous popularity of the ''Batman'' television series starring Adam West. The impact of this hit TV show led to the ''Batman'' strip retaining the front cover of ''Smash'', in colour, for better than a year and a half, entitled ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder''.\n\nInitially, this syndicated newspaper strip adopted the camp style of the Adam West television series, with appearances by humorous guest stars such as American funnyman [[Jack Benny]]. In the later part of the run (which featured serious, rather than camp, stories) Batgirl, too, appeared in the strip, a response to her addition to the TV show in its 3rd season: in the newspaper strip, Batman initially believed her to be a criminal rather than a crime fighter. Superman then co-starred in the strip, which was retitled ''Superman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'', as Batman and Robin attempt to save Superman from the diabolical Professor Zinkk who was secretly poisoning him with kryptonite.\n\nThe expansion of the American content, with the arrival of ''Batman'', meant the loss of two more of the initial British strips: the adventure strip ''The Ghost Patrol'', and the cartoon strip ''The Tellybugs''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\"/>\n\nIn September 1968 the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' began a six-month run in ''Smash'', when it absorbed ''Pow'' (which had previously merged with ''Wham'', in which the strip had initially featured). As one of only a handful of ''Pow'' strips to survive the merger, it was used to lure ''Pow'' readers to the new comic. The strip was introduced to readers of ''Smash'' with the wedding of Reed and Sue from ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Their adventures continued with ''Defeated by the Frightful Four'', and ran through to ''Lo There Shall Be an Ending'', which was the final Marvel strip to appear in ''Smash''.\n\n''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' began a short run in November 1968 when ''Smash'' absorbed ''Fantastic''. The stories, continued from ''Fantastic'', began with ''The Ringmaster's Circus of Crime''. When the Marvel strips were discontinued the following spring, the final ''Thor'' reprint had a new ending substituted, in a rushed attempt to resolve a continuing sub-plot.\n\nThe financial crisis which overtook Odhams in 1968, resulting in the closure of all the other ''Power Comics'', also caused them to give up the expensive licence to reprint the Marvel superhero stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvuk.htm|title=Marvel UK|website=www.internationalhero.co.uk}}</ref> This decision took effect in March&nbsp;1969, when the licence came up for renewal; the final Marvel strips appeared in issue&nbsp;162. The expensive ''Batman'' newspaper strip had already been discontinued, ending in issue&nbsp;157.\n\n===Odhams Humour Strips===\nThere were typically a dozen British humour strips in each of the first 162 issues.\n\nThe initial line-up starred ''The Man From B.U.N.G.L.E.'', which usually occupied the front cover prior to issue&nbsp;20,<ref>''Smash'': [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html The first 20 covers]</ref> supported by seven other long-running humour strips (''Charlie's Choice'',<ref name=\"Brian Lewis\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Brian Lewis]</ref> ''Bad Penny'',<ref name=\"Leo Baxendale\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Leo Baxendale]</ref> ''Percy's Pets'',<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> ''The Nervs'',<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html|title=BLIMEY!

It is unclear why Alf and Cos chose this deeply unfunny strip for what must have been considered the pride of place in the new comic. ''Space Jinx'' was primarily another ''Jonah'' (a strip by Ken Reid which had run in ''The Beano''), except that it could not hold its own against the brilliance of Reid's sea-faring twit. Where ''Jonah'' dealt with sinking ships of the sea, Brian Lewis's ''Space Jinx'' dealt with similar situations in outer space, but (in practice) without the necessary degree of humour.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.7</ref>\n\nKen Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' would last only slightly longer, at 43 issues. A masterpiece of comic artistry, telling the story of the ''Buoyant Queen'' and its two-man crew, Enoch and Bert, a pair of oafs with a love/hate relationship (mostly hate!), it was perhaps too intelligent for its target audience \u2014 its disappearance was a great loss to the comic.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> Many readers failed to understand, amongst many things in the strip that went clear over their heads, that the two main characters were drawn in the likeness of comedians [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], and that the strip's humour was based on the movies of Laurel & Hardy.\n\nAfter only five months \u2013 foreshadowing many, many reshuffles to come \u2013 ''Smash!'' underwent its first major overhaul: from issue&nbsp;20 the ''Batman'' newspaper strip took over the front cover, whilst ''Grimly Feendish'' lost the colour back cover to Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' (which shrank from its original two pages each week to only a single page \u2014 the loss of the extra page was a drawback, but was compensated for by the strip now having a more prestigious location in the comic, and of course by now being in colour).\n\nFurther cover changes would follow. When, after two years, the popularity of the ''Batman'' television series eventually faded, from issue&nbsp;114 onward Batman and Robin were moved to the inside pages, yielding the front cover to the long-running success ''The Swots and the Blots'', at this point still being drawn by Mike Lacey, a humour strip in which two rival gangs vied to outwit each other at Pond Road School, with \"Teach\" caught in the crossfire. Its origins lay in Baxendale's classroom-based strip ''The Tiddlers'', which had then been running for 2 years in ''Wham''<ref>In fact it was a direct continuation of ''[https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/wham/ The Tiddlers]'', with only a change of name. The characters (i.e. \"Teach\" and the Blots), school buildings, and situations, were all largely as they had been in ''The Tiddlers''. The only difference was the addition of the Swots, so that Teach now had an ally.</ref> (and which continued in ''Pow'' when ''Wham'' merged with it in 1968, where it was combined with ''The Dolls of St Dominics'' to become ''The Tiddlers and The Dolls'').\n\n''The Swots and the Blots'' was one of the few strips in ''Smash'' to survive all the changes of 1969 and 1970, reaching a new standard of excellence when [[Leo Baxendale]] began drawing it for the new-look ''Smash'' from March 1969, but even during the Odhams years it had wit and a sense of style. In Baxendale's hands it had notable similarities to his earlier classroom-based strip, ''The Bash Street Kids'', in ''[[The Beano]]''.<ref>Around 1968, Baxendale quit Odhams for the better paying ''Fleetway'' comics. One of the strips he produced there was ''[http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2017/07/leo-baxendales-big-chief-pow-wow.html Big Chief Pow Wow]'' for ''Buster''\u2014the strip ran from 14 September 1968 to 31 January 1970 (some issues were fill-ins by other artists).</ref>\n\n''The Man from BUNGLE'', spoofing the popular TV series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', was a spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye Junior Spy'' strip in ''Wham''. BUNGLE was a secret spy organisation in Britain, organised along more chaotic lines than UNCLE, featuring a secret agent who employed a wide variety of hugely unlikely gadgets in his fight against his humorous opponents. Baxendale himself drew the first few editions, which appeared as large single illustrations on some of the early covers of ''Smash'', after which Mike Lacey took over.\n\nThe second spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye'' strip was ''[[Grimly Feendish]]'' (subtitled ''The Rottenest Crook in the World''), which Leo Baxendale himself drew. Feendish had been the most popular character in the earlier strip, thanks to his ghoulish appearance, which was based on Uncle Fester in the American television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'' (and, presumably, on Charles Adams' illustrations from which the TV series was derived).<ref>Interestingly, the strip would probably have been ''banned'' if this had been an American comic, as the [[Comics Code Authority]] prohibited presentation of crime in comics if it tended to create sympathy for the criminal, and this strip appears to fall foul of that restriction.</ref> The new strip at one point occupied a prestigious position, as the full-colour back cover feature each week, and survived throughout the entire run of 162 issues published by Odhams (even though, after giving up its cover status, it was sometimes ignominiously reduced to only a quarter-page \"filler\").\n\n''Bad Penny'' was another memorable Baxendale creation. Its title logo featured a portrait of Penny herself, alongside the 'Bad Penny' caption, and an illustration of a giant pre-decimal One Penny coin (the coin suggesting the connection with the proverb from which the character's name originated).\n\nShe had some similarities with Baxendale's earlier Minnie the Minx character in ''The Beano''. When he had been drawing Minnie, he had concentrated on experimenting with facial expressions and character traits. By the time he began working on ''Bad Penny'' his drawing style had matured, with an equal concentration on developing a zany but tight storyline, less emphasis on close-ups of facial expressions, but retaining the essentials needed to put over a character's own personality traits.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\"/>\n\nBad Penny was so popular that she survived the changes of 1969, and continued to appear in the new ''Smash''. When the strip was eventually dropped, in 1970, Bad Penny herself still continued to appear, albeit infrequently, making occasional appearances in Baxendale's ''The Swots and the Blots'' as a new member of the Blots.\n\nAs had happened in ''Wham'', artists such as Mike Lacey were commissioned from time to time to \"ghost\" Baxendale's style. Baxendale was allowed to sign his early work on ''Smash'', so there is a way to distinguish which strips he personally drew during his time at Odhams.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075207/http://26pigs.com/wham/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Wham!|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>In practice, Baxendale signed very few of his strips, so it is quite difficult to tell which are his and which are other artists substituting for him.</ref> After he transferred to Fleetway, another IPC subsidiary, he still contributed strips to ''Smash'', but now worked \"undercover\", i.e. without signing them. He explained this in his autobiography, ''A Very Funny Business'' (Duckworth, 1978, page&nbsp;91): \"I was in a delightful situation. Working under my own name, a lot was expected of me. Publishers ''expected'' me to cram my drawings with funny detail. A double standard operated. Working undercover, I was able to reduce the layouts to the simplest terms. Backgrounds were minimal or non-existent \u2014 just a horizon line. And there was no ancillary comic detail \u2014 just the characters acting out the story line against an empty backdrop.\"\n\nThe most bizarre of the Odhams humour strips was ''The Nervs'', depicting a group of little characters inhabiting a schoolboy called Fatty: the strip showed them running Fatty like a group of workers running a factory. Allocated two pages, it followed the same formula as the strip ''Georgie's Germs'' from ''Wham!''. Fatty was aptly named, with the tiny Nervs battling to save the fat twerp's stomach from its numerous overloads, as a minute never passed which was free from him guzzling!\n\nDrawn for the majority of its run by Graham Allen,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> in its final months during 1968-69 [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]]<ref>Comics artist [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Reid Ken Reid]</ref> \u2014 previously of ''Queen of the Seas'', and who had earlier contributed the ''Dare-a-Day Davy''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/dadd.htm|title=Ken Reid's Dare A Day Davy|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> strip to ''Pow'' \u2014 drew this double-page feature.\n\nReid's career had begun at ''The Beano'' in the 1950s, but for Odhams he had already produced the long running success ''Frankie Stein'', in ''Wham!'', before taking on ''Queen of the Seas'' in the early issues of ''Smash!'' and the  ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip in ''Pow!''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> He turned ''The Nervs'' into an extremely surreal, even visceral, strip; achieving a rare level of hilarity and bawdiness, in a subversive presentation of comical horror \u2014 and in the process alarming IPC's management !<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\"/>\n\nHe already had some degree of notoriety, as being the only Odhams artist whose work so disturbed the management that it was actually banned.<ref>[http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/weird1.html Review] of the banned ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' Frankenstein strip</ref><ref>''Dare-A-Day Davy'' [http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/picts2.html Frankenstein strip], published in ''Weird Fantasy''&nbsp;#1 in 1969</ref> At the suggestion of Vance Gledhill of Blackpool, Davy was dared to dig up Frankenstein's monster (in the ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip) and bring him back to life \u2013 for which Reid decided to employ the \"kiss of life\"!

This was a device for featuring, as guest stars in the strip each week, an assortment of popular TV stars. The strip's debut appearance, for instance, featured Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, stars of top-rated secret agent show ''The Man From UNCLE'', maximising their appearance by splashing them across the front cover. It was hoped that by bringing popular television stars into its pages, this would make TV's growing popularity work ''for'' the comic \u2014 a not very subtle ploy to boost its circulation and sales.\n\n''Sammy Shrink'' (subtitled ''The Smallest Boy in the World'')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> was a humour strip about a boy who was only two inches tall. Sammy had the most successful \u2014 but also the most chequered \u2014 career of all the characters featured in ''Smash'', having originated in ''Wham'', then moved to ''Pow'' when they merged, arriving in ''Smash'' when it in turn absorbed ''Pow'', and would subsequently be revived in ''Knockout'', finally ending his career in ''Whizzer and Chips'' when it absorbed ''Knockout'' in June&nbsp;1973.\n\n''Ronnie Rich'' featured the richest kid in the world, who stands to inherit a fortune if only he can get rid of the money he's got. Drawn by Gordon Hogg,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> each week Ronnie spent his every last penny, in some reckless or extravagant way, only to have his scheme backfire and make him richer than ever. He never did get his hands on the fortune.\n\nOften a half-page feature, ''Percy's Pets'' drawn by Stan McMurtry (alias Mac)<ref>Comics artist [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040731/Macs-secret-lady-Britains-cartoonist-reveals-hidden-images-wife.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> was popular enough to go on to make sporadic reappearances from time to time in the new ''Smash'' after March&nbsp;1969. Percy was a small plump schoolboy, who filled his family's home with his exotic collection of pets. These included (from time to time) an elephant, a giraffe, a hippopotamus, a snake, an ape \u2014 in fact almost every type of animal that might be found in a typical zoo \u2014 together with a parrot, a tortoise, a white mouse, and a hedgehog; thereby causing a predictable degree of comical chaos for his long suffering mum and dad.\n\nSome of the best-remembered strips were not included in all of the first 162 issues: a number of them were only acquired in #137, from the merger with ''Pow!'' (which had already absorbed the most popular strips running in ''Wham!'').\n\nOne such acquisition from ''Pow!'' was ''The Cloak''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/cloak.htm|title=Mike Higgs' The Cloak|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> \u2014 like ''The Man From BUNGLE'', another humorous secret agent strip. The Cloak was the top agent for Britain's Special Squad, nominally a part of Scotland Yard; but he usually operated from his personal headquarters, known as the Secret Sanctum. His ingenuity and never-ending supply of gadgets and secret weapons gave him the edge over his somewhat odd enemies (some were ''very'' odd, including Deathshead and various other agents of G.H.O.U.L.).\n\nHe had some equally odd colleagues. Assisted initially by Mole (the tall one with the bald head, big nose and specs) and Shortstuff (the short squirt with the hairy nut and big eyeballs), he then began having adventures in which he found himself also alongside the sexy and flirtatious Lady Shady, the shady lady. The strip benefited from the unusual, idiosyncratic drawing style of Mike Higgs, whose overt inclusion of pop culture imagery made the strip seem extremely modern.\n\n''Wiz War'', drawn by Mike Brown, had also begun in ''Pow!'', and would be one of a handful of strips to survive the changes of 1969. Brown seems to have been unaware of the house rule banning artists from signing their work, as the strip often bore his name. The \"War\" in the title referred to a feud between two wizards, Wizard Prang and his enemy Demon Druid. Being a humour strip, the editorial staff allowed the hero the very silly name of Wizard Prang, a piece of RAF slang from the Second World War.\n\nOther than the fact that Prang was robed entirely in white, befitting his status as the good guy, and Demon Druid was always in black, being the villain of the piece, their costumes were quite similar - a flowing wizard's robe with stars on, and a pointed hat. They would fly around on broomsticks, zapping each other with spells: which turned the other into a toad, or something equally amusing. Wizard Prang was alternately helped and hindered by Englebert, his pet bird. The best feature of the strip was the sign above Wizard Prang's front door. This usually read \"Wizard Prang is... In\" (if he was at home) or \"Wizard Prang is... Out\" (if he was out and about); but if he'd had a bad time in the story, the sign would often make a humorous remark in the final panel, such as \"Wizard Prang is... All At Sea\".\n\nThe secret of Mike Brown, unacknowledged for many years, was that Leo Baxendale needed to earn money from Odhams without disclosing to Fleetway that he was now working for both companies. Accordingly, Baxendale now pencilled the drawings, and Brown, who was a cartoon film animator, inked them in. In this way, they turned out together large numbers of ''Bad Penny'' and ''Grimly Feendish'' strips, which they sold to Odhams under Brown's name \u2014 a situation Baxendale referred to, in his 1978 autobiography, as working ''undercover''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984),p.10</ref>\n\nLost in the merger with ''Pow'' were ''Charlie's Choice'', ''Ronnie Rich'' and ''The Man From BUNGLE''. Also lost in this merger, in effect, was Ken Reid's ''Dare-A-Day Davey'' strip, one of several established features in ''Pow'' which were dropped instead of transferring to ''Smash''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.15</ref>\n\n===Odhams Adventure Strips===\n\nAs ''Smash'' was essentially a superhero and humour comic during the Odhams years, there were few traditional adventure strips in it; but a handful do bear special mention.\n\nThere were various well-remembered adventure strips in the first hundred issues, including some which were quite outstanding, such as ''Rubberman'', ''Experiment X'', ''The Legend Testers'', and ''The Python''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFrom issue 144 in November 1968 ''Smash'' was the only surviving ''Power Comic'', as this was the issue in which ''Smash and Pow'' (as it then was) merged with ''Fantastic''. Five British adventure serials were introduced in this issue, to plug the gap left by the loss of the withdrawn American superhero strips which had been major features of the four closed titles.\n\n''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' is an adventure strip in which a crime reporter on the Daily Globe newspaper is apparently killed while investigating a news story. The world believes newspaperman Jim Jordan is dead, but he still carries on his crusade against crime... calling himself The Spectre.\n\nHe is now fighting crime, rather than merely reporting it, using an array of gadgets which make it seem he is the ghost of the missing reporter. Hence his opponents are terrified to find that if they shoot him he doesn't die (a bullet-proof raincoat was the trick here). And he has a secret underground hideout beneath the statue erected in his memory, from which he would covertly and unexpectedly emerge, or disappear into, under cover of an artificial fog, to give the impression he was coming and going from the spirit world. His first case began in issue&nbsp;144, in which he tracks down Black Murdo, the racketeer who the world believes had murdered him.\n\n''Destination Danger'', a motor racing serial, also began in issue&nbsp;144. This strip was about a feud between a young English racing driver, Jeff Jackson, who was working for Puma Motors in the US, and his enemy Vic Stafford, the Puma team's chief driver, who has taken a bribe to throw a forthcoming race.\n\nAlthough new to ''Smash'', the old-fashioned artwork in the strips ''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' and ''Destination Danger'' marked them out as reprints. The use of reprints was a cost-cutting measure, indicating the straightened financial circumstances of ''Smash'' at this point \u2013 if any evidence were needed beyond the closure of all four of the other ''Power Comics''.\n\n''Laird of the Apes'' was a science fiction strip, milking the popularity of the big budget Charlton Heston motion picture ''Planet of the Apes'' which was released earlier that year. In the strip, set in the 18th century, a young Scottish laird returns to the Highlands to aid his outlaw clansmen in their struggle with the English Redcoats, bringing with him a band of highly trained Apes.\n\nAn adventure strip with a sporting theme was the wrestling serial ''King of the Ring'', featuring Ken King, who was a champion of the grunt-'n'-grapple game (although in the earliest strips he had begun as a boxer). As was not exactly uncommon in the Odhams years, there was a tendency to give the characters very silly names. The most outrageous example in this strip was King's manager, who (in spite of ''not'' being Irish) was called Blarney Stone!\n\nBlarney's real name was originally Tim Stone, and Blarney was only a nickname; but this was soon forgotten. In order to fulfil Ken's ambition to travel, Blarney agrees to manage him on a world tour, if he'll agree to fight his way round the world!\n\nThe fifth adventure strip added was ''Brian's Brain'', drawn by Bert Vandeput,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> a serial with science fiction elements, continued from ''Pow''. This featured two schoolboys: the eponymous Brian and his friend Duffy Rolls. Brian Kingsley possessed an electronic Brain resembling a human skull, which he carried about in a box. It could communicate with him telepathically, glowing when active; and it could control the actions of animals if they were within a few yards, which was the limit of its brain-wave transmissions.\n\nAll five strips commenced in issue&nbsp;144; and all were serials, with cliff-hanger endings each week.\n\n===The Closure of the ''Power Comics''===\nWhat must always be born in mind is that, in the comics industry, the 1960s were not the 1930s. With the advent in Britain of commercial television, in 1955 \u2014 displacing the staid, old-fashioned children's television offered by the BBC up to that point \u2014 the ever-increasing competition from the ''boob-tube'' began a continuous (and accelerating) decline in comics circulation. Throughout the 1960s, in consequence, the circulation wars fought in the comics publishing industry were fought out against a backdrop of ever-declining circulation figures.\n\nFollowing the initial success of ''Wham'' in 1964, Odhams had launched four more [[Power Comics]] during 1966 and '67, including ''Smash'', only to close them in quick succession: merging each in turn into the survivors until by 1969 only ''Smash'' remained. Whereas 1968 began with all five ''Power Comics'' apparently flourishing, by the year's end only ''Smash'' was still being published.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\"/> Even the sleepiest of readers began to notice that something was seriously wrong, as the increasingly frantic series of mergers resulted in ever more ludicrous titles, culminating in the astonishing ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic'' (commonly spoofed as ''Smash, Pow, Wham, incorporating Fantastic and Terrific'').\n\nThe question is why, in a limited market such as the UK, they took such a big risk as to launch five titles (which in hindsight looks an unwise decision by the Odhams management), if it was so quickly obvious that the market could only support one? It has been suggested<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> that it was common practice for a publisher to quickly clone a successful title, in order to forestall its competitors from doing so. That does not seem to be the case here. The comic's only distinctive feature was its American superhero strips, so ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' (which most of the time contained ''only'' Marvel superhero strips) might loosely be described as clones of ''Smash'', even though they lacked any humour strips; but IPC had an ''exclusive'' licence from Marvel Comics to reprint Marvel's strips in the UK, which precluded anyone else from doing so.\n\nThe actual answer lies in the unexpected nature of the economic crisis of 1968 that hit the British economy, resulting in the devaluation of the Pound.<ref>In Britain, the devaluation crisis was major news due to certain ill-judged remarks by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who would be mocked for the rest of his career for his infamous falsehood, ''This will not affect the Pound in your pocket!''</ref> The economic chaos began with a Sterling crisis in Britain in 1967, leading to devaluation in the November. There then followed a crisis for the U.S. dollar in March&nbsp;1968 which had a cascade effect on the international economic system, sending first the French franc and then the West German deutschmark into devaluation, and culminating in a ''new'' Sterling crisis in Britain in November&nbsp;1968.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2170396 ''The Economic Crisis of 1968''] \u2013 published in ''American Historical Review''</ref><ref>Article, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/dec2005/mccar-d30.shtml ''Eugene McCarthy \u2013 pivotal role in 1968 Political Crisis'']</ref>\n\nThese repeated falls in the value of the Pound against the U.S. dollar significantly increased the cost of publishing the American strips, which had to be paid for in dollars, and raised the daunting spectre of further increases if the Pound fell in value yet again. Increasing the cover price of the ''Power Comics'' to compensate was impossible because of stiff competition (with sales on a sharp downward spiral, as circulation fell victim to the ever increasing popularity of television); so the fall in the value of Sterling made the American strips unaffordable.\n\nThe toughness of the competition is apparent from examining other contemporary titles.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/ British Comics] website</ref> The first issue of its stablemate ''Fantastic'', published in February 1967, cost 9d for 40 pages (due to its very high content of American superhero strips), a cover price which forced ''Fantastic'' to close within 18 months. ''Terrific'', having the same high content of American material, also had a high cover price of 9d, and closed even quicker.\n\nIn contrast, the comics ''Dandy'' and ''Beano'' published by the rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] organisation sold at a cover price of 3d. ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' cost three times as much, which (even with double the number of pages compared to many DC Thomson titles) proved unsustainable. This is not surprising, given that ''Wham'' and ''Pow'' each peaked at a cover price of 7d, and even that proved unsustainable.\n\n''Smash'' had launched in February&nbsp;1966 with a cover price of 7d for 24&nbsp;pages. By March&nbsp;1969, although its cover price had not changed, circumstances had conspired to increase its page count, such that each issue now contained 36&nbsp;pages. In fact the page count jumped overnight from 24 pages to 36 pages (a fifty percent increase), with a consequent sharp rise in production costs, and so a marked decline in profit-per-copy.\n\nThe tipping point was issue 144, in which ''Smash'', ''Pow'' and ''Fantastic'' were merged into a single title. The recently created ''Smash and Pow'' lost its ''Daredevil'' and ''Spider-Man'' strips, which together had comprised a full third of each 24 page issue, but now had to accommodate both ''Thor'' and ''Fantastic Four'' from the discontinued titles, plus a whole slew of new British adventure strips (which were being added in preparation for the comic's impending transition to solely-British content).\n\nAll this could not be achieved within the standard ''Smash'' format of 24 pages. So IPC now \"bit the bullet\" and increased the page count, at a single bound, by fifty percent \u2014 a necessity if they were to achieve their intention of reproducing with ''Smash'' the successful formula which was buoying-up sales of their most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant'', both of which were 36-pagers (in effect, to produce another clone of them: an identical mix of adventure and humour, with an identical page count, at an identical price).\n\nOne fundamental difficulty for the ''Power Comics'', however, was always the stark economic truth that a kid could buy both ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'', at 3d each, and still have change left over, for what it cost to buy ''Smash!'', ''Wham!'' or ''Pow!'' at 7d each. However, the DC Thomson titles only had 16 pages, and this more than anything drove up the page count in ''Smash!'', from its original 24 pages to 36 pages, and eventually to 40 pages in 1970 (i.e. it might be more than double the price of a DC Thomson title but it was also more than double the size).<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.9</ref> The difficulty was that the much lower price of ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'' gave those titles a significant advantage, since a kid could choose to buy only one of them, at 3d \u2014 a winning competitive advantage which, as of 1966, would keep both of the DC Thomson titles afloat for more than 30 years to come.\n\nThe highly competitive nature of the UK's publishing industry meant margins were thin: a minimum number of sales each week were needed to reach break-even point, and the lower the cover price, the greater was the number of sales needed to reach that point; but the higher the cover price, the fewer were the number of sales that could actually be achieved.\n\nThe juvenile readers (or their parents) might be able to afford two or three comics a week, but by publishing five ''Power Comics'' IPC were pricing themselves out of the market. For the situation in Britain was not like that in America, where, with comics published just once a month, a child might afford five titles. In Britain, comics were published weekly.\n\nUnder those conditions the ''Power Comics'' were effectively competing with each other \u2014 a factor IPC were certainly aware of, as the letters pages in ''Smash'', in 1968, actually carried readers' complaints that they couldn't afford all five ''Power'' titles. The five together cost an astonishing three shillings and threpence a week (39d), to buy them all, far beyond the reach of the average child's weekly pocket money.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.13</ref>\n\nThe ''Power Comics'' were also competing with IPC's other titles, including [[Lion (comics)|Lion]], [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]] and [[Buster (comics)|Buster]], potentially dragging the Group's entire line into bankruptcy. Rationalisation, by closing some of the titles, would produce an overall benefit, as it would dramatically cut IPC's production costs. Although it would mean fewer titles, as IPC's comics were actually competing against each other it ought to result in better sales for the survivors. In theory, there would be no overall loss of sales or revenue, provided readers switched from the closing titles to surviving IPC ones (rather than to rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] ones).\n\nAnother factor Odhams had not anticipated was the distribution of American comic books within the UK. Although this had always been a consideration, the volume of such comics arriving in Britain had traditionally been small, and their distribution haphazard. In 1968, distribution and quantity suddenly underwent a marked improvement: in America, Marvel Comics' owner, Martin Goodman, pulled off a business coup that overnight freed Marvel from a restrictive distribution agreement, which for a decade had limited it to publishing only 8 titles a month: Marvel was suddenly quadrupeling its monthly output, and dozens of new titles were flooding into Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emagazinepdf.com/2017/05/marvel_comics_-_the_untold_story/|title=''Marvel Comics \u2014 The Untold Story'', Sean Howe (2012)}}</ref> Odhams' black-and-white [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] reprints in their ''Power Comics'' range suddenly faced much more extensive competition from four-colour Marvel originals, and this began to harm sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/03/40-year-flashback-smash-regenerates.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: 40 Year Flashback: SMASH! regenerates|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the turbulent economic conditions, any part of IPC's business which was loss-making had no future. Standard industry practice was to close a comic or magazine if its revenues dipped ''towards'' the break-even point; publishers did not wait for a title to actually incur losses.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> Hence, merely to anticipate losses on the other four titles (''Pow'', ''Wham'', ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'') was enough to doom them. And the closures represented a major cost-cutting exercise, reducing the ongoing production costs on the ''Power Comics'' line by four-fifths.\n\nAs for actual losses incurred due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the problem, and the inability to quickly terminate the long-term contracts with the Americans, ''Smash'' as sole survivor couldn't hope to generate enough income on its own to meet these. In fact it didn't need to. The fortunate circumstance that the ''Power Comics'' were all published by Odhams Press Ltd, a subsidiary company with limited liability, meant that it was possible to ring-fence all debts on the Odhams publications within that one company, thus preventing any losses affecting the rest of the IPC Group (since IPC's other titles were all published by other IPC subsidiaries). Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' was transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd, a new IPC subsidiary formed during 1968,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/publisher/1946/|title=GCD :: Publisher :: IPC|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> leaving Odhams with no continuing titles, and ''Smash'' started again from scratch.<ref>[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?disp=1&frfsh=1414205283&#result Odhams Press Ltd] continued in being until 7 January 1998, when it changed its name to Formpart (No.11) Limited, which still exists today; currently a dormant private company.</ref>\n\nDespite being the longest survivor, and inheriting many popular strips from the other four titles, ''Smash'' was only a limited success. It was plainly on shakey ground: for, hard on the heels of the closure of the other titles, in the spring of 1969 IPC quickly made extensive changes to it, dropping the last remaining Marvel superhero strips, to shed the expense of the licensing fee for using them (having already dropped ''Batman''), and ending many other strips too.\n\nIn consequence of the decision to discontinue the American reprints, as each ''Power Comic'' closed its superhero strips were given up. Only in the case of ''Fantastic'', where the existing contract with Marvel had some months to run, were those strips transferred to its replacement, the merged ''Smash incorporating Fantastic'', until the contract expired in March&nbsp;1969.\n\n''Smash'' then introduced a new cover feature, new strips, and free gifts. In all but name it was a new comic. Even so, it required yet another major shakeup 12 months later, in the spring of 1970, when further changes of editorial policy were imposed by new owners Reed International, who had bought out IPC that year. This resulted, among other things, in the dropping of the newly introduced ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature in favour of a new lead serial: an adventure series entitled ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test''.\n\nWithin the British market, boys' comics for the age group which was too old for titles such as ''Beano'', ''Dandy'' and ''Sparky'' tended to focus around adventure, sport and war (in titles such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''), or humour (in titles such as ''Buster''). In abandoning its superheroes, ''Smash'' sought to attract readers of both types, by offering traditional adventure as well as humour.\n\nTo place these changes in context, the ''Power Comics'' were not the only casualties of the turmoil at IPC in 1969. Hulton's long-running adventure comic ''Eagle'' was also cancelled, merging with Fleetway's ''Lion'' from 2 May 1969. The merged comic was known briefly as ''Lion and Eagle'', but quickly reverted simply to ''Lion''. The humour comic, ''Giggle'', aimed at the slightly younger market dominated by Fleetway's ''Buster'', was also dropped, being merged into ''Buster'' in the spring of 1969 to form ''Buster and Giggle''. As ever, the name change lasted only long enough to absorb the discontinued comic's readership: the reference to ''Giggle'' failed to see out the year, and by December the title had reverted to simply ''Buster'' once more.<ref>''Buster'' [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/ cover gallery] at Wordpress.com</ref> And ''Buster'', like ''Smash'', also now became a publication of the Group's newest subsidiary, IPC Magazines Ltd.\n\nThe surviving titles at both Odhams and at Fleetway were now transferred to a merged operation, at New Year 1969, as merely a part of IPC's newest division, IPC Magazines Ltd, and were placed under the responsibility of Jack Legrand, formerly the Managing Editor of Fleetway's juvenile publications.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.17</ref>\n\nA notable feature of the Odhams years was how few advertisements the comic carried. There were occasional quarter-page inserts, mainly advertising foreign Postage Stamps for stamp collectors, or Subbuteo table-football; but they were few and far between, and their combined total didn't usually exceed one page per issue. Reflecting its financial problems, the relaunched comic under IPC Magazines carried a significantly greater amount of advertising. One obvious change was the back cover (the only in-colour page apart from the front cover), which gradually began to carry colourful full-page advertisements. On the inside pages, too, there was a much more noticeable quantity of adverts: each issue typically carried 4 full-page ads, plus two half-page ads. It was a noticeable feature of the relaunch that the comic now expanded to 40 pages, in order to cope with the need to carry an extra 4 pages of advertising in each issue.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ British Comics] website</ref>\n\nThis was a potentially significant new strategy, and a major change of policy. No longer did the profitability of the comic rest exclusively with the income derived from its sales figures. That sales income was now supplemented by advertising revenue, and without even having to sacrifice any significant amount of page space, nor cancel any strips, thanks to adding the additional pages.\n\n===Turmoil in 1967===\nThe events of 1968 were not even the first threat to the survival of the ''Power Comics''. Odhams had faced their first serious crisis in May 1967.\nThe editorial page warned readers in issue 68 that ''Smash'', initially printed by St Clements Press Ltd of London, had to find new printers within one month, or face closure. In the event, Odhams were able to sign a contract with Southernprint Ltd of Poole in Dorset in time to maintain publication.\n\n==''SMASH'' after Odhams==\n\nIn January 1969 Odhams ceased to exist as a publishing imprint, and ''Smash'' now became an IPC Magazines publication. Most of the consequences of the change didn't become apparent until the issue cover-dated 15 March, in which the comic changed dramatically. IPC had waited three months to relaunch ''Smash'', because, on the one hand, it needed some lead-time in which to ready new strips, and, on the other, in the publishing industry Spring was traditionally considered a good time to launch a new (in this case, a virtually new) comic.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/>\n\nWith the re-launch, ''Smash'' became the last ever British comic to feature a variety mix of adventure, humour and sports themed stories. Subsequent boys' comics featured exclusively sports, or war, or humour; such as ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher and Score]]'' and ''[[Shoot (football magazine)|Shoot]]'' (which featured only soccer), and ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'' and ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' (which featured only war stories).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075250/http://26pigs.com/smash/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Smash|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  A hallmark of this policy was to be the even-handedness with which the editorial staff drew the multitude of reprint strips featured in the new ''Smash'' from both ''Lion'' and ''Buster'', in seeking to appeal to readers of both (i.e. mixing serious and humorous strips without discrimination).\n\nThe symbol of the change was the new cover feature, ''Warriors of the World''. This now replaced ''The Swots and Blots'', who, drawn by Mike Lacey, had occupied the cover during the final part of the Odhams years. Happily, ''The Swots and the Blots'' survived (and prospered) on the inside pages, now drawn by Leo Baxendale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: Christmas comics: Valiant 1971|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=17 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the first relaunch issue (No.163) bearing a cover feature entitled ''Warriors of the World No.1'', the former numbering was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/25870/ Smash! - Title Notes] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> To have maintained the original sequential numbering alongside the ''Warriors of the World'' series could only have caused confusion.\n\nThe revamped ''Smash'', now comprising 40 pages, featured all-British strips \u2014 adventure serials, humour strips, and sporting strips \u2014 many of which were reprints from ''Lion'', such as ''Eric the Viking'' (originally ''Karl the Viking''), ''The Battle of Britain'' (originally ''Britain in Chains''), and ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''; and others which were reprints from ''Buster'', such as ''Wacker'' (originally ''Elmer''), ''Monty Muddle - The Man from Mars'' (originally ''Milkiway - The Man from Mars''), and ''Consternation Street''; but strictly no American superheroes.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The number of reprint strips was another significant indicator of its troubled financial situation, reprints being significantly cheaper than commissioning new strips.\n\nOf the former Odhams strips, only a handful survived. Humour strips which continued were ''The Swots and the Blots'', ''Wiz War'' and ''Bad Penny''. Additionally, ''Percy's Pets'' made occasional appearances (but did not appear every week). Much mourned were the loss of ''The Cloak'' and ''The Man from BUNGLE'', dropped due to the waning popularity of spy spoofs (in 1968 the TV series ''The Man from UNCLE'' had been cancelled); and especially mourned was the loss of Ken Reid and ''The Nervs''.\n\nThe serious offerings fared even worse. For although the survivors appeared to include ''Sergeant Rock - Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'', in reality neither of these were genuinely from the Odhams era. Both had begun only a few weeks earlier, in issues 156 and 158 respectively. They were really a part of the relaunch, but were introduced slightly ahead of time to disguise that fact. The only genuine survivor from the adventure strips of the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', and even that had only begun with issue&nbsp;144, in November&nbsp;1968.\n\nAfter a few months, superheroes appeared to be making a comeback. The Editorial column admitted receiving complaints from readers about the loss of the Marvel strips; and, in the autumn of 1969, six months after the ''Fantastic Four'' and ''Thor'' had been dropped, an all-British superhero called Tri-Man appeared, debuting in the issue of 13 September, and the character also featured in the ''Smash'' Annual that Christmas. Some indication of the effort put into this character is the fact that he was given sole possession of the front cover of the Annual! The adventures of Johnny Meek featured a hero who had triple-superpowers, hence the name Tri-Man. He leaped about rooftops (shades of Spider-Man, from the long-vanished ''Pow''), and got his powers from a ray device once every 24 hours (shades of DC's ''Green Lantern''). But the strip did not prove popular, and quietly vanished in the reshuffles of 1970.\n\nIn the light of how few strips of any sort survived from the Odhams era, and given that none of the superhero strips survived at all (which, according to the Letters pages,<ref>It was a feature of the Odhams years that the comic included a page for readers' letters, like the American comics published by Marvel and DC on which it was based, but the Letters Page was dropped in March 1969 in favour of extra advertising space.</ref> were the most popular feature of the ''Power Comics''), it would be stretching the truth to say that ''Smash'' inherited the best of the Odhams strips. Stylistically, ''The Swots and the Blots'' was the most creative and sophisticated Odhams strip (save only ''The Nervs''), and it did survive. But it was only one strip. And ''The Nervs'', which was objectively a more sophisticated strip in 1968, did not.\n\nMoreover, the publisher was taking a significant risk by re-launching the former ''Power Comic'' as, in effect, a clone of IPC's most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The publisher hoped it could repeat the success of ''Valiant'' and ''Lion'' by copying their successful formula. Nevertheless, without its discontinued superheroes ''Smash'' had nothing unique about it that might attract new readers, compared to its stablemates \u2014 featuring as it did a mix of strips reprinted from (or based on the style of) ''Lion'' and ''Buster''.\n\n===IPC Humour Strips===\n\nAs under Odhams, humour continued to play a large part in the relaunched comic (in terms of the page count): not to the extent it did in ''Buster'', but at least as much as in ''Valiant'' or ''Lion''.\n\nWith the relaunch, ''The Swots and the Blots'' (one of the handful of surviving Odhams strips) moved from the prestigious front cover to the centre pages. Nevertheless, now drawn by Leo Baxendale it became a standard bearer for sophisticated artwork. Baxendale began a five-year run on the strip (beginning in ''Smash'' and continuing in its successor, ''Valiant and Smash'', with some fill-ins by Les Barton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=2818|title=Smash! comic the swots and the blots- Leo Baxendale - Comics UK|website=comicsuk.co.uk}}</ref>), by adopting a new style, one which influenced many others in the comics field, just as his earlier ''Beano'' work had done; and in the process attaining a new, deliriously daft, high standard, one rarely approached by other strips.\n\nNew humour strips featured in the relaunch (new to ''Smash'' at any rate) included a half-page cartoon strip drawn by Nadal, entitled ''Big 'Ead'', detailing the humorous misadventures of a Mr&nbsp;Knowall character, summed up by the strip's catchphrase, continually bellowed at the lead character by his irate victims: \"''Have a care there, Big&nbsp;'Ead!''\" Reprinted from ''Buster'', where it had initially run \u2014 under the same title \u2014 from 28 May 1960 to 18 February 1961.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p43</ref>\n\n''Wacker'' was a single page cartoon strip, subtitled ''He's All at Sea''. Drawn at different times by Rafart and by Roy Wilson, it concerned the crazy antics in the Royal Navy of Mis-leading Seaman Wacker, who was forever driving the Captain of HMS Impossible toward a nervous breakdown. Despite the Liverpudlian overtones of his surname, Wacker seemed not to be a Scouser \u2013 which may have been because it was ''not'' his real name! The strip, although new to ''Smash'', had run in ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'' from 29 October 1960 to 17 October 1964 under its real title, ''Elmer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/|title=Buster 60s|date=29 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/>\n\nAnother humour strip new to ''Smash'' was the World War Two spoof, ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men From W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' Set in 1940, this featured an English scientist named Professor Nutt, who was a boffin inventing eccentric secret weapons for a department of the War Office known as W.H.E.E.Z.E. (short for Weapon Handling Early Experimental and Zoning Establishment), who was kept out of trouble by his Army \"minder\", Sgt&nbsp;'Lightning' Bolt. Nutt and Bolt were perpetually clashing with a cunning Nazi scientist named Doktor Skull. This was another reprint strip, perhaps from ''Lion''. As its title implies, it was born out of the earlier popularity of the ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' television series. However, the strip had only a short run in ''Smash'', being replaced after just 22&nbsp;issues.\n\nYet it was not only in the plainly cartoon-style strips that humour flourished in the new ''Smash''. Many of the ostensibly more serious offerings were, in reality, humour strips: in particular, ''His Sporting Lordship'' and ''The World Wide Wanderers''; but there was also a strong humorous undercurrent in the new lead serial, ''Master of the Marsh''.\n\n===IPC Sporting Strips===\n\nSporting strips were now the order of the day. Reflecting this, the new lead, on page 3, was ''Master of the Marsh'', drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]],<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\">Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Solano Lopez]</ref> a sports serial about Patchman, a strange hermit who lived in the East Anglian fens. He was appointed as the new sports master at Marshside Secondary School, nicknamed 'The Marsh', because he was the only person who could control the kids \u2014 a group of hooligans known as 'the Monsters of the Marsh'. There was an association of ideas between fens and marsh, reinforced by the fact that Patchman camped in the inaccessible heart of the marshes. He was a burly woodsman who had always lived in the Fens, and could communicate after a fashion with the local wildlife, for whom he acted as protector.\n\nThe strip initially featured humorous stories about the attempts of Knocker Reeves \u2013 the worst of the 'monsters' \u2013 to get the better of the new teacher. But eventually it transpired that Patchman was secretly the guardian of a collection of relics left behind by [[Hereward the Wake]], a warlord who had fought the Norman invaders in the Fens during the 11th Century. In this respect, the strip had an occasional tendency to embrace science fiction overtones.\n\nOf the sports-based stories, the only survivor from the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', which continued to prosper. Possibly feeling the strip was suffering in the credibility stakes, the new editorial team made a decision to change the name of King's manager, who bore the remarkable name (actually a nickname) of Blarney Stone! They threw Blarney out of the series and substituted a new manager with a less silly name. ''Ballyhoo Barnes'' wasn't all that much less silly, but it's the thought that counts! Even so, Blarney reappeared after a few weeks, by popular demand.\n\nThe most successful of the new sports-based strips (certainly the most long-running) was ''His Sporting Lordship'', drawn by Douglas Maxted.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html Douglas Maxted]</ref> This humorous hit proved so popular that it ultimately became one of the few to outlast ''Smash'' itself. Henry Nobbins had been a labourer on a building site until he inherited the title of Earl of Ranworth and five million pounds. Before he could touch the money, however, he had to become champion at a number of sports. He also had to evade the nefarious attentions of Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, who was a rival claimant to the fortune, and Parkinson's villainous henchman, Fred Bloggs.\n\nLord Henry, as he had now become, was more than ably assisted by his Butler, Jarvis, who he had inherited from the previous Earl. And Jarvis proved indispensable. Henry was never portrayed as anything other than an able athlete and a good natured bloke, leaving Jarvis to supply the cunning which was (frequently) needed to defeat the dastardly Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, and prevent Henry's ancestral home, Castle Plonkton, from being turned into a glue factory.\n\nThe relaunch included a short-lived football strip with humorous overtones, entitled ''The World-Wide Wanderers'', about a League football team composed of eleven players from eleven different countries \u2014 not such a funny joke today! Football manager Harry Kraft found himself a passenger on a ship passing through the Suez Canal; ships from all over the world called there, and the crews conducted impromptu soccer matches to while away the time in port. Some of the crews had been stranded there, and constant soccer practice (since there was nothing else to do) had caused them to develop fantastic footballing skills. Kraft shipped eleven of them, from as many different countries, back to England; and they used their highly unorthodox individual skills to play as a team in the old Fourth Division.\n\n===IPC Adventure Strips===\n\nThe other staple of the new ''Smash'' was adventure serials, and far and away the most successful of these was ''The Incredible Adventures of [[Janus Stark]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Janus%2BStark|title=British Comic Art}}</ref> written by Tom Tully,<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183041 Janus Stark] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> featuring an escapologist in Victorian London who appeared to be simply an unusual act on the music-hall stage, but who privately used his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. Stark had an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations, thanks to training received in childhood from his mentor, Blind Largo. Drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]], there was more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the departed ''Fantastic Four'' strip, in Stark's uncanny abilities.<ref>Stark's flexible bone structure, which was the basis of his career as an escapologist in the theatres, was perhaps more akin to ''Rubberman'', a character who had featured in ''Smash'' in 1966</ref> Lopez's dark, moody artwork also gave the strip a perfect 19th Century setting.<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\"/> The strip was one of the few to survive the merger of ''Smash'' into ''Valiant'' in 1971, and is still well remembered today. As a mark of its popularity, from week 30 it replaced ''Master of the Marsh'' as the lead serial on page 3 (swapping places with the latter, which was thus relegated to an inconspicuous location on pages 12 and 13).\n\nThis brings up the matter of economics once more. Solano Lopez was a foreign illustrator, born in the Argentine, who worked at a studio in Spain. For reasons of cost, IPC had taken a policy decision to source artwork from cheaper sources outside the UK.<ref name=\"blogs.birminghammail.net\"/> Along with the presence in the new ''Smash'' of reprint strips, which were much cheaper than commissioning new strips, this is yet another indicator of the financial pressure the comic was still under, and the absolute necessity of cutting production costs to the bone in order to make it financially viable.\n\nAnother long-running adventure strip was ''The Battle of Britain'', in which secret agent Simon Kane fought against Baron Rudolph, a usurper who had seized control of Britain using a secret weapon. The weapon emitted a sound wave which paralysed anyone who wasn't protected against it. Rudolph set up a police state, similar in emblems and uniforms to medieval England at the time of King John, and Kane led the resistance against him.\n\nIn spite of the title, the strip had no connection with the Second World War! Drawn for the initial 40 issues by Geoff Campion, and thereafter by [[John Stokes (comics)|John Stokes]],<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p109</ref> it was in fact a reprint; hence it, too, was an indication of the comic's troubled financial status (reprints being cheaper than new strips). It originally ran in ''[[Lion (comics)|Lion]]'' from 29 February 1964 to 28 May 1966 under various titles including ''Britain in Chains'' and ''The Battle for Britain'', where the hero was called Vic Gunn. The editorial staff of ''Smash'' took a decision to change the names of the leading characters from Gunn and Barrel (i.e. ''gun barrel''), to slightly less absurd ones; and so were born secret agent Simon Kane and his assistant Tubby. This had been a very long-running strip in ''Lion'', so much so that ''Smash'' actually ceased publication \u2014 in April 1971 \u2014 before it had reprinted the entire run from ''Lion'', and in the final issue created an (unconvincing) new ending for the serial.\n\n''Rebbels on the Run'' was another adventure serial, featuring three young brothers whose surname was Rebbel, who run away from an orphanage to avoid being split up. After a few months on the run, the strip took an amazing turn and \u2014 renamed ''The Rebbel Robot'' \u2014 became a science fiction serial, when the boys discovered that their late father's mind was preserved within the brain of a robot, which became their unofficial guardian. With it they embarked on a quest to track down a criminal known as The Genie, who had murdered their real father \u2014 who, in a further improbable turn of events, turned out to be a secret agent!\n\n''Eric the Viking'', a continuing serial featuring its eponymous Viking hero, and set in the Dark Ages, was another reprint from ''Lion'', where it had run under the title ''Karl the Viking'', as a set of 13 stories, from 29 October 1960 until 29 September 1964, written by Ken Bulmer.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\">Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p108</ref> The change of name to Eric probably reflects on the continuing fame (during the 1960s) of a real-life Viking leader in Dark Age Britain, Eric Bloodaxe, who history records was King in Viking York in the 10th Century. The strip is well remembered under its original title, as it was drawn by a famous comics artist, Don Lawrence.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Don Lawrence]</ref><ref>[http://www.donlawrence.co.uk/shop/index.php?hg=2&sg=35 Deluxe hardback collection of ''Karl the Viking'' strips] by Don Lawrence</ref> Eric (and Karl) fought a weird but impressive collection of legendary and fantasy monsters, in sword-and-sorcery epics which had some reflections in Lawrence's art for his contemporary work on the highly regarded all-colour science fiction strip ''[[The Trigan Empire]]'' then running in ''Look and Learn''. This was not even the first reprint: retitled ''Swords of the Sea Wolves'' it had initially been reprinted in ''Lion'', in part, between 1 October 1966 and 7 October 1967, with the lead character renamed Rolf the Viking.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\"/> And it would later be reprinted again, in the European version of ''Vulcan'': on that occasion translated into German and retitled 'Kobra'.\n\nTwo of the new IPC adventure strips \u2014 ''Sergeant Rock Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'' \u2014 were introduced five or six weeks early, in an attempt to conceal how few Odhams strips had actually survived, by making these appear to be existing strips although they were not. World War Two was the setting for the former, which, with occasional stories drawn by John Vernon,<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p88</ref> recounted the adventures of the 'Red Devils' of the Parachute Regiment. Initially, Sgt Rock was merely a narrator, introducing stories featuring other characters, so that it was actually tales-of-the-parachute-regiment, rather than tales of Sgt Rock himself. This was a device for reprinting old war stories from other comics: the strip had originally appeared in Fleetway's ''Hurricane'', from 4 July 1964 to 8 May 1965, entitled ''Paratrooper'', and continued in ''Tiger'' when that title absorbed ''Hurricane'' in the issue dated 15 May 1965. The reprints in ''Smash'' were reasonably successful, running for a year; and Sergeant Rock eventually featured as more than just narrator, with later editions sending him into action with the SAS, and marking the change by altering the title to ''Sergeant Rock - Special Air Service''. This change was noticeable, also, by a change of artist; seemingly \u2014 from the similarity of style \u2014 to the artist on the discontinued wartime strip, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''.\n\n''Bunsen's Burner'' was a short-lived strip, lasting just a few weeks.<ref>It was discontinued during the reshuffles of August 1969, when various changes were quietly made to the comic over the course of a month.</ref> This was an adventure yarn with humorous overtones \u2013 its humorous content being trailed in its title: a reference to an item familiar to most schoolboys from their Chemistry classes. Ben Bunsen was the owner of a vintage car, which was known as \"the Burner\" because it was so old it was steam-driven! Like an old-fashioned steam train it had a boiler which had to be stoked, as it ran on coal instead of petrol. Ben and his pal had to drive the Burner around the world, as a condition of Ben inheriting his uncle's fortune; but a rival claimant (shades of ''His Sporting Lordship''!) was secretly out to stop them.\n\nAnother adventure strip which had a sadly brief run, lasting only 47 weeks, but which is very well-remembered today, was ''Cursitor Doom''. In this spooky and atmospheric series,<ref>The strip had various artists during its one year run, but far and away the most effective of them was the talented Eric Bradbury, and it is mainly his serials from which the strip's enduring reputation derives</ref> Cursitor Doom, master investigator of the strange and mystic, who openly practiced sorcery in the strip, battled against the dark forces of evil, ably assisted by the pounding fists of his assistant, Angus McCraggan. Doom battled against genuine spirits and sorcerers, in tales including ''The Case of Kalak the Dwarf'', ''The Sorcerer's Talisman'' and ''The Dark Legion of Mardarax'', in the latter encountering a haunted (and unstoppable) Roman Legion brought back to \"life\" by the evil Mardarax. Doom's pet Raven, Scarab, who could write messages in the dust for Angus McCraggan, by scratching with his claw, was often of more help to Doom in these serials than was the perpetually baffled McCraggan.\n\nThe ''Cursitor Doom'' strip was drawn by Geoff Campion (including ''The Return of the Hunter''), and \u2013 more effectively \u2013 by [[Eric Bradbury]] (including the magnificently atmospheric ''Dark Legion of Mardarax'').\n\n===Changes in August 1969===\n\nAfter 22 weeks, in August&nbsp;1969, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' was dropped, and replaced from the 23rd&nbsp;issue by a more serious World War Two strip entitled ''Send For... Q-Squad'', which dealt with the adventures of a hand picked group of six specialists, who were assigned to unusual missions that required special expertise both in the air and on the ground. This, too, in keeping with the need to cut costs, was a reprint, originally published in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 7 March 1964 under the title ''Phantom Force 5''.<ref>[http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html ''Phantom Force Five''] in ''Buster''</ref><ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p36</ref>\n\nThis was another of those drawn, initially, by one of IPC's best British artists, [[Eric Bradbury]], at other times by the Spanish-based artist Luis Bermejo Rojo,<ref>[http://smashpages.net/2015/12/15/rip-luis-bermejo-rojo/ Career of Luis Bermejo] at SmashPages.net</ref> and in its final months mainly by Fred Holmes.<ref>Comics artist [http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html Fred Holmes] at BusterComic.com</ref> Because the strip had a regrettably short run in ''Smash'' (from 16 August 1969 to 30 January 1970 only), most of the run features art by Eric Bradbury.\n\nIt was marked out as a reprint by its unique style \u2014 which was both different from, and grimmer than, all the other strips. Whereas Sgt Rock emulated Lord Henry (and Janus Stark), by maintaining a huge and confident smile, regardless of how much trouble he was in, no one in ''Q-Squad'' ever stopped looking worried. Its reprint status was also signalled by the fact that Q-Squad was plainly ''not'' the original name of the team. Some panels showed evidence of the name having been inserted over a previous one: a change in the lettering style for the name 'Q-Squad' and any adjacent words \u2014 which used a different handwriting in a cruder style wherever the name appeared, but nowhere else.\n\nIn the same issue, a serious footballing serial entitled ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'' began, replacing the departed \u2014 and rather more humorous \u2014 ''World Wide Wanderers''. Hard-as-nails former prison sports instructor 'Toff' Morgan (so called for his habit of always wearing a top-hat) took over the management of ailing First Division side Haversham Hotspurs. Morgan began to rebuild the team by 'framing' ex-criminals who he'd known while working in various prisons, forcing them to sign on with the club in order to make use of their dishonest skills as footballing talents. These convicts became the 'handcuff hotspurs' of the title. The club's former manager, Reg Jessup, tried constantly to sabotage Morgan's efforts, in order to persuade the Directors to re-appoint him instead.\n\nSix months earlier, various humour strips had been introduced as replacements for the (far more surreal) humour of [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]], whose strip ''The Nervs'' had so disturbed IPC's management. Now another was forthcoming, and one which reflected the pervasive sporting theme of the relaunched comic. ''The Touchline Tearaways'' (replacing ''Big 'Ead'') was another new football-themed strip, featuring three mad-keen supporters of Grimshot United: a totally useless Football League team, perpetually in danger of being relegated as it was made up entirely of ailing and decrepit players. Each week the Tearaways \u2014 Hairy, Lug'oles and Clever Dick \u2014 would execute some scheme from the touchline to help Grimshot win that week's fixture, usually involving a battle of wits with officials from the Ministry of Football, who, not unnaturally, tried to put a stop to the Tearaways well-intentioned cheating.\n\nThe name of the club, Grimshot United, was a humorous indication that the team was not very good (i.e. that the players were \"grim shots\"). Each strip featured a single match, with a plot based around helping the team overcome that week's opponent. Clever Dick masterminded all the ploys used in helping Grimshot, and apart from occasional words of congratulation or encouragement he was generally the only \"Tearaway\" who had dialogue in the strip. Hairy and Lug'oles tended to be merely a pair of walking visual gags: Hairy's features were perpetually invisible behind a vast mass of long black hair that covered his entire face and head, and Lug'oles had a pair of enormous ears.\n\nThese three new strips represented a minor change of emphasis, replacing two of the more whimsical offerings with two entirely serious strips \u2014 even though the third new entry (which was only a single-page) was simply one outright cartoon strip replacing another.\n\nThus, within six months, a number of the strips introduced in the relaunch had already bitten the dust. And more changes were looming.\n\n===The 2nd Relaunch : 1970===\n\nThe most obvious problem faced by the new-look ''Smash'' was the constant \"churn\": the incessant turnover of strips. Without its solidly popular superhero strips to rely on, the editorial staff seemed pathologically incapable of settling on a fixed line-up.<ref>Continual change of line-up was not a problem unique to ''Smash'', but was shared by all IPC's comics of this period. Editors struggled to find strips sufficiently popular to halt the decline in weekly sales; but making so many changes was self-defeating, because it harmed reader loyalty.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the changes made in August&nbsp;1969, further changes made at the start of 1970 left ''Smash'' looking very different from its appearance in the wake of the relaunch just 12&nbsp;months earlier. A vast number of new strips were added, in a second re-launch, such that only half of those introduced in March&nbsp;1969 now survived, although those which continued included ''Master of the Marsh'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'', ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''Battle of Britain'', ''Eric the Viking'', ''Wacker'', ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'', ''The Swots and the Blots'', and ''Percy's Pets'' \u2014 the latter two now being the only remaining Odhams strips.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\nDiscontinued were ''King of the Ring'' (last survivor of the serious strips from the Odhams era), ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service'', and ''Cursitor Doom''. Three of the strips only recently introduced were also dropped, namely the wartime ''Q-Squad'', British superhero ''Tri-Man'', and the humour strip ''The Touchline Tearaways''.\n\nThe first changes in 1970 occurred in the issue dated 24 January, when three new strips appeared, all reprints from ''Buster'': ''The Kid Commandos'', ''Consternation Street'', and ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' (originally titled ''Milkiway \u2013 The Man from Mars''). These were introduced as part of a relaunch of the comic: by once again bringing in some of the changes a few weeks ahead of the relaunch, as had been done in the Spring of 1969, the publisher hoped to disguise the true extent of the changes.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\n''The Kid Commandos'' was a war story about three cockney children stranded in occupied France in World War Two. Drawn by Tom Kerr, the Sparrow children \u2014 Tommy, Jan and Podge \u2014 were on the run from the Germans each week, in a single page strip set in 1940. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it appeared from 9 January to 24 July 1965, under the imaginative title ''The Sparrows Go To War''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref>\n\nIn the humour strip ''Consternation Street'' drawn by Reg Parlett (the title spoofed that of the popular British television soap opera, ''Coronation Street''), which was usually a one-page strip, a collection of unlikely neighbours rubbed shoulders in a very small street. Watched over by the dim-witted Constable Clott were the Snobbs and the Ardupps, Colonel Curry & Caesar (his dog), Miss Primm and her pets, Cutprice the Grocer, and Roger the Lodger. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it had originally run \u2013 under the same title \u2013 between 9 January and 23 October 1965.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p44</ref> Parlett was also known from his other humour strips in ''Buster'' including ''Rent-A-Ghost Ltd'', ''The Happy Family'' and ''Bonehead''.<ref>[http://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=1992 Reg Parlett's contributions to ''Valiant'' and ''Buster''] (including the long running ''Billy Bunter'' strip in ''Valiant'', which continued in ''Valiant and Smash'')</ref>\n\nThe half-page humour strip ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' recounted the misadventures of spaceman Monty Muddle (a name rather less convincing than the character's original name, ''Milkiway''). It originally ran in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 10 March 1962, with art credited to Nadal/Rafart.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/> He flew about in his small bubble-domed spacecraft trying to make friends with the Earth people. However, due to his misunderstanding of Earth customs, his every attempt at contact ended in disaster; and each strip would typically end with the catchphrase ''I'll try again next week!''\n\nThe 7 February issue then saw a full re-launch: with more free gifts, another new cover feature, and no less than eight new strips (making an astonishing eleven strips added since the beginning of the year).\n\nThe ''Warriors of the World'' covers had run into a problem, in that war stories were no longer a strong element of ''Smash'', which had dropped the humour strip ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' some time earlier. When it was decided to also drop ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Paratrooper'' (by then renamed ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service''), and ''Q&nbsp;Squad'', the cover feature had to go too. It was not practical to advertise war stories on the cover if there were no war stories inside!\n\nThe newly added ''Kid Commandos'' did not count as a war story in this context, since the three fugitive children did not do any conventional fighting. The strip was more like a souped-up version of the discontinued ''Rebbels on the Run''.\n\nAccordingly, after forty seven weeks<ref>46 issues featuring the ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature, and one Christmas issue</ref> the ''Warriors of the World'' series was ended. Instead, the issue dated 7 February 1970 began ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'', written by Angus Allan and drawn by the ever-popular Eric Bradbury.<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183036 ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'']</ref> Henceforth each week's cover featured a full-page splash advertising the task which adventurer Simon Test would undertake in a new strip on the inside pages. This strip proved so successful that when the original thirteen-week series was completed (featuring one task each week), Simon Test was given a new series of adventures, extending his hold on the cover indefinitely. He would prove particularly enduring, being one of the few strips to ultimately survive the merger with ''Valiant'' in 1971.\n\n''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'' saw him undertake a quest for immortality by attempting the thirteen tasks of the Pharaoh Thot, believing this to be the only way to save his life, having been deceived into believing he has only a few months to live. The sinister Jabez Coppenger secretly desired Test's death as a means of restoring his own youth. This serial introduced the mute servant Karka, who would ultimately become Test's friend and assistant.\n\nTest then went on to the more lengthy series of adventures entitled ''Simon Test and the Curse of the Conqueror'', where he battled the twenty servants of the evil Ezekiel Spar, the self-styled Conqueror. This pitted him against twenty athletes and champions, each of whom was under the hypnotic control of Spar, who implanted in them an in-built impulse to kill Simon Test.\n\nNew supporting strips introduced in the 7 February issue included ''Threat of the Toymaker'', ''The Pillater Peril'', ''Birdman of Baratoga'', ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'', and three humour strips with a common supernatural element: ''Sam's Spook'' (drawn by Leo Baxendale), ''The Haunts of Headless Harry'', and ''Ghost Ship''.\n\nIn ''Threat of the Toymaker'', drawn by Solano Lopez, a criminal scientist named Doctor Droll escaped from Garstone Prison with the aid of an army of remote controlled mechanical toys he had constructed, along the way taking the Prison Governor's children, Pam and Peter Keen, as hostages. Hampered by the children at every turn, Droll finds himself on the run, pursued by the Police wherever he goes. The idea of using radio controlled toys in the strip was scarcely original, since it was a straight lift from the ''House of Dolmann'', which was then running in ''Valiant'', as well as from the ''General Jumbo'' strip in ''The Beano''. The strip was scarcely original either: having been first published in ''Buster'', under the title ''The Toys of Doom'', between 27 February 1965 and 13 January 1968 (and in which it would be reprinted\u2014in part\u2014between 3 May and 6 September 1986, under the title ''The Terror Toys''), it was also reprinted in ''Eagle'', under its original title ''The Toys of Doom''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\"/>\n\n''The Pillater Peril'' saw David Pillater return to Pillater House, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast, which he is to inherit on his 21st&nbsp;birthday. Along with his four cousins and his Uncle Bernard, David is imperilled by Francis Pillater, an ancestor who has seemingly returned from the dead. Francis had an evil reputation for his misdeeds in the 16th century, but was thought to have perished in a shipwreck during a storm at sea. Blaming the family for his troubles, he sets out for revenge by kidnapping them one by one. The strip had only a short run, but when discontinued it did, unusually, seemingly come to a natural conclusion (rather than merely wrapping-up many continuing plot threads unconvincingly in the final panel).\n\n''Birdman from Baratoga'' was an adventure strip about a boy who grew up on a Pacific island with only the company of birds, and learned from them the secret of flight. By the use of a feather cape, he was able to glide through the air like an albatros. When an English sailor is castaway on the island, called Baratoga, they escape together on a raft and set out on a series of adventures in the Pacific, beginning by hunting down the desperado who has stolen the man's pearl-fishing yacht, ''Enterprise''. ''Birdman from Baratoga'' was perhaps loosely based on a humour strip which had run in ''Buster'' during 1968: ''Captain Swoop \u2013 He's Half Man, Half Bird, Half Wit''.\n\nIn a very atypical move, prompted by IPC's on-going financial problems (in the year in which they were taken over by the Reed Group), the editorial team now resurrected one of the old strips which had run in ''Wham'' under Odhams, drawn by Gordon Hogg. ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'' featured two young lads from Liverpool who fancied themselves as musicians, spoke in Liverpudlian slang (even the original title of the strip was derived from a slang Scouse term for a native of Liverpool: 'wacker'), sported Beatles-style haircuts, and always carried guitars. This was a reprint of ''The&nbsp;Wacks'', which had run in ''Wham'' during 1964, reprinted here with only the title and the names changed. Spoofing the pop group ''The Beatles'', it was an odd choice to run it a year ''after'' that group's demise. It was, though, a popular item: this 1964 strip had already been reprinted, under the title ''Birk 'n' 'Ed, the Mersey Dead-Beats'', from 30 January 1965 in Fleetway's ''Hurricane''.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p.89</ref><ref>Spoken quickly for comic effect, the names of the two characters were intended to sound like that of a district in Liverpool called Birkenhead</ref>\n\nA common supernatural theme linked the three new humour strips. In ''Sam's Spook'', drawn by the ubiquitous Leo Baxendale, Sam was a schoolboy with a ghostly pal called Spooky, who used his powers to humorous effect on Sam's behalf. The strip mostly consisted of Sam's school friends catching Spooky doing a bit of ghostly cheating in order to help Sam win at sports or football, and Sam doing a lot of running away to avoid a bashing.\n\n''The Haunts of Headless Harry'' featured the amiable ghost of a 16th-century soldier who had been beheaded. Harry's head and body led separate but related ghostly existences, with the body carrying the head around everywhere, and both of them were able to talk. Harry's humorous adventures invariably involved misplacing his head; such as going to the cinema and, on leaving, calling at the cloakroom to collect it (as though it was a hat), and being asked by the attendant to identify it among all the other ghostly heads left there during the film.\n\nThe other new humour strip was ''Ghost Ship'', in which the spirit of an ancient galleon, and the ghosts of its pirate crew, sailed the Seven Seas making mischief, but usually coming off worst.\n\nFurther changes followed: such that fully thirteen strips had been introduced since the start of 1970. In the issue dated 27 June 1970, a new humour strip began entitled ''Moonie's Magic Mate'', about a schoolboy, Barry Moon, who finds a Genie in a dusty old bottle. In the issue dated 29 August, a humour strip titled ''The Fighting Three'' began, featuring the misadventures of three men: globe-trotters McGinty, Hambone and Weasel are travelling the world, trying to raise enough money to start their own construction company, but get into fights \u2013 and jail! \u2013 wherever they go. Drawn by Carlos Cruz, this was another reprint from ''Buster'', where, under its original title ''Mighty McGinty'', the strip had run in 1964.<ref>Published 29 February to 17 October 1964: ''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref> And finally, in the last addition before the comic's closure, a strip entitled ''Tyler the Tamer'' was launched in early 1971, about the adventures of the greatest film stuntman in the world. Dropped to make room for these were ''Kid Commandos'', ''Threat of the Toymaker'' and ''The Pillater Peril'' (the ''Pillater'' saga seemingly reaching a natural conclusion, instead of merely being summarily abandoned).\n\n==Merger with ''Valiant''==\n\nIn mid-November 1970, production on ''Smash'' (and many other IPC titles, including ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'') came to a halt due to a printers' strike, and no editions were published for the next three months.<ref name=SP2010 /> By the time the strike was settled, in February of the following year, irreparable damage had been done to the comic's circulation, as its young readers had turned elsewhere in the intervening 11&nbsp;weeks. Similar harm had been suffered by ''Valiant''. In consequence of this latest financial disaster, after eight issues, in April&nbsp;1971 the two titles were merged in an attempt to combine their surviving circulation. For a brief time the merged comic was entitled ''Valiant and Smash'' (10 April to 18 September 1971<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/11/27/valiant-70s/|title=Valiant 70s|date=27 November 2018}}</ref>), before reverting to simply ''Valiant''.\n\nSome strips from ''Smash'' survived in the new comic, including ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'' and ''The Swots and the Blots'', but most were lost,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180805023305/http://26pigs.com/valiant/index.html Merger with ''Valiant''] - ''Valiant and Smash''</ref> although the ''Smash'' Annual continued to appear for many years afterwards (continuing, in fact, until the 1976 Annual, published in the autumn of 1975). A lot of the strips thereby continued to appear each year, including many which had not even survived into ''Valiant'', long after ''Smash'' had ceased publication as a comic.<ref name=\"British Comics website\">{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/|title=Smash!|date=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe sports themed ''His Sporting Lordship'' had enjoyed perhaps the greatest popularity, surviving the shake-ups of 1969 and 1970, and then surviving even the merger with ''Valiant'', though it was to last only a few months in its new home, finally ending in December&nbsp;1971. However, it was revived in the 1972 ''Smash'' Annual, published at Christmas&nbsp;1971, and returned year after year: becoming the regular cover feature of the Annuals.<ref name=\"British Comics website\"/>\n\nThe merged title was dominated by ''Valiant'', which contributed nine strips consisting of twenty pages; whereas ''Smash!'' was represented by only four strips, totalling a meager nine pages: ''Janus Stark'', ''The Swots & The Blots'', ''Simon Test'', and ''His Sporting Lordship''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kidr77.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-valiant-attempt-at-smashing.html|title=CRIVENS! COMICS & STUFF: A VALIANT ATTEMPT AT A SMASHING COMBINATION...|date=25 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite all of the changes, the new ''Smash'' had lasted only two years. Maybe it was only marginally profitable, but no title could have survived such a lengthy loss of production. Its demise was directly attributable to the strike.<ref name=SP2010>{{Cite web|url=https://stephenpoppitt.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/comics-010/|title=Smash! : The IPC Years \u2013 Part 5: Cancellation|date=16 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n''Smash'' was the last attempt in the UK market to publish a general boys comic, mixing adventure, sports and humour strips. Subsequent comics would survive only by ruthlessly focusing on narrow, sectional interests: such as all-sports, all-war, or all-humour;<ref>The most successful of these was ''Doctor Who Weekly'', which still exists today, although it had to become a monthly title in order to survive (and adopt a magazine format)</ref> just as the American market had already specialised into all-funnies, all-horror, and all-superhero titles. The writing was on the wall for non-niche comics in the UK, for, in the face of the competition from television, even IPC's flagship, ''Valiant'', ultimately could not survive.<ref>''Note'': One trend in British comics was to ride the coat-tails of the success of television, which was gradually killing off comics, by specialising in strips based on popular tv shows: titles which attempted to ride the back of the tiger in this fashion included ''[[TV Comic]]'', ''[[TV Century 21|TV21]]'', ''TV Tornado'', ''[[Lady Penelope (comic)|Lady Penelope]]'', ''Joe 90 Top Secret'', ''[[Countdown (Polystyle Publications)|Countdown]]'', ''[[TV Action]]'', and ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]]''.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.IPCmedia.com/about/companyhistory/ The history of IPC]\n* [https://BritishComics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ ''Smash'' at the British Comics WordPress site]\n* [http://clitheroekid.ihostfull.com/links2.htm#comics 1960s British Comics review]\n* [http://BritishComicArt.blogspot.com/search/label/Smash/ ''Smash'' comic art]\n* [http://www.comicworldnews.com/crumpets/4/smash.jpg ''Smash'' #150 cover art]\n* [http://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/ ''Smash'' cover art] at the Grand Comics Database\n* [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/2009/08/battle-for-britain.html ''The Battle For Britain'' - Art by John Stokes]\n* Comics UK Gallery - [http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/gallery.php ''Valiant and Smash'']\n* Baxendale, Leo - [https://www.google.com/images?hl=en&num=20&as_epq=Leo+Baxendale&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=lang_en&cr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images&q=%22Leo+Baxendale%22&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=kFJmTIazKsiOjAfkzZ3UBA&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CCMQsAQwAw Images at Google.com]\n* Reid, Ken - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090304202443/http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/Interviews/KenReid/KenReidOverview.asp Comics UK biography of Ken Reid (1919-87)]\n* McMurtry, Stan - [http://www.cartoons.ac.uk/artists/stanmcmurtry/biography Biography: Stan McMurtry (a.k.a.

The ''Power Comics'' logo, printed on the cover of each issue, was a gimmick dreamed up by Odhams to unify their five titles under a common banner. ''Smash'' remained part of that lineup for 100 issues; the logo was quietly dropped after #143 when the last of the other comics forming part of the lineup was cancelled (so that there was no longer a group of titles needing to be unified).\n\nThe other Power Comics were all ultimately absorbed into ''Smash'', which became the last survivor. On 14 September 1968, with issue 137, it merged with ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow''. On 2 November 1968, with issue&nbsp;144, it merged with ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic''.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=3 Covers Gallery for 1968] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' ceased to be published by Odhams Press Ltd, and was thereafter published by IPC Magazines Ltd (an IPC subsidiary formed during 1968). On 15 March 1969 it was relaunched without its American superhero strips. Further changes followed during the course of 1969, and then a 2nd relaunch at the start of 1970. The final issue was published on 3 April 1971.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=6 ''Smash!''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> It was then merged into ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', forming ''Valiant and Smash''.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/52861/ ''Valiant and Smash!''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nIn addition, ten ''Smash!''

Holiday Special in 1971.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1966 the initial success of ''Wham!'' (which had launched in 1964 and quickly built up strong circulation figures) encouraged Odhams' London management to publish a second title, conceived by Alf Wallace (Managing Editor of Odhams' juveniles \u2014 ''Eagle'', ''Swift'' and ''Boy's World'') and Albert Cosser.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984)</ref> Leo Baxendale, who had created ''Wham!'' for Odhams in 1964, was too heavily embroiled with on-going production on it, providing much of the art for each issue, so had little time for anything else. Also, Baxendale was then still working at long range from Dundee.<ref>DC Thompson Ltd, Baxendale's former employers, were based in Dundee, Scotland</ref>\n\nAccordingly, it was Alf Wallace and Albert Cosser (soon to be known to their young audience as Alf and Cos) who determined the initial format of ''Smash!''. They also recruited the artists who would draw the early issues, as it was plain that Baxendale was fully occupied with the art for ''Wham!''. Baxendale's initial contribution to ''Smash'' was thus limited to providing a list of titles and situations for the humour strips, together with brief written scenarios (script ideas for the individual weekly issues), which he gave to Wallace to be farmed-out to other artists. ''The Swots and The Blots'' was one of these.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984),p.4-5</ref>\n\nBaxendale was asked only to create the ''Bad Penny'' strip, and to give ''Grimly Feendish'' (a character from his ''Eagle Eye, Junior Spy'' strip then running in ''Wham!'') a strip of his own. Wallace also had Baxendale draw the covers for the first three issues.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\"/>\n\n''Smash'' launched with the same format as the early issues of ''Wham'', namely 24 pages per issue, four of which were in colour; but it was printed on lower-quality paper than ''Wham''.\n\nThe initial line-up of strips mixed humour and adventure freely, with the comedic ''Ronnie Rich'' featuring on the cover of the first issue, inside which were adventure strips including the World War Two based ''Ghost Patrol'' \u2014 this latter a reprint strip which lasted only until issue 25. ''Ghost Patrol'' proved symptomatic of the problem with adventure strips which plagued ''Smash'' during the Odhams years, which tended to be ''sloppy in presentation and possessed of little real character or emotion''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984), p.6</ref>\n\nThe root of the problem with ''Smash'' was that it went through many changes in its early days \u2014 far too many. Particularly in its adventure strips: ''The Ghost Patrol'' came and went; ''The Legend Testers'' came and went; ''Moon Madness'' was particularly short-lived; and there were numerous others, equally forgettable. None proved popular enough to last.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Undeniably, none enjoyed the tremendous popularity of the American superhero strips which the comic would shortly feature, which genuinely had sufficient popularity to rival that of television.<ref>Marvel Comics as an independent UK publisher, in the 1970s, demonstrated that their superhero comics were capable of strong sales even in the face of competition from the newest rival -- colour television. ''Smash'' might have survived into that 1970s era of colour tv if it could have managed to retain its popular superhero strips.</ref>\n\nThose readers old enough to have become emotionally attached to comics before Odhams introduced American superhero strips to British readers tended to dislike those superhero strips.ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Whereas, according to the letters pages each week, those same Marvel and DC heroes were enormously popular among the younger age group which had not been reading comics previously. Accordingly, ''Wham'' readers tended to resent the changes made in 1966, because British strips were cancelled in ''Wham'' and replaced with US superheroes, whereas ''Smash'' readers did not resent the superheroes, because in 1966 that comic had only just launched, so there were no real changes \u2014 ''Smash'' more or less teemed with American strips from the very beginning.\n\n==Odhams Years==\n===Superheroes===\nBlack-and-white reprints of [[Marvel Comics]] strips<ref>All the Marvel stories were written by Stan Lee</ref> were introduced into ''Smash'' with issue&nbsp;16, when the ''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' began.<ref>Issue 16 saw the first appearance of Marvel's ''[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=1 Incredible Hulk]'' strip, drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html|title=BLIMEY!

In July&nbsp;1967 ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''<ref>Drawn at various times by Bill Everett, Wally Wood and Gene Colan</ref> replaced the Hulk, from issue&nbsp;76 onwards \u2014 ''Smash'' having exhausted all Hulk stories, from all sources, which had been published in the USA up to that time.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the significance of the introduction of ''The Hulk'', in the issue dated 21 May 1966. It was the first ''Marvel Comics'' strip featured by Odhams, the success of which led to the introduction of ''Fantastic Four'' into ''Wham'' on 6 August of that year, and to the launching of two entire comics entirely dedicated to Marvel superheroes \u2014 ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' \u2014 in 1967. The Hulk's initial appearance in ''Smash'' took up a massive 6 pages, one-quarter of each 24 page issue, pushing fully five existing strips out of that issue, and causing the permanent cancellation of \"Space Jinx\" and \"Brian's Brain\" (although the latter would be revived much later).<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.11</ref>\n\nPrior to this, [[DC Comics|DC]]'s ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]]'' had become the second American superhero to debut in ''Smash'', crashing onto the front cover of issue&nbsp;20 a month after the Hulk's debut, in re-edited reprints from American daily and Sunday newspaper strips: these were credited in-page to ''Batman'' creator Bob Kane, but were actually drawn by [[Al Plastino]] and ghost-written by [[Whitney Ellsworth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/368494/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Smash! #75|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> This was a response to the sudden and enormous popularity of the ''Batman'' television series starring Adam West. The impact of this hit TV show led to the ''Batman'' strip retaining the front cover of ''Smash'', in colour, for better than a year and a half, entitled ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder''.\n\nInitially, this syndicated newspaper strip adopted the camp style of the Adam West television series, with appearances by humorous guest stars such as American funnyman [[Jack Benny]]. In the later part of the run (which featured serious, rather than camp, stories) Batgirl, too, appeared in the strip, a response to her addition to the TV show in its 3rd season: in the newspaper strip, Batman initially believed her to be a criminal rather than a crime fighter. Superman then co-starred in the strip, which was retitled ''Superman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'', as Batman and Robin attempt to save Superman from the diabolical Professor Zinkk who was secretly poisoning him with kryptonite.\n\nThe expansion of the American content, with the arrival of ''Batman'', meant the loss of two more of the initial British strips: the adventure strip ''The Ghost Patrol'', and the cartoon strip ''The Tellybugs''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\"/>\n\nIn September 1968 the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' began a six-month run in ''Smash'', when it absorbed ''Pow'' (which had previously merged with ''Wham'', in which the strip had initially featured). As one of only a handful of ''Pow'' strips to survive the merger, it was used to lure ''Pow'' readers to the new comic. The strip was introduced to readers of ''Smash'' with the wedding of Reed and Sue from ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Their adventures continued with ''Defeated by the Frightful Four'', and ran through to ''Lo There Shall Be an Ending'', which was the final Marvel strip to appear in ''Smash''.\n\n''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' began a short run in November 1968 when ''Smash'' absorbed ''Fantastic''. The stories, continued from ''Fantastic'', began with ''The Ringmaster's Circus of Crime''. When the Marvel strips were discontinued the following spring, the final ''Thor'' reprint had a new ending substituted, in a rushed attempt to resolve a continuing sub-plot.\n\nThe financial crisis which overtook Odhams in 1968, resulting in the closure of all the other ''Power Comics'', also caused them to give up the expensive licence to reprint the Marvel superhero stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvuk.htm|title=Marvel UK|website=www.internationalhero.co.uk}}</ref> This decision took effect in March&nbsp;1969, when the licence came up for renewal; the final Marvel strips appeared in issue&nbsp;162. The expensive ''Batman'' newspaper strip had already been discontinued, ending in issue&nbsp;157.\n\n===Odhams Humour Strips===\nThere were typically a dozen British humour strips in each of the first 162 issues.\n\nThe initial line-up starred ''The Man From B.U.N.G.L.E.'', which usually occupied the front cover prior to issue&nbsp;20,<ref>''Smash'': [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html The first 20 covers]</ref> supported by seven other long-running humour strips (''Charlie's Choice'',<ref name=\"Brian Lewis\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Brian Lewis]</ref> ''Bad Penny'',<ref name=\"Leo Baxendale\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Leo Baxendale]</ref> ''Percy's Pets'',<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> ''The Nervs'',<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html|title=BLIMEY!

It is unclear why Alf and Cos chose this deeply unfunny strip for what must have been considered the pride of place in the new comic. ''Space Jinx'' was primarily another ''Jonah'' (a strip by Ken Reid which had run in ''The Beano''), except that it could not hold its own against the brilliance of Reid's sea-faring twit. Where ''Jonah'' dealt with sinking ships of the sea, Brian Lewis's ''Space Jinx'' dealt with similar situations in outer space, but (in practice) without the necessary degree of humour.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.7</ref>\n\nKen Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' would last only slightly longer, at 43 issues. A masterpiece of comic artistry, telling the story of the ''Buoyant Queen'' and its two-man crew, Enoch and Bert, a pair of oafs with a love/hate relationship (mostly hate!), it was perhaps too intelligent for its target audience \u2014 its disappearance was a great loss to the comic.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> Many readers failed to understand, amongst many things in the strip that went clear over their heads, that the two main characters were drawn in the likeness of comedians [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], and that the strip's humour was based on the movies of Laurel & Hardy.\n\nAfter only five months \u2013 foreshadowing many, many reshuffles to come \u2013 ''Smash!'' underwent its first major overhaul: from issue&nbsp;20 the ''Batman'' newspaper strip took over the front cover, whilst ''Grimly Feendish'' lost the colour back cover to Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' (which shrank from its original two pages each week to only a single page \u2014 the loss of the extra page was a drawback, but was compensated for by the strip now having a more prestigious location in the comic, and of course by now being in colour).\n\nFurther cover changes would follow. When, after two years, the popularity of the ''Batman'' television series eventually faded, from issue&nbsp;114 onward Batman and Robin were moved to the inside pages, yielding the front cover to the long-running success ''The Swots and the Blots'', at this point still being drawn by Mike Lacey, a humour strip in which two rival gangs vied to outwit each other at Pond Road School, with \"Teach\" caught in the crossfire. Its origins lay in Baxendale's classroom-based strip ''The Tiddlers'', which had then been running for 2 years in ''Wham''<ref>In fact it was a direct continuation of ''[https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/wham/ The Tiddlers]'', with only a change of name. The characters (i.e. \"Teach\" and the Blots), school buildings, and situations, were all largely as they had been in ''The Tiddlers''. The only difference was the addition of the Swots, so that Teach now had an ally.</ref> (and which continued in ''Pow'' when ''Wham'' merged with it in 1968, where it was combined with ''The Dolls of St Dominics'' to become ''The Tiddlers and The Dolls'').\n\n''The Swots and the Blots'' was one of the few strips in ''Smash'' to survive all the changes of 1969 and 1970, reaching a new standard of excellence when [[Leo Baxendale]] began drawing it for the new-look ''Smash'' from March 1969, but even during the Odhams years it had wit and a sense of style. In Baxendale's hands it had notable similarities to his earlier classroom-based strip, ''The Bash Street Kids'', in ''[[The Beano]]''.<ref>Around 1968, Baxendale quit Odhams for the better paying ''Fleetway'' comics. One of the strips he produced there was ''[http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2017/07/leo-baxendales-big-chief-pow-wow.html Big Chief Pow Wow]'' for ''Buster''\u2014the strip ran from 14 September 1968 to 31 January 1970 (some issues were fill-ins by other artists).</ref>\n\n''The Man from BUNGLE'', spoofing the popular TV series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', was a spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye Junior Spy'' strip in ''Wham''. BUNGLE was a secret spy organisation in Britain, organised along more chaotic lines than UNCLE, featuring a secret agent who employed a wide variety of hugely unlikely gadgets in his fight against his humorous opponents. Baxendale himself drew the first few editions, which appeared as large single illustrations on some of the early covers of ''Smash'', after which Mike Lacey took over.\n\nThe second spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye'' strip was ''[[Grimly Feendish]]'' (subtitled ''The Rottenest Crook in the World''), which Leo Baxendale himself drew. Feendish had been the most popular character in the earlier strip, thanks to his ghoulish appearance, which was based on Uncle Fester in the American television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'' (and, presumably, on Charles Adams' illustrations from which the TV series was derived).<ref>Interestingly, the strip would probably have been ''banned'' if this had been an American comic, as the [[Comics Code Authority]] prohibited presentation of crime in comics if it tended to create sympathy for the criminal, and this strip appears to fall foul of that restriction.</ref> The new strip at one point occupied a prestigious position, as the full-colour back cover feature each week, and survived throughout the entire run of 162 issues published by Odhams (even though, after giving up its cover status, it was sometimes ignominiously reduced to only a quarter-page \"filler\").\n\n''Bad Penny'' was another memorable Baxendale creation. Its title logo featured a portrait of Penny herself, alongside the 'Bad Penny' caption, and an illustration of a giant pre-decimal One Penny coin (the coin suggesting the connection with the proverb from which the character's name originated).\n\nShe had some similarities with Baxendale's earlier Minnie the Minx character in ''The Beano''. When he had been drawing Minnie, he had concentrated on experimenting with facial expressions and character traits. By the time he began working on ''Bad Penny'' his drawing style had matured, with an equal concentration on developing a zany but tight storyline, less emphasis on close-ups of facial expressions, but retaining the essentials needed to put over a character's own personality traits.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\"/>\n\nBad Penny was so popular that she survived the changes of 1969, and continued to appear in the new ''Smash''. When the strip was eventually dropped, in 1970, Bad Penny herself still continued to appear, albeit infrequently, making occasional appearances in Baxendale's ''The Swots and the Blots'' as a new member of the Blots.\n\nAs had happened in ''Wham'', artists such as Mike Lacey were commissioned from time to time to \"ghost\" Baxendale's style. Baxendale was allowed to sign his early work on ''Smash'', so there is a way to distinguish which strips he personally drew during his time at Odhams.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075207/http://26pigs.com/wham/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Wham!|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>In practice, Baxendale signed very few of his strips, so it is quite difficult to tell which are his and which are other artists substituting for him.</ref> After he transferred to Fleetway, another IPC subsidiary, he still contributed strips to ''Smash'', but now worked \"undercover\", i.e. without signing them. He explained this in his autobiography, ''A Very Funny Business'' (Duckworth, 1978, page&nbsp;91): \"I was in a delightful situation. Working under my own name, a lot was expected of me. Publishers ''expected'' me to cram my drawings with funny detail. A double standard operated. Working undercover, I was able to reduce the layouts to the simplest terms. Backgrounds were minimal or non-existent \u2014 just a horizon line. And there was no ancillary comic detail \u2014 just the characters acting out the story line against an empty backdrop.\"\n\nThe most bizarre of the Odhams humour strips was ''The Nervs'', depicting a group of little characters inhabiting a schoolboy called Fatty: the strip showed them running Fatty like a group of workers running a factory. Allocated two pages, it followed the same formula as the strip ''Georgie's Germs'' from ''Wham!''. Fatty was aptly named, with the tiny Nervs battling to save the fat twerp's stomach from its numerous overloads, as a minute never passed which was free from him guzzling!\n\nDrawn for the majority of its run by Graham Allen,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> in its final months during 1968-69 [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]]<ref>Comics artist [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Reid Ken Reid]</ref> \u2014 previously of ''Queen of the Seas'', and who had earlier contributed the ''Dare-a-Day Davy''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/dadd.htm|title=Ken Reid's Dare A Day Davy|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> strip to ''Pow'' \u2014 drew this double-page feature.\n\nReid's career had begun at ''The Beano'' in the 1950s, but for Odhams he had already produced the long running success ''Frankie Stein'', in ''Wham!'', before taking on ''Queen of the Seas'' in the early issues of ''Smash!'' and the  ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip in ''Pow!''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> He turned ''The Nervs'' into an extremely surreal, even visceral, strip; achieving a rare level of hilarity and bawdiness, in a subversive presentation of comical horror \u2014 and in the process alarming IPC's management !<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\"/>\n\nHe already had some degree of notoriety, as being the only Odhams artist whose work so disturbed the management that it was actually banned.<ref>[http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/weird1.html Review] of the banned ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' Frankenstein strip</ref><ref>''Dare-A-Day Davy'' [http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/picts2.html Frankenstein strip], published in ''Weird Fantasy''&nbsp;#1 in 1969</ref> At the suggestion of Vance Gledhill of Blackpool, Davy was dared to dig up Frankenstein's monster (in the ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip) and bring him back to life \u2013 for which Reid decided to employ the \"kiss of life\"!

This was a device for featuring, as guest stars in the strip each week, an assortment of popular TV stars. The strip's debut appearance, for instance, featured Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, stars of top-rated secret agent show ''The Man From UNCLE'', maximising their appearance by splashing them across the front cover. It was hoped that by bringing popular television stars into its pages, this would make TV's growing popularity work ''for'' the comic \u2014 a not very subtle ploy to boost its circulation and sales.\n\n''Sammy Shrink'' (subtitled ''The Smallest Boy in the World'')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> was a humour strip about a boy who was only two inches tall. Sammy had the most successful \u2014 but also the most chequered \u2014 career of all the characters featured in ''Smash'', having originated in ''Wham'', then moved to ''Pow'' when they merged, arriving in ''Smash'' when it in turn absorbed ''Pow'', and would subsequently be revived in ''Knockout'', finally ending his career in ''Whizzer and Chips'' when it absorbed ''Knockout'' in June&nbsp;1973.\n\n''Ronnie Rich'' featured the richest kid in the world, who stands to inherit a fortune if only he can get rid of the money he's got. Drawn by Gordon Hogg,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> each week Ronnie spent his every last penny, in some reckless or extravagant way, only to have his scheme backfire and make him richer than ever. He never did get his hands on the fortune.\n\nOften a half-page feature, ''Percy's Pets'' drawn by Stan McMurtry (alias Mac)<ref>Comics artist [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040731/Macs-secret-lady-Britains-cartoonist-reveals-hidden-images-wife.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> was popular enough to go on to make sporadic reappearances from time to time in the new ''Smash'' after March&nbsp;1969. Percy was a small plump schoolboy, who filled his family's home with his exotic collection of pets. These included (from time to time) an elephant, a giraffe, a hippopotamus, a snake, an ape \u2014 in fact almost every type of animal that might be found in a typical zoo \u2014 together with a parrot, a tortoise, a white mouse, and a hedgehog; thereby causing a predictable degree of comical chaos for his long suffering mum and dad.\n\nSome of the best-remembered strips were not included in all of the first 162 issues: a number of them were only acquired in #137, from the merger with ''Pow!'' (which had already absorbed the most popular strips running in ''Wham!'').\n\nOne such acquisition from ''Pow!'' was ''The Cloak''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/cloak.htm|title=Mike Higgs' The Cloak|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> \u2014 like ''The Man From BUNGLE'', another humorous secret agent strip. The Cloak was the top agent for Britain's Special Squad, nominally a part of Scotland Yard; but he usually operated from his personal headquarters, known as the Secret Sanctum. His ingenuity and never-ending supply of gadgets and secret weapons gave him the edge over his somewhat odd enemies (some were ''very'' odd, including Deathshead and various other agents of G.H.O.U.L.).\n\nHe had some equally odd colleagues. Assisted initially by Mole (the tall one with the bald head, big nose and specs) and Shortstuff (the short squirt with the hairy nut and big eyeballs), he then began having adventures in which he found himself also alongside the sexy and flirtatious Lady Shady, the shady lady. The strip benefited from the unusual, idiosyncratic drawing style of Mike Higgs, whose overt inclusion of pop culture imagery made the strip seem extremely modern.\n\n''Wiz War'', drawn by Mike Brown, had also begun in ''Pow!'', and would be one of a handful of strips to survive the changes of 1969. Brown seems to have been unaware of the house rule banning artists from signing their work, as the strip often bore his name. The \"War\" in the title referred to a feud between two wizards, Wizard Prang and his enemy Demon Druid. Being a humour strip, the editorial staff allowed the hero the very silly name of Wizard Prang, a piece of RAF slang from the Second World War.\n\nOther than the fact that Prang was robed entirely in white, befitting his status as the good guy, and Demon Druid was always in black, being the villain of the piece, their costumes were quite similar - a flowing wizard's robe with stars on, and a pointed hat. They would fly around on broomsticks, zapping each other with spells: which turned the other into a toad, or something equally amusing. Wizard Prang was alternately helped and hindered by Englebert, his pet bird. The best feature of the strip was the sign above Wizard Prang's front door. This usually read \"Wizard Prang is... In\" (if he was at home) or \"Wizard Prang is... Out\" (if he was out and about); but if he'd had a bad time in the story, the sign would often make a humorous remark in the final panel, such as \"Wizard Prang is... All At Sea\".\n\nThe secret of Mike Brown, unacknowledged for many years, was that Leo Baxendale needed to earn money from Odhams without disclosing to Fleetway that he was now working for both companies. Accordingly, Baxendale now pencilled the drawings, and Brown, who was a cartoon film animator, inked them in. In this way, they turned out together large numbers of ''Bad Penny'' and ''Grimly Feendish'' strips, which they sold to Odhams under Brown's name \u2014 a situation Baxendale referred to, in his 1978 autobiography, as working ''undercover''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984),p.10</ref>\n\nLost in the merger with ''Pow'' were ''Charlie's Choice'', ''Ronnie Rich'' and ''The Man From BUNGLE''. Also lost in this merger, in effect, was Ken Reid's ''Dare-A-Day Davey'' strip, one of several established features in ''Pow'' which were dropped instead of transferring to ''Smash''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.15</ref>\n\n===Odhams Adventure Strips===\n\nAs ''Smash'' was essentially a superhero and humour comic during the Odhams years, there were few traditional adventure strips in it; but a handful do bear special mention.\n\nThere were various well-remembered adventure strips in the first hundred issues, including some which were quite outstanding, such as ''Rubberman'', ''Experiment X'', ''The Legend Testers'', and ''The Python''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFrom issue 144 in November 1968 ''Smash'' was the only surviving ''Power Comic'', as this was the issue in which ''Smash and Pow'' (as it then was) merged with ''Fantastic''. Five British adventure serials were introduced in this issue, to plug the gap left by the loss of the withdrawn American superhero strips which had been major features of the four closed titles.\n\n''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' is an adventure strip in which a crime reporter on the Daily Globe newspaper is apparently killed while investigating a news story. The world believes newspaperman Jim Jordan is dead, but he still carries on his crusade against crime... calling himself The Spectre.\n\nHe is now fighting crime, rather than merely reporting it, using an array of gadgets which make it seem he is the ghost of the missing reporter. Hence his opponents are terrified to find that if they shoot him he doesn't die (a bullet-proof raincoat was the trick here). And he has a secret underground hideout beneath the statue erected in his memory, from which he would covertly and unexpectedly emerge, or disappear into, under cover of an artificial fog, to give the impression he was coming and going from the spirit world. His first case began in issue&nbsp;144, in which he tracks down Black Murdo, the racketeer who the world believes had murdered him.\n\n''Destination Danger'', a motor racing serial, also began in issue&nbsp;144. This strip was about a feud between a young English racing driver, Jeff Jackson, who was working for Puma Motors in the US, and his enemy Vic Stafford, the Puma team's chief driver, who has taken a bribe to throw a forthcoming race.\n\nAlthough new to ''Smash'', the old-fashioned artwork in the strips ''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' and ''Destination Danger'' marked them out as reprints. The use of reprints was a cost-cutting measure, indicating the straightened financial circumstances of ''Smash'' at this point \u2013 if any evidence were needed beyond the closure of all four of the other ''Power Comics''.\n\n''Laird of the Apes'' was a science fiction strip, milking the popularity of the big budget Charlton Heston motion picture ''Planet of the Apes'' which was released earlier that year. In the strip, set in the 18th century, a young Scottish laird returns to the Highlands to aid his outlaw clansmen in their struggle with the English Redcoats, bringing with him a band of highly trained Apes.\n\nAn adventure strip with a sporting theme was the wrestling serial ''King of the Ring'', featuring Ken King, who was a champion of the grunt-'n'-grapple game (although in the earliest strips he had begun as a boxer). As was not exactly uncommon in the Odhams years, there was a tendency to give the characters very silly names. The most outrageous example in this strip was King's manager, who (in spite of ''not'' being Irish) was called Blarney Stone!\n\nBlarney's real name was originally Tim Stone, and Blarney was only a nickname; but this was soon forgotten. In order to fulfil Ken's ambition to travel, Blarney agrees to manage him on a world tour, if he'll agree to fight his way round the world!\n\nThe fifth adventure strip added was ''Brian's Brain'', drawn by Bert Vandeput,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> a serial with science fiction elements, continued from ''Pow''. This featured two schoolboys: the eponymous Brian and his friend Duffy Rolls. Brian Kingsley possessed an electronic Brain resembling a human skull, which he carried about in a box. It could communicate with him telepathically, glowing when active; and it could control the actions of animals if they were within a few yards, which was the limit of its brain-wave transmissions.\n\nAll five strips commenced in issue&nbsp;144; and all were serials, with cliff-hanger endings each week.\n\n===The Closure of the ''Power Comics''===\nWhat must always be born in mind is that, in the comics industry, the 1960s were not the 1930s. With the advent in Britain of commercial television, in 1955 \u2014 displacing the staid, old-fashioned children's television offered by the BBC up to that point \u2014 the ever-increasing competition from the ''boob-tube'' began a continuous (and accelerating) decline in comics circulation. Throughout the 1960s, in consequence, the circulation wars fought in the comics publishing industry were fought out against a backdrop of ever-declining circulation figures.\n\nFollowing the initial success of ''Wham'' in 1964, Odhams had launched four more [[Power Comics]] during 1966 and '67, including ''Smash'', only to close them in quick succession: merging each in turn into the survivors until by 1969 only ''Smash'' remained. Whereas 1968 began with all five ''Power Comics'' apparently flourishing, by the year's end only ''Smash'' was still being published.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\"/> Even the sleepiest of readers began to notice that something was seriously wrong, as the increasingly frantic series of mergers resulted in ever more ludicrous titles, culminating in the astonishing ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic'' (commonly spoofed as ''Smash, Pow, Wham, incorporating Fantastic and Terrific'').\n\nThe question is why, in a limited market such as the UK, they took such a big risk as to launch five titles (which in hindsight looks an unwise decision by the Odhams management), if it was so quickly obvious that the market could only support one? It has been suggested<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> that it was common practice for a publisher to quickly clone a successful title, in order to forestall its competitors from doing so. That does not seem to be the case here. The comic's only distinctive feature was its American superhero strips, so ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' (which most of the time contained ''only'' Marvel superhero strips) might loosely be described as clones of ''Smash'', even though they lacked any humour strips; but IPC had an ''exclusive'' licence from Marvel Comics to reprint Marvel's strips in the UK, which precluded anyone else from doing so.\n\nThe actual answer lies in the unexpected nature of the economic crisis of 1968 that hit the British economy, resulting in the devaluation of the Pound.<ref>In Britain, the devaluation crisis was major news due to certain ill-judged remarks by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who would be mocked for the rest of his career for his infamous falsehood, ''This will not affect the Pound in your pocket!''</ref> The economic chaos began with a Sterling crisis in Britain in 1967, leading to devaluation in the November. There then followed a crisis for the U.S. dollar in March&nbsp;1968 which had a cascade effect on the international economic system, sending first the French franc and then the West German deutschmark into devaluation, and culminating in a ''new'' Sterling crisis in Britain in November&nbsp;1968.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2170396 ''The Economic Crisis of 1968''] \u2013 published in ''American Historical Review''</ref><ref>Article, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/dec2005/mccar-d30.shtml ''Eugene McCarthy \u2013 pivotal role in 1968 Political Crisis'']</ref>\n\nThese repeated falls in the value of the Pound against the U.S. dollar significantly increased the cost of publishing the American strips, which had to be paid for in dollars, and raised the daunting spectre of further increases if the Pound fell in value yet again. Increasing the cover price of the ''Power Comics'' to compensate was impossible because of stiff competition (with sales on a sharp downward spiral, as circulation fell victim to the ever increasing popularity of television); so the fall in the value of Sterling made the American strips unaffordable.\n\nThe toughness of the competition is apparent from examining other contemporary titles.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/ British Comics] website</ref> The first issue of its stablemate ''Fantastic'', published in February 1967, cost 9d for 40 pages (due to its very high content of American superhero strips), a cover price which forced ''Fantastic'' to close within 18 months. ''Terrific'', having the same high content of American material, also had a high cover price of 9d, and closed even quicker.\n\nIn contrast, the comics ''Dandy'' and ''Beano'' published by the rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] organisation sold at a cover price of 3d. ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' cost three times as much, which (even with double the number of pages compared to many DC Thomson titles) proved unsustainable. This is not surprising, given that ''Wham'' and ''Pow'' each peaked at a cover price of 7d, and even that proved unsustainable.\n\n''Smash'' had launched in February&nbsp;1966 with a cover price of 7d for 24&nbsp;pages. By March&nbsp;1969, although its cover price had not changed, circumstances had conspired to increase its page count, such that each issue now contained 36&nbsp;pages. In fact the page count jumped overnight from 24 pages to 36 pages (a fifty percent increase), with a consequent sharp rise in production costs, and so a marked decline in profit-per-copy.\n\nThe tipping point was issue 144, in which ''Smash'', ''Pow'' and ''Fantastic'' were merged into a single title. The recently created ''Smash and Pow'' lost its ''Daredevil'' and ''Spider-Man'' strips, which together had comprised a full third of each 24 page issue, but now had to accommodate both ''Thor'' and ''Fantastic Four'' from the discontinued titles, plus a whole slew of new British adventure strips (which were being added in preparation for the comic's impending transition to solely-British content).\n\nAll this could not be achieved within the standard ''Smash'' format of 24 pages. So IPC now \"bit the bullet\" and increased the page count, at a single bound, by fifty percent \u2014 a necessity if they were to achieve their intention of reproducing with ''Smash'' the successful formula which was buoying-up sales of their most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant'', both of which were 36-pagers (in effect, to produce another clone of them: an identical mix of adventure and humour, with an identical page count, at an identical price).\n\nOne fundamental difficulty for the ''Power Comics'', however, was always the stark economic truth that a kid could buy both ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'', at 3d each, and still have change left over, for what it cost to buy ''Smash!'', ''Wham!'' or ''Pow!'' at 7d each. However, the DC Thomson titles only had 16 pages, and this more than anything drove up the page count in ''Smash!'', from its original 24 pages to 36 pages, and eventually to 40 pages in 1970 (i.e. it might be more than double the price of a DC Thomson title but it was also more than double the size).<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.9</ref> The difficulty was that the much lower price of ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'' gave those titles a significant advantage, since a kid could choose to buy only one of them, at 3d \u2014 a winning competitive advantage which, as of 1966, would keep both of the DC Thomson titles afloat for more than 30 years to come.\n\nThe highly competitive nature of the UK's publishing industry meant margins were thin: a minimum number of sales each week were needed to reach break-even point, and the lower the cover price, the greater was the number of sales needed to reach that point; but the higher the cover price, the fewer were the number of sales that could actually be achieved.\n\nThe juvenile readers (or their parents) might be able to afford two or three comics a week, but by publishing five ''Power Comics'' IPC were pricing themselves out of the market. For the situation in Britain was not like that in America, where, with comics published just once a month, a child might afford five titles. In Britain, comics were published weekly.\n\nUnder those conditions the ''Power Comics'' were effectively competing with each other \u2014 a factor IPC were certainly aware of, as the letters pages in ''Smash'', in 1968, actually carried readers' complaints that they couldn't afford all five ''Power'' titles. The five together cost an astonishing three shillings and threpence a week (39d), to buy them all, far beyond the reach of the average child's weekly pocket money.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.13</ref>\n\nThe ''Power Comics'' were also competing with IPC's other titles, including [[Lion (comics)|Lion]], [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]] and [[Buster (comics)|Buster]], potentially dragging the Group's entire line into bankruptcy. Rationalisation, by closing some of the titles, would produce an overall benefit, as it would dramatically cut IPC's production costs. Although it would mean fewer titles, as IPC's comics were actually competing against each other it ought to result in better sales for the survivors. In theory, there would be no overall loss of sales or revenue, provided readers switched from the closing titles to surviving IPC ones (rather than to rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] ones).\n\nAnother factor Odhams had not anticipated was the distribution of American comic books within the UK. Although this had always been a consideration, the volume of such comics arriving in Britain had traditionally been small, and their distribution haphazard. In 1968, distribution and quantity suddenly underwent a marked improvement: in America, Marvel Comics' owner, Martin Goodman, pulled off a business coup that overnight freed Marvel from a restrictive distribution agreement, which for a decade had limited it to publishing only 8 titles a month: Marvel was suddenly quadrupeling its monthly output, and dozens of new titles were flooding into Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emagazinepdf.com/2017/05/marvel_comics_-_the_untold_story/|title=''Marvel Comics \u2014 The Untold Story'', Sean Howe (2012)}}</ref> Odhams' black-and-white [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] reprints in their ''Power Comics'' range suddenly faced much more extensive competition from four-colour Marvel originals, and this began to harm sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/03/40-year-flashback-smash-regenerates.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: 40 Year Flashback: SMASH! regenerates|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the turbulent economic conditions, any part of IPC's business which was loss-making had no future. Standard industry practice was to close a comic or magazine if its revenues dipped ''towards'' the break-even point; publishers did not wait for a title to actually incur losses.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> Hence, merely to anticipate losses on the other four titles (''Pow'', ''Wham'', ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'') was enough to doom them. And the closures represented a major cost-cutting exercise, reducing the ongoing production costs on the ''Power Comics'' line by four-fifths.\n\nAs for actual losses incurred due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the problem, and the inability to quickly terminate the long-term contracts with the Americans, ''Smash'' as sole survivor couldn't hope to generate enough income on its own to meet these. In fact it didn't need to. The fortunate circumstance that the ''Power Comics'' were all published by Odhams Press Ltd, a subsidiary company with limited liability, meant that it was possible to ring-fence all debts on the Odhams publications within that one company, thus preventing any losses affecting the rest of the IPC Group (since IPC's other titles were all published by other IPC subsidiaries). Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' was transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd, a new IPC subsidiary formed during 1968,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/publisher/1946/|title=GCD :: Publisher :: IPC|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> leaving Odhams with no continuing titles, and ''Smash'' started again from scratch.<ref>[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?disp=1&frfsh=1414205283&#result Odhams Press Ltd] continued in being until 7 January 1998, when it changed its name to Formpart (No.11) Limited, which still exists today; currently a dormant private company.</ref>\n\nDespite being the longest survivor, and inheriting many popular strips from the other four titles, ''Smash'' was only a limited success. It was plainly on shakey ground: for, hard on the heels of the closure of the other titles, in the spring of 1969 IPC quickly made extensive changes to it, dropping the last remaining Marvel superhero strips, to shed the expense of the licensing fee for using them (having already dropped ''Batman''), and ending many other strips too.\n\nIn consequence of the decision to discontinue the American reprints, as each ''Power Comic'' closed its superhero strips were given up. Only in the case of ''Fantastic'', where the existing contract with Marvel had some months to run, were those strips transferred to its replacement, the merged ''Smash incorporating Fantastic'', until the contract expired in March&nbsp;1969.\n\n''Smash'' then introduced a new cover feature, new strips, and free gifts. In all but name it was a new comic. Even so, it required yet another major shakeup 12 months later, in the spring of 1970, when further changes of editorial policy were imposed by new owners Reed International, who had bought out IPC that year. This resulted, among other things, in the dropping of the newly introduced ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature in favour of a new lead serial: an adventure series entitled ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test''.\n\nWithin the British market, boys' comics for the age group which was too old for titles such as ''Beano'', ''Dandy'' and ''Sparky'' tended to focus around adventure, sport and war (in titles such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''), or humour (in titles such as ''Buster''). In abandoning its superheroes, ''Smash'' sought to attract readers of both types, by offering traditional adventure as well as humour.\n\nTo place these changes in context, the ''Power Comics'' were not the only casualties of the turmoil at IPC in 1969. Hulton's long-running adventure comic ''Eagle'' was also cancelled, merging with Fleetway's ''Lion'' from 2 May 1969. The merged comic was known briefly as ''Lion and Eagle'', but quickly reverted simply to ''Lion''. The humour comic, ''Giggle'', aimed at the slightly younger market dominated by Fleetway's ''Buster'', was also dropped, being merged into ''Buster'' in the spring of 1969 to form ''Buster and Giggle''. As ever, the name change lasted only long enough to absorb the discontinued comic's readership: the reference to ''Giggle'' failed to see out the year, and by December the title had reverted to simply ''Buster'' once more.<ref>''Buster'' [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/ cover gallery] at Wordpress.com</ref> And ''Buster'', like ''Smash'', also now became a publication of the Group's newest subsidiary, IPC Magazines Ltd.\n\nThe surviving titles at both Odhams and at Fleetway were now transferred to a merged operation, at New Year 1969, as merely a part of IPC's newest division, IPC Magazines Ltd, and were placed under the responsibility of Jack Legrand, formerly the Managing Editor of Fleetway's juvenile publications.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.17</ref>\n\nA notable feature of the Odhams years was how few advertisements the comic carried. There were occasional quarter-page inserts, mainly advertising foreign Postage Stamps for stamp collectors, or Subbuteo table-football; but they were few and far between, and their combined total didn't usually exceed one page per issue. Reflecting its financial problems, the relaunched comic under IPC Magazines carried a significantly greater amount of advertising. One obvious change was the back cover (the only in-colour page apart from the front cover), which gradually began to carry colourful full-page advertisements. On the inside pages, too, there was a much more noticeable quantity of adverts: each issue typically carried 4 full-page ads, plus two half-page ads. It was a noticeable feature of the relaunch that the comic now expanded to 40 pages, in order to cope with the need to carry an extra 4 pages of advertising in each issue.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ British Comics] website</ref>\n\nThis was a potentially significant new strategy, and a major change of policy. No longer did the profitability of the comic rest exclusively with the income derived from its sales figures. That sales income was now supplemented by advertising revenue, and without even having to sacrifice any significant amount of page space, nor cancel any strips, thanks to adding the additional pages.\n\n===Turmoil in 1967===\nThe events of 1968 were not even the first threat to the survival of the ''Power Comics''. Odhams had faced their first serious crisis in May 1967.\nThe editorial page warned readers in issue 68 that ''Smash'', initially printed by St Clements Press Ltd of London, had to find new printers within one month, or face closure. In the event, Odhams were able to sign a contract with Southernprint Ltd of Poole in Dorset in time to maintain publication.\n\n==''SMASH'' after Odhams==\n\nIn January 1969 Odhams ceased to exist as a publishing imprint, and ''Smash'' now became an IPC Magazines publication. Most of the consequences of the change didn't become apparent until the issue cover-dated 15 March, in which the comic changed dramatically. IPC had waited three months to relaunch ''Smash'', because, on the one hand, it needed some lead-time in which to ready new strips, and, on the other, in the publishing industry Spring was traditionally considered a good time to launch a new (in this case, a virtually new) comic.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/>\n\nWith the re-launch, ''Smash'' became the last ever British comic to feature a variety mix of adventure, humour and sports themed stories. Subsequent boys' comics featured exclusively sports, or war, or humour; such as ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher and Score]]'' and ''[[Shoot (football magazine)|Shoot]]'' (which featured only soccer), and ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'' and ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' (which featured only war stories).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075250/http://26pigs.com/smash/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Smash|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  A hallmark of this policy was to be the even-handedness with which the editorial staff drew the multitude of reprint strips featured in the new ''Smash'' from both ''Lion'' and ''Buster'', in seeking to appeal to readers of both (i.e. mixing serious and humorous strips without discrimination).\n\nThe symbol of the change was the new cover feature, ''Warriors of the World''. This now replaced ''The Swots and Blots'', who, drawn by Mike Lacey, had occupied the cover during the final part of the Odhams years. Happily, ''The Swots and the Blots'' survived (and prospered) on the inside pages, now drawn by Leo Baxendale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: Christmas comics: Valiant 1971|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=17 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the first relaunch issue (No.163) bearing a cover feature entitled ''Warriors of the World No.1'', the former numbering was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/25870/ Smash! - Title Notes] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> To have maintained the original sequential numbering alongside the ''Warriors of the World'' series could only have caused confusion.\n\nThe revamped ''Smash'', now comprising 40 pages, featured all-British strips \u2014 adventure serials, humour strips, and sporting strips \u2014 many of which were reprints from ''Lion'', such as ''Eric the Viking'' (originally ''Karl the Viking''), ''The Battle of Britain'' (originally ''Britain in Chains''), and ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''; and others which were reprints from ''Buster'', such as ''Wacker'' (originally ''Elmer''), ''Monty Muddle - The Man from Mars'' (originally ''Milkiway - The Man from Mars''), and ''Consternation Street''; but strictly no American superheroes.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The number of reprint strips was another significant indicator of its troubled financial situation, reprints being significantly cheaper than commissioning new strips.\n\nOf the former Odhams strips, only a handful survived. Humour strips which continued were ''The Swots and the Blots'', ''Wiz War'' and ''Bad Penny''. Additionally, ''Percy's Pets'' made occasional appearances (but did not appear every week). Much mourned were the loss of ''The Cloak'' and ''The Man from BUNGLE'', dropped due to the waning popularity of spy spoofs (in 1968 the TV series ''The Man from UNCLE'' had been cancelled); and especially mourned was the loss of Ken Reid and ''The Nervs''.\n\nThe serious offerings fared even worse. For although the survivors appeared to include ''Sergeant Rock - Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'', in reality neither of these were genuinely from the Odhams era. Both had begun only a few weeks earlier, in issues 156 and 158 respectively. They were really a part of the relaunch, but were introduced slightly ahead of time to disguise that fact. The only genuine survivor from the adventure strips of the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', and even that had only begun with issue&nbsp;144, in November&nbsp;1968.\n\nAfter a few months, superheroes appeared to be making a comeback. The Editorial column admitted receiving complaints from readers about the loss of the Marvel strips; and, in the autumn of 1969, six months after the ''Fantastic Four'' and ''Thor'' had been dropped, an all-British superhero called Tri-Man appeared, debuting in the issue of 13 September, and the character also featured in the ''Smash'' Annual that Christmas. Some indication of the effort put into this character is the fact that he was given sole possession of the front cover of the Annual! The adventures of Johnny Meek featured a hero who had triple-superpowers, hence the name Tri-Man. He leaped about rooftops (shades of Spider-Man, from the long-vanished ''Pow''), and got his powers from a ray device once every 24 hours (shades of DC's ''Green Lantern''). But the strip did not prove popular, and quietly vanished in the reshuffles of 1970.\n\nIn the light of how few strips of any sort survived from the Odhams era, and given that none of the superhero strips survived at all (which, according to the Letters pages,<ref>It was a feature of the Odhams years that the comic included a page for readers' letters, like the American comics published by Marvel and DC on which it was based, but the Letters Page was dropped in March 1969 in favour of extra advertising space.</ref> were the most popular feature of the ''Power Comics''), it would be stretching the truth to say that ''Smash'' inherited the best of the Odhams strips. Stylistically, ''The Swots and the Blots'' was the most creative and sophisticated Odhams strip (save only ''The Nervs''), and it did survive. But it was only one strip. And ''The Nervs'', which was objectively a more sophisticated strip in 1968, did not.\n\nMoreover, the publisher was taking a significant risk by re-launching the former ''Power Comic'' as, in effect, a clone of IPC's most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The publisher hoped it could repeat the success of ''Valiant'' and ''Lion'' by copying their successful formula. Nevertheless, without its discontinued superheroes ''Smash'' had nothing unique about it that might attract new readers, compared to its stablemates \u2014 featuring as it did a mix of strips reprinted from (or based on the style of) ''Lion'' and ''Buster''.\n\n===IPC Humour Strips===\n\nAs under Odhams, humour continued to play a large part in the relaunched comic (in terms of the page count): not to the extent it did in ''Buster'', but at least as much as in ''Valiant'' or ''Lion''.\n\nWith the relaunch, ''The Swots and the Blots'' (one of the handful of surviving Odhams strips) moved from the prestigious front cover to the centre pages. Nevertheless, now drawn by Leo Baxendale it became a standard bearer for sophisticated artwork. Baxendale began a five-year run on the strip (beginning in ''Smash'' and continuing in its successor, ''Valiant and Smash'', with some fill-ins by Les Barton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=2818|title=Smash! comic the swots and the blots- Leo Baxendale - Comics UK|website=comicsuk.co.uk}}</ref>), by adopting a new style, one which influenced many others in the comics field, just as his earlier ''Beano'' work had done; and in the process attaining a new, deliriously daft, high standard, one rarely approached by other strips.\n\nNew humour strips featured in the relaunch (new to ''Smash'' at any rate) included a half-page cartoon strip drawn by Nadal, entitled ''Big 'Ead'', detailing the humorous misadventures of a Mr&nbsp;Knowall character, summed up by the strip's catchphrase, continually bellowed at the lead character by his irate victims: \"''Have a care there, Big&nbsp;'Ead!''\" Reprinted from ''Buster'', where it had initially run \u2014 under the same title \u2014 from 28 May 1960 to 18 February 1961.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p43</ref>\n\n''Wacker'' was a single page cartoon strip, subtitled ''He's All at Sea''. Drawn at different times by Rafart and by Roy Wilson, it concerned the crazy antics in the Royal Navy of Mis-leading Seaman Wacker, who was forever driving the Captain of HMS Impossible toward a nervous breakdown. Despite the Liverpudlian overtones of his surname, Wacker seemed not to be a Scouser \u2013 which may have been because it was ''not'' his real name! The strip, although new to ''Smash'', had run in ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'' from 29 October 1960 to 17 October 1964 under its real title, ''Elmer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/|title=Buster 60s|date=29 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/>\n\nAnother humour strip new to ''Smash'' was the World War Two spoof, ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men From W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' Set in 1940, this featured an English scientist named Professor Nutt, who was a boffin inventing eccentric secret weapons for a department of the War Office known as W.H.E.E.Z.E. (short for Weapon Handling Early Experimental and Zoning Establishment), who was kept out of trouble by his Army \"minder\", Sgt&nbsp;'Lightning' Bolt. Nutt and Bolt were perpetually clashing with a cunning Nazi scientist named Doktor Skull. This was another reprint strip, perhaps from ''Lion''. As its title implies, it was born out of the earlier popularity of the ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' television series. However, the strip had only a short run in ''Smash'', being replaced after just 22&nbsp;issues.\n\nYet it was not only in the plainly cartoon-style strips that humour flourished in the new ''Smash''. Many of the ostensibly more serious offerings were, in reality, humour strips: in particular, ''His Sporting Lordship'' and ''The World Wide Wanderers''; but there was also a strong humorous undercurrent in the new lead serial, ''Master of the Marsh''.\n\n===IPC Sporting Strips===\n\nSporting strips were now the order of the day. Reflecting this, the new lead, on page 3, was ''Master of the Marsh'', drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]],<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\">Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Solano Lopez]</ref> a sports serial about Patchman, a strange hermit who lived in the East Anglian fens. He was appointed as the new sports master at Marshside Secondary School, nicknamed 'The Marsh', because he was the only person who could control the kids \u2014 a group of hooligans known as 'the Monsters of the Marsh'. There was an association of ideas between fens and marsh, reinforced by the fact that Patchman camped in the inaccessible heart of the marshes. He was a burly woodsman who had always lived in the Fens, and could communicate after a fashion with the local wildlife, for whom he acted as protector.\n\nThe strip initially featured humorous stories about the attempts of Knocker Reeves \u2013 the worst of the 'monsters' \u2013 to get the better of the new teacher. But eventually it transpired that Patchman was secretly the guardian of a collection of relics left behind by [[Hereward the Wake]], a warlord who had fought the Norman invaders in the Fens during the 11th Century. In this respect, the strip had an occasional tendency to embrace science fiction overtones.\n\nOf the sports-based stories, the only survivor from the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', which continued to prosper. Possibly feeling the strip was suffering in the credibility stakes, the new editorial team made a decision to change the name of King's manager, who bore the remarkable name (actually a nickname) of Blarney Stone! They threw Blarney out of the series and substituted a new manager with a less silly name. ''Ballyhoo Barnes'' wasn't all that much less silly, but it's the thought that counts! Even so, Blarney reappeared after a few weeks, by popular demand.\n\nThe most successful of the new sports-based strips (certainly the most long-running) was ''His Sporting Lordship'', drawn by Douglas Maxted.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html Douglas Maxted]</ref> This humorous hit proved so popular that it ultimately became one of the few to outlast ''Smash'' itself. Henry Nobbins had been a labourer on a building site until he inherited the title of Earl of Ranworth and five million pounds. Before he could touch the money, however, he had to become champion at a number of sports. He also had to evade the nefarious attentions of Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, who was a rival claimant to the fortune, and Parkinson's villainous henchman, Fred Bloggs.\n\nLord Henry, as he had now become, was more than ably assisted by his Butler, Jarvis, who he had inherited from the previous Earl. And Jarvis proved indispensable. Henry was never portrayed as anything other than an able athlete and a good natured bloke, leaving Jarvis to supply the cunning which was (frequently) needed to defeat the dastardly Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, and prevent Henry's ancestral home, Castle Plonkton, from being turned into a glue factory.\n\nThe relaunch included a short-lived football strip with humorous overtones, entitled ''The World-Wide Wanderers'', about a League football team composed of eleven players from eleven different countries \u2014 not such a funny joke today! Football manager Harry Kraft found himself a passenger on a ship passing through the Suez Canal; ships from all over the world called there, and the crews conducted impromptu soccer matches to while away the time in port. Some of the crews had been stranded there, and constant soccer practice (since there was nothing else to do) had caused them to develop fantastic footballing skills. Kraft shipped eleven of them, from as many different countries, back to England; and they used their highly unorthodox individual skills to play as a team in the old Fourth Division.\n\n===IPC Adventure Strips===\n\nThe other staple of the new ''Smash'' was adventure serials, and far and away the most successful of these was ''The Incredible Adventures of [[Janus Stark]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Janus%2BStark|title=British Comic Art}}</ref> written by Tom Tully,<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183041 Janus Stark] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> featuring an escapologist in Victorian London who appeared to be simply an unusual act on the music-hall stage, but who privately used his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. Stark had an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations, thanks to training received in childhood from his mentor, Blind Largo. Drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]], there was more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the departed ''Fantastic Four'' strip, in Stark's uncanny abilities.<ref>Stark's flexible bone structure, which was the basis of his career as an escapologist in the theatres, was perhaps more akin to ''Rubberman'', a character who had featured in ''Smash'' in 1966</ref> Lopez's dark, moody artwork also gave the strip a perfect 19th Century setting.<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\"/> The strip was one of the few to survive the merger of ''Smash'' into ''Valiant'' in 1971, and is still well remembered today. As a mark of its popularity, from week 30 it replaced ''Master of the Marsh'' as the lead serial on page 3 (swapping places with the latter, which was thus relegated to an inconspicuous location on pages 12 and 13).\n\nThis brings up the matter of economics once more. Solano Lopez was a foreign illustrator, born in the Argentine, who worked at a studio in Spain. For reasons of cost, IPC had taken a policy decision to source artwork from cheaper sources outside the UK.<ref name=\"blogs.birminghammail.net\"/> Along with the presence in the new ''Smash'' of reprint strips, which were much cheaper than commissioning new strips, this is yet another indicator of the financial pressure the comic was still under, and the absolute necessity of cutting production costs to the bone in order to make it financially viable.\n\nAnother long-running adventure strip was ''The Battle of Britain'', in which secret agent Simon Kane fought against Baron Rudolph, a usurper who had seized control of Britain using a secret weapon. The weapon emitted a sound wave which paralysed anyone who wasn't protected against it. Rudolph set up a police state, similar in emblems and uniforms to medieval England at the time of King John, and Kane led the resistance against him.\n\nIn spite of the title, the strip had no connection with the Second World War! Drawn for the initial 40 issues by Geoff Campion, and thereafter by [[John Stokes (comics)|John Stokes]],<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p109</ref> it was in fact a reprint; hence it, too, was an indication of the comic's troubled financial status (reprints being cheaper than new strips). It originally ran in ''[[Lion (comics)|Lion]]'' from 29 February 1964 to 28 May 1966 under various titles including ''Britain in Chains'' and ''The Battle for Britain'', where the hero was called Vic Gunn. The editorial staff of ''Smash'' took a decision to change the names of the leading characters from Gunn and Barrel (i.e. ''gun barrel''), to slightly less absurd ones; and so were born secret agent Simon Kane and his assistant Tubby. This had been a very long-running strip in ''Lion'', so much so that ''Smash'' actually ceased publication \u2014 in April 1971 \u2014 before it had reprinted the entire run from ''Lion'', and in the final issue created an (unconvincing) new ending for the serial.\n\n''Rebbels on the Run'' was another adventure serial, featuring three young brothers whose surname was Rebbel, who run away from an orphanage to avoid being split up. After a few months on the run, the strip took an amazing turn and \u2014 renamed ''The Rebbel Robot'' \u2014 became a science fiction serial, when the boys discovered that their late father's mind was preserved within the brain of a robot, which became their unofficial guardian. With it they embarked on a quest to track down a criminal known as The Genie, who had murdered their real father \u2014 who, in a further improbable turn of events, turned out to be a secret agent!\n\n''Eric the Viking'', a continuing serial featuring its eponymous Viking hero, and set in the Dark Ages, was another reprint from ''Lion'', where it had run under the title ''Karl the Viking'', as a set of 13 stories, from 29 October 1960 until 29 September 1964, written by Ken Bulmer.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\">Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p108</ref> The change of name to Eric probably reflects on the continuing fame (during the 1960s) of a real-life Viking leader in Dark Age Britain, Eric Bloodaxe, who history records was King in Viking York in the 10th Century. The strip is well remembered under its original title, as it was drawn by a famous comics artist, Don Lawrence.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Don Lawrence]</ref><ref>[http://www.donlawrence.co.uk/shop/index.php?hg=2&sg=35 Deluxe hardback collection of ''Karl the Viking'' strips] by Don Lawrence</ref> Eric (and Karl) fought a weird but impressive collection of legendary and fantasy monsters, in sword-and-sorcery epics which had some reflections in Lawrence's art for his contemporary work on the highly regarded all-colour science fiction strip ''[[The Trigan Empire]]'' then running in ''Look and Learn''. This was not even the first reprint: retitled ''Swords of the Sea Wolves'' it had initially been reprinted in ''Lion'', in part, between 1 October 1966 and 7 October 1967, with the lead character renamed Rolf the Viking.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\"/> And it would later be reprinted again, in the European version of ''Vulcan'': on that occasion translated into German and retitled 'Kobra'.\n\nTwo of the new IPC adventure strips \u2014 ''Sergeant Rock Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'' \u2014 were introduced five or six weeks early, in an attempt to conceal how few Odhams strips had actually survived, by making these appear to be existing strips although they were not. World War Two was the setting for the former, which, with occasional stories drawn by John Vernon,<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p88</ref> recounted the adventures of the 'Red Devils' of the Parachute Regiment. Initially, Sgt Rock was merely a narrator, introducing stories featuring other characters, so that it was actually tales-of-the-parachute-regiment, rather than tales of Sgt Rock himself. This was a device for reprinting old war stories from other comics: the strip had originally appeared in Fleetway's ''Hurricane'', from 4 July 1964 to 8 May 1965, entitled ''Paratrooper'', and continued in ''Tiger'' when that title absorbed ''Hurricane'' in the issue dated 15 May 1965. The reprints in ''Smash'' were reasonably successful, running for a year; and Sergeant Rock eventually featured as more than just narrator, with later editions sending him into action with the SAS, and marking the change by altering the title to ''Sergeant Rock - Special Air Service''. This change was noticeable, also, by a change of artist; seemingly \u2014 from the similarity of style \u2014 to the artist on the discontinued wartime strip, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''.\n\n''Bunsen's Burner'' was a short-lived strip, lasting just a few weeks.<ref>It was discontinued during the reshuffles of August 1969, when various changes were quietly made to the comic over the course of a month.</ref> This was an adventure yarn with humorous overtones \u2013 its humorous content being trailed in its title: a reference to an item familiar to most schoolboys from their Chemistry classes. Ben Bunsen was the owner of a vintage car, which was known as \"the Burner\" because it was so old it was steam-driven! Like an old-fashioned steam train it had a boiler which had to be stoked, as it ran on coal instead of petrol. Ben and his pal had to drive the Burner around the world, as a condition of Ben inheriting his uncle's fortune; but a rival claimant (shades of ''His Sporting Lordship''!) was secretly out to stop them.\n\nAnother adventure strip which had a sadly brief run, lasting only 47 weeks, but which is very well-remembered today, was ''Cursitor Doom''. In this spooky and atmospheric series,<ref>The strip had various artists during its one year run, but far and away the most effective of them was the talented Eric Bradbury, and it is mainly his serials from which the strip's enduring reputation derives</ref> Cursitor Doom, master investigator of the strange and mystic, who openly practiced sorcery in the strip, battled against the dark forces of evil, ably assisted by the pounding fists of his assistant, Angus McCraggan. Doom battled against genuine spirits and sorcerers, in tales including ''The Case of Kalak the Dwarf'', ''The Sorcerer's Talisman'' and ''The Dark Legion of Mardarax'', in the latter encountering a haunted (and unstoppable) Roman Legion brought back to \"life\" by the evil Mardarax. Doom's pet Raven, Scarab, who could write messages in the dust for Angus McCraggan, by scratching with his claw, was often of more help to Doom in these serials than was the perpetually baffled McCraggan.\n\nThe ''Cursitor Doom'' strip was drawn by Geoff Campion (including ''The Return of the Hunter''), and \u2013 more effectively \u2013 by [[Eric Bradbury]] (including the magnificently atmospheric ''Dark Legion of Mardarax'').\n\n===Changes in August 1969===\n\nAfter 22 weeks, in August&nbsp;1969, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' was dropped, and replaced from the 23rd&nbsp;issue by a more serious World War Two strip entitled ''Send For... Q-Squad'', which dealt with the adventures of a hand picked group of six specialists, who were assigned to unusual missions that required special expertise both in the air and on the ground. This, too, in keeping with the need to cut costs, was a reprint, originally published in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 7 March 1964 under the title ''Phantom Force 5''.<ref>[http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html ''Phantom Force Five''] in ''Buster''</ref><ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p36</ref>\n\nThis was another of those drawn, initially, by one of IPC's best British artists, [[Eric Bradbury]], at other times by the Spanish-based artist Luis Bermejo Rojo,<ref>[http://smashpages.net/2015/12/15/rip-luis-bermejo-rojo/ Career of Luis Bermejo] at SmashPages.net</ref> and in its final months mainly by Fred Holmes.<ref>Comics artist [http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html Fred Holmes] at BusterComic.com</ref> Because the strip had a regrettably short run in ''Smash'' (from 16 August 1969 to 30 January 1970 only), most of the run features art by Eric Bradbury.\n\nIt was marked out as a reprint by its unique style \u2014 which was both different from, and grimmer than, all the other strips. Whereas Sgt Rock emulated Lord Henry (and Janus Stark), by maintaining a huge and confident smile, regardless of how much trouble he was in, no one in ''Q-Squad'' ever stopped looking worried. Its reprint status was also signalled by the fact that Q-Squad was plainly ''not'' the original name of the team. Some panels showed evidence of the name having been inserted over a previous one: a change in the lettering style for the name 'Q-Squad' and any adjacent words \u2014 which used a different handwriting in a cruder style wherever the name appeared, but nowhere else.\n\nIn the same issue, a serious footballing serial entitled ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'' began, replacing the departed \u2014 and rather more humorous \u2014 ''World Wide Wanderers''. Hard-as-nails former prison sports instructor 'Toff' Morgan (so called for his habit of always wearing a top-hat) took over the management of ailing First Division side Haversham Hotspurs. Morgan began to rebuild the team by 'framing' ex-criminals who he'd known while working in various prisons, forcing them to sign on with the club in order to make use of their dishonest skills as footballing talents. These convicts became the 'handcuff hotspurs' of the title. The club's former manager, Reg Jessup, tried constantly to sabotage Morgan's efforts, in order to persuade the Directors to re-appoint him instead.\n\nSix months earlier, various humour strips had been introduced as replacements for the (far more surreal) humour of [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]], whose strip ''The Nervs'' had so disturbed IPC's management. Now another was forthcoming, and one which reflected the pervasive sporting theme of the relaunched comic. ''The Touchline Tearaways'' (replacing ''Big 'Ead'') was another new football-themed strip, featuring three mad-keen supporters of Grimshot United: a totally useless Football League team, perpetually in danger of being relegated as it was made up entirely of ailing and decrepit players. Each week the Tearaways \u2014 Hairy, Lug'oles and Clever Dick \u2014 would execute some scheme from the touchline to help Grimshot win that week's fixture, usually involving a battle of wits with officials from the Ministry of Football, who, not unnaturally, tried to put a stop to the Tearaways well-intentioned cheating.\n\nThe name of the club, Grimshot United, was a humorous indication that the team was not very good (i.e. that the players were \"grim shots\"). Each strip featured a single match, with a plot based around helping the team overcome that week's opponent. Clever Dick masterminded all the ploys used in helping Grimshot, and apart from occasional words of congratulation or encouragement he was generally the only \"Tearaway\" who had dialogue in the strip. Hairy and Lug'oles tended to be merely a pair of walking visual gags: Hairy's features were perpetually invisible behind a vast mass of long black hair that covered his entire face and head, and Lug'oles had a pair of enormous ears.\n\nThese three new strips represented a minor change of emphasis, replacing two of the more whimsical offerings with two entirely serious strips \u2014 even though the third new entry (which was only a single-page) was simply one outright cartoon strip replacing another.\n\nThus, within six months, a number of the strips introduced in the relaunch had already bitten the dust. And more changes were looming.\n\n===The 2nd Relaunch : 1970===\n\nThe most obvious problem faced by the new-look ''Smash'' was the constant \"churn\": the incessant turnover of strips. Without its solidly popular superhero strips to rely on, the editorial staff seemed pathologically incapable of settling on a fixed line-up.<ref>Continual change of line-up was not a problem unique to ''Smash'', but was shared by all IPC's comics of this period. Editors struggled to find strips sufficiently popular to halt the decline in weekly sales; but making so many changes was self-defeating, because it harmed reader loyalty.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the changes made in August&nbsp;1969, further changes made at the start of 1970 left ''Smash'' looking very different from its appearance in the wake of the relaunch just 12&nbsp;months earlier. A vast number of new strips were added, in a second re-launch, such that only half of those introduced in March&nbsp;1969 now survived, although those which continued included ''Master of the Marsh'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'', ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''Battle of Britain'', ''Eric the Viking'', ''Wacker'', ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'', ''The Swots and the Blots'', and ''Percy's Pets'' \u2014 the latter two now being the only remaining Odhams strips.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\nDiscontinued were ''King of the Ring'' (last survivor of the serious strips from the Odhams era), ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service'', and ''Cursitor Doom''. Three of the strips only recently introduced were also dropped, namely the wartime ''Q-Squad'', British superhero ''Tri-Man'', and the humour strip ''The Touchline Tearaways''.\n\nThe first changes in 1970 occurred in the issue dated 24 January, when three new strips appeared, all reprints from ''Buster'': ''The Kid Commandos'', ''Consternation Street'', and ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' (originally titled ''Milkiway \u2013 The Man from Mars''). These were introduced as part of a relaunch of the comic: by once again bringing in some of the changes a few weeks ahead of the relaunch, as had been done in the Spring of 1969, the publisher hoped to disguise the true extent of the changes.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\n''The Kid Commandos'' was a war story about three cockney children stranded in occupied France in World War Two. Drawn by Tom Kerr, the Sparrow children \u2014 Tommy, Jan and Podge \u2014 were on the run from the Germans each week, in a single page strip set in 1940. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it appeared from 9 January to 24 July 1965, under the imaginative title ''The Sparrows Go To War''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref>\n\nIn the humour strip ''Consternation Street'' drawn by Reg Parlett (the title spoofed that of the popular British television soap opera, ''Coronation Street''), which was usually a one-page strip, a collection of unlikely neighbours rubbed shoulders in a very small street. Watched over by the dim-witted Constable Clott were the Snobbs and the Ardupps, Colonel Curry & Caesar (his dog), Miss Primm and her pets, Cutprice the Grocer, and Roger the Lodger. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it had originally run \u2013 under the same title \u2013 between 9 January and 23 October 1965.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p44</ref> Parlett was also known from his other humour strips in ''Buster'' including ''Rent-A-Ghost Ltd'', ''The Happy Family'' and ''Bonehead''.<ref>[http://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=1992 Reg Parlett's contributions to ''Valiant'' and ''Buster''] (including the long running ''Billy Bunter'' strip in ''Valiant'', which continued in ''Valiant and Smash'')</ref>\n\nThe half-page humour strip ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' recounted the misadventures of spaceman Monty Muddle (a name rather less convincing than the character's original name, ''Milkiway''). It originally ran in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 10 March 1962, with art credited to Nadal/Rafart.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/> He flew about in his small bubble-domed spacecraft trying to make friends with the Earth people. However, due to his misunderstanding of Earth customs, his every attempt at contact ended in disaster; and each strip would typically end with the catchphrase ''I'll try again next week!''\n\nThe 7 February issue then saw a full re-launch: with more free gifts, another new cover feature, and no less than eight new strips (making an astonishing eleven strips added since the beginning of the year).\n\nThe ''Warriors of the World'' covers had run into a problem, in that war stories were no longer a strong element of ''Smash'', which had dropped the humour strip ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' some time earlier. When it was decided to also drop ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Paratrooper'' (by then renamed ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service''), and ''Q&nbsp;Squad'', the cover feature had to go too. It was not practical to advertise war stories on the cover if there were no war stories inside!\n\nThe newly added ''Kid Commandos'' did not count as a war story in this context, since the three fugitive children did not do any conventional fighting. The strip was more like a souped-up version of the discontinued ''Rebbels on the Run''.\n\nAccordingly, after forty seven weeks<ref>46 issues featuring the ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature, and one Christmas issue</ref> the ''Warriors of the World'' series was ended. Instead, the issue dated 7 February 1970 began ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'', written by Angus Allan and drawn by the ever-popular Eric Bradbury.<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183036 ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'']</ref> Henceforth each week's cover featured a full-page splash advertising the task which adventurer Simon Test would undertake in a new strip on the inside pages. This strip proved so successful that when the original thirteen-week series was completed (featuring one task each week), Simon Test was given a new series of adventures, extending his hold on the cover indefinitely. He would prove particularly enduring, being one of the few strips to ultimately survive the merger with ''Valiant'' in 1971.\n\n''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'' saw him undertake a quest for immortality by attempting the thirteen tasks of the Pharaoh Thot, believing this to be the only way to save his life, having been deceived into believing he has only a few months to live. The sinister Jabez Coppenger secretly desired Test's death as a means of restoring his own youth. This serial introduced the mute servant Karka, who would ultimately become Test's friend and assistant.\n\nTest then went on to the more lengthy series of adventures entitled ''Simon Test and the Curse of the Conqueror'', where he battled the twenty servants of the evil Ezekiel Spar, the self-styled Conqueror. This pitted him against twenty athletes and champions, each of whom was under the hypnotic control of Spar, who implanted in them an in-built impulse to kill Simon Test.\n\nNew supporting strips introduced in the 7 February issue included ''Threat of the Toymaker'', ''The Pillater Peril'', ''Birdman of Baratoga'', ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'', and three humour strips with a common supernatural element: ''Sam's Spook'' (drawn by Leo Baxendale), ''The Haunts of Headless Harry'', and ''Ghost Ship''.\n\nIn ''Threat of the Toymaker'', drawn by Solano Lopez, a criminal scientist named Doctor Droll escaped from Garstone Prison with the aid of an army of remote controlled mechanical toys he had constructed, along the way taking the Prison Governor's children, Pam and Peter Keen, as hostages. Hampered by the children at every turn, Droll finds himself on the run, pursued by the Police wherever he goes. The idea of using radio controlled toys in the strip was scarcely original, since it was a straight lift from the ''House of Dolmann'', which was then running in ''Valiant'', as well as from the ''General Jumbo'' strip in ''The Beano''. The strip was scarcely original either: having been first published in ''Buster'', under the title ''The Toys of Doom'', between 27 February 1965 and 13 January 1968 (and in which it would be reprinted\u2014in part\u2014between 3 May and 6 September 1986, under the title ''The Terror Toys''), it was also reprinted in ''Eagle'', under its original title ''The Toys of Doom''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\"/>\n\n''The Pillater Peril'' saw David Pillater return to Pillater House, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast, which he is to inherit on his 21st&nbsp;birthday. Along with his four cousins and his Uncle Bernard, David is imperilled by Francis Pillater, an ancestor who has seemingly returned from the dead. Francis had an evil reputation for his misdeeds in the 16th century, but was thought to have perished in a shipwreck during a storm at sea. Blaming the family for his troubles, he sets out for revenge by kidnapping them one by one. The strip had only a short run, but when discontinued it did, unusually, seemingly come to a natural conclusion (rather than merely wrapping-up many continuing plot threads unconvincingly in the final panel).\n\n''Birdman from Baratoga'' was an adventure strip about a boy who grew up on a Pacific island with only the company of birds, and learned from them the secret of flight. By the use of a feather cape, he was able to glide through the air like an albatros. When an English sailor is castaway on the island, called Baratoga, they escape together on a raft and set out on a series of adventures in the Pacific, beginning by hunting down the desperado who has stolen the man's pearl-fishing yacht, ''Enterprise''. ''Birdman from Baratoga'' was perhaps loosely based on a humour strip which had run in ''Buster'' during 1968: ''Captain Swoop \u2013 He's Half Man, Half Bird, Half Wit''.\n\nIn a very atypical move, prompted by IPC's on-going financial problems (in the year in which they were taken over by the Reed Group), the editorial team now resurrected one of the old strips which had run in ''Wham'' under Odhams, drawn by Gordon Hogg. ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'' featured two young lads from Liverpool who fancied themselves as musicians, spoke in Liverpudlian slang (even the original title of the strip was derived from a slang Scouse term for a native of Liverpool: 'wacker'), sported Beatles-style haircuts, and always carried guitars. This was a reprint of ''The&nbsp;Wacks'', which had run in ''Wham'' during 1964, reprinted here with only the title and the names changed. Spoofing the pop group ''The Beatles'', it was an odd choice to run it a year ''after'' that group's demise. It was, though, a popular item: this 1964 strip had already been reprinted, under the title ''Birk 'n' 'Ed, the Mersey Dead-Beats'', from 30 January 1965 in Fleetway's ''Hurricane''.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p.89</ref><ref>Spoken quickly for comic effect, the names of the two characters were intended to sound like that of a district in Liverpool called Birkenhead</ref>\n\nA common supernatural theme linked the three new humour strips. In ''Sam's Spook'', drawn by the ubiquitous Leo Baxendale, Sam was a schoolboy with a ghostly pal called Spooky, who used his powers to humorous effect on Sam's behalf. The strip mostly consisted of Sam's school friends catching Spooky doing a bit of ghostly cheating in order to help Sam win at sports or football, and Sam doing a lot of running away to avoid a bashing.\n\n''The Haunts of Headless Harry'' featured the amiable ghost of a 16th-century soldier who had been beheaded. Harry's head and body led separate but related ghostly existences, with the body carrying the head around everywhere, and both of them were able to talk. Harry's humorous adventures invariably involved misplacing his head; such as going to the cinema and, on leaving, calling at the cloakroom to collect it (as though it was a hat), and being asked by the attendant to identify it among all the other ghostly heads left there during the film.\n\nThe other new humour strip was ''Ghost Ship'', in which the spirit of an ancient galleon, and the ghosts of its pirate crew, sailed the Seven Seas making mischief, but usually coming off worst.\n\nFurther changes followed: such that fully thirteen strips had been introduced since the start of 1970. In the issue dated 27 June 1970, a new humour strip began entitled ''Moonie's Magic Mate'', about a schoolboy, Barry Moon, who finds a Genie in a dusty old bottle. In the issue dated 29 August, a humour strip titled ''The Fighting Three'' began, featuring the misadventures of three men: globe-trotters McGinty, Hambone and Weasel are travelling the world, trying to raise enough money to start their own construction company, but get into fights \u2013 and jail! \u2013 wherever they go. Drawn by Carlos Cruz, this was another reprint from ''Buster'', where, under its original title ''Mighty McGinty'', the strip had run in 1964.<ref>Published 29 February to 17 October 1964: ''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref> And finally, in the last addition before the comic's closure, a strip entitled ''Tyler the Tamer'' was launched in early 1971, about the adventures of the greatest film stuntman in the world. Dropped to make room for these were ''Kid Commandos'', ''Threat of the Toymaker'' and ''The Pillater Peril'' (the ''Pillater'' saga seemingly reaching a natural conclusion, instead of merely being summarily abandoned).\n\n==Merger with ''Valiant''==\n\nIn mid-November 1970, production on ''Smash'' (and many other IPC titles, including ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'') came to a halt due to a printers' strike, and no editions were published for the next three months.<ref name=SP2010 /> By the time the strike was settled, in February of the following year, irreparable damage had been done to the comic's circulation, as its young readers had turned elsewhere in the intervening 11&nbsp;weeks. Similar harm had been suffered by ''Valiant''. In consequence of this latest financial disaster, after eight issues, in April&nbsp;1971 the two titles were merged in an attempt to combine their surviving circulation. For a brief time the merged comic was entitled ''Valiant and Smash'' (10 April to 18 September 1971<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/11/27/valiant-70s/|title=Valiant 70s|date=27 November 2018}}</ref>), before reverting to simply ''Valiant''.\n\nSome strips from ''Smash'' survived in the new comic, including ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'' and ''The Swots and the Blots'', but most were lost,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180805023305/http://26pigs.com/valiant/index.html Merger with ''Valiant''] - ''Valiant and Smash''</ref> although the ''Smash'' Annual continued to appear for many years afterwards (continuing, in fact, until the 1976 Annual, published in the autumn of 1975). A lot of the strips thereby continued to appear each year, including many which had not even survived into ''Valiant'', long after ''Smash'' had ceased publication as a comic.<ref name=\"British Comics website\">{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/|title=Smash!|date=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe sports themed ''His Sporting Lordship'' had enjoyed perhaps the greatest popularity, surviving the shake-ups of 1969 and 1970, and then surviving even the merger with ''Valiant'', though it was to last only a few months in its new home, finally ending in December&nbsp;1971. However, it was revived in the 1972 ''Smash'' Annual, published at Christmas&nbsp;1971, and returned year after year: becoming the regular cover feature of the Annuals.<ref name=\"British Comics website\"/>\n\nThe merged title was dominated by ''Valiant'', which contributed nine strips consisting of twenty pages; whereas ''Smash!'' was represented by only four strips, totalling a meager nine pages: ''Janus Stark'', ''The Swots & The Blots'', ''Simon Test'', and ''His Sporting Lordship''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kidr77.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-valiant-attempt-at-smashing.html|title=CRIVENS!

Maybe it was only marginally profitable, but no title could have survived such a lengthy loss of production. Its demise was directly attributable to the strike.<ref name=SP2010>{{Cite web|url=https://stephenpoppitt.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/comics-010/|title=Smash! : The IPC Years \u2013 Part 5: Cancellation|date=16 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n''Smash'' was the last attempt in the UK market to publish a general boys comic, mixing adventure, sports and humour strips. Subsequent comics would survive only by ruthlessly focusing on narrow, sectional interests: such as all-sports, all-war, or all-humour;<ref>The most successful of these was ''Doctor Who Weekly'', which still exists today, although it had to become a monthly title in order to survive (and adopt a magazine format)</ref> just as the American market had already specialised into all-funnies, all-horror, and all-superhero titles.

However, the '''[[recorded history]] of [[Seychelles]]''' dates back to the fourth of the [[Portuguese India Armadas]] led by [[Vasco da Gama]]. On 15 March 1503, the [[scrivener]] [[Thom\u00e9 Lopes]] noted the sighting of an elevated island, doubtless one the granitic islands and almost certainly [[Silhouette Island]]. The first recorded landing was by the men of the English [[East India Company]] ship ''Ascension'', which arrived in Seychelles in January 1609. The islands were claimed by France in 1756. Seychelles remained uninhabited until the first settlers arrived on board the ship Th\u00e9lemaque, which arrived on 27 August 1770. Captain Leblanc Lecore landed the first colonists, comprising 15 white men, eight Africans and five Indians. The [[Seychellois Creole]] language developed as a means of communication between the different races. The British frigate Orpheus commanded by Captain Henry Newcome arrived at Mah\u00e9 on 16 May 1794. Terms of capitulation were drawn up and the next day Seychelles was surrendered to Britain. Following the fall of Mauritius to British forces, Captain Phillip Beaver of the Nisus arrived at Mah\u00e9 on 23 April 1811 and took possession of Seychelles as a permanent colony of Britain. The Seychelles became an independent republic in 1976. Following a coup d'\u00e9tat, a socialist [[one-party state]] ruled the country from 1977 to 1993. The subsequent democratic Presidential elections were won by candidates of the same party.\n\n==Pre-colonial history==\n\nThe early (pre-European colonisation) history of Isle de S\u00e9chelles or Seychelles is unknown. [[Malay race|Malays]] from [[Borneo]], who eventually settled on [[Madagascar]], perhaps lingered here circa 200-300 AD. [[Arab]] navigators, on trading voyages across the [[Indian Ocean]], were probably aware of the islands, although they did not settle them.\n\nArabs were trading the highly valued [[coco de mer]] nuts, found only in Seychelles, long before European discovery of the islands. The rotted-out nuts can float and were found washed ashore in the [[Maldives]] and [[Indonesia]].\n\n\n==Age of Discoveries==\nOn 15 March 1503, [[Vasco da Gama]], crossing from India to East Africa, sighted what was almost certainly [[Silhouette Island]] and the next day, [[Desroches Island]]. The granitic islands began to appear on Portuguese charts as the Seven Sisters.\n\nIn March 1608, a trading fleet of the [[English East India Company]] set sail for India. Lost in a storm, the ''Ascension's'' crew saw \"high land\" on 19 January 1609 and headed for it. They anchored \"as in a pond\". They found an uninhabited island with plentiful fresh water, [[fish]], [[coconut]]s, birds, turtles and giant tortoises with which to replenish their stores. The ''Ascension'' sailed, and reported what they had found, but the British took no action.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century, [[piracy|pirates]] arrived in the Indian Ocean from the Caribbean and made a base in [[Madagascar]], from where they preyed upon vessels approaching and leaving the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\nThe French had occupied the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]) since 1715. This colony was growing in importance, and in 1735 an energetic administrator, [[Bertrand-Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais]] (1699\u20131753) was appointed. His brief was to protect the French sea route to India. La Bourdonnais, himself a sailor, turned his attention to making a speedier passage from Mauritius to India. To this end, in 1742, he sent an expedition under the command of [[Lazare Picault]] to accurately chart the islands northeast of Madagascar.\n\nOn 21 November 1742, the ''Elisabeth'' and the ''Charles'' anchored off [[Mah\u00e9, Seychelles|Mah\u00e9]] at Anse Boileau (not Baie Lazare, later mistakenly named as Picault's landing place). They found a land of plenty. In fact, Picault named the island Ile d'Abondance. Picault's mapping was poor, so in 1744 he was sent back and renamed the main island Mah\u00e9 (in honor of his patron Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais), and the group the Iles de la Bourdonnais. He had high hopes for the Iles de la Bourdonnais. However, the islands were once more forgotten when La Bourdonnais was replaced in 1746.\n\n==French settlement and rule==\nThe outbreak in 1754 of what would become the [[Seven Years' War]] between England and France reminded the authorities on Mauritius about the islands. Two ships were sent to claim them, commanded by [[Corneille Nicholas Morphey]]. He renamed the largest island Isle de S\u00e9chelles in honour of [[Viscount]] [[Jean Moreau de S\u00e9chelles]], Minister of Finance during the reign of [[Louis XV]] (later Anglicised as Seychelles). This name was later used for the island group, whilst Mah\u00e9 was again used for the largest granitic island. Morphey took possession for the French king and the [[French East India Company]] on 1 November 1756.<ref>{{Cite web\n |last        = Fauvel\n |first       = Albert-Auguste\n |title       = Unpublished Documents on the History of the Seychelles Islands Anterior to 1810\n |work        = Government Printing Office, Mah\u00e9, Seychelles, via the World Digital Library\n |accessdate  = 2014-06-19\n |url         = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2396/#regions=africa&page=4\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140707084223/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2396/#regions=africa&page=4\n |archivedate = 2014-07-07\n}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the Seven Years' War, with France's loss of Canada and its status in India, caused the decline of the French East India Company, which had formerly controlled Mauritius. This settlement, and thus Seychelles, now came under direct royal authority. The new intendant of Mauritius, [[Pierre Poivre]] (1719\u20131786), was determined to break the Dutch monopoly of the lucrative spice trade; he thought Mah\u00e9 would be perfect for spice cultivation.\n\nIn 1768, Nicolas Dufresne arranged a commercial venture, sending ships to collect timber and tortoises from the Seychelles. During this expedition, French sovereignty was extended to cover all the islands of the granitic group on [[Christmas Day]].\n\nIn 1769, the navigators Rochon and Grenier proved that a faster route to India could safely be taken via the Seychelles, and thus the importance of the islands' strategic position was realised. Meanwhile, Poivre had finally obtained seedlings of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]], and 10,000 nutmeg seeds. His attempts to propagate them on Mauritius and Bourbon (later named [[R\u00e9union]]) met with little success, and he thought again of Seychelles. It was considered fortuitous when [[Brayer du Barr\u00e9]] (unknown-1777) arrived on Mauritius with royal permission to run a settlement on [[Ste. Anne Island|St Anne]] at his own expense.\n\nOn 12 August 1770, 15 white colonists, seven slaves, five Indians and one black woman settled on St Anne. Du Barr\u00e9 stayed in Mauritius seeking funds. After reports of initial success, he begged the government for more money. However, reports reached the authorities that ship captains could get no supplies of fresh produce from the islands. Du Barr\u00e9's appeals for help to Mauritius and Versailles fell on deaf ears. In desperation, he went to the Seychelles to try and rescue the situation, but to no avail. A ruined man, he left for India and died there shortly afterwards.\n\nFrench colonists then brought large amounts of creole slaves from Mauritius  to the Seychelles - they became the ancestors of the present population.\n\nIn 1771, Poivre sent Antoine Gillot to Seychelles to establish a [[spice]] garden. By August 1772, Du Barr\u00e9's people had abandoned St Anne and moved to Mah\u00e9 or returned home. Gillot worked on at [[Anse Royale]], establishing nutmeg, cloves, [[cinnamon]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] plants.\n\nWhen British ships were seen around Seychelles, the authorities were spurred into action, despatching a garrison under Lieutenant de Romainville. They built Etablissement du Roi (Royal Settlement) on the site of modern [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]]. Gillot was nominally in charge of the civilian colonists but had no real authority over them. Mauritius sent as replacement a man of stronger mettle, [[Jean Baptiste Philogene de Malavois]], who assumed command of the settlement in 1788. He drew up 30 decrees which protected the timber and tortoises. In future, only sound farming techniques and careful husbanding of resources would be tolerated.\n\nThe British frigate Orpheus commanded by Captain Henry Newcome arrived at Mah\u00e9 on 16 May 1794, together with the Centurion, the Resistance and two prizes.  An officer was sent ashore to request provisions and water. Quinssy proposed that having no means to oppose the enemy, the colony should surrender. Terms of capitulation were drawn up and the next day Seychelles was surrendered to Britain. The Centurion returned to Seychelles four years later in September 1798 and renewed the capitulation.\n==The Quincy era==\nIn 1790, as a result of the [[French Revolution]], the settlers formed a Colonial Assembly and decided they would run their colony themselves, according to their own constitution. Land in Seychelles should only go to the children of existing colonists, who should dispose of the colony's produce as they chose, not as Mauritius dictated. They deemed the abolition of [[slavery]] impossible because they believed that without free labour, the colony could not survive.\n\n[[File:The British conquer the Seychelles - 1794, 1 Rupee.jpg|right|thumb|1969 stamp commemorating the British occupation of 1794 ]]\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Queau de Quincy]] (1748\u20131827) took command of the colony in 1794. A wily man, he used skill and expediency to steer Seychelles through the years of war ahead. Seychelles acted as a haven for French [[French corsairs|corsairs]] (pirates carrying lettres de marque entitling them to prey legally on enemy shipping). Quincy hoped this might go unnoticed, but in 1794 a squadron of three British ships arrived led by the frigate \"Orpheus\" commanded by [[Henry Newcome]]. Quinssy proposed that having no means to oppose the enemy, the colony should surrender. Terms of capitulation were drawn up and the next day Seychelles was surrendered to Britain. \n\nThe British made no effort to take over the Seychelles; it was considered a waste of resources. The settlers decided that unless they were sent a garrison, they could not be expected to defend the French flag. Therefore, they would remain neutral, supplying all comers. The strategy worked. The colony flourished. Quincy's favourable terms of capitulation were renewed seven times during the visits of British ships.\n\nOn 11 July 1801, the French frigate ''Chiffonne'' arrived with a cargo of French prisoners sent into exile by [[Napoleon]]. Then HMS ''Sybille'' arrived. Quincy had to try to defend the ''Chiffonne'', but after a brief battle, the ''Chiffonne'' was taken. Captain Adam of the ''Sybille'' wanted to know why Quincy had interfered, in contravention of his capitulation terms. Quincy managed to talk his way out of the difficulty, and even persuaded Adam to agree to Seychelles' vessels flying a flag bearing the words \"Seychelles Capitulation\", allowing them to pass through the British blockade of Mauritius unmolested.\n\n15 September 1801 was the date of a memorable sea battle just off the settlement. The British ship ''Victor'' was seriously disabled by damage to her rigging, but she was able to manoeuvre broadside to the French vessel ''La Fl\u00eache'' and rake her with incessant fire. ''La Fl\u00eache'' began to sink. Rather than surrender her, her captain ran her aground, torching her before abandoning ship. The opposing commanders met ashore afterwards, the Englishman warmly congratulating his French counterpart on his courage and skill during the battle.\n\nThe British tightened the blockade on the French Indian Ocean colonies. [[R\u00e9union]] surrendered, followed in December 1810 by Mauritius. In April 1811, Captain Beaver arrived in Seychelles on the ''Nisus'' to announce the preferential terms of Quincy's capitulation should stand, but Seychelles must recognise the terms of the Mauritian surrender. Beaver left behind a Royal Marine, Lieutenant Bartholomew Sullivan, to monitor the Seychelles situation.\n\n==British rule==\n{{Main|British Mauritius}}\n\nThere was little Sullivan could do alone to stop the settlers continuing to provision French frigates and slavers. Slave ownership was not then against British law, although [[slave trade|slave trading]] was illegal. Sullivan, later given the title of Civil Agent, played cat and mouse with the pro-slaver colonists. Once, acting on a tip off, Sullivan was rowed over to [[Praslin]] and was able to confiscate a cargo of newly landed slaves. It was but a small triumph amidst many frustrations, and Sullivan, complaining that the Seychellois had \"no sense of honour, shame or honesty\", resigned.\n\nThe first civilian administrator of the British regime was [[Edward Madge]]. He had a bitter feud with Quincy, who remained in the administration as [[Justice of the Peace]]. In the following years, the islands became a backwater ticking over quietly. Seychellois landowners had a pleasant life, though making ends meet given the fickle markets for their produce was not always easy. The British had allowed all customary French practices to remain in place. The administrator may have been British, reporting to London, but he governed according to French rules. The biggest grievance the colonists had with their new masters was the colony's dependence on Mauritius.\n\nThe other cloud on the planters' horizon was British anti-slavery legislation. In 1835, slavery was completely abolished. The plantations were already in decline, their soils exhausted by years of cultivation without investment in renewing [[fertility]]. Some planters took their slaves and left. The liberated slaves had no land, and most squatted on the estates they had tended in bondage, and the colony entered a period of stagnation. There were no exports and no money to pay for new infrastructure.\n\nThe situation was only improved when planters realised they could grow [[coconut]]s with less labour and more profit than the traditional crops of [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[rice]], and [[maize]]. Soon, they also had a source of virtually free labour once again. The British took their anti-slavery stance seriously, and operated patrols along the East African coast, raiding Arab [[dhow]]s transporting slaves to the Middle East. Slaves liberated south of the Equator were brought to Seychelles and apprenticed to plantation owners. They worked the land in return for rations and wages. Over a period of thirteen years from 1861, around 2,400 men, women and children were brought to Seychelles.\n\nThe town, called Victoria since 1841, began to grow. Licences granted in 1879 give some idea of the range of businesses in the town. There was a druggist, two auctioneers, five retailers, four [[liquor]] stores, a [[Notary public|notary]], an [[Lawyer|attorney]], a [[jeweller]], and a [[watchmaker]].\n\nThere was a disaster on 12 October 1862, when torrential rain and strong winds hit Mah\u00e9. An [[avalanche]] of mud and rocks fell on the town from the hills. It has been estimated that over 70 persons lost their lives.\n\n<gallery>\nAlbert Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Albert Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s\nChurch Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Church Victoria Seychelles 1900s\nClock court treasury Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Clock court treasury Victoria Seychelles 1900s \nPost office clock tower Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Post office clock tower, Victoria Seychelles 1900s \nPostcard Mahe 1903.jpg|Postcard Mahe 1903 \nQueen Victoria Memorial Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Queen Victoria Memorial Seychelles 1900s.jpg\nRoyal Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Royal Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg \nSupreme Court Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Supreme Court, Seychelles 1900s \nVictoria buildings Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Victoria buildings, Seychelles 1900s \nVictoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Victoria, Seychelles, 1900s \nVictoria Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Victoria Street, Victoria, Seychelles 1900s\nLibrary of Seychelles opening 1910.jpg|Library of Seychelles opening 1910.jpg\nFile:Victoria_Clock_Tower_Seychelles.jpg|Victoria's clock tower after 1925\n</gallery>\n\n==Crown Colony==\n[[File:Flag of Seychelles (1903\u20131961).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Seychelles]] 1903\u20131961]]\n \nSeychellois officials wanted Seychelles to organized as a separate autonomous colony within the British Empire, and the authorities in the mother colony, [[Mauritius]], supported them. Sir [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Gordon]], the Mauritian governor, sent a petition on their behalf to London. Concessions were made, but Seychelles did not become a [[Crown Colony]] in its own right until 1903 when its first Governor, Sir [[Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott]] took office. Befitting its new status, the colony acquired a botanical garden and a clock tower in the heart of Victoria. The French language and culture remained dominant, however.\n\nThe British, like the French before them, saw Seychelles as a useful place to exile troublesome political prisoners. Over the years, Seychelles became a home to prisoners from [[Zanzibar]], [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], to name but a few. The first in the line of exiles was Sultan Abdullah, a sultan in Perak including [[Lela Pandak Lam]], the ex-chief of Pasir Salak in [[Perak]] who arrived in 1875 after their implication in the murder of the British Resident of Perak, JW Birch. Like many of the exiles who followed, they settled well into Seychelles life and became genuinely fond of the islands. Sultan Abdullah's son took home with him one of the popular local French tunes by the islanders la rosal\u00e8 and incorporated it into the national anthem of his country. With new words, it later became ''[[Negaraku]]'', the [[national anthem]] of [[Malaysia]].\n\nPerhaps the most famous of the political prisoners was [[Archbishop Makarios]] from [[Cyprus]], who arrived in 1956. He likewise fell in love with his prison. \"When our ship leaves harbour\", he wrote, \"we shall take with us many good and kindly memories of the Seychelles...may God bless them all.\"\n\nWorld War I caused great hardship in the islands. Ships could not bring in essential goods, nor take away exports. Wages fell; prices soared by 150 percent. Many turned to crime and the prisons were bursting. Joining the Seychelles Labour Contingent, formed at the request of General Smuts, seemed to offer an escape. It was no easy option, however. The force, 800 strong, was sent to East Africa. After just five months, so many had died from [[dysentery]], [[malaria]] and [[beriberi]] that the corps was sent home. In all, 335 men died.\n\nBy the end of World War I, the population of Seychelles was 24,000 and they were feeling neglected by Great Britain. There was agitation from the newly formed Planters Association for greater representation in the governance of Seychelles affairs. After 1929, a more liberal flow of funds was ensured by the Colonial Development Act, but it was a time of economic depression; the price of [[copra]] was falling and so were wages. Workers petitioned the government about their poor working conditions and the burden of [[tax]] they had to bear. Governor Sir [[Arthur Grimble]] instigated some reforms, exempting lower income groups from taxation. He was keen to create model housing and distribute smallholdings for the landless. Many of his reforms were not approved until World War II had broken out, and everything was put on hold.\n\nThe Planters Association lobbied for the white landowners, but until 1937 those who worked for them had no voice. The League of Coloured Peoples was formed to demand a [[minimum wage]], a wage tribunal and free health care for all. During World War II, a seaplane depot was established on St Anne to monitor regional shipping. A garrison was stationed in the islands and a battery built at Pointe Conan to protect the harbour. Some 2,000 Seychellois men served in the Pioneer Companies in Egypt, Palestine and Italy.\n\nAt home, Seychelles had turmoil of its own. The first political party, the Taxpayers Association, was formed in 1939. A British governor described it as \"the embodiment of every reactionary force in Seychelles\", and it was entirely concerned with protecting the interests of the plantocracy. After the war, they also benefited by being granted the vote, which was limited to literate property owners; just 2,000 in a population of 36,000. At the first elections, in 1948, most of those elected to the Legislative Council were predictably members of the Planters and Taxpayers Association.\n\nIn 1958, the French bought back the [[Glorioso islands]] from the Seychelles.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Postcard of the lagoon at Cerf Island in the Seychelles, HMAS SYDNEY (II) refuelled there in January 1941 (27303623761).jpg|Lagoon at Cerf Island, 1941\nFile:Port Glaud to Conception Island, the Seychelles (27098454390).jpg|Port Glaud to Conception Island, 1941\nFile:Seychelles 25c stamp 1954.jpg|Postage stamp with portrait of Queen [[Elizabeth II]], 1954\n</gallery>\n\n==Independence==\n[[File:Flag of Seychelles (1961\u20131976).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Seychelles]] 1961-1976]]\n[[File:Seychelles Governor inspection 1972.jpg|thumb|Colonial Governor of the Seychelles inspecting police guard of honour in 1972]]\n[[File:State House Victoria Seychelles.jpg|thumb|Victoria's State House in the 1970s]]\nIt was not until 1964 that any new political movements were created. In that year, the [[Seychelles People's Progressive Front|Seychelles People's United Party]] (SPUP, later Seychelles People's Progressive Front, SPPF) was formed. Led by [[France-Albert Ren\u00e9]], they campaigned for socialism and independence from Britain. The late [[James Mancham]]'s [[Seychelles Democratic Party]] (SDP), created the same year, by contrast represented businessmen and planters and wanted closer integration with Britain.\n\nElections were held in 1966, won by the SDP.\n\nIn March 1970, colonial and political representatives of Seychelles met in London for a constitutional convention, with the Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP) of [[James Mancham]] advocating closer integration with the UK, and the Seychelles People's United Party (SPUP) of [[France-Albert Ren\u00e9]] advocating independence. Further elections in November 1970 brought a new constitution into effect, with Mancham as Chief Minister.  Further elections were held in April 1974, in which both major political parties campaigned for independence. Following this election, negotiations with the British resulted in an agreement under which the Seychelles became an independent [[republic]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] on June 29, 1976. The newly knighted Sir James Mancham became the country's first President, with Ren\u00e9 as Prime Minister. These negotiations also restored the islands of [[Aldabra]], [[Farquhar Group|Farquhar]], and [[Des Roches]], which had been transferred from Seychelles in November 1965 to form part of the new [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT), to Seychelles upon independence.\n\n<gallery>\nBoy with coconuts Seychelles.jpg|Boy with coconuts Seychelles \nCinnamon quill maker Seychelles.jpg|Cinnamon quill maker Seychelles \nCoconut oil making Seychelles.jpg|Coconut oil making Seychelles \nCoconut plantation worker Seychelles.jpg|Coconut plantation worker Seychelles\n Colourful Skirts at Seychelles Market.jpg|Colourful Skirts at Seychelles Market\n Cutting coconuts Seychelles.jpg|Cutting coconuts Seychelles\n Farmer house Seychelles.jpg|Farmer house Seychelles\nFish market Seychelles 1.jpg|Fish market Seychelles\n Fisherman and his catch Seychelles.jpg|Fisherman and his catch\nFisherman Seychelles.jpg|Fisherman Seychelles \nFishermen pirogue Seychelles.jpg|Fishermen pirogue Seychelles\nMah\u00e9 Beauvallon FishingOnThe Beach.JPG|Mah\u00e9 Beauvallon FishingOnThe Beach\n Market scene Seychelles.jpg|Market scene Seychelles\n Seychelles man with fish.jpg|Seychelles man with fish\n Seychelloise fish trap.jpg|Seychelloise fish trap\n</gallery>\n\n==One-party state==\n{{further|1981 Seychelles coup d'\u00e9tat attempt}}\n[[File:Flag of Seychelles (1977-1996).svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Seychelles]], 1977-1996 ]]\n[[File:France-Albert Ren\u00e9, June 2014.jpg|thumb|[[France-Albert Ren\u00e9]], President of the Seychelles, 1977-2004]]\nOn June 5, 1977, a coup d'\u00e9tat saw Mancham deposed while overseas, and [[France-Albert Ren\u00e9]] became President.

Involving an alliance of CDU, DP, SNP and SNP it outlined negotiations for a peaceful return of the exiles supported by a strong economic program.\n\nIn February 1992, Conrad Gresl\u00e9 (19 August 1937 - July 1993), a local accountant, landowner and advocate of multi-party democracy in Seychelles was arrested and charged with treason for allegedly planning to overthrow President Ren\u00e9's r\u00e9gime with the apparent aid of foreign mercenaries and with supposed CIA involvement.

The Gresl\u00e9 family were one of a few landowners of largely French descent to remain after the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1977 - most had their land confiscated and were exiled. Any individual who publicly resisted the Ren\u00e9 r\u00e9gime was vulnerable to threats, intimidation, or exile throughout the 1980s. Disappearances and what appear to be politically motivated killing did take place but these are not officially documented or acknowledged. A number of Seychellois families are now calling for official acknowledgement of politically motivated violence subsequent to the 1977 coup.\n\n==Democracy==\n[[File:Flag of Seychelles.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Seychelles]] since 1996]]\n[[File:James Michel 2014.png|thumb|[[James Michel]], President of the Seychelles, 2004-2016 ]]\n[[File:Danny Faure 2013-04-23.jpg|thumb|[[Danny Faure]], President of the Seychelles, 2016]]\nFollowing the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], at an Extraordinary Congress of the Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF) on December 4, 1991, President Ren\u00e9 announced a return to the multiparty system of government after almost 16 years of one-party rule. On December 27, 1991, the Constitution of Seychelles was amended to allow for the registration of political parties. Among the exiles returning to Seychelles was James Mancham, who returned in April 1992 to revive his party, the Democratic Party (DP). By the end of that month, eight political parties had registered to contest the first stage of the transition process: election to the constitutional commission, which took place on July 23\u201326, 1992.\n\nThe constitutional commission was made up of 22 elected members, 14 from the SPPF and 8 from the DP. It commenced work on August 27, 1992, with both President Ren\u00e9 and Mancham calling for national reconciliation and consensus on a new democratic constitution. A consensus text was agreed upon on May 7, 1993, and a referendum to approve it was called for June 15\u201318. The draft was approved with 73.9% of the electorate in favor of it and 24.1% against.\n\nJuly 23\u201326, 1993 saw the first multiparty presidential and legislative elections held under the new constitution, as well as a resounding victory for President Ren\u00e9. Three political groups contested the elections\u2014the SPPF, the DP, and the United Opposition (UO)--a coalition of three smaller political parties, including Parti Seselwa. Two other smaller opposition parties threw in their lot with the DP. All participating parties and international observer groups accepted the results as \"free and fair.\"\n\nThree candidates contested the March 20\u201322, 1998 presidential election\u2014Albert Ren\u00e9, SPPF; James Mancham, DP; and Wavel Ramkalawan\u2014and once again President Ren\u00e9 and his SPPF party won a landslide victory. The President's popularity in elections jumped to 66.6% in 1998 from 59.5% in 1993, while the SPPF garnered 61.7% of the total votes cast in the 1998 National Assembly election, compared to 56.5% in 1993.\n\nIn 1999, Mancham switched to the centrist liberal [[Seychelles National Party]] (SNP) which emerged as the major opposition party, losing to the SPPF in 2002 with 42% of the vote. In 2004, Ren\u00e9 turned the presidency over to his former vice president and long-time comrade, [[James Michel]]. Michel won the 2006 presidential elections against SNP leader [[Wavel Ramkalawan]] with 53.5% of the vote.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[List of colonial governors of Seychelles]]\n*[[List of Presidents of Seychelles]]\n*[[Politics of Seychelles]]\n*[[Prime Minister of Seychelles]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|isbn=0-585-06169-6|author=George Bennett, compiler ; with the collaboration of Pramila Ramgulam Bennett.|year=1993|publisher=Clio Press|location=Santa Barbara, California|title=Seychelles}}\n*{{cite book|isbn=99931-809-0-4|author=William McAteer.|year=2000|publisher=Pristine Books|location=Mah\u00e9, Seychelles|title=The history of Seychelles from discovery to independence}}\n*{{cite book|isbn=99931-60-00-8|author=[[Francis MacGregor]]|year=2004|publisher=F.E.

However, the '''[[recorded history]] of [[Seychelles]]''' dates back to the fourth of the [[Portuguese India Armadas]] led by [[Vasco da Gama]]. On 15 March 1503, the [[scrivener]] [[Thom\u00e9 Lopes]] noted the sighting of an elevated island, doubtless one the granitic islands and almost certainly [[Silhouette Island]]. The first recorded landing was by the men of the English [[East India Company]] ship ''Ascension'', which arrived in Seychelles in January 1609. The islands were claimed by France in 1756. Seychelles remained uninhabited until the first settlers arrived on board the ship Th\u00e9lemaque, which arrived on 27 August 1770. Captain Leblanc Lecore landed the first colonists, comprising 15 white men, eight Africans and five Indians. The [[Seychellois Creole]] language developed as a means of communication between the different races. The British frigate Orpheus commanded by Captain Henry Newcome arrived at Mah\u00e9 on 16 May 1794. Terms of capitulation were drawn up and the next day Seychelles was surrendered to Britain. Following the fall of Mauritius to British forces, Captain Phillip Beaver of the Nisus arrived at Mah\u00e9 on 23 April 1811 and took possession of Seychelles as a permanent colony of Britain. The Seychelles became an independent republic in 1976. Following a coup d'etat, a socialist [[one-party state]] ruled the country from 1977 to 1993. The subsequent democratic Presidential elections were won by candidates of the same party.\n\n==Pre-colonial history==\n\nThe early (pre-European colonisation) history of Isle de S\u00e9chelles or Seychelles is unknown. [[Malay race|Malays]] from [[Borneo]], who eventually settled on [[Madagascar]], perhaps lingered here circa 200-300 AD. [[Arab]] navigators, on trading voyages across the [[Indian Ocean]], were probably aware of the islands, although they did not settle them.\n\nArabs were trading the highly valued [[coco de mer]] nuts, found only in Seychelles, long before European discovery of the islands. The rotted-out nuts can float and were found washed ashore in the [[Maldives]] and [[Indonesia]].\n\n\n==Age of Discoveries==\nOn 15 March 1503, [[Vasco da Gama]], crossing from India to East Africa, sighted what was almost certainly [[Silhouette Island]] and the next day, [[Desroches Island]]. The granitic islands began to appear on Portuguese charts as the Seven Sisters.\n\nIn March 1608, a trading fleet of the [[English East India Company]] set sail for India. Lost in a storm, the ''Ascension's'' crew saw \"high land\" on 19 January 1609 and headed for it. They anchored \"as in a pond\". They found an uninhabited island with plentiful fresh water, [[fish]], [[coconut]]s, birds, turtles and giant tortoises with which to replenish their stores. The ''Ascension'' sailed, and reported what they had found, but the British took no action.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century, [[piracy|pirates]] arrived in the Indian Ocean from the Caribbean and made a base in [[Madagascar]], from where they preyed upon vessels approaching and leaving the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\nThe French had occupied the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]) since 1715. This colony was growing in importance, and in 1735 an energetic administrator, [[Bertrand-Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais]] (1699\u20131753) was appointed. His brief was to protect the French sea route to India. La Bourdonnais, himself a sailor, turned his attention to making a speedier passage from Mauritius to India. To this end, in 1742, he sent an expedition under the command of [[Lazare Picault]] to accurately chart the islands northeast of Madagascar.\n\nOn 21 November 1742, the ''Elisabeth'' and the ''Charles'' anchored off [[Mah\u00e9, Seychelles|Mah\u00e9]] at Anse Boileau (not Baie Lazare, later mistakenly named as Picault's landing place). They found a land of plenty. In fact, Picault named the island Ile d'Abondance. Picault's mapping was poor, so in 1744 he was sent back and renamed the main island Mah\u00e9 (in honor of his patron Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais), and the group the Iles de la Bourdonnais. He had high hopes for the Iles de la Bourdonnais. However, the islands were once more forgotten when La Bourdonnais was replaced in 1746.\n\n==French settlement and rule==\nThe outbreak in 1754 of what would become the [[Seven Years' War]] between England and France reminded the authorities on Mauritius about the islands. Two ships were sent to claim them, commanded by [[Corneille Nicholas Morphey]]. He renamed the largest island Isle de S\u00e9chelles in honour of [[Viscount]] [[Jean Moreau de S\u00e9chelles]], Minister of Finance during the reign of [[Louis XV]] (later Anglicised as Seychelles). This name was later used for the island group, whilst Mah\u00e9 was again used for the largest granitic island. Morphey took possession for the French king and the [[French East India Company]] on 1 November 1756.<ref>{{Cite web\n |last        = Fauvel\n |first       = Albert-Auguste\n |title       = Unpublished Documents on the History of the Seychelles Islands Anterior to 1810\n |work        = Government Printing Office, Mah\u00e9, Seychelles, via the World Digital Library\n |accessdate  = 2014-06-19\n |url         = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2396/#regions=africa&page=4\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140707084223/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2396/#regions=africa&page=4\n |archivedate = 2014-07-07\n}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the Seven Years' War, with France's loss of Canada and its status in India, caused the decline of the French East India Company, which had formerly controlled Mauritius. This settlement, and thus Seychelles, now came under direct royal authority. The new intendant of Mauritius, [[Pierre Poivre]] (1719\u20131786), was determined to break the Dutch monopoly of the lucrative spice trade; he thought Mah\u00e9 would be perfect for spice cultivation.\n\nIn 1768, Nicolas Dufresne arranged a commercial venture, sending ships to collect timber and tortoises from the Seychelles. During this expedition, French sovereignty was extended to cover all the islands of the granitic group on [[Christmas Day]].\n\nIn 1769, the navigators Rochon and Grenier proved that a faster route to India could safely be taken via the Seychelles, and thus the importance of the islands' strategic position was realised. Meanwhile, Poivre had finally obtained seedlings of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]], and 10,000 nutmeg seeds. His attempts to propagate them on Mauritius and Bourbon (later named [[R\u00e9union]]) met with little success, and he thought again of Seychelles. It was considered fortuitous when [[Brayer du Barr\u00e9]] (unknown-1777) arrived on Mauritius with royal permission to run a settlement on [[Ste. Anne Island|St Anne]] at his own expense.\n\nOn 12 August 1770, 15 white colonists\n, seven slaves, five Indians and one black woman settled on St Anne. Du Barr\u00e9 stayed in Mauritius seeking funds. After reports of initial success, he begged the government for more money. However, reports reached the authorities that ship captains could get no supplies of fresh produce from the islands. Du Barr\u00e9's appeals for help to Mauritius and Versailles fell on deaf ears. In desperation, he went to the Seychelles to try and rescue the situation, but to no avail. A ruined man, he left for India and died there shortly afterwards.\n\nFrench colonists then brought large amounts of creole slaves from Mauritius  to the Seychelles - they became the ancestors of the present population.\n\nIn 1771, Poivre sent Antoine Gillot to Seychelles to establish a [[spice]] garden. By August 1772, Du Barr\u00e9's people had abandoned St Anne and moved to Mah\u00e9 or returned home. Gillot worked on at [[Anse Royale]], establishing nutmeg, cloves, [[cinnamon]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] plants.\n\nWhen British ships were seen around Seychelles, the authorities were spurred into action, despatching a garrison under Lieutenant de Romainville. They built Etablissement du Roi (Royal Settlement) on the site of modern [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]]. Gillot was nominally in charge of the civilian colonists but had no real authority over them. Mauritius sent as replacement a man of stronger mettle, [[Jean Baptiste Philogene de Malavois]], who assumed command of the settlement in 1788. He drew up 30 decrees which protected the timber and tortoises. In future, only sound farming techniques and careful husbanding of resources would be tolerated.\n\nThe British frigate Orpheus commanded by Captain Henry Newcome arrived at Mah\u00e9 on 16 May 1794, together with the Centurion, the Resistance and two prizes.  An officer was sent ashore to request provisions and water. Quinssy proposed that having no means to oppose the enemy, the colony should surrender. Terms of capitulation were drawn up and the next day Seychelles was surrendered to Britain. The Centurion returned to Seychelles four years later in September 1798 and renewed the capitulation.\n==The Quincy era==\nIn 1790, as a result of the [[French Revolution]], the settlers formed a Colonial Assembly and decided they would run their colony themselves, according to their own constitution. Land in Seychelles should only go to the children of existing colonists, who should dispose of the colony's produce as they chose, not as Mauritius dictated. They deemed the abolition of [[slavery]] impossible because they believed that without free labour, the colony could not survive.\n\n[[File:The British conquer the Seychelles - 1794, 1 Rupee.jpg|right|thumb|1969 stamp commemorating the British occupation of 1794 ]]\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Queau de Quincy]] (1748\u20131827) took command of the colony in 1794. A wily man, he used skill and expediency to steer Seychelles through the years of war ahead. Seychelles acted as a haven for French [[French corsairs|corsairs]] (pirates carrying lettres de marque entitling them to prey legally on enemy shipping). Quincy hoped this might go unnoticed, but in 1794 a squadron of three British ships arrived led by the frigate \"Orpheus\" commanded by [[Henry Newcome]]. Quinssy proposed that having no means to oppose the enemy, the colony should surrender. Terms of capitulation were drawn up and the next day Seychelles was surrendered to Britain. \n\nThe British made no effort to take over the Seychelles; it was considered a waste of resources. The settlers decided that unless they were sent a garrison, they could not be expected to defend the French flag. Therefore, they would remain neutral, supplying all comers. The strategy worked. The colony flourished. Quincy's favourable terms of capitulation were renewed seven times during the visits of British ships.\n\nOn 11 July 1801, the French frigate ''Chiffonne'' arrived with a cargo of French prisoners sent into exile by [[Napoleon]]. Then HMS ''Sybille'' arrived. Quincy had to try to defend the ''Chiffonne'', but after a brief battle, the ''Chiffonne'' was taken. Captain Adam of the ''Sybille'' wanted to know why Quincy had interfered, in contravention of his capitulation terms. Quincy managed to talk his way out of the difficulty, and even persuaded Adam to agree to Seychelles' vessels flying a flag bearing the words \"Seychelles Capitulation\", allowing them to pass through the British blockade of Mauritius unmolested.\n\n15 September 1801 was the date of a memorable sea battle just off the settlement. The British ship ''Victor'' was seriously disabled by damage to her rigging, but she was able to manoeuvre broadside to the French vessel ''La Fl\u00eache'' and rake her with incessant fire. ''La Fl\u00eache'' began to sink. Rather than surrender her, her captain ran her aground, torching her before abandoning ship. The opposing commanders met ashore afterwards, the Englishman warmly congratulating his French counterpart on his courage and skill during the battle.\n\nThe British tightened the blockade on the French Indian Ocean colonies. [[R\u00e9union]] surrendered, followed in December 1810 by Mauritius. In April 1811, Captain Beaver arrived in Seychelles on the ''Nisus'' to announce the preferential terms of Quincy's capitulation should stand, but Seychelles must recognise the terms of the Mauritian surrender. Beaver left behind a Royal Marine, Lieutenant Bartholomew Sullivan, to monitor the Seychelles situation.\n\n==British rule==\n{{Main|British Mauritius}}\n\nThere was little Sullivan could do alone to stop the settlers continuing to provision French frigates and slavers. Slave ownership was not then against British law, although [[slave trade|slave trading]] was illegal. Sullivan, later given the title of Civil Agent, played cat and mouse with the pro-slaver colonists. Once, acting on a tip off, Sullivan was rowed over to [[Praslin]] and was able to confiscate a cargo of newly landed slaves. It was but a small triumph amidst many frustrations, and Sullivan, complaining that the Seychellois had \"no sense of honour, shame or honesty\", resigned.\n\nThe first civilian administrator of the British regime was [[Edward Madge]]. He had a bitter feud with Quincy, who remained in the administration as [[Justice of the Peace]]. In the following years, the islands became a backwater ticking over quietly. Seychellois landowners had a pleasant life, though making ends meet given the fickle markets for their produce was not always easy. The British had allowed all customary French practices to remain in place. The administrator may have been British, reporting to London, but he governed according to French rules. The biggest grievance the colonists had with their new masters was the colony's dependence on Mauritius.\n\nThe other cloud on the planters' horizon was British anti-slavery legislation. In 1835, slavery was completely abolished. The plantations were already in decline, their soils exhausted by years of cultivation without investment in renewing [[fertility]]. Some planters took their slaves and left. The liberated slaves had no land, and most squatted on the estates they had tended in bondage, and the colony entered a period of stagnation. There were no exports and no money to pay for new infrastructure.\n\nThe situation was only improved when planters realised they could grow [[coconut]]s with less labour and more profit than the traditional crops of [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[rice]], and [[maize]]. Soon, they also had a source of virtually free labour once again. The British took their anti-slavery stance seriously, and operated patrols along the East African coast, raiding Arab [[dhow]]s transporting slaves to the Middle East. Slaves liberated south of the Equator were brought to Seychelles and apprenticed to plantation owners. They worked the land in return for rations and wages. Over a period of thirteen years from 1861, around 2,400 men, women and children were brought to Seychelles.\n\nThe town, called Victoria since 1841, began to grow. Licences granted in 1879 give some idea of the range of businesses in the town. There was a druggist, two auctioneers, five retailers, four [[liquor]] stores, a [[Notary public|notary]], an [[Lawyer|attorney]], a [[jeweller]], and a [[watchmaker]].\n\nThere was a disaster on 12 October 1862, when torrential rain and strong winds hit Mah\u00e9. An [[avalanche]] of mud and rocks fell on the town from the hills. It has been estimated that over 70 persons lost their lives.\n\n<gallery>\nAlbert Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Albert Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s\nChurch Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Church Victoria Seychelles 1900s\nClock court treasury Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Clock court treasury Victoria Seychelles 1900s \nPost office clock tower Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Post office clock tower, Victoria Seychelles 1900s \nPostcard Mahe 1903.jpg|Postcard Mahe 1903 \nQueen Victoria Memorial Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Queen Victoria Memorial Seychelles 1900s.jpg\nRoyal Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Royal Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg \nSupreme Court Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Supreme Court, Seychelles 1900s \nVictoria buildings Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Victoria buildings, Seychelles 1900s \nVictoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Victoria, Seychelles, 1900s \nVictoria Street Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|Victoria Street, Victoria, Seychelles 1900s\nLibrary of Seychelles opening 1910.jpg|Library of Seychelles opening 1910.jpg\nFile:Victoria_Clock_Tower_Seychelles.jpg|Victoria's clock tower after 1925\n</gallery>\n\n==Crown Colony==\n[[File:Flag of Seychelles (1903\u20131961).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Seychelles]] 1903\u20131961]]\n \nSeychellois officials wanted Seychelles to organized as a separate autonomous colony within the British Empire, and the authorities in the mother colony, [[Mauritius]], supported them. Sir [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Gordon]], the Mauritian governor, sent a petition on their behalf to London. Concessions were made, but Seychelles did not become a [[Crown Colony]] in its own right until 1903 when its first Governor, Sir [[Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott]] took office. Befitting its new status, the colony acquired a botanical garden and a clock tower in the heart of Victoria. The French language and culture remained dominant, however.\n\nThe British, like the French before them, saw Seychelles as a useful place to exile troublesome political prisoners. Over the years, Seychelles became a home to prisoners from [[Zanzibar]], [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], to name but a few. The first in the line of exiles was Sultan Abdullah, a sultan in Perak including [[Lela Pandak Lam]], the ex-chief of Pasir Salak in [[Perak]] who arrived in 1875 after their implication in the murder of the British Resident of Perak, JW Birch. Like many of the exiles who followed, they settled well into Seychelles life and became genuinely fond of the islands. Sultan Abdullah's son took home with him one of the popular local French tunes by the islanders la rosal\u00e8 and incorporated it into the national anthem of his country. With new words, it later became ''[[Negaraku]]'', the [[national anthem]] of [[Malaysia]].\n\nPerhaps the most famous of the political prisoners was [[Archbishop Makarios]] from [[Cyprus]], who arrived in 1956. He likewise fell in love with his prison. \"When our ship leaves harbour\", he wrote, \"we shall take with us many good and kindly memories of the Seychelles...may God bless them all.\"\n\nWorld War I caused great hardship in the islands. Ships could not bring in essential goods, nor take away exports. Wages fell; prices soared by 150 percent. Many turned to crime and the prisons were bursting. Joining the Seychelles Labour Contingent, formed at the request of General Smuts, seemed to offer an escape. It was no easy option, however. The force, 800 strong, was sent to East Africa. After just five months, so many had died from [[dysentery]], [[malaria]] and [[beriberi]] that the corps was sent home. In all, 335 men died.\n\nBy the end of World War I, the population of Seychelles was 24,000 and they were feeling neglected by Great Britain. There was agitation from the newly formed Planters Association for greater representation in the governance of Seychelles affairs. After 1929, a more liberal flow of funds was ensured by the Colonial Development Act, but it was a time of economic depression; the price of [[copra]] was falling and so were wages. Workers petitioned the government about their poor working conditions and the burden of [[tax]] they had to bear. Governor Sir [[Arthur Grimble]] instigated some reforms, exempting lower income groups from taxation. He was keen to create model housing and distribute smallholdings for the landless. Many of his reforms were not approved until World War II had broken out, and everything was put on hold.\n\nThe Planters Association lobbied for the white landowners, but until 1937 those who worked for them had no voice. The League of Coloured Peoples was formed to demand a [[minimum wage]], a wage tribunal and free health care for all. During World War II, a seaplane depot was established on St Anne to monitor regional shipping. A garrison was stationed in the islands and a battery built at Pointe Conan to protect the harbour. Some 2,000 Seychellois men served in the Pioneer Companies in Egypt, Palestine and Italy.\n\nAt home, Seychelles had turmoil of its own. The first political party, the Taxpayers Association, was formed in 1939. A British governor described it as \"the embodiment of every reactionary force in Seychelles\", and it was entirely concerned with protecting the interests of the plantocracy. After the war, they also benefited by being granted the vote, which was limited to literate property owners; just 2,000 in a population of 36,000. At the first elections, in 1948, most of those elected to the Legislative Council were predictably members of the Planters and Taxpayers Association.\n\nIn 1958, the French bought back the [[Glorioso islands]] from the Seychelles.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Postcard of the lagoon at Cerf Island in the Seychelles, HMAS SYDNEY (II) refuelled there in January 1941 (27303623761).jpg|Lagoon at Cerf Island, 1941\nFile:Port Glaud to Conception Island, the Seychelles (27098454390).jpg|Port Glaud to Conception Island, 1941\nFile:Seychelles 25c stamp 1954.jpg|Postage stamp with portrait of Queen [[Elizabeth II]], 1954\n</gallery>\n\n==Independence==\n[[File:Flag of Seychelles (1961\u20131976).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Seychelles]] 1961-1976]]\n[[File:Seychelles Governor inspection 1972.jpg|thumb|Colonial Governor of the Seychelles inspecting police guard of honour in 1972]]\n[[File:State House Victoria Seychelles.jpg|thumb|Victoria's State House in the 1970s]]\nIt was not until 1964 that any new political movements were created. In that year, the [[Seychelles People's Progressive Front|Seychelles People's United Party]] (SPUP, later Seychelles People's Progressive Front, SPPF) was formed. Led by [[France-Albert Ren\u00e9]], they campaigned for socialism and independence from Britain. The late [[James Mancham]]'s [[Seychelles Democratic Party]] (SDP), created the same year, by contrast represented businessmen and planters and wanted closer integration with Britain.\n\nElections were held in 1966, won by the SDP.\n\nIn March 1970, colonial and political representatives of Seychelles met in London for a constitutional convention, with the Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP) of [[James Mancham]] advocating closer integration with the UK, and the Seychelles People's United Party (SPUP) of [[France-Albert Ren\u00e9]] advocating independence. Further elections in November 1970 brought a new constitution into effect, with Mancham as Chief Minister.  Further elections were held in April 1974, in which both major political parties campaigned for independence. Following this election, negotiations with the British resulted in an agreement under which the Seychelles became an independent [[republic]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] on June 29, 1976. The newly knighted Sir James Mancham became the country's first President, with Ren\u00e9 as Prime Minister. These negotiations also restored the islands of [[Aldabra]], [[Farquhar Group|Farquhar]], and [[Des Roches]], which had been transferred from Seychelles in November 1965 to form part of the new [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT), to Seychelles upon independence.\n\n<gallery>\nBoy with coconuts Seychelles.jpg|Boy with coconuts Seychelles \nCinnamon quill maker Seychelles.jpg|Cinnamon quill maker Seychelles \nCoconut oil making Seychelles.jpg|Coconut oil making Seychelles \nCoconut plantation worker Seychelles.jpg|Coconut plantation worker Seychelles\n Colourful Skirts at Seychelles Market.jpg|Colourful Skirts at Seychelles Market\n Cutting coconuts Seychelles.jpg|Cutting coconuts Seychelles\n Farmer house Seychelles.jpg|Farmer house Seychelles\nFish market Seychelles 1.jpg|Fish market Seychelles\n Fisherman and his catch Seychelles.jpg|Fisherman and his catch\nFisherman Seychelles.jpg|Fisherman Seychelles \nFishermen pirogue Seychelles.jpg|Fishermen pirogue Seychelles\nMah\u00e9 Beauvallon FishingOnThe Beach.JPG|Mah\u00e9 Beauvallon FishingOnThe Beach\n Market scene Seychelles.jpg|Market scene Seychelles\n Seychelles man with fish.jpg|Seychelles man with fish\n Seychelloise fish trap.jpg|Seychelloise fish trap\n</gallery>\n\n==One-party state==\n{{further|1981 Seychelles coup d'\u00e9tat attempt}}\n[[File:Flag of Seychelles (1977-1996).svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Seychelles]], 1977-1996 ]]\n[[File:France-Albert Ren\u00e9, June 2014.jpg|thumb|[[France-Albert Ren\u00e9]], President of the Seychelles, 1977-2004]]\nOn June 5, 1977, a coup d'\u00e9tat saw Mancham deposed while overseas, and [[France-Albert Ren\u00e9]] became President.

Hoarau is buried in London.\n\nIn 1985 after the assassination of Hoarau, the Seychelles community in exile put together a program titled SIROP - Seychelles International Repatriation and Onward Program. Involving an alliance of CDU, DP, SNP and SNP it outlined negotiations for a peaceful return of the exiles supported by a strong economic program.\n\nIn February 1992, Conrad Gresl\u00e9 (19 August 1937 - July 1993), a local accountant, landowner and advocate of multi-party democracy in Seychelles was arrested and charged with treason for allegedly planning to overthrow President Ren\u00e9's r\u00e9gime with the apparent aid of foreign mercenaries and with supposed CIA involvement. Gresl\u00e9 died in Seychelles in July 1993 and is survived by his wife Sylvia, son Neville and daughters Natasha and Yvette Gresl\u00e9.<ref>James Mancham, ''Seychelles: Personalities of Yesterday'' (Seychelles: Mah\u00e9 Publications, 2005).</ref>\n\nA number of Seychellois were displaced and exiled by the dictatorship. The Gresl\u00e9 family were one of a few landowners of largely French descent to remain after the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1977 - most had their land confiscated and were exiled. Any individual who publicly resisted the Ren\u00e9 r\u00e9gime was vulnerable to threats, intimidation, or exile throughout the 1980s. Disappearances and what appear to be politically motivated killing did take place but these are not officially documented or acknowledged. A number of Seychellois families are now calling for official acknowledgement of politically motivated violence subsequent to the 1977 coup.\n\n==Democracy==\n[[File:Flag of Seychelles.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Seychelles]] since 1996]]\n[[File:James Michel 2014.png|thumb|[[James Michel]], President of the Seychelles, 2004-2016 ]]\n[[File:Danny Faure 2013-04-23.jpg|thumb|[[Danny Faure]], President of the Seychelles, 2016]]\nFollowing the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], at an Extraordinary Congress of the Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF) on December 4, 1991, President Ren\u00e9 announced a return to the multiparty system of government after almost 16 years of one-party rule. On December 27, 1991, the Constitution of Seychelles was amended to allow for the registration of political parties. Among the exiles returning to Seychelles was James Mancham, who returned in April 1992 to revive his party, the Democratic Party (DP). By the end of that month, eight political parties had registered to contest the first stage of the transition process: election to the constitutional commission, which took place on July 23\u201326, 1992.\n\nThe constitutional commission was made up of 22 elected members, 14 from the SPPF and 8 from the DP. It commenced work on August 27, 1992, with both President Ren\u00e9 and Mancham calling for national reconciliation and consensus on a new democratic constitution. A consensus text was agreed upon on May 7, 1993, and a referendum to approve it was called for June 15\u201318. The draft was approved with 73.9% of the electorate in favor of it and 24.1% against.\n\nJuly 23\u201326, 1993 saw the first multiparty presidential and legislative elections held under the new constitution, as well as a resounding victory for President Ren\u00e9. Three political groups contested the elections\u2014the SPPF, the DP, and the United Opposition (UO)--a coalition of three smaller political parties, including Parti Seselwa. Two other smaller opposition parties threw in their lot with the DP. All participating parties and international observer groups accepted the results as \"free and fair.\"\n\nThree candidates contested the March 20\u201322, 1998 presidential election\u2014Albert Ren\u00e9, SPPF; James Mancham, DP; and Wavel Ramkalawan\u2014and once again President Ren\u00e9 and his SPPF party won a landslide victory. The President's popularity in elections jumped to 66.6% in 1998 from 59.5% in 1993, while the SPPF garnered 61.7% of the total votes cast in the 1998 National Assembly election, compared to 56.5% in 1993.\n\nIn 1999, Mancham switched to the centrist liberal [[Seychelles National Party]] (SNP) which emerged as the major opposition party, losing to the SPPF in 2002 with 42% of the vote. In 2004, Ren\u00e9 turned the presidency over to his former vice president and long-time comrade, [[James Michel]]. Michel won the 2006 presidential elections against SNP leader [[Wavel Ramkalawan]] with 53.5% of the vote.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[List of colonial governors of Seychelles]]\n*[[List of Presidents of Seychelles]]\n*[[Politics of Seychelles]]\n*[[Prime Minister of Seychelles]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|isbn=0-585-06169-6|author=George Bennett, compiler ; with the collaboration of Pramila Ramgulam Bennett.|year=1993|publisher=Clio Press|location=Santa Barbara, California|title=Seychelles}}\n*{{cite book|isbn=99931-809-0-4|author=William McAteer.|year=2000|publisher=Pristine Books|location=Mah\u00e9, Seychelles|title=The history of Seychelles from discovery to independence}}\n*{{cite book|isbn=99931-60-00-8|author=[[Francis MacGregor]]|year=2004|publisher=F.E.

The destruction of their settlement is attributed to the Carthaginians, giving way to the emergence of the Roman city of Hispalis, built very near the Roman colony of [[It\u00e1lica]] (now Santiponce), which was only 9&nbsp;km northwest of present-day [[Seville]]. It\u00e1lica, the birthplace of the Roman emperors [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]], was founded in 206-205 BC.  It\u00e1lica is well preserved and gives an impression of how Hispalis may have looked in the later Roman period. Its ruins are now an important tourist attraction. Under the rule of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], Hispalis housed the royal court on some occasions.\n\nIn [[al-Andalus]] (Muslim Spain) the city was first the seat of a ''k\u016bra'' (Spanish: ''cora''),<ref name=\"AndersonRosser-Owen2007\">{{cite book|author1=Glaire D.

After the [[Reconquista]], Seville was resettled by the Castilian aristocracy; as capital of the kingdom it was one of the Spanish cities with a vote in the Castilian [[Cortes Generales#History of the Cortes|Cortes]], and on numerous occasions served as the seat of the itinerant court. The Late Middle Ages found the city, its port, and its colony of active Genoese merchants in a peripheral but nonetheless important position in European international trade, while its economy suffered severe demographic and social shocks such as the Black Death of 1348 and the anti-Jewish revolt of 1391.\n\n[[File:Tower of Gold.jpg|thumb|The Torre del Oro (Tower of Gold) next to the [[Guadalquivir]]]]\nAfter the discovery of the Americas, Seville became the economic centre of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]  (House of Trade) wielded its power, opening a Golden Age of arts and letters. Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history, the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city's culture; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as navigation of the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir River]] became increasingly difficult until finally the trade monopoly and its institutions were transferred to C\u00e1diz.\n\nThe city was revitalised in the 19th century with rapid industrialisation and the building of rail connections, and as in the rest of Europe, the artistic, literary, and intellectual Romantic movement found its expression here in reaction to the Industrial Revolution. The 20th century in Seville saw the horrors of the [[Spanish Civil War]], decisive cultural milestones such as the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]] and [[Seville Expo '92|Expo'92]], and the city's election as the capital of the [[Andalusian Autonomous Government|Autonomous Community of Andalusia]].\n\n==Prehistory and antiquity==\n[[File:Tesoro del Carambolo (reproducci\u00f3n Ayuntamiento de Sevilla) 002.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of a gold breast piece from the [[Archeological Museum of Seville#The El Carambolo treasure|El Carambolo treasure]], displayed in the City Hall of Seville]]\nThe original core of the city, in the neighbourhood of the present-day street, Cuesta del Rosario, dates to the 8th century BC,<ref name=\"Salgueiro2007\">{{cite book|author=Manuel Jes\u00fas Rold\u00e1n Salgueiro|title=Historia de Sevilla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zZXEGgAACAAJ|accessdate=9 February 2013|year=2007|publisher=Almuzara|isbn=978-84-88586-24-7}}</ref> when Seville was on an island in the Guadalquivir.<ref name=\"Mena1985\">{{cite book|author=Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Mena|title=Historia de Sevilla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_kqAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 February 2013|year=1985|publisher=Plaza & Jan\u00e9s|isbn=978-84-01-37200-1|page=39}}</ref>  Archaeological excavations in 1999 found anthropic remains under the north wall of the Real [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Alc\u00e1zar]] dating to the 8th\u20137th century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Proyecto Puntual de Investigaci\u00f3n 1999: Intervenci\u00f3n Puntual: \"Estudios estratigr\u00e1ficos y an\u00e1lisis constructivos\"|url=http://www.alcazarsevilla.org/?page_id=33|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130815214749/http://www.alcazarsevilla.org/?page_id=33|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-08-15|work=Real Alc\u00e1zar|publisher=Real Alc\u00e1zar de Sevilla|language=Spanish|quote=Los restos antr\u00f3picos m\u00e1s antiguos se situaban sobre esta terraza, bajo la muralla Septentrional del Alc\u00e1zar, datados en el s.

Although the city was rebuilt after being pillaged by the Carthaginians, the name 'Hispalis' appeared for the first time in the [[Augustan History]] in 49 BC, five years before Julius Caesar granted it the status of Roman colony to celebrate his victory over Pompey in 54 BC.

Isidore's reference to the foundation pilings of Hispalis was confirmed when their remains were discovered by archaeological excavations in Calle Sierpes, where, according to the historian Antonio Collantes de Teran, \"piles were sharpened on their lower ends, regularly driven into the sandy subsoil, and obviously served to consolidate the foundation in that place.\" Similar findings have been made at the Plaza de San Francisco.

Hispalis was a city of great mercantile activity and an important commercial port. The area around the present Plaza de la Alfalfa was the intersection of the two main axes of the city, the Cardo Maximus which ran north to south, and the Decumanus Maximus which ran east to west.

The king may have decided that before undertaking any other ventures in Africa, it would be prudent to gain control of all ports of access to the Iberian peninsula. Years later, the king again summoned the Cortes to Seville in the fall of 1282; to raise monies for waging his war against the Moors, he proposed a debasement of the coinage, to which the assembly reluctantly consented.<ref name=\"Burns1990\">{{cite book|author=O'Callaghan, Joseph F.|editor=Robert I.

Alfonso was an intellectual, and a great patron of the sciences and the arts, hence his title. He distinguished himself as poet, astronomer, musician, linguist and legislator. Alfonso's son, Sancho IV of Castile, tried to usurp the throne from his father, but the people of Seville remained loyal to their scholar king. The symbol 'NO8DO' is believed to have originated when, according to legend, Alfonso X rewarded the fidelity of the ''Sevillanos'' with the words that now appear on the official coat of arms and the flag of the city of Seville.\n\nThe [[Battle of R\u00edo Salado|Battle of Salado]] in 1340 resulted in the opening of maritime trade between southern and northern Europe through the Strait of Gibraltar and a growing presence of Italian and Flemish merchants in Seville, who were key to the inclusion of the southern routes of the Crown of Castile in that commerce.

A 'golden age' of development commenced in Seville, due to its being the only port awarded the royal monopoly for trade with the growing Spanish colonies in the Americas, and the influx of riches from them. Since only sailing ships leaving from and returning to the inland port of Seville could engage in trade with the Spanish Americas, merchants from Europe and other trade centers needed to go to Seville to acquire trade goods from the New World.\n\nA twenty percent tax, the ''[[quinto real]]'', was levied by the Casa on all [[precious metals]] entering Spain.<ref name=\"Acosta2002\">{{cite book|author=Jos\u00e9 de Acosta|title=Natural and Moral History of the Indies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NC4wPdoD7HEC&pg=PA177|date=24 September 2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8393-4|page=177}}</ref> Trade with the overseas possessions was handled by the merchants' guild based in Seville, the ''Consulado de Mercaderes'', which worked in conjunction with the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n.

The factories established in the barrio of Triana were famous for their wares, including soap, silk for export to Europe, and ceramics. The city developed into a multicultural centre that nurtured the flowering of the arts, especially architecture, painting, sculpture and literature, thus playing an important role in the cultural achievements of the [[Spanish Golden Age]] ''(El Siglo de Oro)''. The advent of the printing press in Spain led to the development of a sophisticated Sevillian literary salon.\n\n[[File:RI-51-0000079 Capilla Sta Maria Jesus-Sevilla 02.jpg|thumb|Side Chapel of Santa Maria de Jesus next to the Puerta de Jerez, built in the early 16th century for the University of Seville]]\nIn the middle of the 13th century, the Dominicans, in order to prepare missionaries for work among the Moors and Jews, had organized schools for the teaching of Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek. To cooperate in this work and to enhance the prestige of Seville, Alfonso the Wise in 1254 established in the city 'general schools' (escuelas generales) of Arabic and Latin. Pope Alexander IV, by the Bull of 21 June 1260, recognised this foundation as a ''generale litterarum studium''. Rodrigo de Santaello, archdeacon of the cathedral and commonly known as Maese Rodrigo, began the construction of a building for a university in 1472. The Catholic Monarchs published the royal decree creating the university in 1502, and in 1505 Pope Julius II granted the Bull of authorization\u2014this is considered the official founding of the present [[University of Seville]]. In 1509 the college of Maese Rodrigo was finally installed in its own building, under the name of Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas,<ref>Pozo Ruiz, Alfonso; ''[http://personal.us.es/alporu/sedes/sede_1.htm Historia del Colegio Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas]'', Universidad de Sevilla. [19-10-2008]</ref>  but its courses were not opened until 1516. The Catholic Monarchs and the pope granted the power to confer degrees in logic, philosophy, theology, and canon and civil law. The college was situated near the modern Puerta de Jerez. Only two architectural elements remain: the Late Gothic portal which since 1920 has formed part of the entrance to the Convent of Santa Clara, and the small Mud\u00e9jar chapel.\n\nAt the same time that the royal university was established, there was developed the ''Universidad de Mareantes'' (University of Sea-farers), in which body the Catholic Monarchs, by a royal decree of 1503, established the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n with classes for pilots and of seamen, and courses in cosmography, mathematics, military tactics, and artillery. This establishment was of incalculable importance, for it was there that the expeditions to the Indies were organised, and there that the great Spanish sailors were educated.\n\nThe ''Casa'' had a large number of cartographers and navigators, archivists, record keepers, administrators and others involved in producing and managing the [[Padr\u00f3n Real]], the secret official Spanish master map used as a template for the maps present on all Spanish ships during the 16th century. It was probably a large-scale chart that hung on the wall of the old Alc\u00e1zar in Seville.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Lloyd Arnold|title=The Story of Maps|year=1979|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0486238739|pages=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qh7nDfGm7BkC&pg=PA143|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe numerous official cartographers and pilots included [[Amerigo Vespucci]], [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], [[Alonzo de Santa Cruz]], and Juan Lopez de Velasco. In 1508 a special position was created for Vespucci, the 'pilot major' (chief of navigation), to train new pilots for ocean voyages. Vespucci, who made at least two voyages to the New World, worked at the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n until his death in 1512.\n\n====Important buildings of the Sevillian Golden Age====\nWith its monopoly on the [[West Indies]] trade, Seville saw a great influx of wealth. This wealth drew [[Italy|Italian]] artists such as [[Pietro Torrigiano]], a classmate rival of [[Michelangelo]] in the garden of the [[Medici]]. Torrigiano executed magnificent sculptures at the monastery of Saint Jerome and elsewhere in Seville, as well as notable tombs and other works which brought the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]] and of [[humanism]] to Seville. French and [[Flanders|Flemish]] sculptors such as [[Roque Balduque]] arrived also, bringing with them a tradition of a greater realism.\n\n[[File:Naves 001jpg.jpg|thumb|left|Nave of the Seville Cathedral]]Important historic buildings from this period include the [[Seville Cathedral]], completed in 1506; after Seville was taken by the Christians (1248) in the [[Reconquista]], the city's mosque had been converted to a church. This structure was badly damaged in a 1356 earthquake, and by 1401 the city began building the current cathedral, one of the largest churches in the world and an outstanding example of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Baroque]] architectural styles. The former [[minaret]] of the mosque, called the [[Giralda]], survived the earthquake, but the copper spheres that originally topped it fell during the 1365 earthquake, and were replaced with a cross and bell. The new cathedral incorporated the minaret as a bell tower, which was eventually built higher during the [[Renaissance]]. It is surmounted by a statue, known locally as \"El Giraldillo\", representing [[Faith]] (1560\u20131568).\n\nThe ''Archivo General de Indias'' ([[General Archive of the Indies]]), housed in the ancient merchants' exchange, the ''Casa Lonja de Mercaderes'', is the repository of valuable archival documents preserving the history of the [[Spanish Empire]] in the Americas and the Philippines. The structure, an Italianate example of Spanish  [[Renaissance architecture]], was designed by [[Juan de Herrera]]. The building and its contents were registered in 1987 by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\nThe [[Casa consistorial de Sevilla]] is a [[Plateresque]]-style building, currently home of the city's government ''(ayuntamiento''), built in 1527\u20131564. The building was designed by architect [[Diego de Ria\u00f1o]], who supervised its construction from 1527 until his death in 1534. He was succeeded by Juan S\u00e1nchez, who built the arcade which now connects the building with the ''Plaza Nueva'', and later on by [[Hern\u00e1n Ruiz the Younger]], one of the most accomplished architects of the Plateresque style.<ref>{{cite book|title=Arquitectura renacentista.

Construction of the building began in 1546, as a legacy of Fadrique Enr\u00edquez de Ribera, who had died in 1539. It was designed by the architect Mart\u00edn de Gainza, who supervised its construction until his death in 1556. Two years later, Hern\u00e1n Ruiz II took charge. The hospital was dedicated, although still incomplete, in 1558.\n\n[[File:Fachada iglesia anunciaci\u00f3n 001.jpg|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of the Church of the Annunciation]]\nThe College of the Annunciation of the Professed House of the  [[Society of Jesus]] in Seville was one of the intellectual pillars of the Spanish [[Counter-Reformation]], and also served as a starting point for Jesuit expansion in overseas lands. The building of the Professed House, where the university was installed from 31 December 1771, had been the first residence owned by the Jesuits in Seville. It was founded in February 1558, and work on the church, dedicated to the Annunciation, began in 1565.\n\nThe Jesuit supervisor of the House, the architect Bartolome de Bustamante (1501\u20131570), drew the original plans and the architect [[Hern\u00e1n Ruiz the Younger]] continued the project to its completion in 1568. At first it housed a College for the Humanities, but as early as 1590 it had become the Professed House, a residence for those Jesuits who preached. The Jesuits were expelled from Seville in the 18th century and the building became the seat of the University of Seville in 1771.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aguilar Pi\u00f1al|first=Francisco|title=History of the University of Seville|year=1992|publisher=University of Seville|isbn=84-7405-826-0|pages=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1bJ9F4G4BUC |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title= History of the University of Seville|last= Aguilar Pi\u00f1al|first=Francisco| page=104| year=1992| isbn= 84-7405-826-0 }}</ref> The original structure was torn down in [[Francoist Spain]], but the residence's patio porticoed with marble columns is preserved in the modern Faculty of Fine Arts of the university. The tiny chapel in the Puerta de Jerez, consecrated in 1506, was replaced by the magnificent Church of the Annunciation, built in Renaissance style (1565\u20131568) as the church of the Professed House. Work on the church with its noble classical facade began in 1565; it was consecrated in 1579. There are some important paintings in the main altarpiece, including ''The Annunciation'' by [[Antonio Mohedano]], and the ''Exaltation of the name of Jesus'' or ''Circumcision'' by [[Juan de Roelas]].\n\n[[File:Antigua Audiencia de Sevila.jpg|thumb|The Royal Audiencia of Seville]]\nThe Royal Audiencia of Seville (Real Audiencia de los Grados de Sevilla) was a court of the Crown of Castile, established in 1525 during the reign of Charles I. It had judicial powers as an appeals court in civil and criminal cases, but had no powers of government. The building that housed the Audiencia of Seville is located in the Plaza de San Francisco de Sevilla, and is currently the headquarters of the financial institution Cajasol. The building was built between 1595 and 1597, although justice had been administered earlier in another building at the same place called the Casa Cuadra since shortly after the reconquest of the city in 1248. The building has been renovated several times.\n\nThe Royal Mint of Seville ''(Casa de la Moneda)'', built 1585\u20131587, was the circulation center where gold and silver from the New world were smelted into the [[Spanish maraved\u00ed]]s and [[doubloon]]s that flowed into and helped support the general European economy in the 16th century, the age of the New World conquistadores and Seville in its full splendor.\n\n[[File:SevillaCasaPilatosPatioPrincipal.jpg|thumb|left|Main patio of the [[Casa de Pilatos]] ]]\nThe [[Casa de Pilatos]] ''(Pilate's House)'' serves as the permanent residence of the [[Victoria Eugenia, 18th Duchess of Medinaceli|Dukes of Medinaceli]]. The building is a mixture of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] Italian and [[Mud\u00e9jar]] Spanish styles. It is considered the prototype of the Andalusian palace. The construction of this palace, which is adorned with precious [[azulejos]] tiles and well-kept gardens, was begun by Pedro Enr\u00edquez de Qui\u00f1ones, [[Adelantado|Adelantado Mayor]] of Andalus\u00eda, and his wife Catalina de Rivera, founder of the Casa de Alcal\u00e1, and completed by Pedro's son Fadrique Enr\u00edquez de Rivera, the first Marquis of Tarifa.\n\nThe writer [[Miguel de Cervantes]] lived primarily in Seville between 1596 and 1600. Because of financial problems, Cervantes worked as a purveyor for the Spanish Armada, and later as a tax collector. In 1597, discrepancies in his accounts of the three years previous landed him in the Royal Prison of Seville for a short time.\n''[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]'', a popular comedy among his works, features two young vagabonds who come to Seville, attracted by the riches and disorder that the 16th-century commerce with the Americas had brought to that metropolis.\n\n===17th and 18th Centuries===\n[[File:PesteSevilla.jpg|thumb|right|17th century anonymous painting depicting the 1649 plague]]\nIn the 17th century Seville fell into a deep economic and urban decline as a consequence of the general economic crisis that struck Europe and Spain in particular.<ref name=\"Brown1998\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Brown|title=Painting in Spain: 1500-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxhDegm5N7oC&pg=PA200|year=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-06474-2|page=200}}</ref> This decline was aggravated in Seville by river floods and the great plague of 1649, which may have killed some 60,000 people, nearly half of the existing population of 130,000.<ref name=\"Ort\u00edz1984\">{{cite book|author=Antonio Dom\u00ednguez Ort\u00edz|title=Historia de Sevilla: la Sevilla del siglo XVII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DS5pAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 January 2013|year=1984|publisher=Secretariado de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Sevilla|page=74}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Oca\u00f1a |first=Juan Carlos |title=La Espa\u00f1a del Barroco: Evoluci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y social en el siglo XVII |url=http://www.historiasiglo20.org/HE/7e.htm/La%20Espa%C3%B1a%20del%20Barroco%20historiasiglo20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208121222/http://www.historiasiglo20.org/HE/7e.htm/La%20Espa%C3%B1a%20del%20Barroco%20historiasiglo20 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 December 2015 |work=Historia siglo 20 El sitio web de la historia del siglo XX |publisher=Historia siglo 20{{!}} |accessdate=7 January 2014 |language=Spanish |year=2005 }}</ref> Also at this time the spirit of the [[Counter-Reformation]] manifested itself, the Catholic revival transforming Seville into a city of religious convents. By 1671 there were 45 monasteries for monks and 28 convents for women in the city\u2014with all the major orders, Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians and Jesuits, represented in them. This was the social setting of the Holy Week (Semana Santa) processions which had culminated in the Cathedral since Cardinal [[Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara]] issued the mandates of the Synod of 1604, and the origin of the \"[[Holy Week in Seville#La Carrera Oficial (The Official Path)|Carrera Oficial]]\", or Official Path, to the Cathedral.\n\nThe devastation caused by the plague of 1649 is depicted in an anonymous canvas in the Hospital del Pozo Santo. Seville's population was halved, a heavy blow to the local economy. One of the plague's most notable victims was the sculptor Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s. Discontent spread in the social fabric of Sevillian life, especially among the poor, who rioted in 1652 over the scarcity and high price of bread.\n\nBy the late 17th century, the ''Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n'' had fallen into bureaucratic deadlock, and the empire as a whole was failing because of Spain's inability to finance wars on the Continent and a global empire at the same time. In the 18th century, the new [[Bourbon Reforms|Bourbon kings]] reduced the power of Seville and the ''Casa de Contratacion''. In 1717 they moved the ''Casa'' from Seville to the more suitable harbour of [[C\u00e1diz]], diminishing Seville's importance in international trade.  [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] further limited the powers of the Casa and his son, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], abolished it altogether in 1790.\n\n====The Baroque golden age of Sevillian painting in the 1600s====\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain - Vel\u00e1zquez 1644.jpg|thumb|left|Philip IV of Spain, painted by Vel\u00e1zquez]]\nThe economic decline of this period was not accompanied by a corresponding decline of the arts. During the reign of the Habsburg king [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in the 17th century (1621\u20131665), there were effectively only two patrons of art in Spain\u2014the church and the king with his court. [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] was the artist favored by the church, while [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]] was patronised by the crown. The Baroque period of art emphasised exaggerated motion and clear detail to produce drama, exuberance, and grandeur. The popularity of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Catholic Church, which had decided, in response to the Protestant Reformation, that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement.<ref name=\"Gardner1996\">{{cite book|author=Helen Louise Gardner|title=Gardner's Art: Through the Ages|url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou1996gard|url-access=registration|edition=10|year=1996|publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers|isbn=978-0-15-501141-0|page=820}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish portrait artist, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660), generally acknowledged as one of the greatest painters of all time, was born in Seville, and lived there for his first twenty-two years. He studied under [[Francisco Herrera the Elder|Francisco de Herrera]] till he was twelve, and then was apprenticed to his future father-in-law [[Francisco Pacheco]], an active artist and teacher, for six years.

Zurbar\u00e1n was called the ''Spanish [[Caravaggio]]'' for his mastery of the realistic use of [[chiaroscuro]]. In 1614 his father sent him to [[Seville]] to apprentice for three years with Pedro D\u00edaz de Villanueva. ''The Apotheosis of St. Thomas Aquinas'' is Zurbar\u00e1n's most highly regarded work; he painted this starkly realistic masterpiece at the height of his career.<ref>G\u00e1llego and Gudiol 1987, p. 13.</ref>\nZurbar\u00e1n made his career in Seville, and in about 1630 he was appointed painter to Philip IV.

He spent two periods of a few years in Madrid, but lived and worked mostly in Seville. He began his art studies under [[Juan del Castillo]], and became familiar with [[Flemish painting]]; the great commercial importance of Seville at the time ensured that he was also exposed to influences from other regions. As his painting developed, his works evolved towards the polished style that suited the bourgeois and aristocratic tastes of the time, demonstrated especially in his religious works. In 1642, at the age of 26, he moved to [[Madrid]], where he most likely became familiar with the work of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], and would have seen the work of Venetian and Flemish masters in the royal collections. In 1660, he returned to Seville, where he died twenty-two years later. Here he was one of the founders of the [[Academia de Bellas Artes (Seville)|Academia de Bellas Artes]] (Academy of Art), sharing its direction, in 1660, with the architect [[Francisco Herrera the Younger]]. This was his period of greatest activity, and he received numerous important commissions.\n\n[[File:Bbaasvq.jpg|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville]]\n[[Juan de Vald\u00e9s Leal]] (1622\u20131690) was born in Seville in 1622, and distinguished himself as a painter, sculptor, and architect. He studied under Antonio del Castillo. In 1660 Vald\u00e9s co-founded the Academia de Bellas Artes with Murillo and Francisco Herrera the Younger. Murillo was the preeminent Sevillian painter of the time and was chosen as president of the academy. After the death of Murillo in 1682, Vald\u00e9s established himself as the foremost painter in Sevilla. Among his works are ''History of the Prophet Elias'' for the church of the Carmelites, ''Martyrdom of St. Andrew'' for the church of San Francesco in C\u00f3rdoba, and ''Triumph of the Cross for la Caridad'' in Seville. He died in Seville.\n\nThe [[Museum of Fine Arts of Seville]] ''(Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla)'' houses a choice selection of works by artists from the Golden Age of Sevillian painting during the 17th century, including masterpieces by the above-mentioned masters.\n\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez - Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s (Museo del Prado, 1635-36).jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Portrait of Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s|Portrait of Monta\u00f1\u00e9s]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1636]]\n[[Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s]] (1568\u20131649), known as ''el Dios de la Madera'' (\"the God of Wood\"),<ref>Nash 2005, p. 23</ref> was one of the most important figures of the [[Sevillian school of sculpture]]. In the final quarter of the 16th century, Monta\u00f1\u00e9s made his residence in Seville; it would be his base throughout his long life and career. The greatest and most characteristic sculptor of the school of Seville, he produced many important altarpieces and sculptures for numerous places in Spain and the Americas. His works include the great altar at Santa Clara in Seville, the ''Concepci\u00f3n'' and the realistic figure of Christ Crucified in ''Cristo de la Clemenc\u00eca''  in the sacristy of Seville cathedral; and the highly realistic polychromed wood head and hands of [[St Ignatius of Loyola]] and of [[St Francis Xavier]] in the church of the University of Seville, where the costumed figures were used in celebrations.\n\n[[File:SemanaSantaSevillaEstudiantes3.jpg|thumb|200px|De Mesa's ''Cristo de la Buena Muerte'' on display during Semana Santa in 2006]]\n[[Juan de Mesa]] (1583\u20131627) was the creator of several of the effigies that are still used in the processions of ''[[Holy Week in Seville|Semana Santa]]'', including the ''Cristo del Amor'', ''Jesus del Gran Poder'' and ''Cristo de la Buena Muerte''. Some of Seville's grandest churches were built in the Baroque period, several of them with retables (altar-pieces) created by accomplished artists; many of the traditional rituals and customs of Holy Week still observed in Seville, including the display of venerated images, date from this time.\n\nAt the heart of the ''Semana Santa'' (Holy Week) processions are the religious brotherhoods ''(Hermandades y Cofrad\u00edas de Penitencia)'', associations of Catholic laypersons organised to perform public acts of religious observance, in this case acts related to the Passion and death of Jesus Christ and done as a public penance. The ''hermandades'' and ''cofrad\u00edas'' (brotherhoods and confraternities) organise the processions during which members precede the ''pasos'' dressed in penitential robes, and, with a few exceptions, hoods.\n\nThe ''pasos'' at the centre of each procession are images or sets of images placed atop a movable float of wood. If a brotherhood has three ''pasos'', the first one would be a sculpted scene of the Passion, or an allegorical scene, known as a ''misterio'' (mystery); the second an image of Christ; and the third an image of the Virgin Mary, known as a ''dolorosa''.\n\n[[File:San Telmo 001.jpg|thumb|left|275px|General view of the Palace of San Telmo in 2010 after restoration by architect Guillermo V\u00e1zquez Consuegra]]\nThe Seminary School of the University of Navigators ''(Colegio Seminario de la Universidad de Mareantes)'' was founded in 1681 by the Spanish Crown during the reign of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] to \"...house, bring up and educate orphaned and abandoned boys for service in the navy and fleets of the Indies\". The crown commissioned the building of the [[Palace of San Telmo]] (Palacio de San Telmo), named after St. Telmo, the patron saint of sailors, as its seat. This was designed in an exuberant Spanish baroque style by the local architect Leonardo de Figueroa and Mat\u00edas and Antonio Mat\u00edas, his son and grandson. This emblem of Seville's civil architecture of the period has since been used for various purposes. It was the residence of the [[Duchy of Montpensier|Dukes of Montpensier]] in the 19th century. During most of the 20th century it was the provincial Seminary, and finally, since 1989, it has been home to the Presidency of the Andalusian Autonomous Government ''(Junta de Andaluc\u00eda)''.\n\nIn May 1700, at the beginning of the century of enlightenment and scientific discovery, the Royal Society of Philosophy and Medicine of Seville was founded in Seville, the first of its kind in Spain. Seville lost much of its economic and political importance after 1717, however, when the new Bourbon administration ordered the transfer of the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n from Seville to Cadiz, whose harbour was better suited to transatlantic trade.<ref name=\"Pounds1979\">{{cite book|author=Norman John Greville Pounds|title=An Historical Geography of Europe, 1500-1840|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalgeogra0000poun|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22379-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalgeogra0000poun/page/126 126]}}</ref> The Guadalquivir River had been gradually silting in, which was worsened by the effects of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake<ref>Rodriguez-Vidal ''et al''.

Since the 1950s it has been the seat of the rectorate of the University of Seville. Prior to that, it was, as its name indicates, a tobacco factory\u2014the most prominent such institution in Europe, and a lineal descendant of Europe's first tobacco factory, which was located nearby. One of the first large industrial building projects in modern Europe, the Royal Tobacco Factory is among the most notable and splendid examples of industrial architecture from the era of Spain's Antiguo R\u00e9gimen. By a Royal Order in 1725 the former tobacco factory was transferred to its current location on land adjacent to the Palace of San Telmo, just outside the Puerta de Jerez (a gate in the city walls). Construction began in 1728, and proceeded intermittently for the next 30 years. It was designed by military engineers from Spain and the [[Low Countries]].<ref name=\"Pozo Ruiz\">Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, [http://personal.us.es/alporu/fabricatabaco/vision_general.htm La Real F\u00e1brica de Tabacos de Sevilla: Vision hist\u00f3rica general].

The building covers a roughly rectangular area of 185 by 147 metres (610 by 480 feet), with slight protrusions at the corners. The only building in Spain that covers a larger surface area is the monastery-palace of [[El Escorial]], which is 207 by 162 metres (680 by 530 feet).<ref name=\"Pozo Ruiz\" />  [[Renaissance architecture]] provides the main points of reference, with [[Herrerian]] influences in its floor plan, courtyards, and the details of the fa\u00e7ades. There are also motifs reminiscent of the works of the architects [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Palladio]]. The stone fa\u00e7ades are modulated by pilasters on pedestals.<ref name=\"Pozo Ruiz\" /> This 18th-century industrial building was, at the time it was built, the second largest building in Spain, after the royal residence [[El Escorial]]. It remains one of the largest and most architecturally distinguished industrial buildings ever built in that country, and one of the oldest such buildings to survive.\n\nSeville became the dean of the Spanish provincial press in 1758 with the publication of its first newspaper, the ''Hebdomario \u00fatil de Seville'', the first to be printed in Spain outside Madrid.\n\n==Modern Era==\n[[File:Plano de Sevilla 1860.jpeg|250px|thumb|Map of Seville in 1860]]\n\n===19th Century===\nThe year 1800 in Seville saw an epidemic of yellow fever which spread over the entire city in four months, wiping out a third of the population. It had been introduced into the port of C\u00e1diz with the arrival in July of a corvette coming from Havana, and spread rapidly through the countryside.\n\nWhen news of the advance of [[Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno|Marshal Claude Victor-Perrin's]] invading [[Bonapartist]] French army arrived in Seville on 18 January 1810, the city erupted in chaos. The [[Junta (Peninsular War)#Junta Suprema Central, 1808-1810|Central Junta]] fled on 23 January and was replaced by a revolutionary government led by Francisco Palafox, the [[Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana|Marquis of La Romana]], and [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis|Francisco Saavedra]], the original head of the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom|Junta of Seville]] in 1808. Soon discovering how weak the city's defences were, the new Junta absconded as well on 28 January. Anti-Napoleon sentiment was still widespread and the mob remained defiant yet disorganised. When the vanguard of the French troops appeared on 29 January they were fired upon, but the municipal corporation of Seville negotiated a surrender to avoid bloodshed. On 1 February, Marshal Claude Victor occupied the city, accompanied by the pretender to the Spanish throne, [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (Jos\u00e9 I), elder brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rickard|first=J|title=French invasion of Andalusia French invasion of Andalusia, January\u2013February 1810|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/campaign_french_andalusia.html|date=9 April 2008}}</ref> The French settled in until 27 August 1812, when they were forced to retreat by Anglo-Spanish counterattacks; [[Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]] looted numerous valuable works of art in the interim.\n\nBetween 1825 and 1833 Melchor Cano acted as chief architect in Seville, most of the urban planning policy and architectural modifications of the city being made by him and his collaborator Jose Manuel Arjona y Cuba.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Antig\u00fcedad del Castillo-Olivares|first=Mar\u00eda Dolores|title=El arquitecto Melchor Cano y la teor\u00eda de la ciudad.

The Isabel II bridge, better known as the Triana bridge, dates from this period. The residence of the Dukes of Montpensier in the ''Palacio de San Telmo'' was so extravagant it was said to be vying for second Court of the kingdom. During this period street lighting was expanded in the municipality and most of the streets were paved.<ref>name=\"Bueno2006\"</ref>\n\nBy the second half of the 19th century Seville began an expansion supported by railway construction and the demolition of part of its ancient walls, allowing the urban space of the city to grow eastward and southward. The ''Sevillana de Electricidad'' Company was created in 1894 to provide electric power throughout the municipality,<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez Paradas, Mercedes; ''[http://www.adurcal.com/enlaces/mancomunidad/historia/electri/electri.htm La implantaci\u00f3n del alumbrado p\u00fablico de electricidad en la Andaluc\u00eda del primer del tercio del S.

The exhibition buildings were constructed in [[Mar\u00eda Luisa Park]] along the [[Guadalquivir River]]. A majority of the buildings were built to remain permanently after the closing of the exposition. Many of the foreign buildings, including the United States exhibition building, were to be used as consulates after the closing of the exhibits. By the opening of the exposition all of the buildings were complete, although many were no longer new. Not long before the opening, the Spanish government also began a modernization of the city in order to prepare for the expected crowds by erecting new hotels and widening the mediaeval streets to allow for the movement of automobiles.\n\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Seville BW 2015-10-23 15-35-15.jpg|thumb|left|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]\nSpain spent millions of [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] in developing its exhibits for the fair and constructed elaborate buildings to hold them. The exhibits were designed to show the social and economic progress of Spain as well as expressing its culture. The Spanish architect [[An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez \u00c1lvarez-Ossorio|An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez]] designed the largest and most famous of the buildings which surrounded the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (Seville)|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]] to showcase Spain's industry and technology exhibits. Gonz\u00e1lez combined a mix of 1920s [[Art Deco]] and 'mock Mudejar', and [[Neo-Mud\u00e9jar]] styles. The ''Plaza de Espa\u00f1a'' complex is a huge half-circle with buildings continually running around the edge accessible over the moat by numerous beautiful bridges. In the centre is a large fountain. By the walls of the Plaza are many tiled alcoves, each representing a different province of Spain.\n\nThe arched drawbridge, the Bridge of San Telmo, was opened in 1931.\n\n====The Second Republic and Civil War (1931-1939)====\nIn the country-wide municipal elections held on 12 April 1931 the Republican leftist parties won in the principal Spanish cities. In Seville the Republican Socialists got 57% of the votes versus 39% for the Monarchist coalition. As a result, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] went into exile and proclaimed the Second Republic.\n[[File:Fotograf\u00eda del Jefe Territorial de la Falange Espa\u00f1ola Sancho D\u00e1vila y Fern\u00e1ndez de Celis en Sevilla saludando desde el balc\u00f3n de la casa cuartel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.80|A group of falangists making the [[fascist salute]] from a city balcony in September 1936.]]\nThe convulsions of the [[Spanish Civil War]] were fully felt in the Andalusian capital, where since February 1936 the military had been planning a coup. On July 18 General [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] quickly gained control of the 2nd ''Divisi\u00f3n Org\u00e1nica'', arresting a number of other officers.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936\u20131939 |first=Antony |last=Beevor |authorlink=Antony Beevor|location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |origyear=1982|year=2006|page=59 |isbn=0297848321}}</ref>  In poor neighbourhoods such as Triana and La Macarena the unions and leftist parties mobilised militias but Queipo defeated them by a combination of superior weaponry, cunning and harsh repression. Seville was thus occupied by the rebels along with Cadiz and Algeciras, providing General [[Francisco Franco]], Chief of the General Staff, sufficient ground to safely move the ''Ej\u00e9rcito de \u00c1frica'' (Army of Africa) to Andalusia by air. Seville then became a rearguard city, acting as a bridgehead for the occupation of the rest of the peninsula by the Army of Africa, being the most populous of all the cities occupied by the partisan army. Repression in the city between July 18, 1936 and January 1937 caused the deaths of 3,028 people, including the mayor, Horacio Hermoso Araujo, the Republican former mayor Joseph Gonzalez Fernandez de Labandera, and the president of the Provincial Council, Jos\u00e9 Manuel de los Santos Puelles. Altogether some 8,000 civilians were shot by the Nationalists in Seville during the course of the war.\n\n====Francoist Spain (1939-1975)====\nOn 1 October 1936, in [[Burgos]], Franco was publicly proclaimed as ''[[General\u00edsimo]]'' of the National army and ''Jefe del Estado'' ([[Head of State]]), by the coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Hugh|title=The Spanish Civil War|year=1986|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York|pages=424|edition=3rd}}</ref>  In [[Francoist Spain]] the most powerful officials in Seville and the province were: the military authority embodied in the person occupying the Captaincy General of the Second Military Region, the Civil Government represented by the Provincial Chief of the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' (Nationalist movement), and the archbishop of the Diocese of Seville. The mayors of the city during this period were directly appointed by the Minister of the Interior, usually those nominated by these military, political and religious authorities.\n\nUnder Francisco Franco's rule Spain was officially neutral in World War II (although it did collaborate with the [[Axis powers]]),<ref name=\"Payne2008\">{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

One of the most significant events of this period occurred on 13 March 1941 with the explosion of the gunpowder stored in the magazine of Santa Barbara, located in the ''Cerro del Aguila'' (Eagle Hill), destroying ten surrounding blocks and damaging many more. Calle Jos\u00e9 Arpa, where the depot was located, was destroyed, as well as the streets Huesca, Galicia, Lisbon, Afan de Ribera and part of H\u00e9roes de Toledo. The magazine was not a military facility, but belonged to the ''Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Explosivos'' (Spanish Society of Explosives).\n\nIn 1953, during the full [[autarky]] of Franco, the shipyard of Seville was opened, eventually employing more than 2,000 workers in the 1970s despite the production of the larger vessels demanded by the maritime market being hindered by the shallowness of the Guadalquivir River.\n\nBefore the existence of wetlands regulation in the Guadalquivir basin, Seville suffered regular heavy flooding; perhaps worst of all were the floods that occurred in November 1961 when the river Tamarguillo overflowed as a result of a prodigious downpour of rain in which three hundred litres of water per square metre fell in a short period.<ref name=\"PfisterBr\u00e1zdil2013\">{{cite book|author1=Christian Pfister|author2=Rudolf Br\u00e1zdil|author3=R\u00fcdiger Glaser|title=Climatic Variability in Sixteenth-Century Europe and Its Social Dimension|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLjUBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA272|date=14 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-94-015-9259-8|page=272}}</ref> Entire neighbourhoods were inundated: La Calzada, Cerro del \u00c1guila, San Bernardo, El Fontanal, Tiro de L\u00ednea, and La Puerta de Jerez, the waters penetrating as far as La Campana.

A month later, so many Sevillians were still homeless that the popular radio host Bobby Deglan\u00e9 organised a relief motorcade from Madrid, the so-called 'Operaci\u00f3n Clavel' (Operation Clavel), which ended in tragedy with the crash of a chartered aeroplane leading the way to publicise the event.<ref name=\"Gilmore1998\">{{cite book|author=David D.

The next fifteen years saw the largest urban expansion of the city yet, with the reconstruction of many neighbourhoods, the upper middle class barrio of ''Los Remedios'' exemplifying this urban redevelopment; the [[Seville Fair]], previously held at the ''Prado de San Sebasti\u00e1n'', was moved there in 1973.\n\nTrade unionism in Seville began during the 1960s with the underground organizational activities of the Workers' Commissions or ''Comisiones Obreras'' (CCOO), in factories such as Hytasa, the Astilleros shipyards, Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n, etc. Several of the movement's leaders were imprisoned in Spain in the Process 1001 of November 1973 by the courts of the ''[[Tribunal de Orden P\u00fablico]]'', including Fernando Soto, Eduardo Saborido, and Francisco Acosta.\n\n====Democratic era====\nOn 3 April 1979 Spain held its first democratic municipal elections after the end of Francoist Spain; councillors representing four different political parties were elected in Seville: the Union of the Democratic Centre or ''Uni\u00f3n de Centro Democr\u00e1tico'' (UCD) won nine councilors, the Andalusian Party or ''Partido Andalucista'' (PA) won eight, the Spanish Socialist Party or ''Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol'' (PSOE) won eight as well and the Communist Party of Spain or ''Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a'' (PCE) won six. As no party achieved a sufficient majority to govern, a coalition government was formed, with power shared between the PSA, the PSOE and the PCE. The coalition elected Councilman Luis Uru\u00f1uela of the Partido Andalucista as mayor.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1996 the Sevillian politician Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez held the Presidency of the Government of Spain.\n\nOn 5 November 1982, Pope John Paul II arrived in Seville to officiate at a Mass before more than half a million people at the fairgrounds and celebrate the beatification of Sister (''Sor'' in Spanish) Angela de la Cruz, founder of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Cross. He visited the city again 13 June 1993, for the International Eucharistic Congress.\n\n[[File:Puente de la Barqueta noche.jpg|thumb|The [[Puente de la Barqueta]] (Barqueta Bridge) at dusk]]\nIn 1992, the [[Seville Expo '92|Universal Exposition]] was held for six months in Seville, on the occasion of which the local communications network infrastructure was greatly improved: the SE-30 beltway around the city was completed, new highways were constructed, the new Santa Justa train station had opened in 1991 and the Spanish High Speed Rail system, the ''Alta Velocidad Espa\u00f1ola'' (AVE), began to operate between Madrid-Seville. The Seville airport, the '' Aeropuerto de Sevilla'', was expanded with a new terminal building designed by the architect [[Rafael Moneo]], and various other improvements were made. The monumental ''[[Puente del Alamillo]]'' (Alamillo Bridge) over the Guadalquivir, designed by the architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], was built to allow access to the island of La Cartuja, site of the massive exposition, as was the ''[[Puente de la Barqueta]]'' (Barqueta Bridge) designed by Juan J. Arenas and Marcos J. Pantaler\u00f3n that now connects the historic center of Seville with the technology park. Some of the installations remaining after the exposition at the massive site on La Cartuja island were converted into the largest technology park in Andalusia: the Scientific and Technological Park Cartuja 93. The greenspace and artificial lakes of the Alamillo Park are a legacy of the exposition as well; the present theme park, [[Isla M\u00e1gica]], is a re-purposing of the Lago de Espa\u00f1a zone of the exposition.\n[[File:Calatrava Puente del Alamillo Seville.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puente del Alamillo]] at night, designed for the [[Seville Expo '92]] by [[Santiago Calatrava]] ]]\n\nThroughout the decade there were several attacks in Seville by the Basque separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] resulting in deaths. On 30 January 1998, the deputy mayor of Seville and member of the People's Party, Alberto Jim\u00e9nez-Becerril Barrio and his wife, Ascension Garcia Ortiz, attorney of the courts of Seville, were assassinated at their home, leaving three children; in October 2000 the military physician Colonel Antonio Mu\u00f1oz Cari\u00f1anos was shot dead in his own office. These killings provoked great consternation in the city and led to massive demonstrations against ETA violence.\n\n===21st Century===\nSeville began the century under the leadership of the socialist Mayor Alfredo Sanchez Monteseir\u00edn (PSOE), who had held the position of alderman since June 1999 with support from the PA, the PP being the largest party. In 2003 he was again invested as mayor, winning this time as the candidate with the most popular votes but not an absolute majority, and in this case supported by the councilors of the United Left. The outcome of the elections in May 2007 validated the progressive pact of the (PSOE-IU), surpassing the number of votes submitted by the People's Party (PP) or the Andalusian Party (PA), leaving the latter without representation in the council and the PP with the most votes of all the parties represented in the Consistorio. Thus S\u00e1nchez Monteseir\u00edn ranks as the first mayor in the history of democracy in Seville to serve three times on the city council in power, despite having been only once the candidate with the most votes from the electorate and the filing of corruption charges of illegal financing through the issue of false invoices.\n\nIn June 2002 a summit of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union was held in Seville, chaired by the then acting president of the European Union and the Spanish president, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar. The meeting was protested with a series of actions and peaceful mass demonstrations by alternative and anti-capitalist political action groups.\n\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3nLaPlatadesdelacalle.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to the [[Seville Metro]]]]\nIn 2003, construction of Line 1 of the [[Seville Metro|''Metro de Sevilla'']] was reinitiated, having been canceled in 1983 due to technical difficulties in the subsurface excavation, with cracks appearing in several historic buildings in the city. The project was restarted in 1999 on a different layout to the original, focussing less on urban locations and more on the broader metropolitan area; the work resumed with an intense effort by the ''Sociedad Metro de Sevilla'' (Society of Metro Seville), driven by Andalucista Alejandro Rojas-Marcos and local government to complete the construction of the metro. The completion of its four lines will be a milestone in the history of the communications-saturated metropolitan area of Seville.\n\nIn 2004 the Sevillian brewer Cruzcampo celebrated its centenary, organizing numerous public events and advertising campaigns to celebrate the anniversary. Also in 2004 the conservative newspaper ABC, founded in 1929 by Torcuato Luca de Tena, marked its 75th anniversary in the Seville edition.\n\n2005 marked the centenary of Sevilla FC (Sevilla Football Club) and in 2007 of the Real Betis Balompi\u00e9 club.\n\nWork on the Metro Line 1 should have been completed by June 2006, but changes in layout, unanticipated archaeological finds, problems with tunneling and shafts, and work stoppages of various kinds prompted the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda to not set any date prior to 2008 for its inauguration and shuffle the projected date of full operation to early 2009.\n\nIn February 2007 the bidding process started for works of the remaining lines (2, 3 and 4) to complete the projected metro network; the regional government of Andalusia ''(Junta de Andaluc\u00eda)'' and the national government being responsible for funding Lines 2 and 3 of the metropolitan layout and the city of Seville responsible for financing construction of the urban Line 4. The metro will include tram lines\u2014the Metrocentro in the center of the city, the tram Aljarafe, and the tram Alcala de Guadaira\u2014all connected with Metro Line 1 to provide a comprehensive transportation system.\n[[File:Metropol parasol 02042011 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Setas]]\n[[File:Torre Sevilla abril 2015.jpg|thumbnail|upright|[[Torre Sevilla|Torre Peigi]], near Guadalquivir river]]\nThe empowerment of local lines will be emphasised as well with rail ringing the city, and new connections to the North Aljarafe (Sanlucar la Mayor, etc.). In 2007 and 2008, major media attention-grabbing projects included: the building of a network of bike paths that made Seville the city with the most miles of bike lanes in Spain; the pedestrianization of the Plaza Nueva and Constitution Avenue (next to the Cathedral); the operationalising of the Metrocentro tram that links the Prado de San Sebasti\u00e1n with the aforementioned Plaza Nueva; the construction of the [[C\u00e9sar Pelli]]-designed office tower (scheduled to be finished in 2013) as headquarters for the newly formed Cajasol bank; the international award-winning architectural project \"The setas\"; the redevelopment in the [[La Alameda, Seville|Alameda de Hercules]], and planned upgrades to the gardens and port along the Paseo de las Delicias, the port being redeveloped to accommodate more visits by cruise ships to the city; and a new aquarium, the New World Aquarium at ''Muelle de Las Delicias''.\n\nAlthough Los Astilleros, the Seville shipyard, closed in late 2011<ref name=Astilleros2011>{{cite news|title=Entran en liquidaci\u00f3n los Astilleros de Sevilla con la extinci\u00f3n de contratos|url=http://www.canalsur.es/portal_rtva/web/noticia/id/183859/portada/astilleros_de_sevilla_cierra_tras_60_anos_de_actividad|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=Informativos Canal Sur|date=31 December 2011}}</ref>  after suffering financial<ref>{{cite news|last=Montenegro|first=Raquel|title=Astilleros suma una deuda de 280 millones de euros entre Huelva y Sevilla|url=http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/economia/540116/astilleros/suma/una/deuda/millones/euros/entre/huelva/y/sevilla.html|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=Diario de Sevilla|date=16 October 2009|language=Spanish}}</ref>  and labor<ref>{{cite news|author=R.E.|title=Astilleros de Sevilla presenta un ERE para despedir a 183 trabajadores|url=http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/economia/689161/astilleros/sevilla/presenta/ere/para/despedir/trabajadores.html|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=Diario de Sevilla|date=29 April 2010|language=Spanish}}</ref>  difficulties, Seville's economy is steadily improving with a mix of tourism, commerce, technology and industry.\n\n== Population ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The destruction of their settlement is attributed to the Carthaginians, giving way to the emergence of the Roman city of Hispalis, built very near the Roman colony of [[It\u00e1lica]] (now Santiponce), which was only 9&nbsp;km northwest of present-day [[Seville]]. It\u00e1lica, the birthplace of the Roman emperors [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]], was founded in 206-205 BC.  It\u00e1lica is well preserved and gives an impression of how Hispalis may have looked in the later Roman period. Its ruins are now an important tourist attraction. Under the rule of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], Hispalis housed the royal court on some occasions.\n\nIn [[al-Andalus]] (Muslim Spain) the city was first the seat of a ''k\u016bra'' (Spanish: ''cora''),<ref name=\"AndersonRosser-Owen2007\">{{cite book|author1=Glaire D.

After the [[Reconquista]], Seville was resettled by the Castilian aristocracy; as capital of the kingdom it was one of the Spanish cities with a vote in the Castilian [[Cortes Generales#History of the Cortes|Cortes]], and on numerous occasions served as the seat of the itinerant court. The Late Middle Ages found the city, its port, and its colony of active Genoese merchants in a peripheral but nonetheless important position in European international trade, while its economy suffered severe demographic and social shocks such as the Black Death of 1348 and the anti-Jewish revolt of 1391.\n\n[[File:Tower of Gold.jpg|thumb|The Torre del Oro (Tower of Gold) next to the [[Guadalquivir]]]]\nAfter the discovery of the Americas, Seville became the economic centre of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]  (House of Trade) wielded its power, opening a Golden Age of arts and letters. Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history, the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city's culture; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as navigation of the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir River]] became increasingly difficult until finally the trade monopoly and its institutions were transferred to C\u00e1diz.\n\nThe city was revitalised in the 19th century with rapid industrialisation and the building of rail connections, and as in the rest of Europe, the artistic, literary, and intellectual Romantic movement found its expression here in reaction to the Industrial Revolution. The 20th century in Seville saw the horrors of the [[Spanish Civil War]], decisive cultural milestones such as the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]] and [[Seville Expo '92|Expo'92]], and the city's election as the capital of the [[Andalusian Autonomous Government|Autonomous Community of Andalusia]].\n\n==Prehistory and antiquity==\n[[File:Tesoro del Carambolo (reproducci\u00f3n Ayuntamiento de Sevilla) 002.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of a gold breast piece from the [[Archeological Museum of Seville#The El Carambolo treasure|El Carambolo treasure]], displayed in the City Hall of Seville]]\nThe original core of the city, in the neighbourhood of the present-day street, Cuesta del Rosario, dates to the 8th century BC,<ref name=\"Salgueiro2007\">{{cite book|author=Manuel Jes\u00fas Rold\u00e1n Salgueiro|title=Historia de Sevilla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zZXEGgAACAAJ|accessdate=9 February 2013|year=2007|publisher=Almuzara|isbn=978-84-88586-24-7}}</ref> when Seville was on an island in the Guadalquivir.<ref name=\"Mena1985\">{{cite book|author=Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Mena|title=Historia de Sevilla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_kqAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 February 2013|year=1985|publisher=Plaza & Jan\u00e9s|isbn=978-84-01-37200-1|page=39}}</ref>  Archaeological excavations in 1999 found anthropic remains under the north wall of the Real [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Alc\u00e1zar]] dating to the 8th\u20137th century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Proyecto Puntual de Investigaci\u00f3n 1999: Intervenci\u00f3n Puntual: \"Estudios estratigr\u00e1ficos y an\u00e1lisis constructivos\"|url=http://www.alcazarsevilla.org/?page_id=33|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130815214749/http://www.alcazarsevilla.org/?page_id=33|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-08-15|work=Real Alc\u00e1zar|publisher=Real Alc\u00e1zar de Sevilla|language=Spanish|quote=Los restos antr\u00f3picos m\u00e1s antiguos se situaban sobre esta terraza, bajo la muralla Septentrional del Alc\u00e1zar, datados en el s.

Although the city was rebuilt after being pillaged by the Carthaginians, the name 'Hispalis' appeared for the first time in the [[Augustan History]] in 49 BC, five years before Julius Caesar granted it the status of Roman colony to celebrate his victory over Pompey in 54 BC.

However, the cognomen 'H\u00edspalis' is due to its situation, as it is built on pilings above marshy ground, so as not to yield to a sliding and unstable foundation.}}\n\nAlthough this etymology is not accurate, it is likely that the city was considered untenable as a residence by the Romans for its instability, being built on alluvial soil and frequently threatened by flooding of the Guadalquivir River. Isidore's reference to the foundation pilings of Hispalis was confirmed when their remains were discovered by archaeological excavations in Calle Sierpes, where, according to the historian Antonio Collantes de Teran, \"piles were sharpened on their lower ends, regularly driven into the sandy subsoil, and obviously served to consolidate the foundation in that place.\" Similar findings have been made at the Plaza de San Francisco.

Hispalis was a city of great mercantile activity and an important commercial port.

In 1260, he appointed a sea governor ''(adelantado de la mar)'', and the port of Sal\u00e9, (Arabic:Sal\u00e2), on the Atlantic coast of Morocco was occupied briefly. Encouraged by the apparent success of that raid, Alfonso summoned the Cortes to Seville in January 1261 to seek counsel, but no further action was taken. The king may have decided that before undertaking any other ventures in Africa, it would be prudent to gain control of all ports of access to the Iberian peninsula. Years later, the king again summoned the Cortes to Seville in the fall of 1282; to raise monies for waging his war against the Moors, he proposed a debasement of the coinage, to which the assembly reluctantly consented.<ref name=\"Burns1990\">{{cite book|author=O'Callaghan, Joseph F.|editor=Robert I.

The motto is an heraldic pun in Spanish, i.e., a [[rebus]] combining the Spanish syllables (NO and DO) and a drawing in between of the figure \"8\". The figure represents a skein of yarn, or in Spanish, a ''madeja''. When read aloud, \"No madeja do\" sounds like \"No me ha dejado\", which means \"It [Seville] has not abandoned me\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Hidalgu\u00eda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qxkaAAAAIAAJ&q=%22No+madeja+do%22|year=1982|publisher=Instituto Salazar y Castro (C.S.I.C.)|page=271}}</ref>\nThe story of how NO8DO came to be the motto of the city has undoubtedly been embellished throughout the centuries, but history tells that after the conquest of Seville from the Muslims in 1248, King Ferdinand III moved his court to the former Muslim palace, the Alc\u00e1zar of Seville.\n[[File:Flag of Sevilla, Spain.svg|thumb|Flag of Seville]]\n\nAfter Ferdinand's death in the Real Alc\u00e1zar, his son, Alfonso X the Wise, assumed the throne. Alfonso was an intellectual, and a great patron of the sciences and the arts, hence his title. He distinguished himself as poet, astronomer, musician, linguist and legislator. Alfonso's son, Sancho IV of Castile, tried to usurp the throne from his father, but the people of Seville remained loyal to their scholar king. The symbol 'NO8DO' is believed to have originated when, according to legend, Alfonso X rewarded the fidelity of the ''Sevillanos'' with the words that now appear on the official coat of arms and the flag of the city of Seville.\n\nThe [[Battle of R\u00edo Salado|Battle of Salado]] in 1340 resulted in the opening of maritime trade between southern and northern Europe through the Strait of Gibraltar and a growing presence of Italian and Flemish merchants in Seville, who were key to the inclusion of the southern routes of the Crown of Castile in that commerce.

This aggravation of pre-existing social conflicts found an outlet in the [[anti-Judaism]] revolt of 1391, inspired by the anti-Semitic sermons of Ferran Martine, the [[Archdeacon]] of [[Ecija]].

A 'golden age' of development commenced in Seville, due to its being the only port awarded the royal monopoly for trade with the growing Spanish colonies in the Americas, and the influx of riches from them. Since only sailing ships leaving from and returning to the inland port of Seville could engage in trade with the Spanish Americas, merchants from Europe and other trade centers needed to go to Seville to acquire trade goods from the New World.\n\nA twenty percent tax, the ''[[quinto real]]'', was levied by the Casa on all [[precious metals]] entering Spain.<ref name=\"Acosta2002\">{{cite book|author=Jos\u00e9 de Acosta|title=Natural and Moral History of the Indies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NC4wPdoD7HEC&pg=PA177|date=24 September 2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8393-4|page=177}}</ref> Trade with the overseas possessions was handled by the merchants' guild based in Seville, the ''Consulado de Mercaderes'', which worked in conjunction with the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n.

The factories established in the barrio of Triana were famous for their wares, including soap, silk for export to Europe, and ceramics. The city developed into a multicultural centre that nurtured the flowering of the arts, especially architecture, painting, sculpture and literature, thus playing an important role in the cultural achievements of the [[Spanish Golden Age]] ''(El Siglo de Oro)''. The advent of the printing press in Spain led to the development of a sophisticated Sevillian literary salon.\n\n[[File:RI-51-0000079 Capilla Sta Maria Jesus-Sevilla 02.jpg|thumb|Side Chapel of Santa Maria de Jesus next to the Puerta de Jerez, built in the early 16th century for the University of Seville]]\nIn the middle of the 13th century, the Dominicans, in order to prepare missionaries for work among the Moors and Jews, had organized schools for the teaching of Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek. To cooperate in this work and to enhance the prestige of Seville, Alfonso the Wise in 1254 established in the city 'general schools' (escuelas generales) of Arabic and Latin. Pope Alexander IV, by the Bull of 21 June 1260, recognised this foundation as a ''generale litterarum studium''. Rodrigo de Santaello, archdeacon of the cathedral and commonly known as Maese Rodrigo, began the construction of a building for a university in 1472. The Catholic Monarchs published the royal decree creating the university in 1502, and in 1505 Pope Julius II granted the Bull of authorization\u2014this is considered the official founding of the present [[University of Seville]]. In 1509 the college of Maese Rodrigo was finally installed in its own building, under the name of Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas,<ref>Pozo Ruiz, Alfonso; ''[http://personal.us.es/alporu/sedes/sede_1.htm Historia del Colegio Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas]'', Universidad de Sevilla. [19-10-2008]</ref>  but its courses were not opened until 1516. The Catholic Monarchs and the pope granted the power to confer degrees in logic, philosophy, theology, and canon and civil law. The college was situated near the modern Puerta de Jerez. Only two architectural elements remain: the Late Gothic portal which since 1920 has formed part of the entrance to the Convent of Santa Clara, and the small Mud\u00e9jar chapel.\n\nAt the same time that the royal university was established, there was developed the ''Universidad de Mareantes'' (University of Sea-farers), in which body the Catholic Monarchs, by a royal decree of 1503, established the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n with classes for pilots and of seamen, and courses in cosmography, mathematics, military tactics, and artillery. This establishment was of incalculable importance, for it was there that the expeditions to the Indies were organised, and there that the great Spanish sailors were educated.\n\nThe ''Casa'' had a large number of cartographers and navigators, archivists, record keepers, administrators and others involved in producing and managing the [[Padr\u00f3n Real]], the secret official Spanish master map used as a template for the maps present on all Spanish ships during the 16th century.

In 1508 a special position was created for Vespucci, the 'pilot major' (chief of navigation), to train new pilots for ocean voyages. Vespucci, who made at least two voyages to the New World, worked at the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n until his death in 1512.\n\n====Important buildings of the Sevillian Golden Age====\nWith its monopoly on the [[West Indies]] trade, Seville saw a great influx of wealth. This wealth drew [[Italy|Italian]] artists such as [[Pietro Torrigiano]], a classmate rival of [[Michelangelo]] in the garden of the [[Medici]]. Torrigiano executed magnificent sculptures at the monastery of Saint Jerome and elsewhere in Seville, as well as notable tombs and other works which brought the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]] and of [[humanism]] to Seville. French and [[Flanders|Flemish]] sculptors such as [[Roque Balduque]] arrived also, bringing with them a tradition of a greater realism.\n\n[[File:Naves 001jpg.jpg|thumb|left|Nave of the Seville Cathedral]]Important historic buildings from this period include the [[Seville Cathedral]], completed in 1506; after Seville was taken by the Christians (1248) in the [[Reconquista]], the city's mosque had been converted to a church. This structure was badly damaged in a 1356 earthquake, and by 1401 the city began building the current cathedral, one of the largest churches in the world and an outstanding example of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Baroque]] architectural styles. The former [[minaret]] of the mosque, called the [[Giralda]], survived the earthquake, but the copper spheres that originally topped it fell during the 1365 earthquake, and were replaced with a cross and bell. The new cathedral incorporated the minaret as a bell tower, which was eventually built higher during the [[Renaissance]]. It is surmounted by a statue, known locally as \"El Giraldillo\", representing [[Faith]] (1560\u20131568).\n\nThe ''Archivo General de Indias'' ([[General Archive of the Indies]]), housed in the ancient merchants' exchange, the ''Casa Lonja de Mercaderes'', is the repository of valuable archival documents preserving the history of the [[Spanish Empire]] in the Americas and the Philippines. The structure, an Italianate example of Spanish  [[Renaissance architecture]], was designed by [[Juan de Herrera]]. The building and its contents were registered in 1987 by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\nThe [[Casa consistorial de Sevilla]] is a [[Plateresque]]-style building, currently home of the city's government ''(ayuntamiento''), built in 1527-1564. The building was designed by architect [[Diego de Ria\u00f1o]], who supervised its construction from 1527 until his death in 1534. He was succeeded by Juan S\u00e1nchez, who built the arcade which now connects the building with the ''Plaza Nueva'', and later on by [[Hern\u00e1n Ruiz the Younger]], one of the most accomplished architects of the Plateresque style.<ref>{{cite book|title=Arquitectura renacentista.

Construction of the building began in 1546, as a legacy of Fadrique Enr\u00edquez de Ribera, who had died in 1539. It was designed by the architect Mart\u00edn de Gainza, who supervised its construction until his death in 1556. Two years later, Hern\u00e1n Ruiz II took charge. The hospital was dedicated, although still incomplete, in 1558.\n\n[[File:Fachada iglesia anunciaci\u00f3n 001.jpg|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of the Church of the Annunciation]]\nThe College of the Annunciation of the Professed House of the  [[Society of Jesus]] in Seville was one of the intellectual pillars of the Spanish [[Counter-Reformation]], and also served as a starting point for Jesuit expansion in overseas lands. The building of the Professed House, where the university was installed from 31 December 1771, had been the first residence owned by the Jesuits in Seville. It was founded in February 1558, and work on the church, dedicated to the Annunciation, began in 1565.\n\nThe Jesuit supervisor of the House, the architect Bartolome de Bustamante (1501\u20131570), drew the original plans and the architect [[Hern\u00e1n Ruiz the Younger]] continued the project to its completion in 1568. At first it housed a College for the Humanities, but as early as 1590 it had become the Professed House, a residence for those Jesuits who preached. The Jesuits were expelled from Seville in the 18th century and the building became the seat of the University of Seville in 1771.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aguilar Pi\u00f1al|first=Francisco|title=History of the University of Seville|year=1992|publisher=University of Seville|isbn=84-7405-826-0|pages=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1bJ9F4G4BUC |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title= History of the University of Seville|last= Aguilar Pi\u00f1al|first=Francisco| page=104| year=1992| isbn= 84-7405-826-0 }}</ref> The original structure was torn down in [[Francoist Spain]], but the residence's patio porticoed with marble columns is preserved in the modern Faculty of Fine Arts of the university.

There are some important paintings in the main altarpiece, including ''The Annunciation'' by [[Antonio Mohedano]], and the ''Exaltation of the name of Jesus'' or ''Circumcision'' by [[Juan de Roelas]].\n\n[[File:Antigua Audiencia de Sevila.jpg|thumb|The Royal Audiencia of Seville]]\nThe Royal Audiencia of Seville (Real Audiencia de los Grados de Sevilla) was a court of the Crown of Castile, established in 1525 during the reign of Charles I. It had judicial powers as an appeals court in civil and criminal cases, but had no powers of government. The building that housed the Audiencia of Seville is located in the Plaza de San Francisco de Sevilla, and is currently the headquarters of the financial institution Cajasol. The building was built between 1595 and 1597, although justice had been administered earlier in another building at the same place called the Casa Cuadra since shortly after the reconquest of the city in 1248. The building has been renovated several times.\n\nThe Royal Mint of Seville ''(Casa de la Moneda)'', built 1585\u20131587, was the circulation center where gold and silver from the New world were smelted into the [[Spanish maraved\u00ed]]s and [[doubloon]]s that flowed into and helped support the general European economy in the 16th century, the age of the New World conquistadores and Seville in its full splendor.\n\n[[File:SevillaCasaPilatosPatioPrincipal.jpg|thumb|left|Main patio of the [[Casa de Pilatos]] ]]\nThe [[Casa de Pilatos]] ''(Pilate's House)'' serves as the permanent residence of the [[Victoria Eugenia, 18th Duchess of Medinaceli|Dukes of Medinaceli]]. The building is a mixture of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] Italian and [[Mud\u00e9jar]] Spanish styles. It is considered the prototype of the Andalusian palace. The construction of this palace, which is adorned with precious [[azulejos]] tiles and well-kept gardens, was begun by Pedro Enr\u00edquez de Qui\u00f1ones, [[Adelantado|Adelantado Mayor]] of Andalus\u00eda, and his wife Catalina de Rivera, founder of the Casa de Alcal\u00e1, and completed by Pedro's son Fadrique Enr\u00edquez de Rivera, the first Marquis of Tarifa.\n\nThe writer [[Miguel de Cervantes]] lived primarily in Seville between 1596 and 1600. Because of financial problems, Cervantes worked as a purveyor for the Spanish Armada, and later as a tax collector. In 1597, discrepancies in his accounts of the three years previous landed him in the Royal Prison of Seville for a short time.\n''[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]'', a popular comedy among his works, features two young vagabonds who come to Seville, attracted by the riches and disorder that the 16th-century commerce with the Americas had brought to that metropolis.\n\n===17th and 18th Centuries===\n[[File:PesteSevilla.jpg|thumb|right|17th century anonymous painting depicting the 1649 plague]]\nIn the 17th century Seville fell into a deep economic and urban decline as a consequence of the general economic crisis that struck Europe and Spain in particular.<ref name=\"Brown1998\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Brown|title=Painting in Spain: 1500-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxhDegm5N7oC&pg=PA200|year=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-06474-2|page=200}}</ref> This decline was aggravated in Seville by river floods and the great plague of 1649, which may have killed some 60,000 people, nearly half of the existing population of 130,000.<ref name=\"Ort\u00edz1984\">{{cite book|author=Antonio Dom\u00ednguez Ort\u00edz|title=Historia de Sevilla: la Sevilla del siglo XVII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DS5pAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 January 2013|year=1984|publisher=Secretariado de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Sevilla|page=74}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Oca\u00f1a |first=Juan Carlos |title=La Espa\u00f1a del Barroco: Evoluci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y social en el siglo XVII |url=http://www.historiasiglo20.org/HE/7e.htm/La%20Espa%C3%B1a%20del%20Barroco%20historiasiglo20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208121222/http://www.historiasiglo20.org/HE/7e.htm/La%20Espa%C3%B1a%20del%20Barroco%20historiasiglo20 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 December 2015 |work=Historia siglo 20 El sitio web de la historia del siglo XX |publisher=Historia siglo 20{{!}} |accessdate=7 January 2014 |language=Spanish |year=2005 }}</ref> Also at this time the spirit of the [[Counter-Reformation]] manifested itself, the Catholic revival transforming Seville into a city of religious convents. By 1671 there were 45 monasteries for monks and 28 convents for women in the city\u2014with all the major orders, Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians and Jesuits, represented in them. This was the social setting of the Holy Week (Semana Santa) processions which had culminated in the Cathedral since Cardinal [[Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara]] issued the mandates of the Synod of 1604, and the origin of the \"[[Holy Week in Seville#La Carrera Oficial (The Official Path)|Carrera Oficial]]\", or Official Path, to the Cathedral.\n\nThe devastation caused by the plague of 1649 is depicted in an anonymous canvas in the Hospital del Pozo Santo. Seville's population was halved, a heavy blow to the local economy. One of the plague's most notable victims was the sculptor Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s. Discontent spread in the social fabric of Sevillian life, especially among the poor, who rioted in 1652 over the scarcity and high price of bread.\n\nBy the late 17th century, the ''Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n'' had fallen into bureaucratic deadlock, and the empire as a whole was failing because of Spain's inability to finance wars on the Continent and a global empire at the same time. In the 18th century, the new [[Bourbon Reforms|Bourbon kings]] reduced the power of Seville and the ''Casa de Contratacion''. In 1717 they moved the ''Casa'' from Seville to the more suitable harbour of [[C\u00e1diz]], diminishing Seville's importance in international trade.  [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] further limited the powers of the Casa and his son, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], abolished it altogether in 1790.\n\n====The Baroque golden age of Sevillian painting in the 1600s====\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain - Vel\u00e1zquez 1644.jpg|thumb|left|Philip IV of Spain, painted by Vel\u00e1zquez]]\nThe economic decline of this period was not accompanied by a corresponding decline of the arts. During the reign of the Habsburg king [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in the 17th century (1621\u20131665), there were effectively only two patrons of art in Spain\u2014the church and the king with his court. [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] was the artist favored by the church, while [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]] was patronised by the crown. The Baroque period of art emphasised exaggerated motion and clear detail to produce drama, exuberance, and grandeur. The popularity of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Catholic Church, which had decided, in response to the Protestant Reformation, that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement.<ref name=\"Gardner1996\">{{cite book|author=Helen Louise Gardner|title=Gardner's Art: Through the Ages|url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou1996gard|url-access=registration|edition=10|year=1996|publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers|isbn=978-0-15-501141-0|page=820}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish portrait artist, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660), generally acknowledged as one of the greatest painters of all time, was born in Seville, and lived there for his first twenty-two years. He studied under [[Francisco Herrera the Elder|Francisco de Herrera]] till he was twelve, and then was apprenticed to his future father-in-law [[Francisco Pacheco]], an active artist and teacher, for six years. By the time he went to Madrid in 1622 his position and reputation were assured.\n[[File:Diego Vel\u00e1zquez Autorretrato 45 x 38 cm - Colecci\u00f3n Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos - Museo de Bellas Artes de Valencia.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]\n\n[[Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n|Zurbar\u00e1n]] (1598\u20131664) is known for his religious paintings depicting monks, nuns, and martyred saints, and for his still lifes. Zurbar\u00e1n was called the ''Spanish [[Caravaggio]]'' for his mastery of the realistic use of [[chiaroscuro]]. In 1614 his father sent him to [[Seville]] to apprentice for three years with Pedro D\u00edaz de Villanueva. ''The Apotheosis of St. Thomas Aquinas'' is Zurbar\u00e1n's most highly regarded work; he painted this starkly realistic masterpiece at the height of his career.<ref>G\u00e1llego and Gudiol 1987, p. 13.</ref>\nZurbar\u00e1n made his career in Seville, and in about 1630 he was appointed painter to Philip IV.

He spent two periods of a few years in Madrid, but lived and worked mostly in Seville. He began his art studies under [[Juan del Castillo]], and became familiar with [[Flemish painting]]; the great commercial importance of Seville at the time ensured that he was also exposed to influences from other regions. As his painting developed, his works evolved towards the polished style that suited the bourgeois and aristocratic tastes of the time, demonstrated especially in his religious works. In 1642, at the age of 26, he moved to [[Madrid]], where he most likely became familiar with the work of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], and would have seen the work of Venetian and Flemish masters in the royal collections. In 1660, he returned to Seville, where he died twenty-two years later. Here he was one of the founders of the [[Academia de Bellas Artes (Seville)|Academia de Bellas Artes]] (Academy of Art), sharing its direction, in 1660, with the architect [[Francisco Herrera the Younger]]. This was his period of greatest activity, and he received numerous important commissions.\n\n[[File:Bbaasvq.jpg|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville]]\n[[Juan de Vald\u00e9s Leal]] (1622\u20131690) was born in Seville in 1622, and distinguished himself as a painter, sculptor, and architect. He studied under Antonio del Castillo. In 1660 Vald\u00e9s co-founded the Academia de Bellas Artes with Murillo and Francisco Herrera the Younger. Murillo was the preeminent Sevillian painter of the time and was chosen as president of the academy. After the death of Murillo in 1682, Vald\u00e9s established himself as the foremost painter in Sevilla. Among his works are ''History of the Prophet Elias'' for the church of the Carmelites, ''Martyrdom of St. Andrew'' for the church of San Francesco in C\u00f3rdoba, and ''Triumph of the Cross for la Caridad'' in Seville. He died in Seville.\n\nThe [[Museum of Fine Arts of Seville]] ''(Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla)'' houses a choice selection of works by artists from the Golden Age of Sevillian painting during the 17th century, including masterpieces by the above-mentioned masters.\n\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez - Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s (Museo del Prado, 1635-36).jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Portrait of Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s|Portrait of Monta\u00f1\u00e9s]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1636]]\n[[Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s]] (1568\u20131649), known as ''el Dios de la Madera'' (\"the God of Wood\"),<ref>Nash 2005, p. 23</ref> was one of the most important figures of the [[Sevillian school of sculpture]]. In the final quarter of the 16th century, Monta\u00f1\u00e9s made his residence in Seville; it would be his base throughout his long life and career. The greatest and most characteristic sculptor of the school of Seville, he produced many important altarpieces and sculptures for numerous places in Spain and the Americas. His works include the great altar at Santa Clara in Seville, the ''Concepci\u00f3n'' and the realistic figure of Christ Crucified in ''Cristo de la Clemenc\u00eca''  in the sacristy of Seville cathedral; and the highly realistic polychromed wood head and hands of [[St Ignatius of Loyola]] and of [[St Francis Xavier]] in the church of the University of Seville, where the costumed figures were used in celebrations.\n\n[[File:SemanaSantaSevillaEstudiantes3.jpg|thumb|200px|De Mesa's ''Cristo de la Buena Muerte'' on display during Semana Santa in 2006]]\n[[Juan de Mesa]] (1583\u20131627) was the creator of several of the effigies that are still used in the processions of ''[[Holy Week in Seville|Semana Santa]]'', including the ''Cristo del Amor'', ''Jesus del Gran Poder'' and ''Cristo de la Buena Muerte''. Some of Seville's grandest churches were built in the Baroque period, several of them with retables (altar-pieces) created by accomplished artists; many of the traditional rituals and customs of Holy Week still observed in Seville, including the display of venerated images, date from this time.\n\nAt the heart of the ''Semana Santa'' (Holy Week) processions are the religious brotherhoods ''(Hermandades y Cofrad\u00edas de Penitencia)'', associations of Catholic laypersons organised to perform public acts of religious observance, in this case acts related to the Passion and death of Jesus Christ and done as a public penance. The ''hermandades'' and ''cofrad\u00edas'' (brotherhoods and confraternities) organise the processions during which members precede the ''pasos'' dressed in penitential robes, and, with a few exceptions, hoods.\n\nThe ''pasos'' at the centre of each procession are images or sets of images placed atop a movable float of wood. If a brotherhood has three ''pasos'', the first one would be a sculpted scene of the Passion, or an allegorical scene, known as a ''misterio'' (mystery); the second an image of Christ; and the third an image of the Virgin Mary, known as a ''dolorosa''.\n\n[[File:San Telmo 001.jpg|thumb|left|275px|General view of the Palace of San Telmo in 2010 after restoration by architect Guillermo V\u00e1zquez Consuegra]]\nThe Seminary School of the University of Navigators ''(Colegio Seminario de la Universidad de Mareantes)'' was founded in 1681 by the Spanish Crown during the reign of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] to \"...house, bring up and educate orphaned and abandoned boys for service in the navy and fleets of the Indies\". The crown commissioned the building of the [[Palace of San Telmo]] (Palacio de San Telmo), named after St. Telmo, the patron saint of sailors, as its seat. This was designed in an exuberant Spanish baroque style by the local architect Leonardo de Figueroa and Mat\u00edas and Antonio Mat\u00edas, his son and grandson. This emblem of Seville's civil architecture of the period has since been used for various purposes. It was the residence of the [[Duchy of Montpensier|Dukes of Montpensier]] in the 19th century. During most of the 20th century it was the provincial Seminary, and finally, since 1989, it has been home to the Presidency of the Andalusian Autonomous Government ''(Junta de Andaluc\u00eda)''.\n\nIn May 1700, at the beginning of the century of enlightenment and scientific discovery, the Royal Society of Philosophy and Medicine of Seville was founded in Seville, the first of its kind in Spain.

One of the first large industrial building projects in modern Europe, the Royal Tobacco Factory is among the most notable and splendid examples of industrial architecture from the era of Spain's Antiguo R\u00e9gimen. By a Royal Order in 1725 the former tobacco factory was transferred to its current location on land adjacent to the Palace of San Telmo, just outside the Puerta de Jerez (a gate in the city walls). Construction began in 1728, and proceeded intermittently for the next 30 years.

The stone fa\u00e7ades are modulated by pilasters on pedestals.<ref name=\"Pozo Ruiz\" /> This 18th-century industrial building was, at the time it was built, the second largest building in Spain, after the royal residence [[El Escorial]]. It remains one of the largest and most architecturally distinguished industrial buildings ever built in that country, and one of the oldest such buildings to survive.\n\nSeville became the dean of the Spanish provincial press in 1758 with the publication of its first newspaper, the ''Hebdomario \u00fatil de Seville'', the first to be printed in Spain outside Madrid.\n\n==Modern Era==\n[[File:Plano de Sevilla 1860.jpeg|250px|thumb|Map of Seville in 1860]]\n\n===19th Century===\nThe year 1800 in Seville saw an epidemic of yellow fever which spread over the entire city in four months, wiping out a third of the population.

Soon discovering how weak the city's defences were, the new Junta absconded as well on 28 January. Anti-Napoleon sentiment was still widespread and the mob remained defiant yet disorganised. When the vanguard of the French troops appeared on 29 January they were fired upon, but the municipal corporation of Seville negotiated a surrender to avoid bloodshed. On 1 February, Marshal Claude Victor occupied the city, accompanied by the pretender to the Spanish throne, [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (Jos\u00e9 I), elder brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rickard|first=J|title=French invasion of Andalusia French invasion of Andalusia, January\u2013February 1810|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/campaign_french_andalusia.html|date=9 April 2008}}</ref> The French settled in until 27 August 1812, when they were forced to retreat by Anglo-Spanish counterattacks; [[Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]] looted numerous valuable works of art in the interim.\n\nBetween 1825 and 1833 Melchor Cano acted as chief architect in Seville, most of the urban planning policy and architectural modifications of the city being made by him and his collaborator Jose Manuel Arjona y Cuba.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Antig\u00fcedad del Castillo-Olivares|first=Mar\u00eda Dolores|title=El arquitecto Melchor Cano y la teor\u00eda de la ciudad.

The exhibition buildings were constructed in [[Mar\u00eda Luisa Park]] along the [[Guadalquivir River]]. A majority of the buildings were built to remain permanently after the closing of the exposition. Many of the foreign buildings, including the United States exhibition building, were to be used as consulates after the closing of the exhibits. By the opening of the exposition all of the buildings were complete, although many were no longer new. Not long before the opening, the Spanish government also began a modernization of the city in order to prepare for the expected crowds by erecting new hotels and widening the mediaeval streets to allow for the movement of automobiles.\n\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Seville BW 2015-10-23 15-35-15.jpg|thumb|left|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]\nSpain spent millions of [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] in developing its exhibits for the fair and constructed elaborate buildings to hold them.

In Seville the Republican Socialists got 57% of the votes versus 39% for the Monarchist coalition. As a result, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] went into exile and proclaimed the Second Republic.\n[[File:Fotograf\u00eda del Jefe Territorial de la Falange Espa\u00f1ola Sancho D\u00e1vila y Fern\u00e1ndez de Celis en Sevilla saludando desde el balc\u00f3n de la casa cuartel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.80|A group of falangists making the [[fascist salute]] from a city balcony in September 1936.]]\nThe convulsions of the [[Spanish Civil War]] were fully felt in the Andalusian capital, where since February 1936 the military had been planning a coup. On July 18 General [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] quickly gained control of the 2nd ''Divisi\u00f3n Org\u00e1nica'', arresting a number of other officers.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936\u20131939 |first=Antony |last=Beevor |authorlink=Antony Beevor|location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |origyear=1982|year=2006|page=59 |isbn=0297848321}}</ref>  In poor neighbourhoods such as Triana and La Macarena the unions and leftist parties mobilised militias but Queipo defeated them by a combination of superior weaponry, cunning and harsh repression. Seville was thus occupied by the rebels along with Cadiz and Algeciras, providing General [[Francisco Franco]], Chief of the General Staff, sufficient ground to safely move the ''Ej\u00e9rcito de \u00c1frica'' (Army of Africa) to Andalusia by air. Seville then became a rearguard city, acting as a bridgehead for the occupation of the rest of the peninsula by the Army of Africa, being the most populous of all the cities occupied by the partisan army. Repression in the city between July 18, 1936 and January 1937 caused the deaths of 3,028 people, including the mayor, Horacio Hermoso Araujo, the Republican former mayor Joseph Gonzalez Fernandez de Labandera, and the president of the Provincial Council, Jos\u00e9 Manuel de los Santos Puelles. Altogether some 8,000 civilians were shot by the Nationalists in Seville during the course of the war.\n\n====Francoist Spain (1939-1975)====\nOn 1 October 1936, in [[Burgos]], Franco was publicly proclaimed as ''[[General\u00edsimo]]'' of the National army and ''Jefe del Estado'' ([[Head of State]]), by the coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Hugh|title=The Spanish Civil War|year=1986|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York|pages=424|edition=3rd}}</ref>  In [[Francoist Spain]] the most powerful officials in Seville and the province were: the military authority embodied in the person occupying the Captaincy General of the Second Military Region, the Civil Government represented by the Provincial Chief of the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' (Nationalist movement), and the archbishop of the Diocese of Seville. The mayors of the city during this period were directly appointed by the Minister of the Interior, usually those nominated by these military, political and religious authorities.\n\nUnder Francisco Franco's rule Spain was officially neutral in World War II (although it did collaborate with the [[Axis powers]]),<ref name=\"Payne2008\">{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

One of the most significant events of this period occurred on 13 March 1941 with the explosion of the gunpowder stored in the magazine of Santa Barbara, located in the ''Cerro del Aguila'' (Eagle Hill), destroying ten surrounding blocks and damaging many more. Calle Jos\u00e9 Arpa, where the depot was located, was destroyed, as well as the streets Huesca, Galicia, Lisbon, Afan de Ribera and part of H\u00e9roes de Toledo. The magazine was not a military facility, but belonged to the ''Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Explosivos'' (Spanish Society of Explosives).\n\nIn 1953, during the full [[autarky]] of Franco, the shipyard of Seville was opened, eventually employing more than 2,000 workers in the 1970s despite the production of the larger vessels demanded by the maritime market being hindered by the shallowness of the Guadalquivir River.\n\nBefore the existence of wetlands regulation in the Guadalquivir basin, Seville suffered regular heavy flooding; perhaps worst of all were the floods that occurred in November 1961 when the river Tamarguillo overflowed as a result of a prodigious downpour of rain in which three hundred litres of water per square metre fell in a short period.<ref name=\"PfisterBr\u00e1zdil2013\">{{cite book|author1=Christian Pfister|author2=Rudolf Br\u00e1zdil|author3=R\u00fcdiger Glaser|title=Climatic Variability in Sixteenth-Century Europe and Its Social Dimension|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLjUBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA272|date=14 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-94-015-9259-8|page=272}}</ref> Entire neighbourhoods were inundated: La Calzada, Cerro del \u00c1guila, San Bernardo, El Fontanal, Tiro de L\u00ednea, and La Puerta de Jerez, the waters penetrating as far as La Campana. Seville was consequently declared a disaster zone. A month later, so many Sevillians were still homeless that the popular radio host Bobby Deglan\u00e9 organised a relief motorcade from Madrid, the so-called 'Operaci\u00f3n Clavel' (Operation Clavel), which ended in tragedy with the crash of a chartered aeroplane leading the way to publicise the event.<ref name=\"Gilmore1998\">{{cite book|author=David D.

The next fifteen years saw the largest urban expansion of the city yet, with the reconstruction of many neighbourhoods, the upper middle class barrio of ''Los Remedios'' exemplifying this urban redevelopment; the [[Seville Fair]], previously held at the ''Prado de San Sebasti\u00e1n'', was moved there in 1973.\n\nTrade unionism in Seville began during the 1960s with the underground organizational activities of the Workers' Commissions or ''Comisiones Obreras'' (CCOO), in factories such as Hytasa, the Astilleros shipyards, Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n, etc. Several of the movement's leaders were imprisoned in Spain in the Process 1001 of November 1973 by the courts of the ''[[Tribunal de Orden P\u00fablico]]'', including Fernando Soto, Eduardo Saborido, and Francisco Acosta.\n\n====Democratic era====\nOn 3 April 1979 Spain held its first democratic municipal elections after the end of Francoist Spain; councillors representing four different political parties were elected in Seville: the Union of the Democratic Centre or ''Uni\u00f3n de Centro Democr\u00e1tico'' (UCD) won nine councilors, the Andalusian Party or ''Partido Andalucista'' (PA) won eight, the Spanish Socialist Party or ''Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol'' (PSOE) won eight as well and the Communist Party of Spain or ''Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a'' (PCE) won six. As no party achieved a sufficient majority to govern, a coalition government was formed, with power shared between the PSA, the PSOE and the PCE. The coalition elected Councilman Luis Uru\u00f1uela of the Partido Andalucista as mayor.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1996 the Sevillian politician Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez held the Presidency of the Government of Spain.\n\nOn 5 November 1982, Pope John Paul II arrived in Seville to officiate at a Mass before more than half a million people at the fairgrounds and celebrate the beatification of Sister (''Sor'' in Spanish) Angela de la Cruz, founder of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Cross. He visited the city again 13 June 1993, for the International Eucharistic Congress.\n\n[[File:Puente de la Barqueta noche.jpg|thumb|The [[Puente de la Barqueta]] (Barqueta Bridge) at dusk]]\nIn 1992, the [[Seville Expo '92|Universal Exposition]] was held for six months in Seville, on the occasion of which the local communications network infrastructure was greatly improved: the SE-30 beltway around the city was completed, new highways were constructed, the new Santa Justa train station had opened in 1991 and the Spanish High Speed Rail system, the ''Alta Velocidad Espa\u00f1ola'' (AVE), began to operate between Madrid-Seville. The Seville airport, the '' Aeropuerto de Sevilla'', was expanded with a new terminal building designed by the architect [[Rafael Moneo]], and various other improvements were made. The monumental ''[[Puente del Alamillo]]'' (Alamillo Bridge) over the Guadalquivir, designed by the architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], was built to allow access to the island of La Cartuja, site of the massive exposition, as was the ''[[Puente de la Barqueta]]'' (Barqueta Bridge) designed by Juan J. Arenas and Marcos J. Pantaler\u00f3n that now connects the historic center of Seville with the technology park. Some of the installations remaining after the exposition at the massive site on La Cartuja island were converted into the largest technology park in Andalusia: the Scientific and Technological Park Cartuja 93. The greenspace and artificial lakes of the Alamillo Park are a legacy of the exposition as well; the present theme park, [[Isla M\u00e1gica]], is a re-purposing of the Lago de Espa\u00f1a zone of the exposition.\n[[File:Calatrava Puente del Alamillo Seville.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puente del Alamillo]] at night, designed for the [[Seville Expo '92]] by [[Santiago Calatrava]] ]]\n\nThroughout the decade there were several attacks in Seville by the Basque separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] resulting in deaths. On 30 January 1998, the deputy mayor of Seville and member of the People's Party, Alberto Jim\u00e9nez-Becerril Barrio and his wife, Ascension Garcia Ortiz, attorney of the courts of Seville, were assassinated at their home, leaving three children; in October 2000 the military physician Colonel Antonio Mu\u00f1oz Cari\u00f1anos was shot dead in his own office. These killings provoked great consternation in the city and led to massive demonstrations against ETA violence.\n\n===21st Century===\nSeville began the century under the leadership of the socialist Mayor Alfredo Sanchez Monteseir\u00edn (PSOE), who had held the position of alderman since June 1999 with support from the PA, the PP being the largest party. In 2003 he was again invested as mayor, winning this time as the candidate with the most popular votes but not an absolute majority, and in this case supported by the councilors of the United Left. The outcome of the elections in May 2007 validated the progressive pact of the (PSOE-IU), surpassing the number of votes submitted by the People's Party (PP) or the Andalusian Party (PA), leaving the latter without representation in the council and the PP with the most votes of all the parties represented in the Consistorio. Thus S\u00e1nchez Monteseir\u00edn ranks as the first mayor in the history of democracy in Seville to serve three times on the city council in power, despite having been only once the candidate with the most votes from the electorate and the filing of corruption charges of illegal financing through the issue of false invoices.\n\nIn June 2002 a summit of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union was held in Seville, chaired by the then acting president of the European Union and the Spanish president, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar. The meeting was protested with a series of actions and peaceful mass demonstrations by alternative and anti-capitalist political action groups.\n\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3nLaPlatadesdelacalle.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to the [[Seville Metro]]]]\nIn 2003, construction of Line 1 of the [[Seville Metro|''Metro de Sevilla'']] was reinitiated, having been canceled in 1983 due to technical difficulties in the subsurface excavation, with cracks appearing in several historic buildings in the city. The project was restarted in 1999 on a different layout to the original, focussing less on urban locations and more on the broader metropolitan area; the work resumed with an intense effort by the ''Sociedad Metro de Sevilla'' (Society of Metro Seville), driven by Andalucista Alejandro Rojas-Marcos and local government to complete the construction of the metro. The completion of its four lines will be a milestone in the history of the communications-saturated metropolitan area of Seville.\n\nIn 2004 the Sevillian brewer Cruzcampo celebrated its centenary, organizing numerous public events and advertising campaigns to celebrate the anniversary. Also in 2004 the conservative newspaper ABC, founded in 1929 by Torcuato Luca de Tena, marked its 75th anniversary in the Seville edition.\n\n2005 marked the centenary of Sevilla FC (Sevilla Football Club) and in 2007 of the Real Betis Balompi\u00e9 club.\n\nWork on the Metro Line 1 should have been completed by June 2006, but changes in layout, unanticipated archaeological finds, problems with tunneling and shafts, and work stoppages of various kinds prompted the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda to not set any date prior to 2008 for its inauguration and shuffle the projected date of full operation to early 2009.\n\nIn February 2007 the bidding process started for works of the remaining lines (2, 3 and 4) to complete the projected metro network; the regional government of Andalusia ''(Junta de Andaluc\u00eda)'' and the national government being responsible for funding Lines 2 and 3 of the metropolitan layout and the city of Seville responsible for financing construction of the urban Line 4. The metro will include tram lines\u2014the Metrocentro in the center of the city, the tram Aljarafe, and the tram Alcala de Guadaira\u2014all connected with Metro Line 1 to provide a comprehensive transportation system.\n[[File:Metropol parasol 02042011 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Setas]]\n[[File:Torre Sevilla abril 2015.jpg|thumbnail|upright|[[Torre Sevilla|Torre Peigi]], near Guadalquivir river]]\nThe empowerment of local lines will be emphasised as well with rail ringing the city, and new connections to the North Aljarafe (Sanlucar la Mayor, etc.). In 2007 and 2008, major media attention-grabbing projects included: the building of a network of bike paths that made Seville the city with the most miles of bike lanes in Spain; the pedestrianization of the Plaza Nueva and Constitution Avenue (next to the Cathedral); the operationalising of the Metrocentro tram that links the Prado de San Sebasti\u00e1n with the aforementioned Plaza Nueva; the construction of the [[C\u00e9sar Pelli]]-designed office tower (scheduled to be finished in 2013) as headquarters for the newly formed Cajasol bank; the international award-winning architectural project \"The setas\"; the redevelopment in the [[La Alameda, Seville|Alameda de Hercules]], and planned upgrades to the gardens and port along the Paseo de las Delicias, the port being redeveloped to accommodate more visits by cruise ships to the city; and a new aquarium, the New World Aquarium at ''Muelle de Las Delicias''.\n\nAlthough Los Astilleros, the Seville shipyard, closed in late 2011<ref name=Astilleros2011>{{cite news|title=Entran en liquidaci\u00f3n los Astilleros de Sevilla con la extinci\u00f3n de contratos|url=http://www.canalsur.es/portal_rtva/web/noticia/id/183859/portada/astilleros_de_sevilla_cierra_tras_60_anos_de_actividad|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=Informativos Canal Sur|date=31 December 2011}}</ref>  after suffering financial<ref>{{cite news|last=Montenegro|first=Raquel|title=Astilleros suma una deuda de 280 millones de euros entre Huelva y Sevilla|url=http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/economia/540116/astilleros/suma/una/deuda/millones/euros/entre/huelva/y/sevilla.html|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=Diario de Sevilla|date=16 October 2009|language=Spanish}}</ref>  and labor<ref>{{cite news|author=R.E.|title=Astilleros de Sevilla presenta un ERE para despedir a 183 trabajadores|url=http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/economia/689161/astilleros/sevilla/presenta/ere/para/despedir/trabajadores.html|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=Diario de Sevilla|date=29 April 2010|language=Spanish}}</ref>  difficulties, Seville's economy is steadily improving with a mix of tourism, commerce, technology and industry.\n\n== Population ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{"title_page": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1919 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 11th. It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros.

Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities. The Newton v North Shore match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Ponsonby v Maritime match on Auckland Domain 1. When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = Iles 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.

It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

the opponent.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = A Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Isles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = A Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities.

When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = Iles 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.
