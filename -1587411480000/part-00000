Clive was born on 28 August 1879 in Blaenavon in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]. Clive studied for a medical career, and had completed four years of medical studies at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] before switching his focus to acting at age 22. Touring the provinces for a decade, Clive became an expert at virtually every sort of regional dialect in the British Isles. He moved to the U.S. in 1912, where after working in the [[Orpheum Circuit, Inc.|Orpheum]] [[vaudeville]] circuit he set up his own stock company in [[Boston]]. By the 1920s, his company was operating in Hollywood; among his repertory players were such up-and-comers as [[Rosalind Russell]]. He also worked at the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] in several plays. Clive's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that he acted in  \"1,159 Legitimate Plays Before Going Into Moving Pictures\".<ref name=obit/>\n\nE.E. Clive made his film debut as a village police constable in 1933's ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' with [[Claude Rains]], then spent the next seven years showing up in wry supporting and bit parts, where he often portrayed comical versions of English stereotypes. He often played butlers, reporters, aristocrats, shopkeepers and cabbies during his short film career. Though his roles were often small, Clive was a well-known and prolific character actor of his time. Among his best-known roles was the incompetent [[Burgomaster]] in [[James Whale]]'s horror classic ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935).

One of Clive's last roles was Sir William Lucas in the 1940 literature adaption ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) with [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Greer Garson]]. \n\nE.E.

The new G/O management was more demanding of what content the sites carried, which resulted in a major incident at ''[[Deadspin]]'', the network's sports-oriented site, in October 2019 leading to the firing of its editor in chief and subsequent quitting of most of the remaining editorial staff.<ref name=\"wapost\"/> This propagated across the other former Gawker sites, including ''Kotaku''.

It grows in small patches with up to 10 mm long and 3 mm wide, 3-20 pairs of leaves. The stem is usually green to orange-red or dark reddish-brown. The central strand in the stem is hardly differentiated. The leaves are very contorted when dry, 2\u20136 times as long as wide, the leaves are lingulate to narrowly lanceolate with concave sides at the apex. F.limbatus leaves also have cells that are \u00b1 bulging (seen on the upper leaf cells) that could only be observed in cross-section.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Erzberger|first=Peter|date=2016|title=The genus Fissidens (Fissidentaceae, Bryophyta) in Hungary|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.17110/StudBot.2016.47.1.41|journal=STUDIA BOTANICA HUNGARICA|language=en|volume=47|pages=41\u2013139|issn=0301-7001}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Gametophyte]] ===\nThis species, like the rest of the ''[[Fissidens]]'' genus, is identified by its leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stem and are half-clinging the stem and the rear leaf towards the stem tip. The leaves are unique among other mosses as it has leaves with pocket-like flaps (common name Pocket Moss). The size of the [[gametophyte]] is a few millimetres long (measured as the length of the shoot). Sterile stems are often longer than fertile shoots, and plants from caves can produce long shoots with many leaf pairs. Most of the time, the lamina in F.limbatus is unistratose; however, it is partially bistratose occasionally.\n\n==== Leaf Structure ====\nEach leaf usually divided into three different parts:\n\n# The vaginant laminae (or lamina vera) is a boat-shaped or sheathing part of the leaf. The central cells of [[vaginant lamina]] somewhat more regularly arranged than ventral and dorsal laminae. The cells in this section are a little longer than wide, up to 12 micrometres wide.\n# The ventral lamina (or the apical lamina): the part of the leaf apical to the vaginant laminae on the upper side of the [[costa]]. The central cells of apical and dorsal laminae are unistratose and smooth, up to 12 micrometres wide, hexagonal-rhomboidal shaped with thin walls and no marginal thickenings.\n# The dorsal lamina is the section of the leaf edge opposite the sheathing part and the ventral lamina, extending the total length of the leaf on the backside of the costa. Dorsal lamina is not decurrent, mostly decreased to extinction at the leaf base.\n\n==== [[Leaf margin]] ====\n[[File:F.limbatus leaf.png|thumb|''F.limbatus'' Leaf Poket ]]\nAnother critical characteristic of the ''Fissidens limbatus'' leaf is the margin, which is formed by a border called the [[limbidium]]: long, narrow, incrassate cells. These cells in F,limbatus are unistratose to bistratose. Furthermore, sometimes, the limbidium enters the sheathing part (vaginant lamina), which means that the border cells are separated from the margin by a row of [[Chlorophyllase|chlorophyllose]] cells. This is called an intralaminar or [[intramarginal limbidium]]. The limbidium also connects with the costa at the leaf tip (leaf apex), forming an apiculus, or ending a few cells before the apex. The costa could be up to 25 micrometres at the base (per-current).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== [[Rhizoid|Rhizoids]] ====\nRhizoids are usually limited to the bottom of stems and brown in colour \u00b1 smooth rhizoids. Sometimes, [[papillose]] rhizoids have been reported to occur in F.limbatus.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== [[Sporophyte]] ===\n[[File:Fissidens crispus 3c.jpg|thumb|''Fissidens limbatus'' Sull. Sporophyte ]]\nThe synoicous in F.limbatus could be autoicous or dioicous. The [[Archegonium|archegonia]] could grow up to 240 \u03bcm long when the shoot is autoicous; whereas, the [[Antheridium|antheridia]] that are carried on short basal branches or unusually small axillary buds, its length range between 120\u2013180 \u03bcm. Sporophytes are common in this moss and observed most of the time.  \n\nThe seta is yellowish-red a few millimetres thick (2\u20136mm) often and ~9 mm long. \n\n==== [[Capsule]] ====\nThe sporangium capsule is very tiny 0.6-1 mm long that is erect or sometimes lightly curved, resembling a shape of an ellipsoid. The immature capsule of ''F.limbatus'' is green, and the operculum is fully enlarged and prominently enlarged above the annulus. The tip of the operculum is somewhat clear-green in colour. The capsule turns dark green to brown when maturing, except for the [[apophysis]], keeps it light green colour and the operculum that turns red as each sporocyte has experienced meiosis and has produced four spores at this time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Dale M.

It grows in small patches with up to 10 mm long and 3 mm wide, 3-20 pairs of leaves. The stem is usually green to orange-red or dark reddish-brown. The central strand in the stem is hardly differentiated. The leaves are very contorted when dry, 2\u20136 times as long as wide, the leaves are lingulate to narrowly lanceolate with concave sides at the apex. F.limbatus leaves also have cells that are \u00b1 bulging (seen on the upper leaf cells) that could only be observed in cross-section.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Erzberger|first=Peter|date=2016|title=The genus Fissidens (Fissidentaceae, Bryophyta) in Hungary|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.17110/StudBot.2016.47.1.41|journal=STUDIA BOTANICA HUNGARICA|language=en|volume=47|pages=41\u2013139|issn=0301-7001}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Gametophyte]] ===\nThis species, like the rest of the ''[[Fissidens]]'' genus, is identified by its leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stem and are half-clinging the stem and the rear leaf towards the stem tip. The leaves are unique among other mosses as it has leaves with pocket-like flaps (common name Pocket Moss). The size of the [[gametophyte]] is a few millimetres long (measured as the length of the shoot). Sterile stems are often longer than fertile shoots, and plants from caves can produce long shoots with many leaf pairs. Most of the time, the lamina in F.limbatus is unistratose; however, it is partially bistratose occasionally.\n\n==== Leaf Structure ====\nEach leaf usually divided into three different parts:\n\n# The vaginant laminae (or lamina vera) is a boat-shaped or sheathing part of the leaf. The central cells of [[vaginant lamina]] somewhat more regularly arranged than ventral and dorsal laminae. The cells in this section are a little longer than wide, up to 12 micrometres wide.\n# The ventral lamina (or the apical lamina): the part of the leaf apical to the vaginant laminae on the upper side of the [[costa]]. The central cells of apical and dorsal laminae are unistratose and smooth, up to 12 micrometres wide, hexagonal-rhomboidal shaped with thin walls and no marginal thickenings.\n# The dorsal lamina is the section of the leaf edge opposite the sheathing part and the ventral lamina, extending the total length of the leaf on the backside of the costa. Dorsal lamina is not decurrent, mostly decreased to extinction at the leaf base.\n\n==== [[Leaf margin]] ====\n[[File:F.limbatus leaf.png|thumb|''F.limbatus'' Leaf Poket ]]\nAnother critical characteristic of the ''Fissidens limbatus'' leaf is the margin, which is formed by a border called the [[limbidium]]: long, narrow, incrassate cells. These cells in F,limbatus are unistratose to bistratose. Furthermore, sometimes, the limbidium enters the sheathing part (vaginant lamina), which means that the border cells are separated from the margin by a row of [[Chlorophyllase|chlorophyllose]] cells. This is called an intralaminar or [[intramarginal limbidium]]. The limbidium also connects with the costa at the leaf tip (leaf apex), forming an apiculus, or ending a few cells before the apex. The costa could be up to 25 micrometres at the base (per-current).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== [[Rhizoid|Rhizoids]] ====\nRhizoids are usually limited to the bottom of stems and brown in colour \u00b1 smooth rhizoids. Sometimes, [[papillose]] rhizoids have been reported to occur in F.limbatus.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== [[Sporophyte]] ===\n[[File:Fissidens crispus 3c.jpg|thumb|''Fissidens limbatus'' Sull. Sporophyte ]]\nThe synoicous in F.limbatus could be autoicous or dioicous. The [[Archegonium|archegonia]] could grow up to 240 \u03bcm long when the shoot is autoicous; whereas, the [[Antheridium|antheridia]] that are carried on short basal branches or unusually small axillary buds, its length range between 120\u2013180 \u03bcm. Sporophytes are common in this moss and observed most of the time.  \n\nThe seta is yellowish-red a few millimetres thick (2\u20136mm) often and ~9 mm long. \n\n==== [[Capsule]] ====\nThe sporangium capsule is very tiny 0.6-1 mm long that is erect or sometimes lightly curved, resembling a shape of an ellipsoid. The immature capsule of ''F.limbatus'' is green, and the operculum is fully enlarged and prominently enlarged above the annulus. The tip of the operculum is somewhat clear-green in colour. The capsule turns dark green to brown when maturing, except for the [[apophysis]], keeps it light green colour and the operculum that turns red as each sporocyte has experienced meiosis and has produced four spores at this time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Dale M.
