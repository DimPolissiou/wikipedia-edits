He was the younger brother of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], the final [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]]. Thomas was appointed as Despot of the Morea by his oldest brother, Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]], in 1428, joining his two brothers and other despots [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] and Constantine, already governing the Morea. Though Theodore proved reluctant to cooperate with his brothers, Thomas and Constantine successfully worked to strengthen the despotate and expand its borders. In 1432, Thomas brought the remaining territories of the Latin [[Principality of Achaea]], established during the [[Fourth Crusade]] more than two hundred years earlier, into Byzantine hands by marrying [[Catherine Zaccaria]], daughter and heir to the principality.\n\nIn 1449, Thomas supported the ascension of his brother Constantine, who then became Emperor Constantine XI, to the throne despite the machinations of his other brother, [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], who himself desired the throne. After Constantine's rise to the throne, Demetrios was then assigned by Constantine to govern the Morea with Thomas but the two brothers found it difficult to cooperate, often quarreling with each other. In the aftermath of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and end of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1453, Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] allowed Thomas and Demetrios to continue to rule as Ottoman vassals in the Morea. Thomas hoped to turn the small despotate into a rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, hoping to gain support from the [[Papacy]] and [[Western Europe]]. Constant quarreling with Demetrios, who supported the Ottomans instead, eventually led Mehmed to invade and conquer the Morea in 1460.\n\nThomas and his family, including his wife Catherine and his three younger children [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]], [[Andreas Palaiologos|Andreas]] and [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]], escaped into exile to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]-held city of [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] and then to [[Corfu]], where Catherine and the children stayed. In the hopes of raising support for a crusade to restore his lands in the Morea, and possibly the Byzantine Empire itself, Thomas travelled to [[Rome]], where he was received and provided for by [[Pope Pius II]]. His hopes of retaking the Morea never materialized and he died in Rome on 12 May 1465. After his death, his claims were inherited by his oldest son Andreas, who also attempted to rally support for a campaign to restore the fallen despotate and the Byzantine Empire.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life and appointment as despot ===\n[[File:Manuel_II_Helena_sons.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Manuel_II_Helena_sons.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|Miniature from an early 15th-century manuscript depicting Thomas's father Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], his mother [[Helena Draga\u0161]] and his three oldest brothers [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]] (later Emperor John VIII), [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] and [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronikos]].]]\nAs the [[Byzantine Empire]] fell apart and fragmented over the course of the 14th century, the emperors of the Palaiologan dynasty came to feel that the only sure way to keep their remaining holdings intact was to grant them to their sons, receiving the title of [[Despot (court title)|despot]], as appanages to defend and govern.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=3}} Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] ({{Reign}}1391\u20131425) had a total of six sons who survived infancy. Manuel's eldest surviving son, [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]], was raised to co-emperor and designated to succeed Manuel as sole emperor upon his death. The second eldest son, [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] was designated as [[Despot of the Morea]] and the third eldest, [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronikos]], was made Despot of [[Thessaloniki]] in 1408 at just eight years old. Manuel's younger sons, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]], [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], and Thomas (the youngest, born in 1409, were kept in [[Constantinople]] as there was not sufficient land left to grant them. The younger children; Theodore, Andronikos, Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas were frequently described as having the distinction of [[Porphyrogennetos]] (\"born in the purple\"; born in the imperial palace during the reign of their father), a distinction that does not appear to have been shared by the emperor-to-be John.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=4}}\n\nRelations between the Palaiologos brothers were not always good. Though the young John and Constantine appears to have got on well with each other, relations between Constantine and the younger Demetrios and Thomas were not as friendly.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=4}} The complex relationships between the sons of Manuel II were put to the test when John, now Emperor John VIII, appointed Constantine as Despot of the Morea in 1428. Since his brother Theodore refused to step down from his role as despot, the despotate became governed by two members of the imperial family for the first time since its creation in 1349. Soon thereafter, the younger Thomas (aged 19) was also appointed as Despot of the Morea, meaning that the nominally undivided despotate had effectively disintegrated into three smaller principalities.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}}\n\nTheodore did not make way for Constantine or Thomas in the despotate's capital, [[Mystras]]. Instead, Theodore granted Constantine lands throughout the Morea, including the northern harbor town of [[Aigio]], fortresses and towns in [[Laconia]] (in the south), and [[Kalamata]] and [[Messenia]] in the west. Constantine made his capital as despot the town [[Glarentza]]. Meanwhile, Thomas was given lands in the north and based himself in the castle of [[Kalavryta]].{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}}\n\n=== Despot under the Byzantine Empire ===\n[[File:Bizancio1400AD-la.svg|left|thumb|Map of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1400. By the time Thomas became [[Despot of the Morea]] in 1428, his older brother [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] had already worked to expand the despotate's (the southern territory on the map) borders somewhat. It would be expanded to cover almost the entire [[Peloponnese]] by Thomas and his brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]].]]\nShortly after being appointed as despots, Constantine and Thomas, together with Theodore, decided to join forces in an attempt to seize the flourishing and strategic port of [[Patras]] in the north-west of the Morea, then under the rule of its Catholic Archbishop. The campaign, which was unsuccessful, possibly due to Theodore's reluctance to partake, was Thomas's first experience of war.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}} Constantine later captured Patras on his own, ending 225 of foreign ownership.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\n\nThomas's early tenure as Despot of the Morea was not without acquisitions either. For years, Thomas and Constantine had been eating away at the last remnants of the Principality of Achaea, a crusader state established during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 which had once governed almost the entire peninsula. It was Thomas who finally brought an end to the principality by marrying [[Catherine Zaccaria]], daughter and heir of the final prince, [[Centurione II Zaccaria]]. With Centurione's death in 1432, Thomas could claim control over all of his remaining territories. By the 1430s, Thomas and Constantine had ensured that nearly the entire Peloponnese was once more in Byzantine hands for the first time since 1204, the only exception being the few port towns and cities held by the [[Republic of Venice]].{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=12}}\n\n[[Murad II]], Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which occupied most of the Byzantine Empire's former territory and had relegated the empire and the despotate as effectively vassal states, felt uneasy about the recent string of Byzantine successes in the Morea. In 1431, [[Turahan Bey]], a Turkish general who governed [[Thessaly]], sent his troops south to demolish the Morea's primary defensive fortifications, the [[Hexamilion wall]], in an effort to remind the despots that they were the Sultan's vassals.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}}\n\nIn March 1432, Constantine, possibly desiring to be closer to Mystras, made a new territorial agreement, presumably approved by Theodore and John VIII, with Thomas. Thomas agreed to cede his fortress Kalavryta to Constantine, who made it his new capital, in exchange for [[Elis (city)|Elis]], which Thomas made his new capital.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}} Though relations between the three despots thus appears to have been good in 1432, they soon soured. John VIII had no sons to suceed him and it was thus assumed that his successor would be one of his four surviving brothers (Andronikos having died some time before). John VIII's preferred successor was Constantine and though this choice was accepted by Thomas, who had developed good relations with his older brother, it was resented by the still older Theodore. When Constantine was summoned to the capital in 1435, Theodore believed this was to appoint Constantine as co-emperor and designated heir, which was not actually the case, and he too travelled to Constantinople to raise his objections. The quarrel between Constantine and Theodore was not resolved until the end of 1436, when the future Patriarch [[Gregory III of Constantinople|Gregory Mammas]] was sent to reconcile them and prevent civil war. When Constantine was summoned to act as regent in Constantinople while John VIII was away at the [[Council of Florence]] from 1437 to 1440, Theodore and Thomas stayed in the Morea.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=14}} In November 1443, Constantine gave over control of [[Selymbria]], which he had received after helping to deal with the rebellion of their younger brother Demetrios, to Theodore, who in turn abandoned his position as Despot of the Morea, making Constantine and Thomas the sole Despots of the Morea. Though this brought Theodore closer to Constantinople, it also made Constantine the ruler of the capital of the Morea and one of the most powerful men in the small empire.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=19}} With Theodore and Demetrios out of their way, Constantine and Thomas hoped to strengthen the Morea, by now the cultural center of the Byzantine world, and make it a safe and nearly self-suffient principality.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=21}} The philosopher [[Gemistus Pletho]] advocated that while Constantinople was the New Rome, Mystras and the Morea could become the \"New [[Sparta]]\", a centralized and strong hellenic kingdom in its own right.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=22}}\n[[File:Hexamilion-3.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[Hexamilion wall]], restored by Thomas and his brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]] to defend [[Despotate of the Morea|the Morea]] in 1444 and destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1446.]]\nAmong the actions taken during the brothers' project of strengthening the despotate was to reconstruct the Hexamilion wall, destroyed by the Turks in 1431. Together, they completely restored the wall, which was finished in March 1444.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=24}} The wall was destroyed by the Turks again in 1446 after Constantine had attempted to expand his control northwards and had refused the sultan's demands of dismantling the wall.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=31}} Constantine and Thomas were determined to hold the wall and had brought all their available forces, amounting to perhaps as many as twenty thousand men, to defend it.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=76}} Despite this, the battle by the wall in 1446 was an overwhelming Turkish victory, with Constantine and Thomas barely escaping with their lives. Turahan Bey was sent south to take Mystras and devastate Constantine's lands while Sultan Murad II led his forces in the north of the Peloponnese.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=31}} Although Turahan failed to take Mystras, this was of little consequence as Murad did not wish to conquer the Morea at the time, merely to instill terror, and the Turks soon left the peninsula, devastated and depopulated.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=32}} Constantine and Thomas were in no position to ask for a truce and were forced to accept Murad as their lord and pay him tribute, promising to never again restore the Hexamilion wall.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=33}}\n\nTheir former co-despot Theodore died in June 1448, and on 31 October of the same year, Emperor John VIII passed away. The potential successors to the throne were Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas. John had not formally designated and heir, though everyone knew he favored Constantine and ultimately, the will of their mother, [[Helena Draga\u0161]] (who also preferred Constantine), prevailed.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=35}} Both Thomas, who had no intention of claiming the throne, and Demetrios, who most certainly did, hurried to Constantinople and reached the capital before Constantine. Though Demetrios was favored by many due to his anti-unionist sentiment, Helena reserved her right to act as regent until her eldest son, Constantine arrived, stalling Demetrios's attempt at seizing the throne. Thomas accepted Constantine's appointment and Demetrios, who soon thereafter joined in proclaiming Constantine as his new emperor, was overruled. Sphrantzes then informed Sultan Murad II, who also accepted the ascension of Constantine, now Emperor Constantine XI.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=36}} In order to remove Demetrios from the capital and its vicinity, Constantine made Demetrios Despot of the Morea, to rule the despotate together with Thomas. Demetrios was granted Mystras and primarily ruled the southern and eastern parts of the despotate, with Thomas ruling [[Corinthia]] and the north-west, variously using Patras or [[Leontari, Arcadia|Leontari]] as his capital.{{Sfn|Gilliland Wright|2013|p=63}}\n\nIn 1451, Sultan Murad II, by then old and tired and having let go of all intentions of conquering Constantinople, died and was succeeded as sultan by his young and vigorous son [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]],{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=44}} who was determined above all else to take the city.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=78}} In 1452, during the preparation stages of the Ottoman siege of Constantinople, Constantine XI sent an urgent message to the Morea, requesting that one of his brothers bring their forces to help him defend the city. To prevent aid coming from the Morea, Mehmed II sent Turahan Bey to devastate the peninsula once more.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} The Turkish attack was repelled by an army commanded by Matthaios Asan, brother-in-law of Demetrios, but this victory came too late to offer any aid to Constantinople.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=79}}\n\n=== Continued rule in the Morea ===\n[[File:Despotate of Morea 1450.svg|left|thumb|The [[Despotate of the Morea]] {{Circa|}} 1450, showing the areas under control by Thomas and his brother [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]].]]\nConstantinople ultimately [[Fall of Constantinople|fell]] on 29 May 1453, Constantine XI dying in its defense, ending the Byzantine Empire. In the aftermath of Constantinople's fall, one of the most pressing threats to the new Ottoman regime was the possibility that one of Constantine XI's surviving relatives would find a following and return to reclaim the empire. Luckily for Mehmed II, the two despots in the Morea represented scarcely more than a nuisance and were allowed to keep their titles and lands. Although both Thomas and Demetrios might have considered making their small despotate the rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, they were never able to cooperate and spent most of their resources fighting each other rather than preparing for a struggle against the Turks.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=110}}\n\nShortly after Constantinople fell, a revolt broke out against the despots in the Morea, prompted by the many Albanian immigrants to the region being unhappy with the actions of the local Greek landowners.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} The Albanians had respected earlier despots, such as Constantine and Theodore, but despised the two current despots and without central authority from Constantinople, they saw their opportunity to gain control of the despotate for themselves. In Thomas's part of the despotate, the rebels chose to proclaim [[John Asen Zaccaria]], bastard son of Thomas's father-in-law Centurione II, as their leader and in Demetrios's part of the despotate, the leader of the revolt was [[Manuel Kantakouzenos (usurper)|Manuel Kantakouzenos]], grandson of [[Demetrios I Kantakouzenos]] (who had served as despot until 1384) and great-great-grandson of Emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] ({{Reign}}1347\u20131354).{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=79}} Mehmed II did not wish to see the despotate pass into the hands of Albanians, and out of his control, and sent an army to quell the rebellion in December 1453. The rebellion was not fully crushed until October 1454, when Turahan Bey arrived to aid the despots in firmly establishing their authority in the region. In return for the aid, Mehmed demanded a heavy tribute from Thomas and Demetrios.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}}\n\nNeither brother could raise the sum demanded by the Sultan and they were divided in their policies. While Demetrios, probably the more realistic of the two, had given up hope of Christian aid from the west and thought it might be best to placate the Turks, Thomas retained hope that the Papacy might yet call for a crusade to restore the Byzantine Empire. With no money coming from the Morea, Mehmed eventually lost his patience with the Palaiologoi. The Ottoman army marched from Adrianople in May 1458 and entered the Morea, where the only real resistance was faced at [[Corinth]], within the domain governed by Demetrios.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} Leaving his artillery to bombard and besiege that city, Mehmed left with most of his army to devastate and conquer the northern parts of the despotate, under Thomas's jurisdiction. Corinth at last gave up in August, after several cities in the north had already surrendered, and Mehmed imposed a heavy retribution on the Morea. The territory under the two brothers was drastically reduced, Corinth, [[Patras]] and much of the north-west of the peninsula were annexed into the Ottoman Empire and provided with Turkish governors, with the Palaiologoi only being allowed to keep the south, including the despotate's nominal capital, Mystras, on the condition that they paid their annual tribute to the sultan.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=112}}\n\nAlmost as soon as Mehmed had left the Morea, the two brothers began quarreling with each other again. Demetrios invited Mehmed to return to the Morea and support his cause against Thomas, while Thomas sent pleas to the Papacy for aid. Neither brother had any true control over their remainig territory, where the Greek landowners mostly did as they pleased. Thomas's pleas to the west did represent a real threat to the Ottomans, a threat made even greater through the support of the plan by the vocal Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], a Byzantine refugee who had escaped the empire years earlier. [[Pope Pius II]] convened a council in 1459 in [[Mantua]] and sent Bessarion and some others to preach for a crusade against the Ottomans throughout Europe. Furthermore, Pius II had sent 300 soldiers to aid Thomas, who successfully retook Kalavryta from the Ottomans and attempted to retake Patras.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=112}} Soon after, the Papal troops lost interest and returned home and Thomas began to quarrel with Demetrios once more. Near the end of 1459, Mehmed ordered the [[Diocese of Lacedaemon|Bishop of Lacedaemon]] to make the two swear to keep the peace, but this had little impact and they were once more quarreling a few weeks later.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=113}}\n\nDetermined to bring order to Greece, Mehmed decided that the destruction of the despotate and its full annexation directly into his empire was the only possible solution. The sultan assembled his army once more in April 1460 and led it in person first to Corinth and then on to Mystras. Demetrios surrendered to the Ottomans without a fight, fearing retribution and already having sent his family to safety in [[Monemvasia]]. Mystras thus fell into Ottoman hands on 29 May 1460, exactly seven years after Constantinople's fall. The few places in the Morea that dared resist the sultan's army were devastated as per Islamic law, the men being massacred and the women and children being taken away. As large numbers of Greek refugees escaped to Venetian-held territories such as [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] and [[Koroni]], the Morea was slowly subdued, the last resistance being led by [[Graitzas Palaiologos|Constantine Graitzas Palaiologos]], a relative of Thomas and Demetrios, at [[Salmeniko Castle|Salmenikon]] in July 1461.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=113}}\n\n=== Life in exile ===\n[[File:Vatican StPaul Statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] in front of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].

In July 1460, Thomas and his family, accompanied by other Greek nobles (such as the historian [[George Sphrantzes]]) fled to [[Corfu]] with Venetian help. Catherine and the children stayed in Corfu, but Thomas chose to travel to [[Rome]] in November that same year, hoping to convince Pope Pius II to call for a crusade.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=114}} Thomas, as the brother of the final Byzantine emperor, was the highest profile ruler in exile of all the many Christians who escaped the Balkans over the course of the Ottoman conquest.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}}\n\nUpon arriving in Rome, Thomas met with Pius II, who bestowed him with the [[Golden Rose]], lodging in the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia]] and a pension of 300 [[Ducat|ducats]] each month (for a total of 3600 annually). In addition to the papal pension, Thomas also received an additional 200 ducats a month from the cardinals and 500 ducats from the Republic of Venice, which also begged him not to return to Corfu as to not affect Venice's already tenuous relations with the Ottomans. Thomas's many followers considered the money provided to him to be barely enough to support the despot, and certainly nowhere near enough to also support themselves.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}} The Papacy recognized Thomas as the rightful Despot of the Morea and the true heir to the Byzantine Empire, though Thomas never claimed the imperial title.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nOn 12 April 1462, Thomas gave the supposed skull of Saint [[Andrew the Apostle]], a precious relic which had been in Byzantine hands for centuries, to Pius II. Pius received the skull from Cardinal Bessarion at the [[Ponte Milvio]]. The ceremony, which was hailed as a return of Andrew to his relatives, the Romans (as symbolic descendants of [[Saint Peter]]) is depicted on Pius II's grave.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\nDuring his stay in Rome, Thomas, on account of his \"tall and handsome appearance\", served as the model of the statue of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] which to this day stands in front of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]].{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\nWhile many of the Balkan exiles were happy to live out their lives in obscurity,{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}} Thomas hoped to eventually restore control over Byzantine territory. There were genuine preparations being conducted for a crusade, aimed at recovering Constantinople, during the 1460s, a plan staunchly supported by Thomas. To drum up support for the venture, Thomas toured Italy, carrying with him papal letters of [[indulgence]]. On his visits to the courts of the various landholders in Italy, Thomas presented himself as \"a prince who was born to the illustrious and ancient family of the Palaiologoi ... a man who is now an immigrant, naked, robbed of everything except his lineage\".{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nUpon the death of his wife in August 1462,{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}} Thomas summoned his children (who still remained at Corfu) to Rome, but they only arrived in the city after Thomas had died on 12 May 1465.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} Though Thomas had been largely bypassed and forgotten by the Roman elite after Pius II's death in 1464,{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}} he was buried with honor in the St. Peter's Basilica,{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} where his grave would survive the destruction and removal of the tombs of the Palaiologan emperors in Constantinople during the early years of Ottoman rule.{{Sfn|Melvani|2018|p=260}} Modern efforts to locate his grave within the Basilica have so far proven fruitless.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\n== Children and descendants ==\n[[File:IoannIV reconstruction by Gerasimov02.jpg|thumb|[[Forensic anthropology|Forensical]] reconstruction of [[Ivan the Terrible]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]'s first [[Tsar]] from 1547 to 1584.

By the time of the Morea's fall, Helena had long since moved to [[Smederevo]] with her husband (who eventually became the Despot of Serbia in 1456). Lazar died in 1458 and Helena was left to care for the couple's three daughters. In 1459, Mehmed II invaded Serbia and put an end to the despotate, but Helena was allowed to leave the country. After spending some time in [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]], she moved to Corfu and lived there with her mother and siblings. After that, Helena became a nun and lived on the island of [[Lefkada]], where she died in November 1473. Though Helena had many descendants through her three daughters [[Maria of Serbia, Queen of Bosnia|Jelena]], [[Milica Brankovi\u0107|Milica]] and [[Jerina Brankovi\u0107 (wife of Gjon Kastrioti II)|Jerina Brankovic]], none of them carried on the Palaiologos name.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}\n* '''[[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe Palaiologina]]''' ({{Circa|}} 1449 \u2013 7 April 1503), the younger daughter of Thomas and Catherine, Zoe was married off to [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow]], by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] in 1472, in the hope of converting the Russians to Roman Catholicism. The Russians did not convert, with the marriage being celebrated according to Eastern Orthodox tradition. Zoe was called \"Sophia\" in Russia and her marriage to Ivan III served to strengthen Moscow's claim to be \"[[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]]\", the ideological and spiritual successor to the Byzantine Empire. Zoe and Ivan III had several children, who in turn had numerous descendants and though none carried the Palaiologos name, many of them used the [[double-headed eagle]] iconography of Byzantium.

He attempted to organize an expedition to restore the empire in 1481, but his plans failed and he later ceded the rights to the imperial title to [[Charles VIII of France]], hoping to use him as a champion against the Turks. Andreas died poor in Rome, whether or not he had any children is uncertain.

Failing to find satisfactory offers, Manuel surprised everyone else involved by travelling to Constantinople in 1476 and throwing himself on the mercy of Sultan Mehmed II, who graciously received him. He married an unknown woman and stayed in Constantinople for the rest of his life.

He was the younger brother of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], the final [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]]. Thomas was appointed as Despot of the Morea by his oldest brother, Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]], in 1428, joining his two brothers and other despots [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] and Constantine, already governing the Morea. Though Theodore proved reluctant to cooperate with his brothers, Thomas and Constantine successfully worked to strengthen the despotate and expand its borders. In 1432, Thomas brought the remaining territories of the Latin [[Principality of Achaea]], established during the [[Fourth Crusade]] more than two hundred years earlier, into Byzantine hands by marrying [[Catherine Zaccaria]], daughter and heir to the principality.\n\nIn 1449, Thomas supported the ascension of his brother Constantine, who then became Emperor Constantine XI, to the throne despite the machinations of his other brother, [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], who himself desired the throne. After Constantine's rise to the throne, Demetrios was then assigned by Constantine to govern the Morea with Thomas but the two brothers found it difficult to cooperate, often quarreling with each other. In the aftermath of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and end of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1453, Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] allowed Thomas and Demetrios to continue to rule as Ottoman vassals in the Morea. Thomas hoped to turn the small despotate into a rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, hoping to gain support from the [[Papacy]] and [[Western Europe]]. Constant quarreling with Demetrios, who supported the Ottomans instead, eventually led Mehmed to invade and conquer the Morea in 1460.\n\nThomas and his family, including his wife Catherine and his three younger children [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]], [[Andreas Palaiologos|Andreas]] and [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]], escaped into exile to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]-held city of [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] and then to [[Corfu]], where Catherine and the children stayed. In the hopes of raising support for a crusade to restore his lands in the Morea, and possibly the Byzantine Empire itself, Thomas travelled to [[Rome]], where he was received and provided for by [[Pope Pius II]]. His hopes of retaking the Morea never materialized and he died in Rome on 12 May 1465. After his death, his claims were inherited by his oldest son Andreas, who also attempted to rally support for a campaign to restore the fallen despotate and the Byzantine Empire.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life and appointment as despot ===\n[[File:Manuel_II_Helena_sons.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Manuel_II_Helena_sons.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|Miniature from an early 15th-century manuscript depicting Thomas's father Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], his mother [[Helena Draga\u0161]] and his three oldest brothers [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]] (later Emperor John VIII), [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] and [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronikos]].]]\nAs the [[Byzantine Empire]] fell apart and fragmented over the course of the 14th century, the emperors of the Palaiologan dynasty came to feel that the only sure way to keep their remaining holdings intact was to grant them to their sons, receiving the title of [[Despot (court title)|despot]], as appanages to defend and govern.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=3}} Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] ({{Reign}}1391\u20131425) had a total of six sons who survived infancy. Manuel's eldest surviving son, [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]], was raised to co-emperor and designated to succeed Manuel as sole emperor upon his death. The second eldest son, [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] was designated as [[Despot of the Morea]] and the third eldest, [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronikos]], was made Despot of [[Thessaloniki]] in 1408 at just eight years old. Manuel's younger sons, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]], [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], and Thomas (the youngest, born in 1409, were kept in [[Constantinople]] as there was not sufficient land left to grant them. The younger children; Theodore, Andronikos, Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas were frequently described as having the distinction of [[Porphyrogennetos]] (\"born in the purple\"; born in the imperial palace during the reign of their father), a distinction that does not appear to have been shared by the emperor-to-be John.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=4}}\n\nRelations between the Palaiologos brothers were not always good. Though the young John and Constantine appears to have got on well with each other, relations between Constantine and the younger Demetrios and Thomas were not as friendly.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=4}} The complex relationships between the sons of Manuel II were put to the test when John, now Emperor John VIII, appointed Constantine as Despot of the Morea in 1428. Since his brother Theodore refused to step down from his role as despot, the despotate became governed by two members of the imperial family for the first time since its creation in 1349. Soon thereafter, the younger Thomas (aged 19) was also appointed as Despot of the Morea, meaning that the nominally undivided despotate had effectively disintegrated into three smaller principalities.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}}\n\nTheodore did not make way for Constantine or Thomas in the despotate's capital, [[Mystras]]. Instead, Theodore granted Constantine lands throughout the Morea, including the northern harbor town of [[Aigio]], fortresses and towns in [[Laconia]] (in the south), and [[Kalamata]] and [[Messenia]] in the west. Constantine made his capital as despot the town [[Glarentza]]. Meanwhile, Thomas was given lands in the north and based himself in the castle of [[Kalavryta]].{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}}\n\n=== Despot under the Byzantine Empire ===\n[[File:Bizancio1400AD-la.svg|left|thumb|Map of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1400. By the time Thomas became [[Despot of the Morea]] in 1428, his older brother [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] had already worked to expand the despotate's (the southern territory on the map) borders somewhat. It would be expanded to cover almost the entire [[Peloponnese]] by Thomas and his brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]].]]\nShortly after being appointed as despots, Constantine and Thomas, together with Theodore, decided to join forces in an attempt to seize the flourishing and strategic port of [[Patras]] in the north-west of the Morea, then under the rule of its Catholic Archbishop. The campaign, which was unsuccessful, possibly due to Theodore's reluctance to partake, was Thomas's first experience of war.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}} Constantine later captured Patras on his own, ending 225 of foreign ownership.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\n\nThomas's early tenure as Despot of the Morea was not without acquisitions either. For years, Thomas and Constantine had been eating away at the last remnants of the Principality of Achaea, a crusader state established during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 which had once governed almost the entire peninsula. It was Thomas who finally brought an end to the principality by marrying [[Catherine Zaccaria]], daughter and heir of the final prince, [[Centurione II Zaccaria]]. With Centurione's death in 1432, Thomas could claim control over all of his remaining territories. By the 1430s, Thomas and Constantine had ensured that nearly the entire Peloponnese was once more in Byzantine hands for the first time since 1204, the only exception being the few port towns and cities held by the [[Republic of Venice]].{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=12}}\n\n[[Murad II]], Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which occupied most of the Byzantine Empire's former territory and had relegated the empire and the despotate as effectively vassal states, felt uneasy about the recent string of Byzantine successes in the Morea. In 1431, [[Turahan Bey]], a Turkish general who governed [[Thessaly]], sent his troops south to demolish the Morea's primary defensive fortifications, the [[Hexamilion wall]], in an effort to remind the despots that they were the Sultan's vassals.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}}\n\nIn March 1432, Constantine, possibly desiring to be closer to Mystras, made a new territorial agreement, presumably approved by Theodore and John VIII, with Thomas. Thomas agreed to cede his fortress Kalavryta to Constantine, who made it his new capital, in exchange for [[Elis (city)|Elis]], which Thomas made his new capital.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}} Though relations between the three despots thus appears to have been good in 1432, they soon soured. John VIII had no sons to suceed him and it was thus assumed that his successor would be one of his four surviving brothers (Andronikos having died some time before). John VIII's preferred successor was Constantine and though this choice was accepted by Thomas, who had developed good relations with his older brother, it was resented by the still older Theodore. When Constantine was summoned to the capital in 1435, Theodore believed this was to appoint Constantine as co-emperor and designated heir, which was not actually the case, and he too travelled to Constantinople to raise his objections. The quarrel between Constantine and Theodore was not resolved until the end of 1436, when the future Patriarch [[Gregory III of Constantinople|Gregory Mammas]] was sent to reconcile them and prevent civil war. When Constantine was summoned to act as regent in Constantinople while John VIII was away at the [[Council of Florence]] from 1437 to 1440, Theodore and Thomas stayed in the Morea.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=14}} In November 1443, Constantine gave over control of [[Selymbria]], which he had received after helping to deal with the rebellion of their younger brother Demetrios, to Theodore, who in turn abandoned his position as Despot of the Morea, making Constantine and Thomas the sole Despots of the Morea. Though this brought Theodore closer to Constantinople, it also made Constantine the ruler of the capital of the Morea and one of the most powerful men in the small empire.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=19}} With Theodore and Demetrios out of their way, Constantine and Thomas hoped to strengthen the Morea, by now the cultural center of the Byzantine world, and make it a safe and nearly self-suffient principality.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=21}} The philosopher [[Gemistus Pletho]] advocated that while Constantinople was the New Rome, Mystras and the Morea could become the \"New [[Sparta]]\", a centralized and strong hellenic kingdom in its own right.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=22}}\n[[File:Hexamilion-3.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[Hexamilion wall]], restored by Thomas and his brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]] to defend [[Despotate of the Morea|the Morea]] in 1444 and destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1446.]]\nAmong the actions taken during the brothers' project of strengthening the despotate was to reconstruct the Hexamilion wall, destroyed by the Turks in 1431. Together, they completely restored the wall, which was finished in March 1444.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=24}} The wall was destroyed by the Turks again in 1446 after Constantine had attempted to expand his control northwards and had refused the sultan's demands of dismantling the wall.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=31}} Constantine and Thomas were determined to hold the wall and had brought all their available forces, amounting to perhaps as many as twenty thousand men, to defend it.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=76}} Despite this, the battle by the wall in 1446 was an overwhelming Turkish victory, with Constantine and Thomas barely escaping with their lives. Turahan Bey was sent south to take Mystras and devastate Constantine's lands while Sultan Murad II led his forces in the north of the Peloponnese.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=31}} Although Turahan failed to take Mystras, this was of little consequence as Murad did not wish to conquer the Morea at the time, merely to instill terror, and the Turks soon left the peninsula, devastated and depopulated.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=32}} Constantine and Thomas were in no position to ask for a truce and were forced to accept Murad as their lord and pay him tribute, promising to never again restore the Hexamilion wall.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=33}}\n\nTheir former co-despot Theodore died in June 1448, and on 31 October of the same year, Emperor John VIII passed away. The potential successors to the throne were Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas. John had not formally designated and heir, though everyone knew he favored Constantine and ultimately, the will of their mother, [[Helena Draga\u0161]] (who also preferred Constantine), prevailed.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=35}} Both Thomas, who had no intention of claiming the throne, and Demetrios, who most certainly did, hurried to Constantinople and reached the capital before Constantine. Though Demetrios was favored by many due to his anti-unionist sentiment, Helena reserved her right to act as regent until her eldest son, Constantine arrived, stalling Demetrios's attempt at seizing the throne. Thomas accepted Constantine's appointment and Demetrios, who soon thereafter joined in proclaiming Constantine as his new emperor, was overruled. Sphrantzes then informed Sultan Murad II, who also accepted the ascension of Constantine, now Emperor Constantine XI.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=36}} In order to remove Demetrios from the capital and its vicinity, Constantine made Demetrios Despot of the Morea, to rule the despotate together with Thomas. Demetrios was granted Mystras and primarily ruled the southern and eastern parts of the despotate, with Thomas ruling [[Corinthia]] and the north-west, variously using Patras or [[Leontari, Arcadia|Leontari]] as his capital.{{Sfn|Gilliland Wright|2013|p=63}}\n\nIn 1451, Sultan Murad II, by then old and tired and having let go of all intentions of conquering Constantinople, died and was succeeded as sultan by his young and vigorous son [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]],{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=44}} who was determined above all else to take the city.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=78}} In 1452, during the preparation stages of the Ottoman siege of Constantinople, Constantine XI sent an urgent message to the Morea, requesting that one of his brothers bring their forces to help him defend the city. To prevent aid coming from the Morea, Mehmed II sent Turahan Bey to devastate the peninsula once more.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} The Turkish attack was repelled by an army commanded by Matthaios Asan, brother-in-law of Demetrios, but this victory came too late to offer any aid to Constantinople.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=79}}\n\n=== Continued rule in the Morea ===\n[[File:Despotate of Morea 1450.svg|left|thumb|The [[Despotate of the Morea]] {{Circa|}} 1450, showing the areas under control by Thomas and his brother [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]].]]\nConstantinople ultimately [[Fall of Constantinople|fell]] on 29 May 1453, Constantine XI dying in its defense, ending the Byzantine Empire. In the aftermath of Constantinople's fall, one of the most pressing threats to the new Ottoman regime was the possibility that one of Constantine XI's surviving relatives would find a following and return to reclaim the empire. Luckily for Mehmed II, the two despots in the Morea represented scarcely more than a nuisance and were allowed to keep their titles and lands. Although both Thomas and Demetrios might have considered making their small despotate the rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, they were never able to cooperate and spent most of their resources fighting each other rather than preparing for a struggle against the Turks.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=110}}\n\nShortly after Constantinople fell, a revolt broke out against the despots in the Morea, prompted by the many Albanian immigrants to the region being unhappy with the actions of the local Greek landowners.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} The Albanians had respected earlier despots, such as Constantine and Theodore, but despised the two current despots and without central authority from Constantinople, they saw their opportunity to gain control of the despotate for themselves. In Thomas's part of the despotate, the rebels chose to proclaim [[John Asen Zaccaria]], bastard son of Thomas's father-in-law Centurione II, as their leader and in Demetrios's part of the despotate, the leader of the revolt was [[Manuel Kantakouzenos (usurper)|Manuel Kantakouzenos]], grandson of [[Demetrios I Kantakouzenos]] (who had served as despot until 1384) and great-great-grandson of Emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] ({{Reign}}1347\u20131354).{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=79}} Mehmed II did not wish to see the despotate pass into the hands of Albanians, and out of his control, and sent an army to quell the rebellion in December 1453. The rebellion was not fully crushed until October 1454, when Turahan Bey arrived to aid the despots in firmly establishing their authority in the region. In return for the aid, Mehmed demanded a heavy tribute from Thomas and Demetrios.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}}\n\nNeither brother could raise the sum demanded by the Sultan and they were divided in their policies. While Demetrios, probably the more realistic of the two, had given up hope of Christian aid from the west and thought it might be best to placate the Turks, Thomas retained hope that the Papacy might yet call for a crusade to restore the Byzantine Empire. With no money coming from the Morea, Mehmed eventually lost his patience with the Palaiologoi. The Ottoman army marched from Adrianople in May 1458 and entered the Morea, where the only real resistance was faced at [[Corinth]], within the domain governed by Demetrios.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} Leaving his artillery to bombard and besiege that city, Mehmed left with most of his army to devastate and conquer the northern parts of the despotate, under Thomas's jurisdiction. Corinth at last gave up in August, after several cities in the north had already surrendered, and Mehmed imposed a heavy retribution on the Morea. The territory under the two brothers was drastically reduced, Corinth, [[Patras]] and much of the north-west of the peninsula were annexed into the Ottoman Empire and provided with Turkish governors, with the Palaiologoi only being allowed to keep the south, including the despotate's nominal capital, Mystras, on the condition that they paid their annual tribute to the sultan.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=112}}\n\nAlmost as soon as Mehmed had left the Morea, the two brothers began quarreling with each other again. Demetrios invited Mehmed to return to the Morea and support his cause against Thomas, while Thomas sent pleas to the Papacy for aid. Neither brother had any true control over their remainig territory, where the Greek landowners mostly did as they pleased. Thomas's pleas to the west did represent a real threat to the Ottomans, a threat made even greater through the support of the plan by the vocal Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], a Byzantine refugee who had escaped the empire years earlier. [[Pope Pius II]] convened a council in 1459 in [[Mantua]] and sent Bessarion and some others to preach for a crusade against the Ottomans throughout Europe. Furthermore, Pius II had sent 300 soldiers to aid Thomas, who successfully retook Kalavryta from the Ottomans and attempted to retake Patras.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=112}} Soon after, the Papal troops lost interest and returned home and Thomas began to quarrel with Demetrios once more. Near the end of 1459, Mehmed ordered the [[Diocese of Lacedaemon|Bishop of Lacedaemon]] to make the two swear to keep the peace, but this had little impact and they were once more quarreling a few weeks later.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=113}}\n\nDetermined to bring order to Greece, Mehmed decided that the destruction of the despotate and its full annexation directly into his empire was the only possible solution. The sultan assembled his army once more in April 1460 and led it in person first to Corinth and then on to Mystras. Demetrios surrendered to the Ottomans without a fight, fearing retribution and already having sent his family to safety in [[Monemvasia]]. Mystras thus fell into Ottoman hands on 29 May 1460, exactly seven years after Constantinople's fall. The few places in the Morea that dared resist the sultan's army were devastated as per Islamic law, the men being massacred and the women and children being taken away. As large numbers of Greek refugees escaped to Venetian-held territories such as [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] and [[Koroni]], the Morea was slowly subdued, the last resistance being led by [[Graitzas Palaiologos|Constantine Graitzas Palaiologos]], a relative of Thomas and Demetrios, at [[Salmeniko Castle|Salmenikon]] in July 1461.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=113}}\n\n=== Life in exile ===\n[[File:Vatican StPaul Statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] in front of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. Thomas served as the model of this statue in the 1460s.|alt=|left]]By the time the despotate fell, Thomas had already fled to Methoni with his wife Catherine and his children [[Andreas Palaiologos|Andreas]], [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]] and [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]]. In July 1460, Thomas and his family, accompanied by other Greek nobles (such as the historian [[George Sphrantzes]]) fled to [[Corfu]] with Venetian help. Catherine and the children stayed in Corfu, but Thomas chose to travel to [[Rome]] in November that same year, hoping to convince Pope Pius II to call for a crusade.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=114}} Thomas, as the brother of the final Byzantine emperor, was the highest profile ruler in exile of all the many Christians who escaped the Balkans over the course of the Ottoman conquest.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}}\n\nUpon arriving in Rome, Thomas met with Pius II, who bestowed him with the [[Golden Rose]], lodging in the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia]] and a pension of 300 [[Ducat|ducats]] each month (for a total of 3600 annually). In addition to the papal pension, Thomas also received an additional 200 ducats a month from the cardinals and 500 ducats from the Republic of Venice, which also begged him not to return to Corfu as to not affect Venice's already tenuous relations with the Ottomans. Thomas's many followers considered the money provided to him to be barely enough to support the despot, and certainly nowhere near enough to also support themselves.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}} The Papacy recognized Thomas as the rightful Despot of the Morea and the true heir to the Byzantine Empire, though Thomas never claimed the imperial title.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nOn 12 April 1462, Thomas gave the supposed skull of Saint [[Andrew the Apostle]], a precious relic which had been in Byzantine hands for centuries, to Pius II. Pius received the skull from Cardinal Bessarion at the [[Ponte Milvio]]. The ceremony, which was hailed as a return of Andrew to his relatives, the Romans (as symbolic descendants of [[Saint Peter]]) is depicted on Pius II's grave.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\nDuring his stay in Rome, Thomas, on account of his \"tall and handsome appearance\", served as the model of the statue of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] which to this day stands in front of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]].{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\nWhile many of the Balkan exiles were happy to live out their lives in obscurity,{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}} Thomas hoped to eventually restore control over Byzantine territory. There were genuine preparations being conducted for a crusade, aimed at recovering Constantinople, during the 1460s, a plan staunchly supported by Thomas. To drum up support for the venture, Thomas toured Italy, carrying with him papal letters of [[indulgence]]. On his visits to the courts of the various landholders in Italy, Thomas presented himself as \"a prince who was born to the illustrious and ancient family of the Palaiologoi ... a man who is now an immigrant, naked, robbed of everything except his lineage\".{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nUpon the death of his wife in August 1462,{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}} Thomas summoned his children (who still remained at Corfu) to Rome, but they only arrived in the city after Thomas had died on 12 May 1465.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} Though Thomas had been largely bypassed and forgotten by the Roman elite after Pius II's death in 1464,{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}} he was buried with honor in the St. Peter's Basilica,{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} where his grave would survive the destruction and removal of the tombs of the Palaiologan emperors in Constantinople during the early years of Ottoman rule.{{Sfn|Melvani|2018|p=260}} Modern efforts to locate his grave within the Basilica have so far proven fruitless.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\n== Children and descendants ==\n[[File:IoannIV reconstruction by Gerasimov02.jpg|thumb|[[Forensic anthropology|Forensical]] reconstruction of [[Ivan the Terrible]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]'s first [[Tsar]] from 1547 to 1584. Thomas Palaiologos was Ivan's great-grandfather through his daughter [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe (Sophia) Palaiologina]]. Blood ties to Byzantine royalty allowed Russia to strengthen its claim to being the \"[[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]]\".]]\nIt is generally accepted that Thomas had four children with Catherine Zaccaria.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=114}} These four children were:{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=114\u2013116}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=539}}\n\n* '''[[Helena Palaiologina, Despotess of Serbia|Helena Palaiologina]]''' (1431 \u2013 7 November 1473), the older of the couple's two daughters, Helena was married to [[Lazar Brankovi\u0107]], a son of [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]], [[Despot of Serbia]]. By the time of the Morea's fall, Helena had long since moved to [[Smederevo]] with her husband (who eventually became the Despot of Serbia in 1456). Lazar died in 1458 and Helena was left to care for the couple's three daughters. In 1459, Mehmed II invaded Serbia and put an end to the despotate, but Helena was allowed to leave the country. After spending some time in [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]], she moved to Corfu and lived there with her mother and siblings. After that, Helena became a nun and lived on the island of [[Lefkada]], where she died in November 1473. Though Helena had many descendants through her three daughters [[Maria of Serbia, Queen of Bosnia|Jelena]], [[Milica Brankovi\u0107|Milica]] and [[Jerina Brankovi\u0107 (wife of Gjon Kastrioti II)|Jerina Brankovic]], none of them carried on the Palaiologos name.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}\n* '''[[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe Palaiologina]]''' ({{Circa|}} 1449 \u2013 7 April 1503), the younger daughter of Thomas and Catherine, Zoe was married off to [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow]], by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] in 1472, in the hope of converting the Russians to Roman Catholicism. The Russians did not convert, with the marriage being celebrated according to Eastern Orthodox tradition. Zoe was called \"Sophia\" in Russia and her marriage to Ivan III served to strengthen Moscow's claim to be \"[[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]]\", the ideological and spiritual successor to the Byzantine Empire. Zoe and Ivan III had several children, who in turn had numerous descendants and though none carried the Palaiologos name, many of them used the [[double-headed eagle]] iconography of Byzantium. The famous [[Ivan the Terrible]], Russia's first [[Tsar]], was Sophia's grandson.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}\n*'''[[Andreas Palaiologos]]''' (17 January 1453 \u2013 June 1502), the older of the couple's two sons and the third child overall, Andreas lived most of his life in Rome, surviving on a gradually declining papal pension. After Thomas's death, Andreas was recognized by the Papacy and others in Italy as the rightful heir to the Despotate of the Morea and he would later go on to claim the title ''Imperator Constantinopolitanus'' (\"Emperor of Constantinople\") as well, hoping to one day restore the fallen Byzantine Empire. He attempted to organize an expedition to restore the empire in 1481, but his plans failed and he later ceded the rights to the imperial title to [[Charles VIII of France]], hoping to use him as a champion against the Turks. Andreas died poor in Rome, whether or not he had any children is uncertain. His will specified that his titles were to be granted to the [[Catholic Monarchs of Spain|Catholic Monarchs]] in Spain (though they never used them).{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=116}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=537\u2013554}}\n* '''[[Manuel Palaiologos]]''' (2 January 1455 \u2013 before 1512), the youngest of the four children, Manuel lived in Rome and lived off Papal money, much the same as his brother. As the pension deteriorated and Manuel (as second-in-line) did not have any titles to sell, he instead travelled Europe in search of someone to hire him in a military capacity. Failing to find satisfactory offers, Manuel surprised everyone else involved by travelling to Constantinople in 1476 and throwing himself on the mercy of Sultan Mehmed II, who graciously received him. He married an unknown woman and stayed in Constantinople for the rest of his life. Manuel had two sons, one of which died young and another which converted to Islam and whose eventual fate is uncertain.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=539}}\n\nIn the late 16th century, a family with the last name Paleologus, living in [[Pesaro]] in Italy, claimed descent from Thomas through a supposed third son, called John. This family later mainly lived in [[Cornwall]] and contained figures such as [[Theodore Palaiologos (16th century)|Theodore Paleologus]], who worked as a soldier and hired assassin, and [[Ferdinand Palaiologos|Ferdinand Paleologus]], who retired in Barbados in the late 17th century.{{Sfn|Nicol|1974|p=179\u2013203}} The existence of a son of Thomas called John can't be proven with any certainty as no mention is made of a son by that name in contemporary records. It is possible that John was a real historical figure, possibly a illegitimate son of Thomas, or perhaps his grandson through of either of his known sons, Andreas or Manuel.{{Sfn|Hall|2015|p=229}} Some later Italian genealogies dating to the 17th century and onwards give Thomas two more sons; a bastard son named Rogerio and a fourth legitimate son, also named Thomas. The existence of Rogerio and Thomas the Younger is regarded as fantasy by most modern scholars.{{Sfn|Hall|2015|p=34}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Pretenders to the Byzantine throne]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n*{{Cite journal|last=Gilliland Wright|first=Diana|date=2013|title=The Fair of Agios Demetrios of 26 October 1449: Byzantine-Venetian relations and Land Issues in Mid-Century|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272223892_The_fair_of_Agios_Demetrios_of_26_October_1449_Byzantine-Venetian_relations_and_land_issues_in_mid-century|journal=Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=63\u201380|ref=CITEREFGilliland_Wright2013|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=John|title=An Elizabethan Assassin: Theodore Paleologus: Seducer, Spy and Killer|publisher=The History Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0750962612|location=Stroud|pages=|ref=CITEREFHall2015}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Jonathan|date=1995|title=A Worthless Prince?

Riley was interested in the idea of a second-born cub and what his role would be if Kiara is destined to become queen. Additionally, he was inspired by his 8-year-old son. \"Every Thursday, he and his buddies go to the park and they have this imaginary superhero team and they have all these imaginary adventures.

In reference to ''Return of the Roar'', Riley noted; \"The whole laying on hands where Kion gives the mark of the guard to the rest of the team, that goes back to the [[Bible]].\" Riley noted that protecting the Circle of Life is the main theme of the series; \"The animals who respect it don\u2019t eat too much, allow for the grass to grow, and larger animals to eat smaller animals.

As the second-born of the Lion King, he is gifted with a power called the Roar of the Elders and becomes the leader of the Lion Guard, a team of animals who protect the Pride Lands and defend the Circle of Life. Kion, along with his friends Bunga the honey badger, Beshte the hippopotamus, Fuli the cheetah and Ono the egret, sets out to keep the Pride Lands safe and protected from animals who do not respect the Circle of Life. \n\nStarting in season 2, the Lion Guard's mission becomes harder when [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] returns as a fiery spirit with plans to destroy the Pride Lands. Scar forms an army consisted of animals from the Outlands, the Outlanders. This eventually leads to an all out battle between the Pridelanders and the Outlanders.\n\nAfter Scar's defeat at the beginning of season 3, the Lion Guard travels out of the Pride Lands of Africa and across the world to get to the Tree of Life to cure Kion and Ono from their battle injuries. Kion's team also gets a new member, a martial eagle named Anga who replaces Ono's position as the new keenest of sight after Ono temporarily lost his eyesight, while Ono gains a new position as the smartest.\n\nOnce reaching the Tree of Life, the Lion Guard assists in defending the safe haven from intruders together with the Night Pride, the royal family who rules the Tree of Life and its protectors. After Kion and Ono are healed, Jasiri and Janja comes looking for them and alerts them that Zira and her pride are back. The Lion Guard returns to the Pride Lands, only to find out that the conflict has already been settled.

However, after seeing Vitani's confidence in becoming a leader even without the Roar, Kion allows Vitani's Lion Guard to succeed his Guard as defenders of Pride Lands. Kion and his friends return to the Tree of Life where Kion marries Rani and is crowned King of the Tree of Life with his close family and friends attending.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Lion Guard episodes}}\n{{:List of The Lion Guard episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of The Lion King characters}}\n\n===The Lion Guard===\n* [[List of The Lion King characters#Kion|Kion]] (voiced by [[Max Charles]]<ref name=\"ew.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/11/lion-king-spinoff-voice-cast-rob-lowe-gabrielle-union|title=Lion King spinoff voice cast includes Rob Lowe, Gabrielle Union, James Earl Jones, and more - EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}</ref>, singing voice by Aaron Daniel Jacob in season 3) \u2013 A lion who is Simba and Nala's second born cub, Mufasa's grandson, Kiara's younger brother, the Prince of the Pride Lands and the leader of the Lion Guard as well as its fiercest member.

Speedwagon''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] [[Band (rock and pop)|band]] from [[Champaign, Illinois]]. Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. The group's best-selling album, ''[[Hi Infidelity]]'' (1980), contained four US Top 40 hits and sold more than 10 million copies.\n\nOver the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted 13 Top 40 hits, including the number ones \"[[Keep On Loving You (song)|Keep On Loving You]]\" and \"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\". REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity waned in the late 1980s, but the band remains a popular live act.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\n[[File:REO half ton Speedwagon.jpeg|thumb|250px|Advertisement for an REO Speed Wagon]] \nIn the fall of 1966, Neal Doughty entered the electrical engineering program at the [[University of Illinois]] in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], [[Illinois]], as a junior. On his first night, he met fellow student Alan Gratzer. They held an impromptu jam session in the basement of their [[UIUC Residence Halls|Illinois Street Residence]] Hall dormitory<ref name=\"mtv.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/reo_speedwagon/artist.jhtml#bio |title=REO Speedwagon &#124; New Music And Songs |website=Mtv.com|date= |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=NG2017>{{cite news|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/section/answerbook/famous-residents-former-residents.html |title=Famous residents, former residents |newspaper=[[Champaign News-Gazette]] |date=January 15, 2017 |accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref> and soon started a rock band. Gratzer had been a drummer since high school, and was playing in a local group on the weekends, while Doughty had learned some [[The Beatles|Beatles]] songs on his parents' piano.\n\nDoughty began to follow Gratzer's band, eventually sitting in on a song or two. The keyboard player was the leader, but several other band members were unhappy with the situation. On the last day of the university's spring semester, guitarist Joe Matt called the band's leader and told him that he, drummer Gratzer, and bassist Mike Blair had decided to leave the band to start a new one with Doughty.\n\nThey made a list of songs to learn over the summer break, and Doughty landed a summer job to buy his first keyboard. On his [[Farfisa]] organ, he learned \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by [[The Doors]]. The members returned to school in the fall of 1967, and had their first rehearsal before classes started. They named the band REO Speedwagon, from the [[REO Speed Wagon]], a 1915 truck that was designed by [[Ransom E. Olds|Ransom Eli Olds]].<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1006}}</ref>  Doughty had seen the name written across the blackboard when he walked into his History of Transportation class on the first day they had decided to look for a name. Rather than pronouncing REO as a single word as the motor company did, they chose to spell out the name with the individual letters each pronounced (\"R-E-O\"). An advertisement in the school newspaper produced their first job, a fraternity party that turned into a food fight. They continued to perform [[cover songs]] in campus bars, fraternity parties, and university events. The first lineup consisted of Doughty on keyboards, Gratzer on drums and vocals, Joe Matt on guitar and vocals, Mike Blair on bass and vocals.\n\nIn early 1968, [[Terry Luttrell]] became lead singer, and Bob Crownover joined as the guitar player, replacing Matt.  When Mike Blair left the band in the summer of 1968, Gregg Philbin replaced Blair, Marty Shepard played trumpet and Joe McCabe played sax until McCabe moved to [[Southern Illinois University]]. Crownover played guitar for the group until the summer of 1969 when [[Bill Fiorio]] replaced him. Fiorio then departed in late 1969, eventually assuming the name [[Duke Tumatoe]], and went on to form the All Star Frogs. Steve Scorfina (who would go on to found [[progressive rock]]/[[album-oriented rock]] band [[Pavlov's Dog (band)|Pavlov's Dog]]) came aboard for over a year, composing with the band and performing live, before being replaced by [[Gary Richrath]] in late 1970.\n\nRichrath was a [[Peoria, Illinois]]-based guitarist and prolific [[songwriter]] who brought fresh original material to the band. Richrath had driven 100 miles (160km) to see the band and become a part of it.  He is quoted as saying \"I'm going to be a part of that band whether they like it or not\", and then went about making it happen.  With Richrath on board, the regional popularity of the band grew tremendously. The Midwestern United States was the original REO Speedwagon fan stronghold and is pivotal in this period of the band's history.\n\nThe band signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1971.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> [[Paul Leka]], an [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] record producer, brought the band to his [[recording studio]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]] where it recorded original material for its first album. The lineup on the first album consisted of Richrath, Gratzer, Doughty, Philbin, and Luttrell.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Early  years===\nWith their equipment being hauled to dates in a friend's station wagon, REO played bars and clubs all over the Midwest. The band's debut album, ''[[R.E.O. Speedwagon (album)|R.E.O. Speedwagon]]'', was released on [[Epic Records]] in 1971.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The most popular track on this record was \"[[157 Riverside Avenue]]\". The title refers to the [[Westport, Connecticut]] address, where the band stayed while recording in Leka's studio in Bridgeport and remains an in-concert favorite.\n\nAlthough the rest of the band's lineup remained stable, REO Speedwagon switched lead vocalists three times for their first three albums. Luttrell left the band in early 1972, eventually becoming the vocalist for [[Starcastle]]. He was replaced by [[Kevin Cronin]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Cronin recorded one album with the band, 1972's ''[[R.E.O./T.W.O.]]'' but left the band during the recording sessions for 1973's ''[[Ridin' the Storm Out]]'' because of internal conflicts.<ref>{{cite news| work= [[People (magazine)|People]]  |title= Now It's Cheat to the Beat, as Reo Speedwagon Finally Arrives with 'Hi Infidelity' |first= David |last= Sheff |date= March 23, 1981 |volume= 15| number= 11| url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20078872,00.html | accessdate=August 19, 2010}}</ref> ''Ridin' the Storm Out'' was completed with Michael Bryan Murphy on lead vocal, and featured Neal Doughty's \"wailing storm siren\" entrance on the title track. Murphy stayed on for two more albums, ''[[Lost in a Dream (REO Speedwagon album)|Lost in a Dream]]'' and ''[[This Time We Mean It]]'', before Cronin returned to the fold in January 1976 and recorded ''[[R.E.O. (album)|R.E.O.]]'', which was released that same year.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nCronin's return came after [[Greg X. Volz]] turned down the position for lead vocalist after becoming a born-again Christian.\n\nIn 1977, REO convinced Epic Records that their strength was in their live performances. Epic agreed to let them produce their first live album, ''[[Live: You Get What You Play For]]'', which was eventually [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> That same year, the band moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\nIn 1977, bassist Gregg Philbin left the band.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Depending upon which band member is expressing an opinion, it was either because Philbin was disenchanted with the new corporate-structure REO where Cronin and Richrath got bigger slices of the pie instead of the equal credit they once shared as a \"garage band\", or he was asked to leave over his lifestyle issues affecting the music quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/REO-Speedwagon-2571/Gregg-Philbin.htm |title=REO Speedwagon |website=En.allexperts.com |accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref> Philbin was replaced with another Champaign, Illinois musician, [[Centennial High School (Champaign, Illinois)|Centennial High School]] alumnus, [[Bruce Hall (musician)|Bruce Hall]],<ref name=NG2017 /> to record ''[[You Can Tune a Piano but You Can't Tuna Fish]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album was released in 1978 and has received [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio airplay over the years, thanks to songs like \"Roll with the Changes\" and \"Time for Me to Fly\". The album was REO's first to make the Top 40, peaking at #29. The album went on to sell over two million copies in the US, ultimately achieving [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] status.\n\nIn 1979, the band took a turn back to hard rock with the release of ''[[Nine Lives (REO Speedwagon album)|Nine Lives]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Mainstream success===\nOn November 21, 1980, Epic released ''[[Hi Infidelity]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which represented a change in sound, going from [[hard rock]] to more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented material.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> ''Hi Infidelity'' spawned four hit singles written by Richrath and Cronin, including the chart-topping \"[[Keep On Loving You (song)|Keep On Loving You]]\" (Cronin),<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> plus \"[[Take It on the Run]]\" (#5) (Richrath), \"[[In Your Letter]]\" (#20) (Richrath), and \"[[Don't Let Him Go]]\" (#24) (Cronin), and remained on the charts for 65 weeks, 32 of which were spent in the top ten, including 15 weeks atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''Hi Infidelity'' sold over 10 million copies.\n\nThe band's follow-up album, ''[[Good Trouble]]'', was released in June 1982.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Although it was not as successful as its predecessor, the album performed moderately well commercially, featuring the hit singles \"[[Keep the Fire Burnin' (REO Speedwagon song)|Keep the Fire Burnin']]\" (U.S. #7), \"Sweet Time\" (U.S. #26) and the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock chart]] hit \"The Key.\"\n\nThe band came storming back two years later with ''[[Wheels Are Turnin']]'', an album that included the #1 hit single \"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\" plus three more hits: \"[[I Do' Wanna Know]]\" (U.S. #29), \"[[One Lonely Night (song)|One Lonely Night]]\" (U.S. #19), and \"Live Every Moment\" (U.S. #34).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nREO Speedwagon toured the US in 1985, including a sold-out concert in Madison, Wisconsin in May.<ref name=\"Inc.1985\">{{cite book|title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts|work=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT48|date=1 June 1985 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=48\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> On July 13, on the way to a show in Milwaukee, the band made a stop in Philadelphia to play at the US leg of [[Live Aid]], which broke a record for number of viewers. They performed \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" and \"Roll With the Changes,\" which featured members of [[the Beach Boys]], the band members' families, and [[Paul Shaffer]] on stage for backing vocals.\n\n1987's ''[[Life as We Know It (REO Speedwagon album)|Life as We Know It]]'' saw a decline in sales,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> but still managed to provide the band with the top-20 hits \"That Ain't Love\" (U.S. #16) and \"[[In My Dreams (REO Speedwagon song)|In My Dreams]]\" (U.S. #19).<ref>{{cite magazine | url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=reo speedwagon|chart=all}} | title=Artist Chart History - REO Speedwagon|magazine=Billboard.com | accessdate=May 9, 2009}}</ref> ''[[The Hits (REO Speedwagon album)|The Hits]]'' (1988) is a compilation album from REO Speedwagon.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It contains the new tracks \"Here With Me\" and \"I Don't Want to Lose You.\" They were the last songs recorded with Gary Richrath and Alan Gratzer. \"Here with Me\" cracked the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top ten on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\n===Changes in the 1990s===\nBy the late 1980s, the band's popularity was starting to decline.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Original drummer Alan Gratzer left in September 1988 after he decided to retire from music to open a restaurant. In early 1989, Gary Richrath quit after tensions between him and Kevin Cronin boiled over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6700404/reo-speedwagon-gary-richrath-kevin-cronin-interview|title=REO Speedwagon Will Dedicate Every Show to Late Guitarist Gary Richrath 'Probably Forever'|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Cronin had been playing in The Strolling Dudes, a jazz ensemble that included jazz trumpet player [[Rick Braun]] (who had co-written the abovementioned \"Here With Me\" with Cronin), Miles Joseph on lead guitar and [[Graham Lear]] on drums. Lear had already been invited to join REO in September 1988 as Gratzer's successor and Joseph was brought in as a temporary stand-in for Richrath. Back up singers Carla Day and Melanie Jackson were also added. This lineup did only one show, on January 7, 1989 in [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]], [[Chile]], where it won the award for best group at the city's annual International Song Festival. After that, Miles Joseph and the back up singers were dropped in favor of former [[Ted Nugent]] guitarist [[Dave Amato]] (who was brought aboard in May 1989) and keyboardist/songwriter/producer [[Jesse Harms]].\n\nThe 1990 release ''[[The Earth, a Small Man, His Dog and a Chicken]]'', with [[Bryan Hitt]] (formerly of [[Wang Chung (band)|Wang Chung]]) on drums, was a commercial disappointment.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album produced only one, and - to date - the band's last [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] single, \"[[Love Is a Rock]],\" which peaked at #65. Harms, disenchanted by the album's failure, left the group in early 1991.\n\nShortly after his departure, Richrath assembled former members of the Midwestern band Vancouver to form a namesake band, Richrath. After touring for several years, the Richrath band released ''Only the Strong Survive'' in 1992 on the [[GNP Crescendo Record Co.|GNP Crescendo]] label. Richrath (the band) continued to perform for several years before disbanding in the late 1990s. In September 1998, Gary Richrath briefly joined REO onstage at the County Fair in Los Angeles to play on the band's encore song, \"157 Riverside Avenue\". He then joined REO once again in Los Angeles in May 2000 for the same encore but no serious plans for a reunion ever materialized.\n\nHaving lost their recording contract with Epic, REO Speedwagon ended up releasing ''[[Building the Bridge]]'' (1996) on the Priority/Rhythm Safari label. When that label went [[bankrupt]], the album was released on [[Sanctuary Records|Castle Records]], which also experienced financial troubles. REO Speedwagon ultimately self-financed this effort, which failed to chart. The title track did make R&R's AC Top 30 chart.\n\n===Revival of the hits===\nThe commercial failure of the band's newer material with its revised lineup demanded a change in marketing strategy. As a consequence, Epic began re-releasing recordings from older albums with updated artwork and design.\n\nFrom 1995 to the present, the label released over a dozen compilation albums featuring greatest hits, including 1999's ''[[The Ballads (REO Speedwagon album)|The Ballads]]''. In 2000, REO teamed up with [[Styx (band)|Styx]] for an appearance at [[Riverport Amphitheater]] in [[St. Louis]], which was released as a live concert video ''[[Arch Allies: Live at Riverport]]''.

Speedwagon''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] [[Band (rock and pop)|band]] from [[Champaign, Illinois]]. Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. The group's best-selling album, ''[[Hi Infidelity]]'' (1980), contained four US Top 40 hits and sold more than 10 million copies.\n\nOver the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted 13 Top 40 hits, including the number ones \"[[Keep On Loving You (song)|Keep On Loving You]]\" and \"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\". REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity waned in the late 1980s, but the band remains a popular live act.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\n[[File:REO half ton Speedwagon.jpeg|thumb|250px|Advertisement for an REO Speed Wagon]] \nIn the fall of 1966, Neal Doughty entered the electrical engineering program at the [[University of Illinois]] in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], [[Illinois]], as a junior. On his first night, he met fellow student Alan Gratzer. They held an impromptu jam session in the basement of their [[UIUC Residence Halls|Illinois Street Residence]] Hall dormitory<ref name=\"mtv.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/reo_speedwagon/artist.jhtml#bio |title=REO Speedwagon &#124; New Music And Songs |website=Mtv.com|date= |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=NG2017>{{cite news|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/section/answerbook/famous-residents-former-residents.html |title=Famous residents, former residents |newspaper=[[Champaign News-Gazette]] |date=January 15, 2017 |accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref> and soon started a rock band. Gratzer had been a drummer since high school, and was playing in a local group on the weekends, while Doughty had learned some [[The Beatles|Beatles]] songs on his parents' piano.\n\nDoughty began to follow Gratzer's band, eventually sitting in on a song or two. The keyboard player was the leader, but several other band members were unhappy with the situation. On the last day of the university's spring semester, guitarist Joe Matt called the band's leader and told him that he, drummer Gratzer, and bassist Mike Blair had decided to leave the band to start a new one with Doughty.\n\nThey made a list of songs to learn over the summer break, and Doughty landed a summer job to buy his first keyboard. On his [[Farfisa]] organ, he learned \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by [[The Doors]]. The members returned to school in the fall of 1967, and had their first rehearsal before classes started. They named the band REO Speedwagon, from the [[REO Speed Wagon]], a 1915 truck that was designed by [[Ransom E. Olds|Ransom Eli Olds]].<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1006}}</ref>  Doughty had seen the name written across the blackboard when he walked into his History of Transportation class on the first day they had decided to look for a name. Rather than pronouncing REO as a single word as the motor company did, they chose to spell out the name with the individual letters each pronounced (\"R-E-O\"). An advertisement in the school newspaper produced their first job, a fraternity party that turned into a food fight. They continued to perform [[cover songs]] in campus bars, fraternity parties, and university events. The first lineup consisted of Doughty on keyboards, Gratzer on drums and vocals, Joe Matt on guitar and vocals, Mike Blair on bass and vocals.\n\nIn early 1968, [[Terry Luttrell]] became lead singer, and Bob Crownover joined as the guitar player, replacing Matt.  When Mike Blair left the band in the summer of 1968, Gregg Philbin replaced Blair, Marty Shepard played trumpet and Joe McCabe played sax until McCabe moved to [[Southern Illinois University]]. Crownover played guitar for the group until the summer of 1969 when [[Bill Fiorio]] replaced him. Fiorio then departed in late 1969, eventually assuming the name [[Duke Tumatoe]], and went on to form the All Star Frogs. Steve Scorfina (who would go on to found [[progressive rock]]/[[album-oriented rock]] band [[Pavlov's Dog (band)|Pavlov's Dog]]) came aboard for over a year, composing with the band and performing live, before being replaced by [[Gary Richrath]] in late 1970.\n\nRichrath was a [[Peoria, Illinois]]-based guitarist and prolific [[songwriter]] who brought fresh original material to the band. Richrath had driven 100 miles (160km) to see the band and become a part of it.  He is quoted as saying \"I'm going to be a part of that band whether they like it or not\", and then went about making it happen.  With Richrath on board, the regional popularity of the band grew tremendously. The Midwestern United States was the original REO Speedwagon fan stronghold and is pivotal in this period of the band's history.\n\nThe band signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1971.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> [[Paul Leka]], an [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] record producer, brought the band to his [[recording studio]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]] where it recorded original material for its first album. The lineup on the first album consisted of Richrath, Gratzer, Doughty, Philbin, and Luttrell.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Early  years===\nWith their equipment being hauled to dates in a friend's station wagon, REO played bars and clubs all over the Midwest. The band's debut album, ''[[R.E.O. Speedwagon (album)|R.E.O. Speedwagon]]'', was released on [[Epic Records]] in 1971.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The most popular track on this record was \"[[157 Riverside Avenue]]\". The title refers to the [[Westport, Connecticut]] address, where the band stayed while recording in Leka's studio in Bridgeport and remains an in-concert favorite.\n\nAlthough the rest of the band's lineup remained stable, REO Speedwagon switched lead vocalists three times for their first three albums. Luttrell left the band in early 1972, eventually becoming the vocalist for [[Starcastle]]. He was replaced by [[Kevin Cronin]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Cronin recorded one album with the band, 1972's ''[[R.E.O./T.W.O.]]'' but left the band during the recording sessions for 1973's ''[[Ridin' the Storm Out]]'' because of internal conflicts.<ref>{{cite news| work= [[People (magazine)|People]]  |title= Now It's Cheat to the Beat, as Reo Speedwagon Finally Arrives with 'Hi Infidelity' |first= David |last= Sheff |date= March 23, 1981 |volume= 15| number= 11| url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20078872,00.html | accessdate=August 19, 2010}}</ref> ''Ridin' the Storm Out'' was completed with Michael Bryan Murphy on lead vocal, and featured Neal Doughty's \"wailing storm siren\" entrance on the title track. Murphy stayed on for two more albums, ''[[Lost in a Dream (REO Speedwagon album)|Lost in a Dream]]'' and ''[[This Time We Mean It]]'', before Cronin returned to the fold in January 1976 and recorded ''[[R.E.O. (album)|R.E.O.]]'', which was released that same year.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nCronin's return came after [[Greg X. Volz]] turned down the position for lead vocalist after becoming a born-again Christian.\n\nIn 1977, REO convinced Epic Records that their strength was in their live performances. Epic agreed to let them produce their first live album, ''[[Live: You Get What You Play For]]'', which was eventually [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> That same year, the band moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\nIn 1977, bassist Gregg Philbin left the band.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Depending upon which band member is expressing an opinion, it was either because Philbin was disenchanted with the new corporate-structure REO where Cronin and Richrath got bigger slices of the pie instead of the equal credit they once shared as a \"garage band\", or he was asked to leave over his lifestyle issues affecting the music quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/REO-Speedwagon-2571/Gregg-Philbin.htm |title=REO Speedwagon |website=En.allexperts.com |accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref> Philbin was replaced with another Champaign, Illinois musician, [[Centennial High School (Champaign, Illinois)|Centennial High School]] alumnus, [[Bruce Hall (musician)|Bruce Hall]],<ref name=NG2017 /> to record ''[[You Can Tune a Piano but You Can't Tuna Fish]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album was released in 1978 and has received [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio airplay over the years, thanks to songs like \"Roll with the Changes\" and \"Time for Me to Fly\". The album was REO's first to make the Top 40, peaking at #29. The album went on to sell over two million copies in the US, ultimately achieving [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] status.\n\nIn 1979, the band took a turn back to hard rock with the release of ''[[Nine Lives (REO Speedwagon album)|Nine Lives]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Mainstream success===\nOn November 21, 1980, Epic released ''[[Hi Infidelity]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which represented a change in sound, going from [[hard rock]] to more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented material.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> ''Hi Infidelity'' spawned four hit singles written by Richrath and Cronin, including the chart-topping \"[[Keep On Loving You (song)|Keep On Loving You]]\" (Cronin),<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> plus \"[[Take It on the Run]]\" (#5) (Richrath), \"[[In Your Letter]]\" (#20) (Richrath), and \"[[Don't Let Him Go]]\" (#24) (Cronin), and remained on the charts for 65 weeks, 32 of which were spent in the top ten, including 15 weeks atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''Hi Infidelity'' sold over 10 million copies.\n\nThe band's follow-up album, ''[[Good Trouble]]'', was released in June 1982.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Although it was not as successful as its predecessor, the album performed moderately well commercially, featuring the hit singles \"[[Keep the Fire Burnin' (REO Speedwagon song)|Keep the Fire Burnin']]\" (U.S. #7), \"Sweet Time\" (U.S. #26) and the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock chart]] hit \"The Key.\"\n\nThe band came storming back two years later with ''[[Wheels Are Turnin']]'', an album that included the #1 hit single \"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\" plus three more hits: \"[[I Do' Wanna Know]]\" (U.S. #29), \"[[One Lonely Night (song)|One Lonely Night]]\" (U.S. #19), and \"Live Every Moment\" (U.S. #34).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nREO Speedwagon toured the US in 1985, including a sold-out concert in Madison, Wisconsin in May.<ref name=\"Inc.1985\">{{cite book|title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts|work=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT48|date=1 June 1985 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=48\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> On July 13, on the way to a show in Milwaukee, the band made a stop in Philadelphia to play at the US leg of [[Live Aid]], which broke a record for number of viewers.

In early 1989, Gary Richrath quit after tensions between him and Kevin Cronin boiled over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6700404/reo-speedwagon-gary-richrath-kevin-cronin-interview|title=REO Speedwagon Will Dedicate Every Show to Late Guitarist Gary Richrath 'Probably Forever'|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Cronin had been playing in The Strolling Dudes, a jazz ensemble that included jazz trumpet player [[Rick Braun]] (who had co-written the abovementioned \"Here With Me\" with Cronin), Miles Joseph on lead guitar and [[Graham Lear]] on drums. Lear had already been invited to join REO in September 1988 as Gratzer's successor and Joseph was brought in as a temporary stand-in for Richrath. Back up singers Carla Day and Melanie Jackson were also added. This lineup did only one show, on January 7, 1989 in [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]], [[Chile]], where it won the award for best group at the city's annual International Song Festival. After that, Miles Joseph and the back up singers were dropped in favor of former [[Ted Nugent]] guitarist [[Dave Amato]] (who was brought aboard in May 1989) and keyboardist/songwriter/producer [[Jesse Harms]].\n\nThe 1990 release ''[[The Earth, a Small Man, His Dog and a Chicken]]'', with [[Bryan Hitt]] (formerly of [[Wang Chung (band)|Wang Chung]]) on drums, was a commercial disappointment.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album produced only one, and - to date - the band's last [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] single, \"[[Love Is a Rock]],\" which peaked at #65. Harms, disenchanted by the album's failure, left the group in early 1991.\n\nShortly after his departure, Richrath assembled former members of the Midwestern band Vancouver to form a namesake band, Richrath. After touring for several years, the Richrath band released ''Only the Strong Survive'' in 1992 on the [[GNP Crescendo Record Co.|GNP Crescendo]] label. Richrath (the band) continued to perform for several years before disbanding in the late 1990s. In September 1998, Gary Richrath briefly joined REO onstage at the County Fair in Los Angeles to play on the band's encore song, \"157 Riverside Avenue\". He then joined REO once again in Los Angeles in May 2000 for the same encore but no serious plans for a reunion ever materialized.\n\nHaving lost their recording contract with Epic, REO Speedwagon ended up releasing ''[[Building the Bridge]]'' (1996) on the Priority/Rhythm Safari label. When that label went [[bankrupt]], the album was released on [[Sanctuary Records|Castle Records]], which also experienced financial troubles. REO Speedwagon ultimately self-financed this effort, which failed to chart. The title track did make R&R's AC Top 30 chart.\n\n===Revival of the hits===\nThe commercial failure of the band's newer material with its revised lineup demanded a change in marketing strategy. As a consequence, Epic began re-releasing recordings from older albums with updated artwork and design.\n\nFrom 1995 to the present, the label released over a dozen compilation albums featuring greatest hits, including 1999's ''[[The Ballads (REO Speedwagon album)|The Ballads]]''. In 2000, REO teamed up with [[Styx (band)|Styx]] for an appearance at [[Riverport Amphitheater]] in [[St. Louis]], which was released as a live concert video ''[[Arch Allies: Live at Riverport]]''. The REO portion of the show was released again under three separate titles: ''Live - Plus'' (2001), ''Live Plus 3'' (2001) and ''Extended Versions'' (2001) (which was [[RIAA certification|certified gold]] by the RIAA on April 26, 2006). REO once again teamed with Styx in 2003 for the Classic Rock's Main Event tour which also included another band from their common rock era, [[Journey (band)|Journey]].\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nThe band released a self-financed album entitled ''[[Find Your Own Way Home]]'' in April 2007. Though it did not chart as an album, it produced two singles which appeared on [[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'s [[Adult contemporary music|Adult Contemporary]] radio chart.\n\nREO Speedwagon continues to tour regularly, performing mostly their classic hits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.louisville.com/content/reo-speedwagons-kevin-cronin-louisville-power-ballads-and-if-my-wifes-slut | title=REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin on Louisville, power ballads and if my wife's a slut|website=Louisville.com | accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref> They teamed up with [[Styx (band)|Styx]] to record a new single entitled \"Can't Stop Rockin'\", released in March 2009, as well as for a full tour that included special guest [[38 Special (band)|.38 Special]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269330/styx-reo-speedwagon-team-up-for-rockin-tour-single | title=Styx, REO Speedwagon Team Up For \"Rockin'\" Tour, Single | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, REO Speedwagon released a Christmas album, ''[[Not So Silent Night...Christmas with REO Speedwagon]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=100890339&blogId=509425779 |title=Myspace |website=Blogs.myspace.com |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808161408/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=100890339&blogId=509425779 |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On December 2, the band released an online [[video game]], ''Find Your Own Way Home'', produced by digital design agency Curious Sense.

Richrath stayed on stage to help with the encore of \"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\" along with REO, Styx, Richard Marx, and others.
