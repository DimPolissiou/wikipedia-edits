It was part of the \"[[Black Reichswehr]]\" and in the late days of the [[Weimar Republic]] operated as the armed branch of the national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), placed at party gatherings in the position of armed security guards (''Saalschutz'').\n\n==Weimar Republic==\nThe ''Stahlhelm'' was formed on December 25, 1918, in [[Magdeburg]], [[Germany]], by the factory owner and war-disabled [[Military reserve force|reserve]] officer [[Franz Seldte]]. After the [[armistice with Germany|November 11 Armistice]], the Army had been split up and the newly established German ''[[Reichswehr]]'' according to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was to be confined to no more than 100,000 men. Similar to the numerous ''[[Freikorps]]'', which upon the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|Revolution of 1918\u20131919]] were temporarily backed by the [[Council of the People's Deputies]] under Chancellor [[Friedrich Ebert]] ([[Ebert\u2013Groener pact]]), the ''Stahlhelm'' ex-servicemen's organization was meant to form a [[paramilitary]] organization. \n\nThe league was a rallying point for [[Revanchism|revanchist]] and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]] forces from the beginning. Within the organization a worldview oriented toward the prior [[German Empire|Imperial]] regime and the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] monarchy predominated, many of its members promoting the ''Dolchstosslegende'' (\"[[Stab-in-the-back legend]]\") and the \"November Criminals\" bias against the [[Weimar Coalition]] government. Its journal, ''Der Stahlhelm'', was edited by Count [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Blumenthal]], later hanged for his part in the [[July 20 plot]]. Financing was provided by the ''Deutscher Herrenklub'', an association of German industrialists and [[business magnate]]s with elements of the [[East Elbia]]n landed gentry (''[[Junker (Prussia)|Junker]]''). [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] veterans were denied admission and formed a separate ''[[Reichsbund j\u00fcdischer Frontsoldaten]]''.\n\nAfter the failed [[Kapp Putsch]] of 1920, the organization gained further support from dissolved ''Freikorps'' units. In 1923 the former DNVP politician [[Theodor Duesterberg]] joined the ''Stahlhelm'' and quickly rose to Seldte's deputy and long\u2013time rival. From 1924 on, in several subsidiary organizations, veterans with front line experience as well as new recruits would provide a standing armed force in support of the ''Reichswehr'' beyond the 100,000 men allowed. With 500,000 members in 1930, the league was the largest paramilitary organization of [[Weimar Republic]]. In the 1920s the ''Stahlhelm'' received political support from Fascist Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]].<ref>Stanley G. Payne. ''Fascism: Comparison and Definition''.

Its goals were a German dictatorship, the preparation of a revanchist program, and the direction of local anti-parliamentarian action. For political reasons its members distinguished themselves from the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) as \"German [[Fascism|Fascists]]\". Among their further demands were the establishment of a Greater Germanic People's Reich, struggle against [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democracy]], the \"mercantilism of the Jews\" and the general liberal democratic worldview, and attempted without success to place candidates favorable to the politics of a renewed German [[Drang nach Osten|expansion to the East]].\n\nIn 1929 the ''Stahlhelm'' supported the \"Peoples' Initiative\" of DNVP leader [[Alfred Hugenberg]] and the Nazis to initiate a [[1929 German referendum|German referendum]] against the [[Young Plan]] on [[World War I reparations]] in order to overthrow the government of Chancellor [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]]. In 1931 they proposed another [[1931 Prussian Landtag referendum|referendum for the dissolution of the Prussian Landtag]]. After both these referenda failed to reach the 50% necessary to be declared valid, the organization in October 1931 joined another attempt of DNVP, NSDAP and [[Pan-German League]] to form the [[Harzburg Front]], a united [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] campaign against the Weimar Republic and Chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]]. However, the front soon broke up and in the first round of the 1932 [[1932 German presidential election|German presidential election]], Theodor Duesterberg ran as ''Stahlhelm'' candidate against incumbent [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Facing a massive Nazi campaign reproaching him with a non-pure \"[[Aryan race|Aryan]]\" ancestry he only gained 6.8% of the votes cast.\n\n==Nazi ''Machtergreifung''==\n[[File:Naziuniformen 1934.jpg|thumb|left|''Der Stahlhelm'' in uniform, [[Circa|ca.]] 1934]]\nAfter the Nazi [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]] on January 30, 1933, the new authorities urged for a merge into the party's ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) paramilitary organization. [[Franz Seldte]] joined the [[Hitler Cabinet]] as Reich Minister for Labour, prevailing against Duesterberg. The ''Stahlhelm'' still tried to keep its distance from the Nazis, and in the run-up to the [[March 1933 German federal election|German federal election]] of 5 March 1933 formed the united conservative \"Black-White-Red Struggle Front\" (''Kampffront Schwarz-Wei\u00df-Rot'') with the DNVP and the [[Agricultural League]], reaching 8% of the votes. On March 27, 1933, a SA raid with the intention of disarmament on ''Stahlhelm'' members in [[Braunschweig]], who under the command of [[Werner Schrader]] had forged an alliance with scattered Republican ''[[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]]'' forces. The violent incident initiated by Nazi Minister [[Dietrich Klagges]] and later called ''Stahlhelm Putsch'' was characteristic of the pressure applied by the Nazis on the ''Stahlhelm'' in this period, mistrusting the organization due to its fundamentally [[monarchist]] character. In April Seldte applied for membership in the NSDAP and also joined the SA, from August 1933 in the rank of an ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.\n\nOn April 27, 1933, Seldte had officially declared the ''Stahlhelm'' subordinate to Hitler's command. The attempts by the Nazis to integrate the ''Stahlhelm'' succeeded in 1934 in the course of the \"voluntary\" ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process: the organization was renamed ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Frontk\u00e4mpferbund'' (League of National Socialist Frontline-Fighters) while large parts were merged into the SA as ''Wehrstahlhelm'', ''Reserve I'' and ''Reserve II'' contingents. The remaining ''Frontk\u00e4mpferbund'' veterans' units were finally dissolved by decree of Adolf Hitler on November 7, 1935. Seldte's rival Duesterberg was interned at [[Dachau concentration camp]] upon the [[Night of the Long Knives]] at the beginning of July 1934, but released soon after.\n\n==Ranks==\n[[File:Stahlhelm (N&H) obverse 1.JPG|thumb|A Stahlhelm membership stickpin]]\n*Wehrmann\n*Oberwehrmann\n*Stabswehrmann\n*Gruppenf\u00fchrer\n*Feldmeister\n*Oberfeldmeister\n*Zugf\u00fchrer\n*Oberzugf\u00fchrer\n*Kompanief\u00fchrer\n*Bataillonsf\u00fchrer\n*Stabsf\u00fchrer\n*Regimentsf\u00fchrer\n*Brigadef\u00fchrer\n*Divisionsf\u00fchrer\n*Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\n*Bundeshauptmann\n*Bundesf\u00fchrer\n\n==See also==\n*[[Weimar paramilitary groups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Tauber |first=Kurt |year=1967 |title=[[Beyond Eagle and Swastika]]: German Nationalism Since 1945 |location=Middletown, Conn. |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n<!--\n  ===============================================================================\n   WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A COLLECTION OF LINKS.

It lies in the historical region of [[Cieszyn Silesia]].\n\n== History ==\nThe village was established by [[Kazimierz I of Cieszyn|Kazimierz]], [[Duke of Cieszyn]] in 1353. The name of the village is derived from [[beech]] forests that grew there - ''buk'' is a Slavic root for beech. The first settlers lived mainly off the logging of local beech forests. After 200 years, the village gained a farming-pasture character. Pastures were established on nearby hills. The number of inhabitants rose very slowly. By 1647, only 20 people lived there. Settlers had many children and soon number of inhabitants rose. They lived in wooden houses.\n\nSince the 18th century, villagers lived mainly off the transport of salt from [[Wieliczka Salt Mine|Wieliczka]] to [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w]], farming, transport of wood and [[smithing]]. Later they worked in [[coal mining]] and metallurgy. From the interwar period until after [[World War II]], smuggling was widespread, as in other villages near the borders.\n\nAfter [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]] a modern [[municipality|municipal division]] was introduced in the re-established [[Austrian Silesia]]. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the [[Districts of Austria|political district]] of [[Cieszyn]] and the [[legal district]] of [[Jablunkov]].

It lies in the historical region of [[Cieszyn Silesia]].\n\n== History ==\nThe village was established by [[Kazimierz I of Cieszyn|Kazimierz]], [[Duke of Cieszyn]] in 1353. The name of the village is derived from [[beech]] forests that grew there - ''buk'' is a Slavic root for beech. The first settlers lived mainly off the logging of local beech forests. After 200 years, the village gained a farming-pasture character. Pastures were established on nearby hills. The number of inhabitants rose very slowly. By 1647, only 20 people lived there. Settlers had many children and soon number of inhabitants rose. They lived in wooden houses.\n\nSince the 18th century, villagers lived mainly off the transport of salt from [[Wieliczka Salt Mine|Wieliczka]] to [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w]], farming, transport of wood and [[smithing]]. Later they worked in [[coal mining]] and metallurgy. From the interwar period until after [[World War II]], smuggling was widespread, as in other villages near the borders.\n\nAfter [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]] a modern [[municipality|municipal division]] was introduced in the re-established [[Austrian Silesia]]. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the [[Districts of Austria|political district]] of [[Cieszyn]] and the [[legal district]] of [[Jablunkov]]. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 844 in 1880 to 1,071 in 1910 with the majority being native Polish-speakers (between 97.7% and 99.9%) accompanied by German-speaking (at most 19 or 2% in 1890) and Czech-speaking people (at most 3 or 0.3% in 1890).

He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a similarly strong ability with [[The Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only two characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received an overwhelmingly positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has claimed the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same alien species as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]].<ref

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies.

He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a similarly strong ability with [[The Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only two characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received an overwhelmingly positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has claimed the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same alien species as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]].<ref

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly [[arm wrestling]] match.

Miller suggested the Child could be putting on a similar performance.<ref name=\"Miller1218\" /> One fan theory suggests the Child could be related to a prophecy in a past ''Star Wars'' work that predicted an evil that could consume the galaxy. The prophecy, described in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Master and Apprentice]]'' (2019), says: \"The danger of the past is not past, but sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the galaxy entire.\" Fans theorized this could refer to the Child, who sleeps in an egg-like bassinet in ''The Mandalorian''.<ref name=\"Abdulbaki0106\" /> Others have theorized the reason the Imperial remnant wants the Child is to turn him over to the Dark Side of the Force,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /> or for use as a weapon.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> Moff Gideon in the season finale says: \"You may think you have some idea what you\u2019re in possession of, but you do not.\" Peter Foy of ''Comic Book Resources'' suggested this could allude to the Child's potential to cause mass destruction.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" />\n\nCaitlin Gallagher of ''[[Bustle (website)|Bustle]]'' suggested rather than building toward the Child becoming evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> All season long, the Child has witnessed those around him committing violent acts.<ref name=\"Milner1222\">{{cite news |last=Milner |first=Sarah Bea |title=The Mandalorian: Baby Yoda Learns About Good & Bad In A Powerful Way |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 22, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223125659/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |archive-date=December 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> For example, ''Vulture'' writer Keith Phipps noticed that when IG-11 kills multiple stormtroopers in front of him, the Child has a \"look of wonder\" in his eyes, which Phipps said \"is hilarious, but also a little chilling\".<ref name=\"Phipps1227\" /> Some writers applied a [[nature versus nurture]] argument to this, contending the Child is becoming violent because of what he is learning based on the actions around him.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> This suggests the Child is not inherently good or evil,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /><ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him.
