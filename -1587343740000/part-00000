{"title_page": "Olonkho", "text_new": "'''Olonkho''' ({{lang-ru|\u041e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0445\u043e\u0301}}, {{lang-sah|\u041e\u043b\u043e\u04a5\u0445\u043e}}) is a series of [[Epic Poetry|heroic epic]] tales of the [[Yakuts]] and one of the oldest epic arts of the [[Turkic peoples]]. The term refers to the entire Sakha epic tradition as well as its central epic.\n\nThere are over one hundred poem epics recorded of which a small number have been published - each can contain several tens of thousands of verses. As originally performed the epics were narrated/sung not written, with each character or principle indicated by the tone and musicality of the performer's voice. The poems contain numerous literary devices including metaphor, simile, etc. and contain fantastical elements and archaic concepts. They are thought to originate from times when the ancestors of the Yakuts lived further south. Oral performance of an Olonho contains both spoken (descriptions) and sung (dialogue) parts.\n\nThe epics were first recorded by westerners after the [[Russian conquest of Siberia]] starting in the 18th century onwards. Western exiles to Siberia during the 19th century made major contributions to the recording of these epic, and after the formation of the [[Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], government-backed organisations took part in collating and archiving versions of the epics.\n\nThe best known Olonho \"Nyurgun Bootur the Swift\", consists of more than 36,000 verses, and has been translated into several languages.\n\n==Performance and presentation==\nIn their original form, Olonkho was an orally presented epic 'sung' by a narrator. Difference characters, male/female, good/evil etc. were distinguished only by the performer's voice using intonation and melody.{{sfn|Nakhodkina|2014|p=275}} They contain archaic language, complex grammar, fantastic and symbolic imagery, as well as metaphor, simile, epithets, and hyperbole.{{sfn|Nakhodkina|2014|p=275}}\n\nThe Olonho poems vary from a few thousand up to forty thousand verses in length\n{{sfn|Kiri\u015f\u00e7io\u011flu|2003|p=227}} Typically an Olonkho performance would last 7\u20138 hours, starting at the beginning of an evening and continuing throughout the night, during which time approximately 7,000-8,000 lines of verse could be performed. Some Olonho may have taken over a month to complete.{{sfn|Illarionov|2013|pp=1-2}}\n\nThe beginning of a performance starts with a poetic recitation - other descriptive parts of the epic also take this form. Dialogue is sung. Gestures and facial expressions also form part of the performance.{{sfn|Illarionov|2013|p=2}}\n\nIn the 1930s, [[P.A. Oyunsky]] created written versions of the Olonhos in his own words, which are more suitable for reading, in part because he divided them into separate parts and songs.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=525-6}}{{sfn|Nakhodkina|2014|p=275}}\n\nThe Olonkho is still performed in the [[Sakha Republic]].<ref>{{citation| url = https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/olonkho-yakut-heroic-epos-00145| title = Olonkho, Yakut heroic epos |publisher =  UNESCO| access-date = 9 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Nyurgun Bootur the Swift==\n''[[Nyurgun Bootur the Swift]]'' is the most well known and widely disseminated of the Olonhos. [[Platon Oyunsky]] created a written version of the tale in the 1920s and 1930s. In terms of its impact, it is well known by most Yakut speakers, is used in teaching in the Yakut language, and is one of the few Olonhos to have been translated into a variety other languages. It is even considered to be a key part of the Sakha identity.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|pp=366-7}}\n\nOyunksy made an addition to the story when he added ''Taas kiele ogo'', a character who speaks about a core principle of the Sakha world view. This principle is rooted in the belief that there are three separate worlds - the upper world (\"gods\"), the middle world (\"people\"), and the lower world (\"devils\").{{sfn|Popova|2018|p=272}} It is considered taboo to upset the balance between the three worlds, for example when an inhabitant of one world fails to carry out their traditional role.{{sfn|Popova|2018|p=278}} In Oyunnsky's story, Taas kiele ogo becomes involved in the narrative because of an imbalance in the worlds, and {{harvnb|Popova|2018}} proposed that Oyunksy added the character to the tale to warn of contemporary and future threats to the Sakha (such as nuclear war).{{sfn|Popova|2018|loc=Conclusion|p=278}}\n\n[[Vladimir Derzhavin]] published the first Russian version of the tale, which was published in 1975. A Russian translation with notes was produced by [[Egor Sidorov]] in 2012. The first English translation was produced in the 1990s from the Russian translation by Vladimir Derzhavin. A translation of Oyunsky's text into English was published in 2014 as ''Olonkho: Nurgun Botur the Swift''. Other translations include: Slovak (Milo\u0161 Krno, 2012); Kyrgyz (2014); Evenki (Krivoshapkin-Nyimkalan, 1996-2003). A version for children was produced in French by  Jankel Karro and Lina Sabaraikina.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|pp=367-8}}\n\nA recording of the work by Yakut Gavril Kolesov was made in 1954 - and 8 hour recording with Kolesov was published by [[Melodiya]] in 1968.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|p=369}}\n\n===Derivative works===\n''Tuyaryma Kuo'' was created by Platon Oyunsky in the 1930s as a drama based on ''Nyurgun Bootur the Swift'' - it was first performed in 1937 at the Yakut National Theater. The main character, Tuyaryma Kuo, is a symbol of female beauty and character.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|p=369}}\n\nProse versions of the story in Yakut were made by Elena Sleptsova-Kuorsunnaakh in 2007, consisting of 201 tales.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|p=370}} The work has also been converted to cartoon form, in Yakut, as well as English and German voiced versions.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|p=370}}\n\n==Etymology and related terms==\nAssociated with the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] verb \"Olmak\", meaning \"to be\".<ref name=\"dic233\">{{citation| work = T\u00fcrk S\u00f6ylence S\u00f6zl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc [Turkish Mythology Dictionary]|first =  Deniz |last =  Karakurt | language = turkish | title = Olongo | page =233 | url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Turk_Soylence_Sozlugu.pdf | year =2011 |isbn\n = 978-605-5618-03-2 }}</ref> The [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] word ''\u00d6l\u00f6n'' also means \"saga\".<ref name=\"dic233\"/>\n\nWhilst the term ''Olonho'' refers to the saga/epic itself, an ''Olonhohut'' is the person/storyteller who performs the saga,{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=519}} and ''Olonholoo-'' is the act/art of presenting/performing the story in the form of words and sound.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=519-520}}\n\nThe [[Buryat-Mongol]] epic ''ontkno'' are thought to have the same name origin.{{sfn|Nakhodkina|2014|p=275}}\n\n==History==\n===Origins of Olonhos and Sakha===\nThe origins of the Olonho epics is of interest not only in the context of Yakutian history, but also in the wider field of comparative [[Turkic mythology]]. The Yakuts (whose ancestors are thought to originate in southern Siberia/central Asia) were broadly isolated from the rest of the Turkic world for approximately 1000 years - the Olonhos are thought to have retained many archaic aspects of ancient Turkic myths.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|loc=Abstract, Introduction|pp=194-5}}\n\nIn the late 19th century, thought that the Yakuts had their origin somewhere to the south of the  [[River Lena]], an idea which informed contemporary attempts at explanation of the origin of the Olonhos. In 1927 [[P.A. Oyunsky]] inferred that the Yakuts originated in the [[Aral Sea]] area, moving via the [[Transbaikal]] to the [[Lena River]] basin, using the Olonhos as a source themselves.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|p=195}}  Ethnographer [[G.V. Ksenofontov]] (1888\u20131938) proposed a southern origin for the Sakha - part of the evidence of this was a supposed oral chronicle preserved in the Olonho. Historian [[Georgiy Basharin]] also supported the idea of a southern origin, and suggested that the Olonhos arose together with the northern migration, and the people's struggle for 'nationhood'.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|pp=195-6}}\n\nIn the 1950s [[A.P. Okladnikov]] proposed the Olonhos represented a memory of the culture of the 'Sakha' before the northern migration to the Lena basin, and dates to a period when the Sakha's predecessors lived near the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] and [[Sayans]] with the Mongol's predecessors.  Okladnikov claimed there was linguistic evidence for an origin of the Yakut language not in the mid [[River Lena|Lena]] basin, but somewhere where other Turkic and Mongol peoples lived. He linked their origins to the western Baikal region, where the [[Orkhon-Yenisei script]] using [[Guligans]] and [[Qurykans]] lived, and suggested that those tribes ancestors were the Yakut's ancestors - so-called \"forest peoples\", who lived east of the [[Yenisei Kyrgyz]] in lowlands around the [[Selenga River]], on the banks of [[Lake Baikal]], and around  the [[Angara River]].{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|pp=197-8}}\n\nIn the 1970s [[G.U. Ergis]] suggested that the 7th century [[Orkhon Turks]] had folklore that corresponded to the beginnings of the Yakut's myths.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|p=198}} In the 2000s [[I.V. Pukhov]] made a comparative analysis of the epics of the Altain and Sayan peoples, and the Yakutian Olonho, finding similarity with the Altain [[Maaday-Kara]] epic, and commonalities with most epics of Turkic-speaking peoples in the Altai region.\n{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|pp=198-9}}\n\n[[Ye.M. Meletinskiy]] stated that the historical conditions of epic creation were those of a nomadic cattle breeding lifestyle, coupled with migrations, and conditions of rapidly forming military unions, conflicts, and other violence in a system of 'military democracy'.{{harvnb|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018}} state that the plots, characters, etc. of the Olonhos well match such conditions.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|p=202}}\n\n=== Olonho research and translation===\nThe [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] played a key role in the collection and publication of Olonho texts - though their primary purpose was the geographic and geological analysis of Siberia they also collected information about the region's inhabitants, and their cultures and languages.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=520}} Early collectors of Sakha culture included [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller]] and [[Yakov Ivanovich Lindenau]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=520}} During an expedition of 1842-5 biologist [[Alexander von Middendorff]] also collated a short section of the tale ''Eriedel Bergen'', published in 1878, becoming the first published Olonho.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=520-1}} A summary of ''Ereydeeh Buruuydaah Er Sogotoh'' by A. Y. Uvaroskiy was published in German translation in 1851 in the work ''\u00dcber Die Sprache Der Jakuten''.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=521}}\n\nP. K. Maak was an official in the B\u00fcl\u00fc\u00fc region ([[Verkhnevilyuysk]]) in the 1850s and compiled the ''Olonholoon Oburgu'' in his ''Vil\u00fcyskiy Okrug Yakutskaya Oblast'' (1887). Tsarist exile V. L. Serosevskiy compiled important information on the Onlonho tradition in his monograph ''Yakuti'', though he did not record any Olonhos.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=521}} A. Hudyakov also compiled some Olonhos and other oral material during his exile in [[Verkhoyansk]] between 1867 and 1874, including ''Haan Carg\u0131stay'', which was compiled as it was performed, and so represents the earliest useful source for the tradition.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=522}}\n\n[[E. K. Pekarsky]] was exiled to the region between 1881 and 1905, initially in Taatta ([[Tattinsky District]]), there drawing on the rich local oral tradition of ''olonhohutlar'' (epics), ''alg\u0131s\u00e7\u0131tlar'' (prayers), and ''oyuunlar'' (games). Helped by the local populace his compilation work continued until his death, producing records of folklore that continue to be important to later researchers.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=522}} An anthology of Sakha folklore ''Obrazts\u0131 Narodnoy Literatur\u0131 Yakutov'' [Examples of Yakut Folklore], the first volume of which was published in 1907, include work by Pekarsky as well as other researchers, including material from a research expedition of 1894-6 funded by gold mine owner [[Alexander Sibiryakov|Aleksander Mikhaylovich Sibiryakov]].{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=522}} This work focused mainly on the central region of Yakutia, including Taatta, Amma ([[Amginsky District]]), Uus Aldan ([[Ust-Aldansky District]]), Mene Hanalas, \u00c7urap\u00e7\u0131 ([[Churapchinsky District]]), and Cookuskay. Material from other regions remained essentially uncollated due to transportation difficulties.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=523-4}}\n\nThe publication of the series ''Obrazts\u0131 Narodnoy Literatur\u0131 Yakutov'' was a cultural turning point in the compilation and study of the Olonhos. A ''Slovar Yakutskogo Yaz\u0131ka'' [Sakha-Russian Dictionary] was published in 13 volumes between 1905 and 1930, also edited by Perkarskiy - examples of word usage drew on folklore and especially Olonho texts.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=524}}\n\nAnother exile [[S. V. Yastremskiy]] also made contributions to the study of Sakha culture. Having learnt the Sakha language he took part in the work funded by Sibiryakov, and translated full texts of ''Er Sogotoh'', ''Kulun Kullustur'', and ''S\u00fcn Caah\u0131n'' into Russian in the 1929 volume of ''Obrazts\u0131 Narodnoy Literatur\u0131 Yakutov''.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=524}}\n\n[[P. A. Oyuunuskay]] also made a very important contribution to the wider dissemination of the Olonho scholars. However, unlike previous researchers he did compile his version of the tales from the oral tradition, but instead wrote the Olonho in his own words - written between 1930 and 1937 ''Culuruyar Nurgun Bootur Olonhosu'' in nine episodes totalling 36,000 words. A ban on the publication of his works was not lifted until after [[Stalin]]'s death in 1953 - his works were published 1959\u201360 in seven volumes; the fourth, fifth and sixth volumes formed the ''Culuruyar Nurgun Bootur Olonhosu\u2019na''.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=525-6}}\n\nThe ''Saha Dili ve K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc Bilimsel Arast\u0131rma Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc'' [Sakha Institute of Language and Cultural Research] was formed in 1934, establishing folklore archives. In the late 1930s it began field expeditions to record oral culture in the region. After the great disruption of the [[Second World War]] the institute was renamed to ''Saha Dilini, Edebiyat\u0131n\u0131 ve Tarihini Arast\u0131rma Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc olarak degistirilir.'' in 1947.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=526-9}} In the 1960s and 70s focus of the institute switch to textual analysis rather than collation, Important works during this period include the ''Yakutskiy Geroi\u00e7eskiy Epos Olonho - Osnovn\u0131e Obraz\u0131'' [Main Characters of the Yakut Heroic Epics - Olonho] (V. Puhov, 1962); as well as ''O\u00e7erki Po Yakutskomu Folkloru'' [Essays on Yakut Folklore] (Ergis, 1974).{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=529-60}}\n\nImportant later publications include ''C\u0131r\u0131b\u0131na C\u0131r\u0131l\u0131atta K\u0131\u0131s Buhat\u0131\u0131r'' (1981), an Olonho whose main protagonist is a woman; and ''Kuruubay Haannaah Kulun Kullustuur'' (1985) published in a free Russian translation alongside the Sakha with the aim of both being as close to the original as possible.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=530-1}}\n\nIn 1997, Olonhos were recognized as part of \"Humanity's Oral and Intangible Heritage\" by [[UNESCO]].{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=533}} Since the 1990s Olonho have been used by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Sakha as teaching aids to primary school children - however some of the language of folklore (idioms, proverbs, riddles etc.) is considered too difficult, and simplified, shortened texts have been prepared.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=535-6}}\n\nBy 2003, around 150 full Olonhos had been collected of which 17 had been published.{{sfn|Kiri\u015f\u00e7io\u011flu|2003|p=227}} Around 300 Olonhos are thought to have been known to olonhosuts in the first half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Illarionov|2013|p=2}}\n\nAs of 2009, only one Olonho, the ''Culuruyar Nurgun Bootur\u2019dur'' had been translated into French and English. First translated into Russian in 1947, the French text was based upon the Russian translation, and summarised the tale. The text with Russian and English translations was published in 2002.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=535}}\n\n==Derivative works==\n*Timofey Stepanov produced a series of large scale paintings based on Ohlonho.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|p=369}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Epic of King Gesar]], Buryat narrated epic\n*[[Ural-batyr]], Basksir narrated epic\n*[[Epic of Jangar]], Kalmyk  narrated epic\n*[[Kalevala]], Finnish narrated epic\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation| title =OLONHO MET\u0130NLER\u0130N\u0130N DERLENMES\u0130 VE YAYIMLANMASIYLA \u0130LG\u0130L\u0130 \u00c7ALI\u015eMALARIN TAR\u0130H\u0130| trans-title = History of the compliation and publication of the Olonkho texts | first= Metin|last = Ers\u00f6z | language = turkish | journal = Gazi T\u00fcrkiyat T\u00fcrkoloji Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131 Dergisi | year = 2009 | volume =1 | issue  =5 | pages = 519\u2013540 | url = https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/gaziturkiyat/issue/6718/90277 }}\n*{{citation| last = Ivanov |first= V|last2= Koriakina| first2 = A | last3 = Savvinova | first3 = G. | last4 = Anisimov | first4 =  R. | year = 2018 | title = On the Issue of Origin of the Yakut Epic Olonkho | journal = Journal of History Culture and Art Research | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages =  194\u2013204 | doi = 10.7596/taksad.v7i1.1369 | doi-access = free }}\n*{{citation| title = Olonkho Metinlerinin Toplanmas\u0131 ve Ara\u015ft\u0131r\u0131lmas\u0131 | trans-title = Collection of, and research on - the Olonkho texts| first =  Fatih | last =  Kiri\u015f\u00e7io\u011flu | language = turkish | journal = T\u00fcrkiyat Ara\u015ftirmalari Dergisi | volume = 1| year = 2003 | issue = 13 | pages = 227\u2013233| url = http://sutad.selcuk.edu.tr/sutad/article/view/214 }}\n*{{citation| url =http://elib.sfu-kras.ru/bitstream/handle/2311/10229/08_Nakhodkina.pdf;jsessionid=169857BE40154F655CDC61EE3162B813?sequence=1  | journal = Journal of Siberian Federal University.

The term refers to the entire Sakha epic tradition as well as its central epic.\n\nThere are over one hundred poem epics recorded of which a small number have been published - each can contain several tens of thousands of verses. As originally performed the epics were narrated/sung not written, with each character or principle indicated by the tone and musicality of the performer's voice. The poems contain numerous literary devices including metaphor, simile, etc. and contain fantastical elements and archaic concepts. They are thought to originate from times when the ancestors of the Yakuts lived further south. Oral performance of an Olonho contains both spoken (descriptions) and sung (dialogue) parts.\n\nThe epics were first recorded by westerners after the [[Russian conquest of Siberia]] starting in the 18th century onwards. Western exiles to Siberia during the 19th century made major contributions to the recording of these epic, and after the formation of the [[Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], government-backed organisations took part in collating and archiving versions of the epics.\n\nThe best known Olonho \"Nyurgun Bootur the Swift\", consists of more than 36,000 verses, and has been translated into several languages.\n\n==Performance and presentation==\nIn their original form, Olonkho was an orally presented epic 'sung' by a narrator. Difference characters, male/female, good/evil etc. were distinguished only by the performer's voice using intonation and melody.{{sfn|Nakhodkina|2014|p=275}} They contain archaic language, complex grammar, fantastic and symbolic imagery, as well as metaphor, simile, epithets, and hyperbole.{{sfn|Nakhodkina|2014|p=275}}\n\nThe Olonho poems vary from a few thousand up to forty thousand verses in length\n{{sfn|Kiri\u015f\u00e7io\u011flu|2003|p=227}} Typically an Olonkho performance would last 7\u20138 hours, starting at the beginning of an evening and continuing throughout the night, during which time approximately 7,000-8,000 lines of verse could be performed. Some Olonho may have taken over a month to complete.{{sfn|Illarionov|2013|pp=1-2}}\n\nThe beginning of a performance starts with a poetic recitation - other descriptive parts of the epic also take this form. Dialogue is sung. Gestures and facial expressions also form part of the performance.{{sfn|Illarionov|2013|p=2}}\n\nIn the 1930s, [[P.A. Oyunsky]] created written versions of the Olonhos in his own words, which are more suitable for reading, in part because he divided them into separate parts and songs.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=525-6}}{{sfn|Nakhodkina|2014|p=275}}\n\nThe Olonkho is still performed in the [[Sakha Republic]].<ref>{{citation| url = https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/olonkho-yakut-heroic-epos-00145| title = Olonkho, Yakut heroic epos |publisher =  UNESCO| access-date = 9 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Nyurgun Bootur the Swift==\n''[[Nyurgun Bootur the Swift]]'' is the most well known and widely disseminated of the Olonhos. [[Platon Oyunsky]] created a written version of the tale in the 1920s and 1930s. In terms of its impact, it is well known by most Yakut speakers, is used in teaching in the Yakut language, and is one of the few Olonhos to have been translated into a variety other languages. It is even considered to be a key part of the Sakha identity.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|pp=366-7}}\n\nOyunksy made an addition to the story when he added ''Taas kiele ogo'', a character who speaks about a core principle of the Sakha world view. This principle is rooted in the belief that there are three separate worlds - the upper world (\"gods\"), the middle world (\"people\"), and the lower world (\"devils\").{{sfn|Popova|2018|p=272}} It is considered taboo to upset the balance between the three worlds, for example when an inhabitant of one world fails to carry out their traditional role.{{sfn|Popova|2018|p=278}} In Oyunnsky's story, Taas kiele ogo becomes involved in the narrative because of an imbalance in the worlds, and {{harvnb|Popova|2018}} proposed that Oyunksy added the character to the tale to warn of contemporary and future threats to the Sakha (such as nuclear war).{{sfn|Popova|2018|loc=Conclusion|p=278}}\n\n[[Vladimir Derzhavin]] published the first Russian version of the tale, which was published in 1975. A Russian translation with notes was produced by [[Egor Sidorov]] in 2012. The first English translation was produced in the 1990s from the Russian translation by Vladimir Derzhavin. A translation of Oyunsky's text into English was published in 2014 as ''Olonkho: Nurgun Botur the Swift''. Other translations include: Slovak (Milo\u0161 Krno, 2012); Kyrgyz (2014); Evenki (Krivoshapkin-Nyimkalan, 1996-2003). A version for children was produced in French by  Jankel Karro and Lina Sabaraikina.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|pp=367-8}}\n\nA recording of the work by Yakut Gavril Kolesov was made in 1954 - and 8 hour recording with Kolesov was published by [[Melodiya]] in 1968.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|p=369}}\n\n===Derivative works===\n''Tuyaryma Kuo'' was created by Platon Oyunsky in the 1930s as a drama based on ''Nyurgun Bootur the Swift'' - it was first performed in 1937 at the Yakut National Theater. The main character, Tuyaryma Kuo, is a symbol of female beauty and character.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|p=369}}\n\nProse versions of the story in Yakut were made by Elena Sleptsova-Kuorsunnaakh in 2007, consisting of 201 tales.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|p=370}} The work has also been converted to cartoon form, in Yakut, as well as English and German voiced versions.{{sfn|Razumovskaya|2018|p=370}}\n\n==Etymology and related terms==\nAssociated with the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] verb \"Olmak\", meaning \"to be\".<ref name=\"dic233\">{{citation| work = T\u00fcrk S\u00f6ylence S\u00f6zl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc [Turkish Mythology Dictionary]|first =  Deniz |last =  Karakurt | language = turkish | title = Olongo | page =233 | url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Turk_Soylence_Sozlugu.pdf | year =2011 |isbn\n = 978-605-5618-03-2 }}</ref> The [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] word ''\u00d6l\u00f6n'' also means \"saga\".<ref name=\"dic233\"/>\n\nWhilst the term ''Olonho'' refers to the saga/epic itself, an ''Olonhohut'' is the person/storyteller who performs the saga,{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=519}} and ''Olonholoo-'' is the act/art of presenting/performing the story in the form of words and sound.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=519-520}}\n\nThe [[Buryat-Mongol]] epic ''ontkno'' are thought to have the same name origin.{{sfn|Nakhodkina|2014|p=275}}\n\n==History==\n===Origins of Olonhos and Sakha===\nThe origins of the Olonho epics is of interest not only in the context of Yakutian history, but also in the wider field of comparative [[Turkic mythology]]. The Yakuts (whose ancestors are thought to originate in southern Siberia/central Asia) were broadly isolated from the rest of the Turkic world for approximately 1000 years - the Olonhos are thought to have retained many archaic aspects of ancient Turkic myths.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|loc=Abstract, Introduction|pp=194-5}}\n\nIn the late 19th century, thought that the Yakuts had their origin somewhere to the south of the  [[River Lena]], an idea which informed contemporary attempts at explanation of the origin of the Olonhos. In 1927 [[P.A. Oyunsky]] inferred that the Yakuts originated in the [[Aral Sea]] area, moving via the [[Transbaikal]] to the [[Lena River]] basin, using the Olonhos as a source themselves.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|p=195}}  Ethnographer [[G.V. Ksenofontov]] (1888\u20131938) proposed a southern origin for the Sakha - part of the evidence of this was a supposed oral chronicle preserved in the Olonho. Historian [[Georgiy Basharin]] also supported the idea of a southern origin, and suggested that the Olonhos arose together with the northern migration, and the people's struggle for 'nationhood'.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|pp=195-6}}\n\nIn the 1950s [[A.P. Okladnikov]] proposed the Olonhos represented a memory of the culture of the 'Sakha' before the northern migration to the Lena basin, and dates to a period when the Sakha's predecessors lived near the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] and [[Sayans]] with the Mongol's predecessors.  Okladnikov claimed there was linguistic evidence for an origin of the Yakut language not in the mid [[River Lena|Lena]] basin, but somewhere where other Turkic and Mongol peoples lived. He linked their origins to the western Baikal region, where the [[Orkhon-Yenisei script]] using [[Guligans]] and [[Qurykans]] lived, and suggested that those tribes ancestors were the Yakut's ancestors - so-called \"forest peoples\", who lived east of the [[Yenisei Kyrgyz]] in lowlands around the [[Selenga River]], on the banks of [[Lake Baikal]], and around  the [[Angara River]].{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|pp=197-8}}\n\nIn the 1970s [[G.U. Ergis]] suggested that the 7th century [[Orkhon Turks]] had folklore that corresponded to the beginnings of the Yakut's myths.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|p=198}} In the 2000s [[I.V. Pukhov]] made a comparative analysis of the epics of the Altain and Sayan peoples, and the Yakutian Olonho, finding similarity with the Altain [[Maaday-Kara]] epic, and commonalities with most epics of Turkic-speaking peoples in the Altai region.\n{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|pp=198-9}}\n\n[[Ye.M. Meletinskiy]] stated that the historical conditions of epic creation were those of a nomadic cattle breeding lifestyle, coupled with migrations, and conditions of rapidly forming military unions, conflicts, and other violence in a system of 'military democracy'.{{harvnb|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018}} state that the plots, characters, etc. of the Olonhos well match such conditions.{{sfn|Ivanov|Koriakina|Savvinova|Anisimov|2018|p=202}}\n\n=== Olonho research and translation===\nThe [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] played a key role in the collection and publication of Olonho texts - though their primary purpose was the geographic and geological analysis of Siberia they also collected information about the region's inhabitants, and their cultures and languages.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=520}} Early collectors of Sakha culture included [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller]] and [[Yakov Ivanovich Lindenau]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=520}} During an expedition of 1842-5 biologist [[Alexander von Middendorff]] also collated a short section of the tale ''Eriedel Bergen'', published in 1878, becoming the first published Olonho.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=520-1}} A summary of ''Ereydeeh Buruuydaah Er Sogotoh'' by A. Y. Uvaroskiy was published in German translation in 1851 in the work ''\u00dcber Die Sprache Der Jakuten''.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=521}}\n\nP. K. Maak was an official in the B\u00fcl\u00fc\u00fc region ([[Verkhnevilyuysk]]) in the 1850s and compiled the ''Olonholoon Oburgu'' in his ''Vil\u00fcyskiy Okrug Yakutskaya Oblast'' (1887). Tsarist exile V. L. Serosevskiy compiled important information on the Onlonho tradition in his monograph ''Yakuti'', though he did not record any Olonhos.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=521}} A. Hudyakov also compiled some Olonhos and other oral material during his exile in [[Verkhoyansk]] between 1867 and 1874, including ''Haan Carg\u0131stay'', which was compiled as it was performed, and so represents the earliest useful source for the tradition.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=522}}\n\n[[E. K. Pekarsky]] was exiled to the region between 1881 and 1905, initially in Taatta ([[Tattinsky District]]), there drawing on the rich local oral tradition of ''olonhohutlar'' (epics), ''alg\u0131s\u00e7\u0131tlar'' (prayers), and ''oyuunlar'' (games). Helped by the local populace his compilation work continued until his death, producing records of folklore that continue to be important to later researchers.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=522}} An anthology of Sakha folklore ''Obrazts\u0131 Narodnoy Literatur\u0131 Yakutov'' [Examples of Yakut Folklore], the first volume of which was published in 1907, include work by Pekarsky as well as other researchers, including material from a research expedition of 1894-6 funded by gold mine owner [[Alexander Sibiryakov|Aleksander Mikhaylovich Sibiryakov]].{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=522}} This work focused mainly on the central region of Yakutia, including Taatta, Amma ([[Amginsky District]]), Uus Aldan ([[Ust-Aldansky District]]), Mene Hanalas, \u00c7urap\u00e7\u0131 ([[Churapchinsky District]]), and Cookuskay. Material from other regions remained essentially uncollated due to transportation difficulties.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=523-4}}\n\nThe publication of the series ''Obrazts\u0131 Narodnoy Literatur\u0131 Yakutov'' was a cultural turning point in the compilation and study of the Olonhos. A ''Slovar Yakutskogo Yaz\u0131ka'' [Sakha-Russian Dictionary] was published in 13 volumes between 1905 and 1930, also edited by Perkarskiy - examples of word usage drew on folklore and especially Olonho texts.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=524}}\n\nAnother exile [[S. V. Yastremskiy]] also made contributions to the study of Sakha culture. Having learnt the Sakha language he took part in the work funded by Sibiryakov, and translated full texts of ''Er Sogotoh'', ''Kulun Kullustur'', and ''S\u00fcn Caah\u0131n'' into Russian in the 1929 volume of ''Obrazts\u0131 Narodnoy Literatur\u0131 Yakutov''.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=524}}\n\n[[P. A. Oyuunuskay]] also made a very important contribution to the wider dissemination of the Olonho scholars. However, unlike previous researchers he did compile his version of the tales from the oral tradition, but instead wrote the Olonho in his own words - written between 1930 and 1937 ''Culuruyar Nurgun Bootur Olonhosu'' in nine episodes totalling 36,000 words. A ban on the publication of his works was not lifted until after [[Stalin]]'s death in 1953 - his works were published 1959-60 in seven volumes; the fourth, fifth and sixth volumes formed the ''Culuruyar Nurgun Bootur Olonhosu\u2019na''.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=525-6}}\n\nThe ''Saha Dili ve K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc Bilimsel Arast\u0131rma Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc'' [Sakha Institute of Language and Cultural Research] was formed in 1934, establishing folklore archives. In the late 1930s it began field expeditions to record oral culture in the region. After the great disruption of the [[Second World War]] the institute was renamed to ''Saha Dilini, Edebiyat\u0131n\u0131 ve Tarihini Arast\u0131rma Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc olarak degistirilir.'' in 1947.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=526-9}} In the 1960s and 70s focus of the institute switch to textual analysis rather than collation, Important works during this period include the ''Yakutskiy Geroi\u00e7eskiy Epos Olonho - Osnovn\u0131e Obraz\u0131'' [Main Characters of the Yakut Heroic Epics - Olonho] (V. Puhov, 1962); as well as ''O\u00e7erki Po Yakutskomu Folkloru'' [Essays on Yakut Folklore] (Ergis, 1974).{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=529-60}}\n\nImportant later publications include ''C\u0131r\u0131b\u0131na C\u0131r\u0131l\u0131atta K\u0131\u0131s Buhat\u0131\u0131r'' (1981), an Olonho whose main protagonist is a woman; and ''Kuruubay Haannaah Kulun Kullustuur'' (1985) published in a free Russian translation alongside the Sakha with the aim of both being as close to the original as possible.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=530-1}}\n\nIn 1997, Olonhos were recognized as part of \"Humanity's Oral and Intangible Heritage\" by [[UNESCO]].{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|p=533}} Since the 1990s Olonho have been used by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Sakha as teaching aids to primary school children - however some of the language of folklore (idioms, proverbs, riddles etc.) is considered too difficult, and simplified, shortened texts have been prepared.{{sfn|Ers\u00f6z|2009|pp=535-6}}\n\nBy 2003, around 150 full Olonhos had been collected of which 17 had been published.{{sfn|Kiri\u015f\u00e7io\u011flu|2003|p=227}} Around 300 Olonhos are thought to have been known to olonhosuts in the first half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Illarionov|2013|p=2}}\n\nAs of 2009, only one Olonho, the ''Culuruyar Nurgun Bootur\u2019dur'' had been translated into French and English. First translated into Russian in 1947, the French text was based upon the Russian translation, and summarised the tale.

Second, they were stereotyped as those who make fuss about nothing. Third, they were stereotyped as lacking 'normal maternal instinct'. The study found communication difficulties to be part of the problem, particularly among women who were Muslim South Asians with [[Urdu]] as their first language; this problem vanished when hospital staff of South Asian descent were included in the team attending the expectant mother. Further, the study found [[experimenter's bias]] in a population wide study that included native British people, people of South Asian descent and people from other parts of the world.<ref name=bowler/><ref>Jowell and Airey (1984), ''British Social Attitudes'', Gower, London, {{ISBN|978-0566007378}}</ref> Contrary to the stereotypes, comparative analysis revealed that the rate of health care service use, rate of diligent treatment and follow up, as well as 'maternal instinct' behavior was no different among South Asian women than natives or other ethnic groups.\n\n===Too eager or awkward in assimilation===\nTwo conflicting but prevailing stereotypes in Europe and North America relate to alienation and assimilation by people of South Asian origins.\n\nHernandez, for example, in her analysis of [[Richard Rodriguez]] \u2013 the [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]] winner \u2013 and [[V. S. Naipaul|V.S. Naipaul]] \u2013 the Nobel laureate in literature of Indo-Caribbean origin \u2013 quotes Albert Memmi's classic, illustrating the stereotype. Memmi claims they make every effort to look Western, in the hope that no one will recognise them; from this proceeds their efforts to forget their past, to change their collective customs, their enthusiastic adoption of the Western language, culture and values, alleges Memmi.<ref name=\"Memmi, Albert 1973\">{{cite book|title=Portrait du decolonise|author=Memmi, Albert|year=1973|publisher=Payot|isbn=978-2-07-034201-3}}</ref><ref name=hern1>{{cite web|title=Postcolonial blues: Ambivalence and alienation in the autobiographies of Richard Rodriguez and V.S.

Some stereotype them as betraying a past, others as betraying the future. These stereotypes reflect innate discomfort, confusion and possibly a struggle with rejection by those who stereotype as well as those who are being stereotyped.<ref name=\"Memmi, Albert 1973\"/><ref name=\"hern1\"/>\n\nHernandez notes, for Naipaul, after a start in a humble family background, personal and professional success could only be achieved through learning, understanding and assimilation. This conflicting stereotype is not unique to South Asians. As Hernandez outlines, the same stereotypes exist against people from different regions of the world, such as against Rodriguez of Mexico.<ref name=hern1/>\n\n==Historical==\n\n=== Komagata Maru ===\nIn 1914, a steamer named ''[[Komagata Maru]]'' arrived in the harbour of Vancouver, Canada. On it were 376 Indians, mostly [[Sikh]]s.<ref name=cic/><ref name=berkeley/> Both Canada and India were part of the British Commonwealth at the time, movement of people and migration within the empire was permissible, with millions of Indians sought by the British government for its World War I efforts outside India. The passengers on ''Komagata Maru'' were not soldiers but workers. The provincial government stopped the steamer at sea, refused the tired passengers from disembarking for two months, argued that the South Asians didn't belong in Canada, then forced the steamer and passengers to go back to India. Political leaders and newspaper media parroted allegations, impressions and cartoons for two months, mocking the immigrants waiting in the boat at sea.<ref>see:\n*[http://komagatamarujourney.ca/sites/default/files/Lesson%20Plan%202%20-%20Final.pdf Media Representations of the Komagata Maru Incident] Simon Fraser University (2010)\n*[http://komagatamarujourney.ca/photos The story, documents and cartoons against Komagata Maru] Canada</ref> This action has been explained by scholars,<ref name=mcdonald>Robert McDonald (2011), Making Vancouver: Class, Status, and Social Boundaries, 1863\u20131913, University of British Columbia Press, {{ISBN|0-7748-0555-2}}, pages 206\u2013207</ref><ref>Patricia Roy, ''British Fear of Asians, 1900\u20131950'', in British Columbia: Historical Readings, Douglas & McIntyre, 1981</ref> as a result of four stereotypes. First, they were stereotyped as polluting the collective character of British Columbia as a land of White, European-based settlers. Second, South Asians were stereotyped to be from an insulated and unassimilable culture. Third, they were stereotyped as those who were willing to work for less than fair wage. Fourth, South Asians were stereotyped as unclean, diseased and a threat to public health. Robert McDonald suggests<ref name=mcdonald/> that these stereotypes were false because it was the prevalent prejudice that contributed to their segregation and difficulty in their assimilation, they did not compete with Whites for employment but took the unskilled and rough jobs for which there were no White workers available, and they were neither diseased nor unclean as wealthier Europeans families eagerly sought them as cooks and errand houseboys inside their homes. The stereotypes, claims Robert McDonald, were irrational constructions.\n\nAfter being forced to go back, ''Komagata Maru'' returned to India with emotionally distraught and angry Indians. Some were arrested on arrival of the steamer in Calcutta by British officials, few shot for resisting arrest, others jumped off the ship and escaped, then joined the cause of independence of India from British rule. The Indian government in 1952, and the Canadian government in 1989 marked the Komagata Maru incident with memorials and a reminder of the dangers of discrimination and stereotypes.<ref name=cic>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/releases/2012/2012-07-24.asp Citizenship and Immigration Canada] Government of Canada (2009)</ref><ref name=berkeley>[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/SSEAL/echoes/chapter5/chapter5.html Voyage of the Komagata Maru] ''Echoes of Freedom Series'', University of California, Berkeley (2009)</ref> On May 18, 2016, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] tendered a formal \"full apology\" for the incident in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/komagata-maru-live-apology-1.3587827 | title=Trudeau gives Komagata Maru apology in House of Commons &#124; CBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/05/18/the-tragic-story-behind-justin-trudeaus-apology-in-canadas-parliament/ | title=Canada's Trudeau makes formal apology for racist Komagata Maru incident}}</ref>\n\n===Indomania===\n{{Main|Indomania}}\n\n[[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] wrote in a letter to Tieck that India was the source of [[Indo-European languages|all languages]], [[Indian philosophy|thoughts]] and [[Indian poetry|poems]], and that \"everything\" came from India.<ref>Ludwig Tieck und die Br\u00fcder Schlegel, Briefe.

It has been argued that allegations of [[war rape]] were used as propaganda by British [[Colonialism|colonialists]] to justify the [[British India|colonisation of India]]. While incidents of rape committed by Indian rebels against English women and girls were generally uncommon during the rebellion, this was exaggerated to great effect by the [[Media of the United Kingdom|British media]] to justify British colonialism in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and to violently suppress opposition.<ref>{{citation|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film, and Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8223-3074-5|pages=31\u20133}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, British newspapers had printed various apparently eyewitness accounts of English women and girls being raped by Indian rebels, with little corroboration to support these accounts.

One such account published by ''[[The Times]]'', regarding an incident where 48 English girls as young as 10\u201314 had been raped by Indian rebels in [[Delhi]], was criticised as false propaganda by [[Karl Marx]], who pointed out that the story was written by a clergyman in [[Bangalore]], far from the events of the rebellion.<ref>{{citation|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film, and Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8223-3074-5|pages=33\u20134}}</ref> These stereotypes and allegations were later argued as false by scholars, but they did harden the British attitude to the Indian population.<ref>Hall, C.

India is not depicted as a viable political state. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture, but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its attempts to modernize or develop are to be winked at and patronized.\n\nAfter her own studies, Rosser began to question the interpretations of some of the more well-known, leftist-oriented scholars from India who dissect the nascent nation, for whatever reasons, along with their Western counterparts, regularly demonize India's national urges, deconstructing and disempowering individuals of South Asian origin. Most people stereotype South Asians as if the nation is little more than \"Taj Mahal, famine, hunger, population, poverty, Hare Krishna, and Gandhi.\"<ref name=rosser1/><ref>[[T. S.

S.]] (1998), International Conference on the Hindu Diaspora \u2013 A Review, International Migration Review, 32(1), pages 227\u2013230</ref>\n\nAlternatively, the stereotypes stress prejudices about \"Hinduism, the caste system, poverty, third world country, inferiority\" as if that is all India is. One survey participant confided that the diversity of views and culture within India was not depicted accurately and \"only negativity was enforced; we of South Asian origin are stereotyped as that we all starve, eat monkey brains, worship rats and cows.\" It is as if every single individual in India is oppressed or oppressing others, it is stereotyped as a backward country that treats their women poorly and kills their baby girls. Checking for facts or reality is considered unnecessary. Similar observations have been made by other scholars, for both recent immigrants and second generation South Asian Americans born in the United States.<ref name=akd/><ref name=daskemp>Das & Kemp (1997), ''Between two worlds: Counseling South Asian Americans'', Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development, 25(1), pages 23\u201333</ref><ref>Inman et al., ''Bereavement and coping of South-Asian families'', Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development, 35, pages 101\u2013115</ref>\n\nIn the minds of many Americans, Rosser writes, Indian women are to be pitied and the positive social progress made by many women in India is completely ignored.<ref name=rosser1/> Despite the fact that women's right to vote, other labor and civil rights in the United States took time in American history, such facts are never contextualized or compared to the social and political uplift of modern Indian women. The prevailing image is that if the unfortunate females of South Asia survive a deprived childhood they are likely to be burned in a dowry death after their forced marriage to a complete stranger. Indian women are shown as downtrodden and powerless victims, unlike American women who have more freedom. Indira Gandhi is seen as an anomaly. The numerous Indian women who every year join the colleges in America are also seen as anomalous.\n\nRosser notes that while India's religion and the caste system are emphasized in American discourse, no mention is made of post-independence secular India's efforts toward national integration of its minorities. No mention is made of laws and efforts against discrimination, or the country's 60-year effort towards active inclusion of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe population in educational and employment opportunities.

S. Naipaul|V.S. Naipaul]] \u2013 the Nobel laureate in literature of Indo-Caribbean origin \u2013 quotes Albert Memmi's classic, illustrating the stereotype. Memmi claims they make every effort to look Western, in the hope that no one will recognise them; from this proceeds their efforts to forget their past, to change their collective customs, their enthusiastic adoption of the Western language, culture and values, alleges Memmi.<ref name=\"Memmi, Albert 1973\">{{cite book|title=Portrait du decolonise|author=Memmi, Albert|year=1973|publisher=Payot|isbn=978-2-07-034201-3}}</ref><ref name=hern1>{{cite web|title=Postcolonial blues: Ambivalence and alienation in the autobiographies of Richard Rodriguez and V.S.

Some stereotype them as betraying a past, others as betraying the future. These stereotypes reflect innate discomfort, confusion and possibly a struggle with rejection by those who stereotype as well as those who are being stereotyped.<ref name=\"Memmi, Albert 1973\"/><ref name=\"hern1\"/>\n\nHernandez notes, for Naipaul, after a start in a humble family background, personal and professional success could only be achieved through learning, understanding and assimilation. This conflicting stereotype is not unique to South Asians. As Hernandez outlines, the same stereotypes exist against people from different regions of the world, such as against Rodriguez of Mexico.<ref name=hern1/>\n\n==Historical==\n\n=== Komagata Maru ===\nIn 1914, a steamer named ''[[Komagata Maru]]'' arrived in the harbour of Vancouver, Canada. On it were 376 Indians, mostly [[Sikh]]s.<ref name=cic/><ref name=berkeley/> Both Canada and India were part of the British Commonwealth at the time, movement of people and migration within the empire was permissible, with millions of Indians sought by the British government for its World War I efforts outside India. The passengers on ''Komagata Maru'' were not soldiers but workers. The provincial government stopped the steamer at sea, refused the tired passengers from disembarking for two months, argued that the South Asians didn't belong in Canada, then forced the steamer and passengers to go back to India. Political leaders and newspaper media parroted allegations, impressions and cartoons for two months, mocking the immigrants waiting in the boat at sea.<ref>see:\n*[http://komagatamarujourney.ca/sites/default/files/Lesson%20Plan%202%20-%20Final.pdf Media Representations of the Komagata Maru Incident] Simon Fraser University (2010)\n*[http://komagatamarujourney.ca/photos The story, documents and cartoons against Komagata Maru] Canada</ref> This action has been explained by scholars,<ref name=mcdonald>Robert McDonald (2011), Making Vancouver: Class, Status, and Social Boundaries, 1863\u20131913, University of British Columbia Press, {{ISBN|0-7748-0555-2}}, pages 206\u2013207</ref><ref>Patricia Roy, ''British Fear of Asians, 1900\u20131950'', in British Columbia: Historical Readings, Douglas & McIntyre, 1981</ref> as a result of four stereotypes.

Second, South Asians were stereotyped to be from an insulated and unassimilable culture. Third, they were stereotyped as those who were willing to work for less than fair wage. Fourth, South Asians were stereotyped as unclean, diseased and a threat to public health. Robert McDonald suggests<ref name=mcdonald/> that these stereotypes were false because it was the prevalent prejudice that contributed to their segregation and difficulty in their assimilation, they did not compete with Whites for employment but took the unskilled and rough jobs for which there were no White workers available, and they were neither diseased nor unclean as wealthier Europeans families eagerly sought them as cooks and errand houseboys inside their homes. The stereotypes, claims Robert McDonald, were irrational constructions.\n\nAfter being forced to go back, ''Komagata Maru'' returned to India with emotionally distraught and angry Indians. Some were arrested on arrival of the steamer in Calcutta by British officials, few shot for resisting arrest, others jumped off the ship and escaped, then joined the cause of independence of India from British rule. The Indian government in 1952, and the Canadian government in 1989 marked the Komagata Maru incident with memorials and a reminder of the dangers of discrimination and stereotypes.<ref name=cic>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/releases/2012/2012-07-24.asp Citizenship and Immigration Canada] Government of Canada (2009)</ref><ref name=berkeley>[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/SSEAL/echoes/chapter5/chapter5.html Voyage of the Komagata Maru] ''Echoes of Freedom Series'', University of California, Berkeley (2009)</ref> On May 18, 2016, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] tendered a formal \"full apology\" for the incident in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/komagata-maru-live-apology-1.3587827 | title=Trudeau gives Komagata Maru apology in House of Commons &#124; CBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/05/18/the-tragic-story-behind-justin-trudeaus-apology-in-canadas-parliament/ | title=Canada's Trudeau makes formal apology for racist Komagata Maru incident}}</ref>\n\n===Indomania===\n{{Main|Indomania}}\n\n[[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] wrote in a letter to Tieck that India was the source of [[Indo-European languages|all languages]], [[Indian philosophy|thoughts]] and [[Indian poetry|poems]], and that \"everything\" came from India.<ref>Ludwig Tieck und die Br\u00fcder Schlegel, Briefe.

It has been argued that allegations of [[war rape]] were used as propaganda by British [[Colonialism|colonialists]] to justify the [[British India|colonisation of India]]. While incidents of rape committed by Indian rebels against English women and girls were generally uncommon during the rebellion, this was exaggerated to great effect by the [[Media of the United Kingdom|British media]] to justify British colonialism in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and to violently suppress opposition.<ref>{{citation|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film, and Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8223-3074-5|pages=31\u20133}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, British newspapers had printed various apparently eyewitness accounts of English women and girls being raped by Indian rebels, with little corroboration to support these accounts.

One such account published by ''[[The Times]]'', regarding an incident where 48 English girls as young as 10\u201314 had been raped by Indian rebels in [[Delhi]], was criticised as false propaganda by [[Karl Marx]], who pointed out that the story was written by a clergyman in [[Bangalore]], far from the events of the rebellion.<ref>{{citation|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film, and Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8223-3074-5|pages=33\u20134}}</ref> These stereotypes and allegations were later argued as false by scholars, but they did harden the British attitude to the Indian population.<ref>Hall, C.

Another student complained that India is depicted as just a poor country and that the lives of the people are dealt with in a simplistic manner.|A woman born in the United States who went to high school in Dallas<ref name=rosser1/>}}\n\nRosser notes that the stereotypical discourse in much of the United States about South Asia is rarely devoted to economic development and democratic institutions in independent India. India is not depicted as a viable political state. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture, but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its attempts to modernize or develop are to be winked at and patronized.\n\nAfter her own studies, Rosser began to question the interpretations of some of the more well-known, leftist-oriented scholars from India who dissect the nascent nation, for whatever reasons, along with their Western counterparts, regularly demonize India's national urges, deconstructing and disempowering individuals of South Asian origin. Most people stereotype South Asians as if the nation is little more than \"Taj Mahal, famine, hunger, population, poverty, Hare Krishna, and Gandhi.\"<ref name=rosser1/><ref>[[T. S. Rukmani|Rukmani, T. S.]] (1998), International Conference on the Hindu Diaspora \u2013 A Review, International Migration Review, 32(1), pages 227\u2013230</ref>\n\nAlternatively, the stereotypes stress prejudices about \"Hinduism, the caste system, poverty, third world country, inferiority\" as if that is all India is. One survey participant confided that the diversity of views and culture within India was not depicted accurately and \"only negativity was enforced; we of South Asian origin are stereotyped as that we all starve, eat monkey brains, worship rats and cows.\" It is as if every single individual in India is oppressed or oppressing others, it is stereotyped as a backward country that treats their women poorly and kills their baby girls. Checking for facts or reality is considered unnecessary. Similar observations have been made by other scholars, for both recent immigrants and second generation South Asian Americans born in the United States.<ref name=akd/><ref name=daskemp>Das & Kemp (1997), ''Between two worlds: Counseling South Asian Americans'', Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development, 25(1), pages 23\u201333</ref><ref>Inman et al., ''Bereavement and coping of South-Asian families'', Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development, 35, pages 101\u2013115</ref>\n\nIn the minds of many Americans, Rosser writes, Indian women are to be pitied and the positive social progress made by many women in India is completely ignored.<ref name=rosser1/> Despite the fact that women's right to vote, other labor and civil rights in the United States took time in American history, such facts are never contextualized or compared to the social and political uplift of modern Indian women. The prevailing image is that if the unfortunate females of South Asia survive a deprived childhood they are likely to be burned in a dowry death after their forced marriage to a complete stranger. Indian women are shown as downtrodden and powerless victims, unlike American women who have more freedom. Indira Gandhi is seen as an anomaly. The numerous Indian women who every year join the colleges in America are also seen as anomalous.\n\nRosser notes that while India's religion and the caste system are emphasized in American discourse, no mention is made of post-independence secular India's efforts toward national integration of its minorities. No mention is made of laws and efforts against discrimination, or the country's 60-year effort towards active inclusion of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe population in educational and employment opportunities. People also forget to introspect the fact that social discrimination and prejudice has been a widespread worldwide issue, for example the treatment of African Americans in southern United States.<ref name=rosser1/>\n\n====Outsourcing/offshoring/call centres====\n[[Barack Obama]] has said that the prevailing stereotype being cultivated against Indians in the United States is that \"all U.S. jobs are being outsourced to India,\" and the stereotype is adversely affecting [[India-United States relations]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2010/11/obama-stereotypes-shadow-us-indian-trade-relations/1 |title=Obama: 'Stereotypes' shadow U.S.-Indian trade relations | work=USA Today | date=8 November 2010}}</ref> He also commented that such stereotypes have \"outlived their usefulness\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciol.com/News/News/News-Reports/Obama-strikes-out-at-outsourcing-stereotypes/143163/0/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119042148/http://www.ciol.com/News/News/News-Reports/Obama-strikes-out-at-outsourcing-stereotypes/143163/0/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 January 2013 |access-date=11 January 2011 }}</ref> and \"ignore today's reality.\" Obama said, \"Trade between our countries is not just a one-way street of American jobs and companies moving to India.

Soon after, the area of Caldwell Township just to the east of Caldwell Borough between Caldwell Borough and Montclair (present-day Verona and Cedar Grove) decided to follow Caldwell's lead and incorporated itself as its own borough, Verona. Some of the already developed eastern neighborhoods of Caldwell Township chose to become part of Montclair, as it was a rapidly developing suburb of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]]. At around the same time, the area north of Caldwell Borough became its own town, North Caldwell. The wooded area directly to the south of downtown Caldwell Borough became Essex Fells. Meanwhile, the farmland to the south of the western portion of Caldwell township attempted to become its own municipality known as South Caldwell. This failed, as much of developed sections of that area lied on its southernmost and easternmost borders, along the expanding Newark suburbs of Livingston and West Orange respectively. Those areas were engulfed by those two towns once they became incorporated municipalities of several small villages and developments.\n\nThis left only the most rural farmland south of Caldwell Borough and Essex Fells to become its own township, Roseland. At this point, all that remained of the original Caldwell Township was a large piece of undeveloped land in the northwestern-most part of Essex County. In 1963, Caldwell Township changed its name to Fairfield in order to avoid being confused with Caldwell Borough.<ref>Wright, George Cable.

However, two individual settlements, known as Franklin and Westville, soon formed in the western part of Caldwell Borough. As development increased and population grew in the western part of Caldwell, the town's more rural western population and more urban east often could not reconcile their differences. This led to the areas of Franklin and Westville consolidating into their own township known as West Caldwell in 1904, leaving only the one square mile of original downtown Horseneck development as the borough of Caldwell.

Soon after, the area of Caldwell Township just to the east of Caldwell Borough between Caldwell Borough and Montclair (present-day Verona and Cedar Grove) decided to follow Caldwell's lead and incorporated itself as its own borough, Verona. Some of the already developed eastern neighborhoods of Caldwell Township chose to become part of Montclair, as it was a rapidly developing suburb of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]]. At around the same time, the area north of Caldwell Borough became its own town, North Caldwell. The wooded area directly to the south of downtown Caldwell Borough became Essex Fells. Meanwhile, the farmland to the south of the western portion of Caldwell township attempted to become its own municipality known as South Caldwell. This failed, as much of developed sections of that area lied on its southernmost and easternmost borders, along the expanding Newark suburbs of Livingston and West Orange respectively. Those areas were engulfed by those two towns once they became incorporated municipalities of several small villages and developments.\n\nThis left only the most rural farmland south of Caldwell Borough and Essex Fells to become its own township, Roseland. At this point, all that remained of the original Caldwell Township was a large piece of undeveloped land in the northwestern-most part of Essex County. In 1963, Caldwell Township changed its name to Fairfield in order to avoid being confused with Caldwell Borough.<ref>Wright, George Cable.

However, two individual settlements, known as Franklin and Westville, soon formed in the western part of Caldwell Borough. As development increased and population grew in the western part of Caldwell, the town's more rural western population and more urban east often could not reconcile their differences. This led to the areas of Franklin and Westville consolidating into their own township known as West Caldwell in 1904, leaving only the one square mile of original downtown Horseneck development as the borough of Caldwell.
