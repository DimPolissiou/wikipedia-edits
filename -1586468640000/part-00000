These Florida Keys are the surface expression of the 3.7&nbsp;mi (6&nbsp;km) thick southern Florida [[carbonate platform]], which has been accumulating sediments since the [[Early Cretaceous]].  Two [[stratigraphic unit]]s are exposed at the surface, the Key Largo [[Limestone]] and the Miami Limestone.  The Key Largo Limestone are reefs up to 200&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m) thick, parallel to the shelf edge, consisting of [[hermatypic coral]]s and [[calcarenite]]s.  The Miami Limestone is less than 49&nbsp;ft (15&nbsp;m) thick, and in general, is found behind the Key Largo Limestone reef, but overlies it in the western extent of the keys.  It consists of a [[bryozoa]]n [[facies]] and an oolitic facies and represents a [[Littoral zone|subtidal]] [[shoal]].  Additionally, excellent examples of [[Holocene]] carbonate-sand deposits are found in the Dry Tortugas, consisting mainly of disarticulated ''[[Halimeda]]'' plates.  Between the Dry Tortugas and Key West is a 39&nbsp;ft (12&nbsp;m) thick example of these sand deposits, known as \"the [[quicksand]]s\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Randazzo|first1=Anthony|last2=Halley|first2=Robert|editor1-last=Randazzo|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Jones|editor2-first=Douglas|title=Geology of the Florida Keys, in The Geology of Florida|date=1997|publisher=University of Florida Press|location=Gainesville|isbn=9780813014968|pages=251\u2013259}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe park is in a [[tropical savanna climate]], with a rainy season coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season from May to October and a dry season extending from November through April. Despite occasional exposure to tropical systems, the Tortugas are the driest places in Florida with an annual precipitation of about {{convert|36|in|cm}}. There is no large jungle or forest canopy area on the islands, and the sandy soil (which drains quickly) and intense sun only enhance the drought-like conditions often found on the islands. Seasonally there is little temperature variation, with high temperatures in summer around {{convert|90|F|C}} and low temperatures in winter around {{convert|66|F|C}}.

Ponce de Le\u00f3n caught 160 sea turtles there and subsequently referred to the islands as the \"Tortugas\" (turtles). They are called ''Dry'' owing to the absence of surface fresh water on the island. The archipelago includes a high concentration of historically significant shipwrecks dating from the 17th century to the present.<ref name=\"drto2000report1\">{{cite web |title=Dry Tortugas National Park: 2000 Annual Report |url=http://www.nps.gov/drto/parkmgmt/upload/drto2000annualreport.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref> The Dry Tortugas were a significant American naval base from colonial times to the early 20th century, providing a sheltered anchorage and coaling station through the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].<ref name=\"npsdrto1\">{{cite web |title=Places |url=http://www.nps.gov/drto/historyculture/places.htm |work=Dry Tortugas National Park |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>\n\nFlorida was acquired from Spain by the United States in 1822. The Dry Tortugas were seen as a strategic point for the control of the [[Straits of Florida]] and the Gulf of Mexico. Work on a lighthouse on Garden Key started in 1825. Planning for a fortification began almost immediately, and construction started in 1847. In 1856 work on a new, more powerful lighthouse on Loggerhead Key was started to replace the Garden Key light.<ref name=\"npsdrto1\" />\n\nWork was half complete in 1860. Construction continued into the [[American Civil War]], but eventually stopped, and the fort was used as a military prison. It was here that Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]] and three others charged with conspiracy in the assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] were imprisoned.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Florida.

Seeing this as having a damaging effect on their tourism-dependent economy, the residents of [[Key West]], [[Florida]], raised money to keep Dry Tortugas open. The effort was inspired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which raised private donations to keep its museums open during the shutdown.\n\nFailing to find anybody to accept the money to reopen the park, Key West residents, under the auspices of the satirical [[micronation]] [[Conch Republic]], sent a flotilla of civilian boats and fire department boats to Fort Jefferson in order to reopen the national park. When officials attempted to enter the fort, they were cited. The citation was contested in court the following year, and the resultant case, ''The United States of America v. Peter Anderson'', was quickly dropped.\n\nThe park is a landing location for [[wet feet, dry feet policy|immigrants arriving from Cuba]] in homebuilt boats called \"chugs.\" Receiving and housing the migrants is a particular problem for Dry Tortugas, which has limited resources for such arrivals and which is several hours from the nearest Coast Guard or Border Patrol units. Communications with Key West are accomplished using a satellite-based voice-over-IP system, which is prone to garbling and delays, and by a radio relay system using an abandoned Air Force tower between Key West and the Dry Tortugas.<ref name=\"nps2010rpt1\" />\n\nVisitation steadily rose for several decades, reaching a peak of 83,704 in 2000.

Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the [[northern parula]], [[American redstart]], [[prairie warbler]], [[hooded warbler]], [[palm warbler]], [[black-and-white warbler]], [[common yellowthroat]], [[yellow-rumped warbler]], [[ovenbird]], [[northern waterthrush]], [[black-throated blue warbler]], [[blackpoll warbler]], and [[Cape May warbler]], with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as [[cattle egret]]s are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several [[Thespesia populnea|seaside mahoe]] and [[Conocarpus|buttonwood]] trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation in the fall of 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.\n\n===Invasive species and eradication efforts===\nAn active eradication program has resulted in the removal of invasive ''[[Casuarina]]'' trees and [[agave]] from Loggerhead Key, by cutting and herbicide treatment. [[Pterois]], commonly known as '''lionfish''', have also been found in the park's waters and the National Park Service was reviewing (in 2015) the lionfish management plan to determine what actions to take to manage the spread of this [[invasive species]] in Dry Tortugas National Park and [[Everglades National Park]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/drto/naturescience/lionfish.htm Lionfish - Dry Tortugas National Park (U.S. National Park Service)]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dry Tortugas Ferry to Fort Jefferson]]\n* [[List of birds of Dry Tortugas National Park]]\n* [[List of national parks of the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|wikt=no|commons cat=Dry Tortugas National Park|b=no|n=no|q=no|s=no|v=no|voy=Dry Tortugas National Park|species=no|d=no}}\n* {{official|https://www.nps.gov/drto/}}\n\n{{Protected areas of Florida}}\n{{National parks of the United States}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places in Florida}}\n{{Monroe County, Florida}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dry Tortugas National Park| 01]]\n[[Category:National parks in Florida]]\n[[Category:Parks in Monroe County, Florida]]\n[[Category:American Civil War prison camps]]\n[[Category:Biosphere reserves of the United States]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Monroe County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Defunct prisons in Florida]]\n[[Category:Florida in the American Civil War]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Monroe County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of Florida]]\n[[Category:Beaches of Monroe County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Beaches of Florida]]\n[[Category:1935 establishments in Florida]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 1935]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|64,657 acres in Florida (US) managed by the National Park Service}}\n{{Infobox protected area\n|name=Dry Tortugas National Park\n|iucn_category=V\n|photo=Fort-Jefferson Dry-Tortugas.jpg\n|photo_caption=Fort Jefferson\n|map=Florida#USA\n|relief = 1\n|map_caption=Location in Florida##Location in the United States\n|location=[[Monroe County, Florida]], United States\n|nearest_city=[[Key West]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|24.628588|-82.873287|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-FL|display=it}}\n|area_acre=64701\n|area_ref= <ref name=\"area\">{{NPS area|year=2011|accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n|established=January 4, 1935\n|visitation_num=56,810\n|visitation_year=2018\n|visitation_ref=<ref name=\"visits\">{{NPS Visitation |accessdate=2019-03-06}}</ref>\n|governing_body=[[National Park Service]]\n|website= {{Official website}} <!-- [https://www.nps.gov/drto/index.htm Dry Tortugas National Park] -->\n}}\n\n'''Dry Tortugas National Park''' is a [[national park]] in the [[United States]] about {{convert|68|mi|km}} west of [[Key West]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

These Florida Keys are the surface expression of the 3.7&nbsp;mi (6&nbsp;km) thick southern Florida [[carbonate platform]], which has been accumulating sediments since the [[Early Cretaceous]].  Two [[stratigraphic unit]]s are exposed at the surface, the Key Largo [[Limestone]] and the Miami Limestone.  The Key Largo Limestone are reefs up to 200&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m) thick, parallel to the shelf edge, consisting of [[hermatypic coral]]s and [[calcarenite]]s.  The Miami Limestone is less than 49&nbsp;ft (15&nbsp;m) thick, and in general, is found behind the Key Largo Limestone reef, but overlies it in the western extent of the keys.  It consists of a [[bryozoa]]n [[facies]] and an oolitic facies and represents a [[Littoral zone|subtidal]] [[shoal]].  Additionally, excellent examples of [[Holocene]] carbonate-sand deposits are found in the Dry Tortugas, consisting mainly of disarticulated ''[[Halimeda]]'' plates.  Between the Dry Tortugas and Key West is a 39&nbsp;ft (12&nbsp;m) thick example of these sand deposits, known as \"the [[quicksand]]s\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Randazzo|first1=Anthony|last2=Halley|first2=Robert|editor1-last=Randazzo|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Jones|editor2-first=Douglas|title=Geology of the Florida Keys, in The Geology of Florida|date=1997|publisher=University of Florida Press|location=Gainesville|isbn=9780813014968|pages=251\u2013259}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe park is in a [[tropical savanna climate]], with a rainy season coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season from May to October and a dry season extending from November through April. Despite occasional exposure to tropical systems, the Tortugas are the driest places in Florida with an annual precipitation of about {{convert|36|in|cm}}. There is no large jungle or forest canopy area on the islands, and the sandy soil (which drains quickly) and intense sun only enhance the drought-like conditions often found on the islands.

Ponce de Le\u00f3n caught 160 sea turtles there and subsequently referred to the islands as the \"Tortugas\" (turtles). They are called ''Dry'' owing to the absence of surface fresh water on the island. The archipelago includes a high concentration of historically significant shipwrecks dating from the 17th century to the present.<ref name=\"drto2000report1\">{{cite web |title=Dry Tortugas National Park: 2000 Annual Report |url=http://www.nps.gov/drto/parkmgmt/upload/drto2000annualreport.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref> The Dry Tortugas were a significant American naval base from colonial times to the early 20th century, providing a sheltered anchorage and coaling station through the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].<ref name=\"npsdrto1\">{{cite web |title=Places |url=http://www.nps.gov/drto/historyculture/places.htm |work=Dry Tortugas National Park |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>\n\nFlorida was acquired from Spain by the United States in 1822. The Dry Tortugas were seen as a strategic point for the control of the [[Straits of Florida]] and the Gulf of Mexico. Work on a lighthouse on Garden Key started in 1825. Planning for a fortification began almost immediately, and construction started in 1847. In 1856 work on a new, more powerful lighthouse on Loggerhead Key was started to replace the Garden Key light.<ref name=\"npsdrto1\" />\n\nWork was half complete in 1860. Construction continued into the [[American Civil War]], but eventually stopped, and the fort was used as a military prison. It was here that Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]] and three others charged with conspiracy in the assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] were imprisoned.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Florida.

Seeing this as having a damaging effect on their tourism-dependent economy, the residents of [[Key West]], [[Florida]], raised money to keep Dry Tortugas open. The effort was inspired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which raised private donations to keep its museums open during the shutdown.\n\nFailing to find anybody to accept the money to reopen the park, Key West residents, under the auspices of the satirical [[micronation]] [[Conch Republic]], sent a flotilla of civilian boats and fire department boats to Fort Jefferson in order to reopen the national park. When officials attempted to enter the fort, they were cited. The citation was contested in court the following year, and the resultant case, ''The United States of America v. Peter Anderson'', was quickly dropped.\n\nThe park is a landing location for [[wet feet, dry feet policy|immigrants arriving from Cuba]] in homebuilt boats called \"chugs.\" Receiving and housing the migrants is a particular problem for Dry Tortugas, which has limited resources for such arrivals and which is several hours from the nearest Coast Guard or Border Patrol units. Communications with Key West are accomplished using a satellite-based voice-over-IP system, which is prone to garbling and delays, and by a radio relay system using an abandoned Air Force tower between Key West and the Dry Tortugas.<ref name=\"nps2010rpt1\" />\n\nVisitation steadily rose for several decades, reaching a peak of 83,704 in 2000.

Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the [[northern parula]], [[American redstart]], [[prairie warbler]], [[hooded warbler]], [[palm warbler]], [[black-and-white warbler]], [[common yellowthroat]], [[yellow-rumped warbler]], [[ovenbird]], [[northern waterthrush]], [[black-throated blue warbler]], [[blackpoll warbler]], and [[Cape May warbler]], with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as [[cattle egret]]s are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several [[Thespesia populnea|seaside mahoe]] and [[Conocarpus|buttonwood]] trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation in the fall of 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.\n\n===Invasive species and eradication efforts===\nAn active eradication program has resulted in the removal of invasive ''[[Casuarina]]'' trees and [[agave]] from Loggerhead Key, by cutting and herbicide treatment. [[Pterois]], commonly known as '''lionfish''', have also been found in the park's waters and the National Park Service was reviewing (in 2015) the lionfish management plan to determine what actions to take to manage the spread of this [[invasive species]] in Dry Tortugas National Park and [[Everglades National Park]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/drto/naturescience/lionfish.htm Lionfish - Dry Tortugas National Park (U.S. National Park Service)]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dry Tortugas Ferry to Fort Jefferson]]\n* [[List of birds of Dry Tortugas National Park]]\n* [[List of national parks of the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|wikt=no|commons cat=Dry Tortugas National Park|b=no|n=no|q=no|s=no|v=no|voy=Dry Tortugas National Park|species=no|d=no}}\n* {{official|https://www.nps.gov/drto/}}\n\n{{Protected areas of Florida}}\n{{National parks of the United States}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places in Florida}}\n{{Monroe County, Florida}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dry Tortugas National Park| 01]]\n[[Category:National parks in Florida]]\n[[Category:Parks in Monroe County, Florida]]\n[[Category:American Civil War prison camps]]\n[[Category:Biosphere reserves of the United States]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Monroe County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Defunct prisons in Florida]]\n[[Category:Florida in the American Civil War]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Monroe County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of Florida]]\n[[Category:Beaches of Monroe County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Beaches of Florida]]\n[[Category:1935 establishments in Florida]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 1935]]\n", "name_user": "24.96.206.245", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_Tortugas_National_Park"}

These mountains are all sparsely populated highland country, and are covered in rich grassland and forests.<ref name=\"EnZim\" />\n\nThe Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe's central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains. The northern portion is drained by tributaries of the  [[Zambezi River]], while the southern portion is drained by tributaries of the [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]].<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\">\"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic\". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]</ref> The eastern slope is drained by Mozambique's [[Buzi River (Mozambique)|Buzi]] and [[Pungwe River|Pungwe]] rivers.\n\nThe Eastern Highlands are part of the '''East African Highlands''', one of four distinct physiographic divisions on the African continent. The East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the [[East African Rift]] and [[Ethiopian Highlands|Abyssinian]] physiographic provinces, part of the long chain of mountains that runs down [[East Africa]]. The mountains and mountain ranges that make up the East African Highlands share many common plant and animal species and communities, known as [[Afromontane]] flora and fauna.\n\n==Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic==\nThe Highlands are home to the '''Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic''' [[ecoregion]]. The ecoregion includes the portion of the Higlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Highlands, Vumba Highlands, Chimanimani Mountains, Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\n==Flora==\nMuch of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nSome valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.\n\nIn the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nA number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.\n\n==Fauna==\nThis variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' [[Sykes' monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus albogularis)'', [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''. Many of these animals are found throughout East Africa.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1006|name=Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic}}</ref>\n\nThe highlands are also rich in birdlife<ref>Ian Sinclair, Birds of Southern Africa, Struik Publishers 1996</ref> including [[trumpeter hornbill]] ''(Bycanistes bucinator)'', [[Knysna turaco]] ''(Tauraco corythaix)'', [[purple-crested turaco]] ''(Tauraco porphyreolophus)'', [[crested guineafowl]] ''(Guttera pucherani)'' and [[crowned eagle]] ''(Stephanoaetus coronatus)''. Two species, the [[Chirinda apalis]] ''(Apalis chirindensis)'' and [[Roberts's warbler]] ''(Oreophilais robertsi)'', are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts's warbler inhabits the forest edge.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe forests are also full of butterflies, most notably [[Papilio|swallowtails]] such as the emperor swallowtail ''([[Papilio ophidicephalus]])'' and the citrus swallowtail ''([[Papilio demodocus]])'' and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including [[skink]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, and [[snake]]s.\n{{See also|Reptiles and frogs of the Eastern Highlands}}\n\n==Threats and preservation==\nThe mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming. \n\nLarge areas of the highlands are protected, including [[Nyanga National Park]] and [[Mtarazi Falls National Park]] in the Nyanga Mountains, [[Bunga Forest Botanical Reserve]] in the Bvumba Mountains, and Zimbabwe's 171km<sup>2</sup> [[Chimanimani National Park]] and Mozambique's [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] in the Chimanimani Mountains.

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|A diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\n\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States since the information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review |date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it's incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China\".<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn 31 August 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years. The investigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine's gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was a foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine's liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn 19 June 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure.

The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own power.<ref>http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinese_satellite_Zhongxing_9A_enters_preset_orbit_999.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight|China}}\n*[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/report/1999/3b.htm LM-3B User's Manual] at GlobalSecurity.org\n*[http://www.calt.com/english/ps/index.html Long March-3B (LM-3B)] at the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology\n\n{{Long March rockets}}\n{{Expendable launch systems}}\n{{CLEP}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long March 3b}}\n[[Category:Long March (rocket family)]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1996]]\n", "name_user": "CRS-20", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFlight mishaps", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_3B"}

The stand has been formerly known as the NTL stand and the Tesco Stand.\n\n=== South Stand ===\nThis stand is used for Away Supports for football matches and only opens for Rugby matches when needed due to extra demand. However the stand has opened for home supporters in the past for Coventry City fixtures for fixtures against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] as there was heavy demand by the home support but there was no large followings from the away side.

After the deadline passed, a winding up order was enforced through the High Court. Subsequently, after ACL planned to place Coventry City FC Ltd into administration, the club itself entered administration, accepting a 10-point penalty from the Football League as a consequence. A further 10-point penalty was incurred when ACL refused to accept the terms of a CVA proposed by the administrator.

This game was technically a sellout as the fan segregation took up a whole block and all available tickets were sold with the overall attendance being 31,407.\n\nIn December 2009, the first hat-trick was scored at the venue when [[Freddy Eastwood]] scored three past [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]].

In the corner between this stand and the South Stand is a Police control box.<ref>{{cite web|title = Ricoh Arena {{!}} Coventry City FC {{!}} Football Ground Guide|url = http://www.footballgroundguide.com/leagues/england/league-one/ricoh-arena-coventry-city.html|website = www.footballgroundguide.com|accessdate = 5 February 2016|first = Duncan|last = Adams}}</ref> This is the only stand that offers cushioned seats and it also provides seating for directors as well as the media.\n\n=== East Stand ===\nThe East Stand provided a video screen in the corner by the South Stand until 2018, this corner soon became known as the Singers' corner to Coventry fans as first called by Aidy Boothroyd, when he was manager of the Sky Blues. This is where the main cameras are positioned for the highlights of fixtures as well as the televised fixtures. The stand has been formerly known as the NTL stand and the Tesco Stand.\n\n=== South Stand ===\nThis stand is used for Away Supports for football matches and only opens for Rugby matches when needed due to extra demand. However the stand has opened for home supporters in the past for Coventry City fixtures for fixtures against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] as there was heavy demand by the home support but there was no large followings from the away side. Clubs such as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] have sold out the stand in the past. The stand has had previous names in the past, due to sponsors. In October 2018 the capacity of the stand was reduced when a new large screen was installed to replace the previous one situated between the South and East stands<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.wasps.co.uk/news/big-screen-launch/ |title = Big screen launch}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n\n=== Stadium Bowl ===\n[[File:Ricoh Arena - geograph.org.uk - 901396.jpg|thumbnail|Stadium Bowl used mainly for Rugby Union]]\nThe ''stadium bowl'' has a [[seating capacity]] of 32,609 with the overall capacity rising to 40,000 for concerts and has easy access to refreshments for customers from the many bar and food outlets around the bowl.

However, the stadium was constructed on the former site of the 'Foleshill' gasworks complex, although the Foleshill district itself begins more than a mile to the south east. The stadium is located within a quarter-mile of the boundary with [[Nuneaton and Bedworth]] and the county of [[Warwickshire]].

The previously agreed rent amounted to \u00a31.2&nbsp;million per year, but did not give Coventry City access to matchday revenue.\n\nA deadline of 27 December 2012 was given by ACL for unpaid rent. After the deadline passed, a winding up order was enforced through the High Court. Subsequently, after ACL planned to place Coventry City FC Ltd into administration, the club itself entered administration, accepting a 10-point penalty from the Football League as a consequence. A further 10-point penalty was incurred when ACL refused to accept the terms of a CVA proposed by the administrator. Coventry City Football Club has since been bought by Otium Entertainment Group.\n\nOn 23 March 2013, Coventry City moved all its staff and club shop stock from the Ricoh Arena after a long dispute over rent and access to matchday revenue with the club.<ref>{{cite news |title=Coventry City transfer staff and stock from Ricoh Arena |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21912436 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 March 2013 |accessdate=27 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] agreed to play their home games at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]]'s [[Sixfields Stadium]] to ensure that they fulfilled their fixtures.

The first vote is for a candidate to become the Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote is for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[D'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation. The overall result is approximately [[proportional representation|proportional]].\n\nIn accordance to the [[Wales Act 2014]], a candidate is allowed to stand in both a constituency, as well as a regional list. However, holding a [[dual mandate]] with the House of Commons is illegal, meaning a Welsh Parliament Member cannot also be an MP.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom]] was the last of its kind.

|title=Wales Bill (Dates) |work=publications.parliament.uk |publisher= |date= |accessdate=7 Oct 2016}}</ref> to elect 60 members to the [[Welsh Parliament]]. It would be the sixth [[general election]] since the (formerly named) Assembly was established in 1999. The election will be held along with the other [[2021 United Kingdom local elections]].\n\nIt will be the first election in which 16 and 17 year olds are allowed to vote in Wales, the largest extension of the franchise in Wales since 1969. Both changes were a result of the [[Senedd and Elections (Wales) Bill 2019]].<ref name=\":assemblywales2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.assembly.wales/en/newhome/pages/newsitem.aspx?itemid=2054|title=16 and 17 year olds get right to vote - a historic day for democracy in Wales|website=National Assembly for Wales|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-24}}</ref>\n\nSeven parties had AMs in the fifth Assembly: [[Welsh Labour]] led by [[First Minister of Wales|First Minister]] [[Mark Drakeford]], [[Welsh Conservative Party|Welsh Conservatives]] led by [[Paul Davies (politician)|Paul Davies]], [[Plaid Cymru]] led by [[Adam Price]], the [[Brexit Party]] led by [[Mark Reckless]], [[UK Independence Party|UKIP Wales]] led by [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]], the [[Welsh Liberal Democrats]] led by [[Jane Dodds]] and the Welsh National Party led by [[Neil McEvoy]].\n\n==Electoral system==\n{{main|Mixed-Member Proportional}}\n{{main|Additional Member System}}\nIn [[election]]s for the Welsh Parliament, each voter has two votes in the [[additional member system]]. The first vote is for a candidate to become the Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote is for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[D'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation. The overall result is approximately [[proportional representation|proportional]].\n\nIn accordance to the [[Wales Act 2014]], a candidate is allowed to stand in both a constituency, as well as a regional list.

In addition to basic attacks, characters have access to more powerful moves, known as smash attacks. Each character has four unique moves, which often cause effects besides damage to an opponent. ''Brawl'' introduces character-specific [[super (fighting games)|super attacks]], referred to as \"Final Smashes\".

In this world, when a fighter is defeated, they become a trophy which can be revived by touching the base. Suddenly, the Battleship Halberd appears, releasing a stream of black, purple-clouded Shadow Bugs that form the soldiers of the Subspace Army. The Ancient Minister, the cloaked, mysterious Subspace General, arrives and detonates a Subspace Bomb, which can only be detonated by the sacrifice of two [[R.O.B]] units, and transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the heroes to ally and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest the power of the allied characters by using dark cannons to convert them into trophies and using Shadow Bugs on some of them to create powerful doppelg\u00e4ngers. [[King Dedede]] begins independently gathering some fallen fighters' trophies, placing golden brooches on them.\n\nThe Ancient Minister is revealed as a subordinate to [[Ganon]]dorf, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], and [[Wario]], who are under orders from [[Master Hand]] to draw the world into Subspace. Wario, who had stolen [[Ness (character)|Ness]] with his dark cannon, is turned into a trophy by a [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters#Player Characters|Pok\u00e9mon Trainer]] and [[Lucas (Mother 3)|Lucas]], and is then helplessly sucked in by a Subspace Bomb. Meanwhile, [[Meta Knight]] leaves his group to reclaim his stolen ship, the Halberd. He allies with [[Lucario]] and [[Solid Snake|Snake]], reaching the cockpit and destroying the Mr. Game & Watch clones piloting the battleship.\n\nThe Ancient Minister's true identity is found to be that of the Master R.O.B. unit, who rebels against Ganondorf to join the allied characters. Bowser and Ganondorf detonate several bombs on their Isle of the Ancients base to create a subspace portal large enough to summon their Subspace Gunship weapon. The three major groups converge and use the Halberd to battle the Gunship. Although the Halberd is destroyed, all of the characters escape unscathed and Ganondorf and Bowser retreat after Kirby destroys the Gunship with his Dragoon. Ganondorf betrays Bowser and turns him into a trophy, only to learn that Master Hand was being manipulated by the actual Subspace Army leader, Tabuu, who turns Ganondorf into a trophy and defeats Master Hand.\n\nThe allied characters enter Tabuu's chamber, but Tabuu annihilates them all with powerful \"Off Waves\" and scatters them all throughout Subspace.

The characters in ''Brawl'' include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as [[Mario]] and [[Pikachu]].

In addition to basic attacks, characters have access to more powerful moves, known as smash attacks. Each character has four unique moves, which often cause effects besides damage to an opponent. ''Brawl'' introduces character-specific [[super (fighting games)|super attacks]], referred to as \"Final Smashes\". Significantly more powerful than regular attacks, these moves have a wide variety of effects that range from nearly unavoidable blasts to temporary transformations.

In this world, when a fighter is defeated, they become a trophy which can be revived by touching the base. Suddenly, the Battleship Halberd appears, releasing a stream of black, purple-clouded Shadow Bugs that form the soldiers of the Subspace Army. The Ancient Minister, the cloaked, mysterious Subspace General, arrives and detonates a Subspace Bomb, which can only be detonated by the sacrifice of two [[R.O.B]] units, and transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the heroes to ally and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest the power of the allied characters by using dark cannons to convert them into trophies and using Shadow Bugs on some of them to create powerful doppelg\u00e4ngers. [[King Dedede]] begins independently gathering some fallen fighters' trophies, placing golden brooches on them.\n\nThe Ancient Minister is revealed as a subordinate to [[Ganon]]dorf, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], and [[Wario]], who are under orders from [[Master Hand]] to draw the world into Subspace. Wario, who had stolen [[Ness (character)|Ness]] with his dark cannon, is turned into a trophy by a [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters#Player Characters|Pok\u00e9mon Trainer]] and [[Lucas (Mother 3)|Lucas]], and is then helplessly sucked in by a Subspace Bomb. Meanwhile, [[Meta Knight]] leaves his group to reclaim his stolen ship, the Halberd. He allies with [[Lucario]] and [[Solid Snake|Snake]], reaching the cockpit and destroying the Mr. Game & Watch clones piloting the battleship.\n\nThe Ancient Minister's true identity is found to be that of the Master R.O.B. unit, who rebels against Ganondorf to join the allied characters. Bowser and Ganondorf detonate several bombs on their Isle of the Ancients base to create a subspace portal large enough to summon their Subspace Gunship weapon. The three major groups converge and use the Halberd to battle the Gunship. Although the Halberd is destroyed, all of the characters escape unscathed and Ganondorf and Bowser retreat after Kirby destroys the Gunship with his Dragoon. Ganondorf betrays Bowser and turns him into a trophy, only to learn that Master Hand was being manipulated by the actual Subspace Army leader, Tabuu, who turns Ganondorf into a trophy and defeats Master Hand.\n\nThe allied characters enter Tabuu's chamber, but Tabuu annihilates them all with powerful \"Off Waves\" and scatters them all throughout Subspace.

Some are new, but others return from ''Melee''\u2014in some cases updated or refined, either in appearance, fighting capabilities, or both. For example, [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] and [[Fox McCloud|Fox]] have adopted designs from more recent titles at the time, while [[Samus Aran|Samus]] has gained the ability to change into Zero Suit Samus. [[Dr. Mario]], [[Roy (Fire Emblem)|Roy]], [[Young Link]], [[Mewtwo]] and [[Pichu]] are the first characters to not return from a previous game, though they do appear as stickers and/or trophies.\n\nSome previously represented series have had more characters added to ''Brawl''. [[Diddy Kong]] from the [[Donkey Kong|''Donkey Kong'' series]], [[Ike (Fire Emblem)|Ike]] from the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, and [[Lucas (Mother 3)|Lucas]] from the ''[[EarthBound (series)|EarthBound]]'' series make their first appearance in the ''Smash Bros.'' series. Other newcomers are the first to represent their series. These include characters such as [[Pit (Kid Icarus)|Pit]], representing the ''[[Kid Icarus (series)|Kid Icarus]]'' series for the first time since the 1991 [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters]]'', [[Captain Olimar|Olimar]] of the ''[[Pikmin (series)|Pikmin]]'' series, ''[[Lucario]]'' from ''[[Pokemon: Diamond and Pearl]]'', and [[Wario]], as he appears in Nintendo's ''[[WarioWare (series)|WarioWare]]''.

Stages range from floating platforms to moving areas where the characters must stay within the field of play. Each stage has a boundary that cannot be passed, or the character will be \"KO'd\", thus losing a life or \"point\", depending on the mode of play.\n\n''Brawl'' contains 41&nbsp;selectable stages, 29 of which are initially available.

At the age of 6, she began to seriously engage in music and singing. Barbie's hobby began at age 11, after her parents gave Tanya a doll when she was in the hospital with a fracture. Since then, the girl decided to become like Barbie, imitated her clothes, collected a scope of Barbie dolls. Parents, friends and acquaintances noted the similarity of Tanya and Barbie, which gave her an incentive to maintain the image, develop it and make it more global. At school, she had a bright image with a predominance of pink clothes but had few friends.{cn}}\nAt the same time, she studied in a music school, where she was one of the best students, performed at school concerts and soloed in the choir.

According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], New Brunswick is the only bilingual province. About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones, and one third francophones. One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual. Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas, mostly in [[Greater Moncton]], [[Greater Saint John]] and the capital [[Fredericton]].\n\nUnlike the other [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], New Brunswick's terrain is mostly forested uplands, with much of the land further from the coast, giving it a harsher climate. New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1785 [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] became the first incorporated city in what is now Canada.<ref name=\"CanEncycl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saint-john/ |title=Saint John, NB |website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly, reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century. In 1867, New Brunswick was one of four founding provinces of the [[Canadian Confederation]], along with [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]).\n\nAfter Confederation, wooden shipbuilding and lumbering declined, while [[protectionism]] disrupted trade ties with New England. The mid-1900s found New Brunswick to be one of the poorest regions of Canada, now mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments]] and improved support for rural areas. As of 2002, provincial [[gross domestic product]] was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial Gross Domestic Product by Industry|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=19 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053036/http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism accounts for about 9% of the labour force directly or indirectly.

The French built the fort in 1751 in an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia.]]\nBy the early 1700s the French settlements formed a part of [[Acadia]], a colonial division of [[New France]]. Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].\n\n====British colony====\nContinental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.

The art gallery at Mount Allison University is presently the oldest [[university museum|university-operated art gallery]] in Canada. Modern New Brunswick artists include landscape painter [[Jack Humphrey]], sculptor [[Claude Roussel]], and [[Miller Brittain]]. The province is also home to the [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]], which was designated as the provincial art gallery in 1994.\n\n===Literature===\n[[Julia Catherine Beckwith]], born in Fredericton, was Canada's first published novelist. Poet [[Bliss Carman]] and his cousin [[Charles G. D. Roberts]] were some of the first Canadians to achieve international fame for letters. [[Antonine Maillet]] was the first non-European winner of France's [[Prix Goncourt]]. Other modern writers include [[Alfred Bailey]], [[Alden Nowlan]], [[John Thompson (poet)|John Thompson]], [[Douglas Lochhead]], [[K. V. Johansen]], [[David Adams Richards]], [[Raymond Fraser]], and [[France Daigle]]. A recent New Brunswick Lieutenant-Governor, [[Herm\u00e9n\u00e9gilde Chiasson]], is a poet and playwright. [[The Fiddlehead]], established in 1945 at University of New Brunswick, is Canada's oldest literary magazine.\n\n===Media===\nNew Brunswick has four daily newspapers: the ''[[Times & Transcript]]'', serving eastern New Brunswick; the ''[[Telegraph-Journal]]'', based in Saint John and distributed province-wide; ''[[The Daily Gleaner]]'', based in Fredericton; and ''[[L'Acadie Nouvelle]]'', based in Caraquet. The three English-language dailies and the majority of the weeklies are owned and operated by [[Brunswick News]]\u2014which is privately owned by [[James K. Irving]]. Due to its dominant position, critics have accused Brunswick News of being biased towards the Irving Group of Companies, including its reluctance to publish stories that are critical of the group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2009/06/17/hot_scoop_burns_reporter_at_irving_paper.html|title=Hot scoop burns reporter at Irving paper|website=Toronto Star|language=en|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/prb9935-e.htm#A.%20The%20Daveytxt|title=Newspaper ownership in Canada: an overview of the Davey Committee and Kent Commission studies (PRB 99-35E)|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/07/06/news/irvings-media-monopoly-and-its-consequences|title=The Irvings' media monopoly and its consequences|last=Livesey |first=Bruce |date=2016-07-06|website=National Observer|language=en|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Media convergence, acquisitions and sales in Canada|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2010/04/29/f-media-ownership-canada.html|work=CBC News|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] has anglophone television and radio operations in Fredericton.

According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], New Brunswick is the only bilingual province. About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones, and one third francophones. One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual. Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas, mostly in [[Greater Moncton]], [[Greater Saint John]] and the capital [[Fredericton]].\n\nUnlike the other [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], New Brunswick's terrain is mostly forested uplands, with much of the land further from the coast, giving it a harsher climate. New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1785 [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] became the first incorporated city in what is now Canada.<ref name=\"CanEncycl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saint-john/ |title=Saint John, NB |website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly, reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century. In 1867, New Brunswick was one of four founding provinces of the [[Canadian Confederation]], along with [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]).\n\nAfter Confederation, wooden shipbuilding and lumbering declined, while [[protectionism]] disrupted trade ties with New England. The mid-1900s found New Brunswick to be one of the poorest regions of Canada, now mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments]] and improved support for rural areas. As of 2002, provincial [[gross domestic product]] was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial Gross Domestic Product by Industry|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=19 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053036/http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism accounts for about 9% of the labour force directly or indirectly.

The French built the fort in 1751 in an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia.]]\nBy the early 1700s the French settlements formed a part of [[Acadia]], a colonial division of [[New France]]. Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].\n\n====British colony====\nContinental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.

In 1940 the [[Rowell\u2013Sirois Commission]] reported that federal government attempts to manage the depression illustrated grave flaws in the Canadian constitution. While the federal government had most of the revenue gathering powers, the provinces had many expenditure responsibilities such as healthcare, education, and welfare, which were becoming increasingly expensive. The Commission recommended the creation of equalization payments, implemented in 1957.\n\nAfter Canada joined [[World War II]], 14 NB army units were organized, in addition to [[The Royal New Brunswick Regiment]],<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=New Brunswick at War|last=|first=|publisher=Provincial Archives of New Brunswick|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201313}}</ref> and first deployed in the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]] in 1943.

{{Quote|\"I wouldn't call them delays. It was highly optimistic that we could start quickly until scripts are written. If there's no scripts, there's nothing, right? The scripts took four years. You can call that a delay, but it's not really a delay because from the time we pushed the button to really go make the movies [until now,] we're clicking along perfectly. We're doing very well because of all the time that we had to develop the system and the pipeline and all that. We weren't wasting time, we were putting it into tech development and design. So when all the scripts were approved, everything was designed. Every character, every creature, every setting. In a funny way it was to the benefit of the film because the design team had more time to work. . . . Most of the actors, the key principals, have all read all four scripts, so they know exactly what their character arcs are, they know where they're going, they know how to modulate their arc now across the first two films\".<ref name=\"Vanity Fair Legacy\"/>}} He was optimistic that the delays would not harm the films' success, comparing it to his films ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', which were both commercially successful sequels released seven years after the original films.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair Legacy\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/james-cameron-avatar-movie-sequel-2081078|title=James Cameron isn't worried about the gap between Avatar movies|date=May 30, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> Several creatures introduced in ''[[Avatar Flight of Passage]]'' will be featured in the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movieweb.com/avatar-sequels-pandora-theme-park-crossover/|title=Avatar Sequels Stay on Pandora, Will Include Theme Park Crossovers |work=[[MovieWeb]] |date=August 14, 2018 |accessdate= August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, it was reported that the release of ''Avatar 2'' had been pushed back to December 2021 as a result of the announcement of three upcoming ''[[Star Wars]]'' films<ref name=\"auto\"/> to be released respectively in December 2023, December 2025 and December 2027.\n\n===Writing===\nIn 2012, Cameron stated that the sequels were being written as \"separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film\", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a [[cliffhanger]] to the next film.

You can call that a delay, but it's not really a delay because from the time we pushed the button to really go make the movies [until now,] we're clicking along perfectly. We're doing very well because of all the time that we had to develop the system and the pipeline and all that. We weren't wasting time, we were putting it into tech development and design. So when all the scripts were approved, everything was designed. Every character, every creature, every setting. In a funny way it was to the benefit of the film because the design team had more time to work. . . .
