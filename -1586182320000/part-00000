Colors are harmonized to achieve a balanced, unified, and aesthetically pleasing effect for the viewer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nColor harmony is achieved in a variety of ways, some of which consist of combining a set of colors that share the same hue, or a set of colors that share the same values for two of the three color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness).<ref name=\":1\" /> Color harmony can also be achieved by simply combining colors that are considered compatible to one another<ref name=\":1\" /> as represented in the [[color wheel]].\n\n*[[Contrast (vision)|'''Color contrasts''']]\n\n[[Contrast (vision)|Color contrasts]] are studied with a pair of colors, as opposed to color harmony, which studies a set of colors. In color contrasting, two colors with perceivable differences in aspects such as luminance, or saturation, are placed side by side to create contrast.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[Johannes Itten]] presented seven kinds of color contrasts: contrast of light and dark, contrast of hue, contrast of temperature, contrast of [[Colorfulness|saturation]], simultaneous contrast, contrast of sizes, and contrast of complementary.<ref name=\":1\" /> These seven kinds of color contrasts have inspired past works involving color schemes in design.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*[[Color scheme|'''Color schemes''']]\n\n[[Color scheme]]s are defined as the set of colors chosen for a design. They are often made up of two or more colors that look appealing beside one another, and that create an [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] feeling when used together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphic-design-institute.com/blogs/color-powerful-way-communicate-subconscious-human-mind|title=Uses of Colors in Designing {{!}} Learn Uses of Color|website=www.graphic-design-institute.com|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> Color schemes depend on [[Harmony (color)|color harmony]] as they point to which colors look pleasing beside one another.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA satisfactory design product is often accompanied by a successful color scheme.

Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal or curved. They can be any width or texture. And can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of line, aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is \nhorizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using a line to create.\n\n=== Point ===\nA Point is basically the beginning of \u201csomething\u201d in \u201cnothing\u201d. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms\n\n===Shape===\n{{main|Shape and form (visual arts)}}\nA [[shape]] is defined as a two dimensional area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ehhs.kent.edu/community/VLO/design/elements/shape/index.html | title=Visual Literacy |author=Cindy Kovalik, Ph.D. and Peggy King, M.Ed. |accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> Shapes are recognizable objects and forms<ref name=\":0\" /> and are usually composed of other elements of design.<ref name=\"Design Notes\">{{cite web|last=Saw|first=James|title=Design Notes|url=http://daphne.palomar.edu/design/Default.htm|publisher=Palomar College|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a [[square]] that is drawn on a piece of paper is considered a shape. It is created with a series of lines which serve as a boundary that shapes the square and separates it from the space around it that is not part of the square.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Types of shapes====\n[[Geometric shape|'''Geometric shapes''']] or mechanical shapes are shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass, such as [[square]]s, [[circle]]s, [[triangle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[parallelogram]]s, [[Star polygon|stars]], and so on.<ref name=\":0\" /> Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control and order.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n[[Organic form|'''Organic shapes''']] are irregular shapes<ref name=\":0\" /> that are often complex and resemble shapes that are found in [[nature]].<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Organic shapes can be drawn by hand, which is why they are sometimes subjective and only exist in the imagination of the artist.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Curvilinear shapes''' are composed of curved lines and smooth edges. They give off a more natural feeling to the shape. In contrast, '''rectilinear shapes''' are composed of sharp edges and [[right angle]]s, and give off a sense of order in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. They look more human-made, structured, and [[Artificiality|artificial]]. Artists can choose to create a composition that revolves mainly around one of these styles of shape, or they can choose to combine both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Texture===\n{{main|Texture (visual arts)}}\n[[File:Texture arbre.jpg|thumb|This is only a two dimensional image of a tree, but appears to have the texture of three dimensional bark.]]\n[[Texture (visual arts)|Texture]] refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==== Uses of texture in design ====\n\n* Texture can be used to attract or repel interest to an element, depending on how pleasant the texture is perceived to be.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> \n* Texture can also be used to add complex detail into the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of a design.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* In theatrical design, the surface qualities of a costume sculpts the look and feel of a character, which influences the way the audience reacts to the character.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Types of texture\n\n'''Tactile texture''', also known as \"actual texture\", refers to the physical three-dimensional texture of an object. Tactile texture can be perceived by the sense of touch. A person can feel the tactile texture of a sculpture by running their hand over its surface and feelings its ridges and dents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Painters use [[impasto]] to build peaks and create texture in their painting.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n* Texture can be created through [[collage]]. This is when artists assemble three dimensional objects and apply them onto a two-dimensional surface, like a piece of paper or canvas, to create one final composition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Papier coll\u00e9]] is another collaging technique in which artists glue paper to a surface to create different textures on its surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] is a technique that consists of assembling various three-dimensional objects into a sculpture, which can also reveal textures to the viewer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Visual texture''', also referred to as \"implied texture\", is not detectable by our sense of touch, but by our sense of sight.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Visual texture is the illusion of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface.<ref name=\":0\" /> Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture. A photograph of rough tree bark is considered a visual texture. It creates the impression of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface which would remain smooth to the touch no matter how rough the represented texture is.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\nIn painting, different [[paint]]s are used to achieve different types of textures. Paints such as [[Oil paint|oil]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]], and [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] are thicker and more [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and are used to create three-dimensional impressions on the surface. Other paints, such as [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], tend to be used for visual textures, because they are thinner and have transparency, and do not leave much tactile texture on the surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Pattern ====\nMany textures appear to repeat the same [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].<ref name=\":0\" /> When a motif is repeated over and over again in a surface, it results in a '''[[pattern]]'''.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Patterns are frequently used in [[fashion design]] or [[textile design]], where motifs are repeated to create decorative patterns on fabric or other [[textile]] materials.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Patterns are also used in [[Architecture|architectural design]], where decorative structural elements such as [[window]]s, [[column]]s, or [[pediment]]s, are incorporated into building design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Space===\nIn design, space is concerned with the area deep within the moment of designated design, the design will take place on. For a two-dimensional design, space concerns creating the illusion of a third dimension on a flat surface:<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n*Overlap is the effect where objects appear to be on top of each other. This illusion makes the top element look closer to the observer. There is no way to determine the depth of the space, only the order of closeness.\n*Shading adds gradiation marks to make an object of a two-dimensional surface seem three-dimensional.\n*Highlight, Transitional Light, Core of the Shadow, Reflected Light, and Cast Shadow give an object a three-dimensional look.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n*Linear Perspective is the concept relating to how an object seems smaller the farther away it gets.\n*Atmospheric Perspective is based on how air acts as a filter to change the appearance of distant objects.\n\n===Form===\nIn visual design, form is described as the way an artist arranges elements in the entirety of a composition.<ref name=\":0\" /> It may also be described as any [[three-dimensional]] object. Form can be measured, from top to bottom (height), side to side (width), and from back to front (depth). Form is also defined by light and dark. It can be defined by the presence of shadows on surfaces or faces of an object. There are two types of form, geometric (artificial) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture or color. It can be illustrated or constructed.\n\n==Principles of design==\n{{See also|Gestalt laws of grouping}}\nPrinciples applied to the '''elements of design''' that bring them together into one design. How one applies these principles determines how successful a design may be.<ref name=\"John L\" />\n\n===Unity/harmony===\nAccording to Alex White, author of ''The Elements of Graphic Design'', to achieve visual unity is a main goal of graphic design. When all elements are in agreement, a design is considered unified. No individual part is viewed as more important than the whole design. A good balance between unity and variety must be established to avoid a chaotic or a lifeless design.<ref name=C>{{cite book|last=White|first=Alex|title=The Elements of Graphic Design|year=2011|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-58115-762-8|pages=81\u2013105}}</ref>\n\n====Methods====\n*[[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]]: sense of distance between elements.\n*[[Similarity (geometry)|Similarity]]: ability to seem repeatable with other elements.\n*Continuation: the sense of having a line or pattern extend.\n*Repetition: elements being copied or mimicked numerous times.\n*[[Rhythm]]: is achieved when recurring position, size, color, and use of a graphic element has a focal point interruption.\n*Altering the basic [[Theme (arts)|theme]] achieves unity and helps keep interest.\n\n===Balance===\nIt is a state of equalized tension and equilibrium, which may not always be calm.<ref name=\"C\"/>\n\n====Types of balance in visual design====\n[[File:Cams.svg|thumb|The top image has symmetrical balance and the bottom image has asymmetrical balance]]\n* [[Symmetry]]\n*[[Asymmetry|Asymmetrical]] balance produces an informal balance that is attention attracting and dynamic.\n* Radial balance is arranged around a central element. The elements placed in a radial balance seem to 'radiate' out from a central point in a circular fashion.\n* Overall is a mosaic form of balance which normally arises from too many elements being put on a page. Due to the lack of hierarchy and contrast, this form of balance can look noisy but sometimes quiet.\n\n===Hierarchy===\nA good design contains elements that lead the reader through each element in order of its significance. The type and images should be expressed starting from most important to the least important.\n\n===Scale/proportion===\nUsing the relative size of elements against each other can attract attention to a focal point. When elements are designed larger than life, scale is being used to show drama.<ref name=\"C\"/>\n\n===Dominance/emphasis===\nDominance is created by contrasting size, positioning, color, style, or shape.The focal point should dominate the design with scale and contrast without sacrificing the unity of the whole.<ref name=\"C\"/>\n\n===Similarity and contrast===\nPlanning a consistent and similar design is an important aspect of a designer's work to make their focal point visible. Too much similarity is boring but without similarity important elements will not exist and an image without contrast is uneventful so the key is to find the balance between similarity and contrast.<ref name=C />\n\n====Similar environment====\nThere are several ways to develop a similar environment:<ref name=C />\n*Build a unique internal organization structure.\n*Manipulate shapes of images and text to correlate together.\n*Express continuity from page to page in publications. Items to watch include headers, themes, borders, and spaces.\n*Develop a [[style manual]] and adhere to it.\n\n====Contrasts====\n*Space\n**Filled / Empty\n**Near / Far\n**2-D / 3-D\n*Position\n**Left / Right\n**Isolated / Grouped\n**Centered / Off-Center\n**Top / Bottom\n*Form\n**Simple / Complex\n**Beauty / Ugly\n**Whole / Broken\n*Direction\n**Stability / Movement\n*Structure\n**Organized / Chaotic\n**Mechanical / Hand-Drawn\n*Size\n**Large / Small\n**Deep / Shallow\n**Fat / Thin\n*Color\n**Grey scale / Color\n**Black & White / Color\n**Light / Dark\n*Texture\n**Fine / Coarse\n**Smooth / Rough\n**Sharp / Dull\n*Density\n**Transparent / Opaque\n**Thick / Thin\n**Liquid / Solid\n*Gravity\n**Light / Heavy\n**Stable / Unstable\n\nMovement is the path the viewer\u2019s eye takes through the artwork, often to focal areas. Such movement can be directed along lines edges, shape and color within the artwork, and more.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Composition (visual arts)]]\n* [[Interior design]]\n* [[Landscape design]]\n* [[Pattern language]]\n* [[Elements of art]]\n* [[Principles of art]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Kilmer, R., & Kilmer, W.

Colors are harmonized to achieve a balanced, unified, and aesthetically pleasing effect for the viewer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nColor harmony is achieved in a variety of ways, some of which consist of combining a set of colors that share the same hue, or a set of colors that share the same values for two of the three color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness).<ref name=\":1\" /> Color harmony can also be achieved by simply combining colors that are considered compatible to one another<ref name=\":1\" /> as represented in the [[color wheel]].\n\n*[[Contrast (vision)|'''Color contrasts''']]\n\n[[Contrast (vision)|Color contrasts]] are studied with a pair of colors, as opposed to color harmony, which studies a set of colors. In color contrasting, two colors with perceivable differences in aspects such as luminance, or saturation, are placed side by side to create contrast.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[Johannes Itten]] presented seven kinds of color contrasts: contrast of light and dark, contrast of hue, contrast of temperature, contrast of [[Colorfulness|saturation]], simultaneous contrast, contrast of sizes, and contrast of complementary.<ref name=\":1\" /> These seven kinds of color contrasts have inspired past works involving color schemes in design.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*[[Color scheme|'''Color schemes''']]\n\n[[Color scheme]]s are defined as the set of colors chosen for a design. They are often made up of two or more colors that look appealing beside one another, and that create an [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] feeling when used together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphic-design-institute.com/blogs/color-powerful-way-communicate-subconscious-human-mind|title=Uses of Colors in Designing {{!}} Learn Uses of Color|website=www.graphic-design-institute.com|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> Color schemes depend on [[Harmony (color)|color harmony]] as they point to which colors look pleasing beside one another.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA satisfactory design product is often accompanied by a successful color scheme.

Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal or curved. They can be any width or texture. And can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of line, aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is \nhorizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using a line to create.\n\n=== Point ===\nA Point is basically the beginning of \u201csomething\u201d in \u201cnothing\u201d. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms\n\n===Shape===\n{{main|Shape and form (visual arts)}}\nA [[shape]] is defined as a two dimensional area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ehhs.kent.edu/community/VLO/design/elements/shape/index.html | title=Visual Literacy |author=Cindy Kovalik, Ph.D. and Peggy King, M.Ed. |accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> Shapes are recognizable objects and forms<ref name=\":0\" /> and are usually composed of other elements of design.<ref name=\"Design Notes\">{{cite web|last=Saw|first=James|title=Design Notes|url=http://daphne.palomar.edu/design/Default.htm|publisher=Palomar College|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a [[square]] that is drawn on a piece of paper is considered a shape. It is created with a series of lines which serve as a boundary that shapes the square and separates it from the space around it that is not part of the square.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Types of shapes====\n[[Geometric shape|'''Geometric shapes''']] or mechanical shapes are shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass, such as [[square]]s, [[circle]]s, [[triangle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[parallelogram]]s, [[Star polygon|stars]], and so on.<ref name=\":0\" /> Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control and order.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n[[Organic form|'''Organic shapes''']] are irregular shapes<ref name=\":0\" /> that are often complex and resemble shapes that are found in [[nature]].<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Organic shapes can be drawn by hand, which is why they are sometimes subjective and only exist in the imagination of the artist.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Curvilinear shapes''' are composed of curved lines and smooth edges. They give off a more natural feeling to the shape. In contrast, '''rectilinear shapes''' are composed of sharp edges and [[right angle]]s, and give off a sense of order in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. They look more human-made, structured, and [[Artificiality|artificial]]. Artists can choose to create a composition that revolves mainly around one of these styles of shape, or they can choose to combine both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Texture===\n{{main|Texture (visual arts)}}\n[[File:Texture arbre.jpg|thumb|This is only a two dimensional image of a tree, but appears to have the texture of three dimensional bark.]]\n[[Texture (visual arts)|Texture]] refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==== Uses of texture in design ====\n\n* Texture can be used to attract or repel interest to an element, depending on how pleasant the texture is perceived to be.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> \n* Texture can also be used to add complex detail into the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of a design.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* In theatrical design, the surface qualities of a costume sculpts the look and feel of a character, which influences the way the audience reacts to the character.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Types of texture\n\n'''Tactile texture''', also known as \"actual texture\", refers to the physical three-dimensional texture of an object. Tactile texture can be perceived by the sense of touch. A person can feel the tactile texture of a sculpture by running their hand over its surface and feelings its ridges and dents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Painters use [[impasto]] to build peaks and create texture in their painting.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n* Texture can be created through [[collage]]. This is when artists assemble three dimensional objects and apply them onto a two-dimensional surface, like a piece of paper or canvas, to create one final composition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Papier coll\u00e9]] is another collaging technique in which artists glue paper to a surface to create different textures on its surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] is a technique that consists of assembling various three-dimensional objects into a sculpture, which can also reveal textures to the viewer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Visual texture''', also referred to as \"implied texture\", is not detectable by our sense of touch, but by our sense of sight.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Visual texture is the illusion of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface.<ref name=\":0\" /> Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture. A photograph of rough tree bark is considered a visual texture. It creates the impression of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface which would remain smooth to the touch no matter how rough the represented texture is.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\nIn painting, different [[paint]]s are used to achieve different types of textures. Paints such as [[Oil paint|oil]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]], and [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] are thicker and more [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and are used to create three-dimensional impressions on the surface. Other paints, such as [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], tend to be used for visual textures, because they are thinner and have transparency, and do not leave much tactile texture on the surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Pattern ====\nMany textures appear to repeat the same [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].<ref name=\":0\" /> When a motif is repeated over and over again in a surface, it results in a '''[[pattern]]'''.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Patterns are frequently used in [[fashion design]] or [[textile design]], where motifs are repeated to create decorative patterns on fabric or other [[textile]] materials.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Patterns are also used in [[Architecture|architectural design]], where decorative structural elements such as [[window]]s, [[column]]s, or [[pediment]]s, are incorporated into building design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Space===\nIn design, space is concerned with the area deep within the moment of designated design, the design will take place on. For a two-dimensional design, space concerns creating the illusion of a third dimension on a flat surface:<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n*Overlap is the effect where objects appear to be on top of each other. This illusion makes the top element look closer to the observer. There is no way to determine the depth of the space, only the order of closeness.\n*Shading adds gradiation marks to make an object of a two-dimensional surface seem three-dimensional.\n*Highlight, Transitional Light, Core of the Shadow, Reflected Light, and Cast Shadow give an object a three-dimensional look.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n*Linear Perspective is the concept relating to how an object seems smaller the farther away it gets.\n*Atmospheric Perspective is based on how air acts as a filter to change the appearance of distant objects.\n\n===Form===\nIn visual design, form is described as the way an artist arranges elements in the entirety of a composition.<ref name=\":0\" /> It may also be described as any [[three-dimensional]] object. Form can be measured, from top to bottom (height), side to side (width), and from back to front (depth). Form is also defined by light and dark. It can be defined by the presence of shadows on surfaces or faces of an object. There are two types of form, geometric (artificial) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture or color. It can be illustrated or constructed.\n\n==Principles of design==\n{{See also|Gestalt laws of grouping}}\nPrinciples applied to the '''elements of design''' that bring them together into one design. How one applies these principles determines how successful a design may be.<ref name=\"John L\" />\n\n===Unity/harmony===\nAccording to Alex White, author of ''The Elements of Graphic Design'', to achieve visual unity is a main goal of graphic design. When all elements are in agreement, a design is considered unified. No individual part is viewed as more important than the whole design. A good balance between unity and variety must be established to avoid a chaotic or a lifeless design.<ref name=C>{{cite book|last=White|first=Alex|title=The Elements of Graphic Design|year=2011|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-58115-762-8|pages=81\u2013105}}</ref>\n\n====Methods====\n*[[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]]: sense of distance between elements.\n*[[Similarity (geometry)|Similarity]]: ability to seem repeatable with other elements.\n*Continuation: the sense of having a line or pattern extend.\n*Repetition: elements being copied or mimicked numerous times.\n*[[Rhythm]]: is achieved when recurring position, size, color, and use of a graphic element has a focal point interruption.\n*Altering the basic [[Theme (arts)|theme]] achieves unity and helps keep interest.\n\n===Balance===\nIt is a state of equalized tension and equilibrium, which may not always be calm.<ref name=\"C\"/>\n\n====Types of balance in visual design====\n[[File:Cams.svg|thumb|The top image has symmetrical balance and the bottom image has asymmetrical balance]]\n* [[Symmetry]]\n*[[Asymmetry|Asymmetrical]] balance produces an informal balance that is attention attracting and dynamic.\n* Radial balance is arranged around a central element. The elements placed in a radial balance seem to 'radiate' out from a central point in a circular fashion.\n* Overall is a mosaic form of balance which normally arises from too many elements being put on a page. Due to the lack of hierarchy and contrast, this form of balance can look noisy but sometimes quiet.\n\n===Hierarchy===\nA good design contains elements that lead the reader through each element in order of its significance. The type and images should be expressed starting from most important to the least important.\n\n===Scale/proportion===\nUsing the relative size of elements against each other can attract attention to a focal point. When elements are designed larger than life, scale is being used to show drama.<ref name=\"C\"/>\n\n===Dominance/emphasis===\nDominance is created by contrasting size, positioning, color, style, or shape.The focal point should dominate the design with scale and contrast without sacrificing the unity of the whole.<ref name=\"C\"/>\n\n===Similarity and contrast===\nPlanning a consistent and similar design is an important aspect of a designer's work to make their focal point visible. Too much similarity is boring but without similarity important elements will not exist and an image without contrast is uneventful so the key is to find the balance between similarity and contrast.<ref name=C />\n\n====Similar environment====\nThere are several ways to develop a similar environment:<ref name=C />\n*Build a unique internal organization structure.\n*Manipulate shapes of images and text to correlate together.\n*Express continuity from page to page in publications. Items to watch include headers, themes, borders, and spaces.\n*Develop a [[style manual]] and adhere to it.\n\n====Contrasts====\n*Space\n**Filled / Empty\n**Near / Far\n**2-D / 3-D\n*Position\n**Left / Right\n**Isolated / Grouped\n**Centered / Off-Center\n**Top / Bottom\n*Form\n**Simple / Complex\n**Beauty / Ugly\n**Whole / Broken\n*Direction\n**Stability / Movement\n*Structure\n**Organized / Chaotic\n**Mechanical / Hand-Drawn\n*Size\n**Large / Small\n**Deep / Shallow\n**Fat / Thin\n*Color\n**Grey scale / Color\n**Black & White / Color\n**Light / Dark\n*Texture\n**Fine / Coarse\n**Smooth / Rough\n**Sharp / Dull\n*Density\n**Transparent / Opaque\n**Thick / Thin\n**Liquid / Solid\n*Gravity\n**Light / Heavy\n**Stable / Unstable\n\nMovement is the path the viewer\u2019s eye takes through the artwork, often to focal areas.

It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended [[Napoleon]]'s presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on [[Elba]]. The [[Monument to the Battle of the Nations]] celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.<ref>Katherine Aaslestad, \"Cities and War: Modern Military Urbanism in Hamburg and Leipzig during the Napoleonic Era.\" ''German History'' 35.3 (2017): 381-402.</ref>\n\nWhen it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance [[railway]] to [[Dresden]] (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of [[Central Europe]]an railway traffic, with [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]] the largest [[terminal station]] by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the [[Royal Saxon State Railways]] and the western one for the [[Prussian state railways]].\n\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German [[List of Labour Parties|labor party]], the [[General German Workers' Association]] (''Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein'', ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge ''[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]'' areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n[[File:Leipzig um 1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Augustusplatz with [[Leipzig Opera]] House, around 1900]]\n\n===20th century===\n{{See also|History of Leipzig from 1933-1939|Bombing of Leipzig in World War II|University of Music and Theatre Leipzig}}\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the [[Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei]] became the largest [[cotton mill]] company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles.

Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the [[Jews]] living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig.

Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of [[Dresden]], this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\n\nThe Allied ground advance into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] and U.S. [[69th Infantry Division (United States)|69th Infantry Division]] fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939\u20131946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 78, 139.</ref> In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a [[Volkssturm]] Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\n\nThe United States turned the city over to the [[Red Army]] as it pulled back from the [[line of contact]] with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries.

At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the [[Monument to the Battle of the Nations]].\n\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://theprotocity.com/leipzig-back-growth-everyone/|title=Leipzig: Back to Growth, but Not for Everyone|date=2014-08-25|website=TheProtoCity.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67845/1/casereport107.pdf|title=Leipzig City Story|last=Power|first=Anne and Elineen Herden|date=May 2016|website=LSE Housing and Communities|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, after [[prayer]]s for peace at [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|St.&nbsp;Nicholas Church]], established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] started as the most prominent mass protest against the [[Government of East Germany|East German government]].<ref>David Brebis (ed.), ''Michelin guide to Germany'', Greenville (2006), p. 324.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8297630.stm|title=The day I outflanked the Stasi|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2009}} + video.</ref> The [[reunification of Germany]], however, was at first not good for Leipzig.

There are also several [[Baroque architecture|baroque period]] trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the [[Historicism (art)|historicist style]] representative of the ''[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]'' era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The [[New Town Hall (Leipzig)|new city hall]], completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\n\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in [[Plattenbau]] buildings during Communist rule in East Germany.<ref>[[:de:Liste der Plattenbausiedlungen in Sachsen#Leipzig]]</ref> and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation.<ref>[[:de:Plattenbauten in Leipzig]]</ref> Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/gruenau/|title=Leipzig-Gr\u00fcnau|work=leipzig.de}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|St. Paul's Church]] was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called [[Paulinum (University of Leipzig)|Paulinum]], which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\n\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n===Tallest buildings and structures===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of {{convert|205|m|ft|abbr=off}}.

After the [[Reunification of Germany]], immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n===Rail===\n\n[[File:Bahnhof Leipzig von Panorama Tower 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]] is the main hub of tram and rail network and the world's largest railway station by floor area.]]\n[[File:Leipziger Bahnhof (228148125).jpeg|thumb|right|Inside Leipzig main station.]]\nOpened in 1915, [[Leipzig Central Station]] is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]] network of the [[Deutsche Bahn]] as well as a connection point for [[S-Bahn]] and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\n\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\n\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\n\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200&nbsp;km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300&nbsp;km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200&nbsp;km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long [[City-Tunnel (Leipzig)|City Tunnel]], which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]].\n\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n===Suburban train===\n\n{{see also|S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland}}\n[[File:S-Bahn - City-Tunnel Leipzig mit BR 182 und Doppelstockwagen (HP Markt).jpg|thumb|right|Trains of S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland at [[Leipzig Markt station]].]]\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and [[Bayerischer Bahnhof]] leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\n\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n===Tramway and Buses===\n\n{{see also|Trams in Leipzig}}\n[[File:Leipzig Tram 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Tram at [[Goerdelerring]].]]\nThe [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe]], existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\n\nThe total length of the tram network is {{cvt|149.9|km}}, making it the largest in Saxony ({{cvt|130.2|km}}) ahead of Dresden and the second largest in Germany ({{cvt|193.6|km}} after Berlin). The longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\n\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n===Bicycle===\n\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be [[bicycle-friendly]]. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\n\nSince 2004 there is a [[bicycle-sharing system]]. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n===Road===\n\n[[File:Mitteldeutsche-Schleife.png|thumb|Leipzig's road network]]\n[[File:Leipzig-Halle Airport Check-in.jpg|thumb|[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], hub of [[DHL Express|DHL]]]]\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the [[Bundesautobahn 14|A 14]] in the north, the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A 9]] in the west and the [[Bundesautobahn 38|A 38]] in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A 72]] is also partly under construction or being planned.\n\nThe [[Bundesstra\u00dfe|federal roads]] [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 2|B 2]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 6|B 6]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 87|B 87]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 181|B 181]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 184|B 184]] and [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 186|B 186]] lead through the city area.\n\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\n\nLeipzig has a dense network of [[carsharing]] stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\n\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a [[Transportation network company|ridesharing provider]]. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n===Long-distance buses===\n\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\n\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5&nbsp;million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\n\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and [[Leipziger Messe]] for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n===Air===\n\n[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\n\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). [[DHL]] uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines [[Aerologic]] and [[European Air Transport Leipzig]].\n\nThe former military airport near [[Altenburg]], [[Thuringia]] called [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]] about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by [[Ryanair]] until 2010.\n\n===Water===\n\n[[File:Leipzig - Elsterflutbett + Palmengartenwehr 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Boats at the [[White Elster|Elsterflutbett]]]]\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the [[Elster-Saale canal]], [[White Elster]] and [[Saale]] was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of [[forced labor]]. The [[Lindenauer port]] was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and [[Karl-Heine canal]] respectively. The Leipzig rivers ([[White Elster]], [[Neue Luppe|New Luppe]], [[Plei\u00dfe]], and [[Parthe]]) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\n\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing [[mill race]]s and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused [[open cast mines]], the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the [[Elbe]] from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Leipzig NGT12-LEI Waldplatz defekt.jpg|Tram of [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe]]\nFile:Leipzig Georg-Schumann-Strasse.jpg|Tramsystem at the Georg-Schumann-Stra\u00dfe\nFile:S-Bahnhof Leipzig Markt.jpg|[[Leipzig City Tunnel]], part of Leipzig's new [[S-Bahn]] network\nFile:S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.

The [[Monument to the Battle of the Nations]] celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.<ref>Katherine Aaslestad, \"Cities and War: Modern Military Urbanism in Hamburg and Leipzig during the Napoleonic Era.\" ''German History'' 35.3 (2017): 381-402.</ref>\n\nWhen it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance [[railway]] to [[Dresden]] (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of [[Central Europe]]an railway traffic, with [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]] the largest [[terminal station]] by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the [[Royal Saxon State Railways]] and the western one for the [[Prussian state railways]].\n\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German [[List of Labour Parties|labor party]], the [[General German Workers' Association]] (''Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein'', ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway.

Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the [[Jews]] living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig.

Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of [[Dresden]], this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\n\nThe Allied ground advance into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] and U.S. [[69th Infantry Division (United States)|69th Infantry Division]] fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939\u20131946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 78, 139.</ref> In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a [[Volkssturm]] Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\n\nThe United States turned the city over to the [[Red Army]] as it pulled back from the [[line of contact]] with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries.

At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the [[Monument to the Battle of the Nations]].\n\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://theprotocity.com/leipzig-back-growth-everyone/|title=Leipzig: Back to Growth, but Not for Everyone|date=2014-08-25|website=TheProtoCity.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67845/1/casereport107.pdf|title=Leipzig City Story|last=Power|first=Anne and Elineen Herden|date=May 2016|website=LSE Housing and Communities|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, after [[prayer]]s for peace at [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|St.&nbsp;Nicholas Church]], established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] started as the most prominent mass protest against the [[Government of East Germany|East German government]].<ref>David Brebis (ed.), ''Michelin guide to Germany'', Greenville (2006), p. 324.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8297630.stm|title=The day I outflanked the Stasi|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2009}} + video.</ref> The [[reunification of Germany]], however, was at first not good for Leipzig.

After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called [[Paulinum (University of Leipzig)|Paulinum]], which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\n\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n===Tallest buildings and structures===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of {{convert|205|m|ft|abbr=off}}.

The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\n\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200&nbsp;km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300&nbsp;km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200&nbsp;km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long [[City-Tunnel (Leipzig)|City Tunnel]], which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]].\n\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n===Suburban train===\n\n{{see also|S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland}}\n[[File:S-Bahn - City-Tunnel Leipzig mit BR 182 und Doppelstockwagen (HP Markt).jpg|thumb|right|Trains of S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland at [[Leipzig Markt station]].]]\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and [[Bayerischer Bahnhof]] leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\n\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n===Tramway and Buses===\n\n{{see also|Trams in Leipzig}}\n[[File:Leipzig Tram 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Tram at [[Goerdelerring]].]]\nThe [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe]], existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\n\nThe total length of the tram network is {{cvt|149.9|km}}, making it the largest in Saxony ({{cvt|130.2|km}}) ahead of Dresden and the second largest in Germany ({{cvt|193.6|km}} after Berlin). The longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\n\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n===Bicycle===\n\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be [[bicycle-friendly]]. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\n\nSince 2004 there is a [[bicycle-sharing system]]. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n===Road===\n\n[[File:Mitteldeutsche-Schleife.png|thumb|Leipzig's road network]]\n[[File:Leipzig-Halle Airport Check-in.jpg|thumb|[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], hub of [[DHL Express|DHL]]]]\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the [[Bundesautobahn 14|A 14]] in the north, the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A 9]] in the west and the [[Bundesautobahn 38|A 38]] in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A 72]] is also partly under construction or being planned.\n\nThe [[Bundesstra\u00dfe|federal roads]] [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 2|B 2]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 6|B 6]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 87|B 87]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 181|B 181]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 184|B 184]] and [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 186|B 186]] lead through the city area.\n\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\n\nLeipzig has a dense network of [[carsharing]] stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\n\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a [[Transportation network company|ridesharing provider]]. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n===Long-distance buses===\n\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\n\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\n\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and [[Leipziger Messe]] for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n===Air===\n\n[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\n\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). [[DHL]] uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines [[Aerologic]] and [[European Air Transport Leipzig]].\n\nThe former military airport near [[Altenburg]], [[Thuringia]] called [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]] about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by [[Ryanair]] until 2010.\n\n===Water===\n\n[[File:Leipzig - Elsterflutbett + Palmengartenwehr 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Boats at the [[White Elster|Elsterflutbett]]]]\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the [[Elster-Saale canal]], [[White Elster]] and [[Saale]] was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of [[forced labor]]. The [[Lindenauer port]] was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and [[Karl-Heine canal]] respectively. The Leipzig rivers ([[White Elster]], [[Neue Luppe|New Luppe]], [[Plei\u00dfe]], and [[Parthe]]) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\n\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing [[mill race]]s and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused [[open cast mines]], the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the [[Elbe]] from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Leipzig NGT12-LEI Waldplatz defekt.jpg|Tram of [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe]]\nFile:Leipzig Georg-Schumann-Strasse.jpg|Tramsystem at the Georg-Schumann-Stra\u00dfe\nFile:S-Bahnhof Leipzig Markt.jpg|[[Leipzig City Tunnel]], part of Leipzig's new [[S-Bahn]] network\nFile:S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.
