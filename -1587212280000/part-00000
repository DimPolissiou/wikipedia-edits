There are essential mycorrhizae that evolved from other symbioses such as [[Ascomycota]], (which shares a phylum with [[Basidiomycota]], another major mycorrhiza) which evolved to eventually become Ericoid mycorrhizae or [[Ectomycorrhizae]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gueidan C, Ruibal C, de Hoog GS, Schneider H | title = Rock-inhabiting fungi originated during periods of dry climate in the late Devonian and middle Triassic | journal = Fungal Biology | volume = 115 | issue = 10 | pages = 987\u201396 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21944211 | doi = 10.1016/j.funbio.2011.04.002 }}</ref> Some of the derived families are more complex due to specialized or multifunctional roots, which were not present in earlier times before [[Pangaea]]. The climate of the environments these groups of mycorrhizae occupied (which developed on rocky surfaces) were arid, not allowing for much diversification in life due to fixed niches.<ref name=\":1\" /> The downside to looking into the history of most fungi and plant symbioses is that typically, fungi do not preserve very well, so finding a fungal fossil of more ancient periods is not only difficult, but offers only specific information about the fungus and the environment in which it developed.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Second wave \u2013 Cretaceous ===\nThis diversification in both plants and mycorrhizae brought about their second wave of evolution within the Cretaceous period, which introduced alongside arbuscular mycorrhizae three new types of mycorrhizae: [[orchid mycorrhiza]]e, [[ericoid mycorrhiza]]e, and [[ectomycorrhiza]]e.<ref name=\":0\" /> The taxonomic diversification of all plants with and without mycorrhizal symbiosis shows that 71% makes up arbuscular mycorrhizae, 10% makes up [[Orchidaceae]], 2% make up ectomycorrhizae, and 1.4% make up ericoid mycorrhizae.<ref name=\":0\" /> The defining feature of this wave of evolution was the consistency of root types (or in other words, the similarities shared between root types, though characteristically different for individual families or even species) within the families that allowed for appropriate symbiosis with the plants of the period.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh SP, Singh JS, Majumdar S, Moyano J, Nu\u00f1ez MA, Richardson DM | title = Pinus species) in the Late Cretaceous and their increasing dominance in the Anthropocene | journal = Ecology and Evolution | volume = 8 | issue = 20 | pages = 10345\u201310359 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30398478 | pmc = 6206191 | doi = 10.1002/ece3.4499 }}</ref> The environments of this period had a radiation of [[angiosperm]]s, showing a different reproductive strategy than before and providing distinct morphological traits for most varieties of plants as opposed to prior periods and before the [[K-Pg extinction event]].<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Strullu-Derrien C, Selosse MA, Kenrick P, Martin FM | title = The origin and evolution of mycorrhizal symbioses: from palaeomycology to phylogenomics | journal = The New Phytologist | volume = 220 | issue = 4 | pages = 1012\u20131030 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 29573278 | doi = 10.1111/nph.15076 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The climate that allowed for these developments could be described as relatively warm, leading to higher sea levels and shallow inland bodies of water.<ref name=\":3\" /> These areas were occupied mostly by reptiles that fed on animals, and insects that fed on plants, showing a more complex ecosystem than was present in the [[Triassic period]] and further pushing evolution in plants and mycorrhizae via ever-present natural selection. There is plenty of plant evidence to support most of these findings; however, the information necessary to form hypotheses regarding the mycorrhizae of the time, as well as other related symbioses, is incredibly limited as the fossilization of such individuals is very rare.\n\n=== Third wave \u2013 Paleogene ===\nThe third wave of evolutionary diversification began in the [[Paleogene Period]] (24\u201375&nbsp;million years ago) and is closely linked with change in climate and soil conditions.<ref name=\":0\" /> The conditions that caused these changes are mostly due to an increase in disturbed niches and environments and the warming of global ecosystems, causing a shift in mycorrhizal types in plants within more complex soils.<ref name=\":3\" /> This wave consists of lineages of plants with root morphologies that are often inconsistent with the previously mentioned families from the second wave.<ref name=\":0\" /> These would be referred to as \"New Complex Root Clades,\" due to the complexities that would arise in peculiar environments between ectomycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants.<ref name=\":0\" /> While both the second and third waves are linked to climate change, the defining feature of the third wave is the increased variability within the families and complexities in plant-fungus associations.<ref name=\":3\" /> These stretches of diversification were brought about by an initially hot and humid climate, but became cooler and drier over time, forcing [[genetic drift]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThese three waves are what help divide and organize most of the mycorrhizae timeline without getting into specific genera and species. While it is important to mention the distinction of these fungal types and their differences, it is equally important to recognize their counterpart plant diversification as well. There are a number of notable nonmycorrhizal plants that speciate during the Cretaceous Period&mdash;while there was a spread in mycorrhizal plants, there was also a spread in nonmycorrhizal plants. This all helps play into a clearly picture of the distribution of plants and their symbiotic fungi over the course of an Earth's history.\n\n== The effect of climate on plants and mycorrhizae ==\nThere are various effects that a changing climate can have on the numerous species found within an ecosystem. This includes plants and their symbiotic relations. As it is understood, any particular mycorrhiza is expected to be both present and abundant in any of its respective niches so long as the environment can support its growth. However, sustainable environments are becoming uncommon due to the effects of a warming, changing climate. It is important to note that the relationship between the vascular host plant and mycorrhizae is [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]]. This means global environmental change first affects the host plant, which in turn impacts the mycorrhizae in a very similar way. Essentially, if the host plant experiences environmental stress, this will be passed along to the mycorrhizae, which could have negative consequences'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5043000/|title=Stressed out symbiotes: hypotheses for the influence of abiotic stress on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|last=Millar|first=Niall|date=|website=NCBI|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>'''. \n\n<u>[[Arbuscular mycorrhiza|Arbuscular mycorrhizae]]</u>, the most common form of mycorrhizae which are widespread \"essential components of soil biota in natural and agricultural ecosystems\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00747/full|title=Belowground Inoculation With Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Increases Local and Systemic Susceptibility of Rice Plants to Different Pest Organisms|last=Bernaola|first=Lina|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, are used as a benchmark for the impacts of climate change on mycorrhizae in the following sections. \n\n=== Increasing temperatures and excess CO<sub>2</sub> ===\nThe temperature of the globe is steadily rising due to human activity, where the majority of the blame can be placed on anthropogenic production of pollutant gases. The most common gas that is produced by both artificial and natural means is CO<sub>2</sub>, and its heavy collective concentration in the atmosphere traps a large amount of heat underneath the atmosphere.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal| vauthors = Monz CA, Hunt HW, Reeves FB, Elliott ET |date=1994-03-01|title=The response of mycorrhizal colonization to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and climate change in Pascopyrum smithii and Bouteloua gracilis |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=165|issue=1|pages=75\u201380|doi=10.1007/BF00009964 }}</ref> The heat affects fungi differently depending on what genus, species or strain they are; while some fungi suffer at certain temperatures, others thrive in them.<ref name=\":4\" /> This depends on which environments the fungi are most often found in. However, temperature also plays a vital role in availability of water and nutrients as the hotter climates will have an easier time absorbing nutrients but are also threatened by [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of proteins.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the soil is dried by excessive heat, the hyphae of the mycorrhizae as well as the plant root hairs will have far more difficulty obtaining both water and the nutrients to sustain their interactions.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhile temperature may play a key role in fungal and plant growth, there is equally as much dependence on the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is absorbed. The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> within the soil is different from the amount that is in the air; the presence of this CO<sub>2</sub> is a vital part of many plant cycles (such as photosynthesis) and due to the properties of plant-fungus symbiosis taking place in roots, mycorrhizae are affected as well. When plants are exposed to higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub>, they tend to take advantage of it and grow faster.<ref name=\":4\" /> This also increases the allocation of carbon to the plant's roots rather than the plant's shoots, which is beneficial to the symbiotic mycorrhizae.<ref name=\":4\" /> There is an increase in the amount of space that the roots can occupy and thus the cycle of trade between the plant and the fungi increases, showing potential for further growth and taking advantage of the available resources until the feedback becomes neutral.<ref name=\":4\" /> The allocated CO<sub>2</sub> that is provided to the mycorrhizae also allows them to grow at an increased rate at higher levels, meaning the hyphae of the fungi will also expand, however the direct benefits seem to cease there in accordance to the mycorrhizae, alone.<ref name=\":4\" /> \"Despite significant effects on root carbohydrate levels, there were generally no significant effects on mycorrhizal colonization.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> This means that while the plant may grow larger, the mycorrhizae will grow proportionally larger with the growth of the plant. In other words, the mycorrhizae's growth is caused by the growth of the plant; the opposite cannot be proven true even though these environmental factors affect both the mycorrhizae and the plant. CO<sub>2</sub> should not be thought of as entirely beneficial: its main contribution is to photosynthetic processes but the plant relies on it while the essential sugars that the mycorrhizae require can only be provided by the plant; they cannot be extracted directly from the soils.<ref name=\":4\" /> The effects CO<sub>2</sub> has on the environment are detrimental in the long run as it is a vital contributor to the problem of [[greenhouse gases]] and loss of territory in which plants and their respective mycorrhizae grow.\n\n== Mycorrhizae in Arctic Regions ==\nWhile it may seem like a barren landscape, the Arctic is actually home to huge populations of animals, plants, and fungi. The plants in these regions depend on their relationship with mycorrhizae, and without it, would not fare as well as they do in such harsh conditions. In Arctic regions, nitrogen and water are harder for plants to obtain as the ground is frozen, which makes mycorrhizae crucial to their fitness, health, and growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19190704|title=Mycorrhizal fungi supply nitrogen to host plants in Arctic tundra and boreal forests: 15N is the key signal.|last=Hobbie|first=JE|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nClimate change has been recognized to affect Arctic regions more drastically than non-Arctic regions, a process known as [[Arctic amplification|Arctic Amplification]].

Fungi tend to grow where there are already plants and probably animals because many of them are symbiotic in nature and the rely on very specific environments in order to grow. Plants on the other hand must rely on separate elements in order to spread, like the wind or other animals, and when seeds are planted the environments must still be sufficient enough to help them grow.<ref name=\":5\" /> Arbuscular mycorrhizae are the best example of this as it is found nearly anywhere where plants are growing in the wild. However, with changing climate comes change in environments. As climates warm or cool, plants tend to \"move\", that is \u2013 they exhibit biogeographic movement.<ref name=\":5\" /> Some habitats no longer remain viable to certain plants but then other previously hostile environments may become more hospitable to the same species.<ref name=\":5\" /> Once again, if a plant occupies an environment where mycorrhizae can grow and form a symbiosis with the plant, it will likely occur with seldom exceptions.\n\nNot all fungi can grow in the same places though, distinct types of fungi are necessary to consider. Even though some fungi can have a massive area of dispersal, they still succumb to the same barriers that most species do. Some elevations are too high or too low and limit the capacity to disperse spores, favoring similar elevation as opposed to an increase inclining or declining elevation.<ref name=\":5\" /> Some biomes are too wet or too dry for a plant to not only move to but grow and survive in, or the fungi that occupy one climate do not function as efficiently (if at all) in another climate, limiting the dispersal even more.<ref name=\":5\" /> There are other factors that will mediate the dispersal of fungi, creating boundaries that can cause speciation between fungal communities, such as distance, bodies of water, strength or direction of wind, even animal interactions There are \"structural differences, such as mushroom height, spore shape and size of the Buller\u2019s drop, that determine dispersal distances.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> Morphological reproductive traits such as these play a big role in dispersal, and if there is a barrier that isolates or eliminates these, such as a river or a lack of soil which can support mycorrhizal interactions due to something like falling pH levels from acid rain, essential tactics for germination become obsolete as the offspring do not survive and thus, the population cannot grow or move. [[Vertical transmission]] of mycorrhizae does not exist, so to move past these barriers requires alternative means of [[horizontal transmission]].<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison J, Moora M, \u00d6pik M, Adholeya A, Ainsaar L, B\u00e2 A, Burla S, Diedhiou AG, Hiiesalu I, Jairus T, Johnson NC, Kane A, Koorem K, Kochar M, Ndiaye C, P\u00e4rtel M, Reier \u00dc, Saks \u00dc, Singh R, Vasar M, Zobel M | title = FUNGAL SYMBIONTS.

While vegetation above ground is easier to see and varies less over a larger region, soil contents vary widely within a much smaller region.

There are essential mycorrhizae that evolved from other symbioses such as [[Ascomycota]], (which shares a phylum with [[Basidiomycota]], another major mycorrhiza) which evolved to eventually become Ericoid mycorrhizae or [[Ectomycorrhizae]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gueidan C, Ruibal C, de Hoog GS, Schneider H | title = Rock-inhabiting fungi originated during periods of dry climate in the late Devonian and middle Triassic | journal = Fungal Biology | volume = 115 | issue = 10 | pages = 987\u201396 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21944211 | doi = 10.1016/j.funbio.2011.04.002 }}</ref> Some of the derived families are more complex due to specialized or multifunctional roots, which were not present in earlier times before [[Pangaea]]. The climate of the environments these groups of mycorrhizae occupied (which developed on rocky surfaces) were arid, not allowing for much diversification in life due to fixed niches.<ref name=\":1\" /> The downside to looking into the history of most fungi and plant symbioses is that typically, fungi do not preserve very well, so finding a fungal fossil of more ancient periods is not only difficult, but offers only specific information about the fungus and the environment in which it developed.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Second wave \u2013 Cretaceous ===\nThis diversification in both plants and mycorrhizae brought about their second wave of evolution within the Cretaceous period, which introduced alongside arbuscular mycorrhizae three new types of mycorrhizae: [[orchid mycorrhiza]]e, [[ericoid mycorrhiza]]e, and [[ectomycorrhiza]]e.<ref name=\":0\" /> The taxonomic diversification of all plants with and without mycorrhizal symbiosis shows that 71% makes up arbuscular mycorrhizae, 10% makes up [[Orchidaceae]], 2% make up ectomycorrhizae, and 1.4% make up ericoid mycorrhizae.<ref name=\":0\" /> The defining feature of this wave of evolution was the consistency of root types (or in other words, the similarities shared between root types, though characteristically different for individual families or even species) within the families that allowed for appropriate symbiosis with the plants of the period.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh SP, Singh JS, Majumdar S, Moyano J, Nu\u00f1ez MA, Richardson DM | title = Pinus species) in the Late Cretaceous and their increasing dominance in the Anthropocene | journal = Ecology and Evolution | volume = 8 | issue = 20 | pages = 10345\u201310359 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30398478 | pmc = 6206191 | doi = 10.1002/ece3.4499 }}</ref> The environments of this period had a radiation of [[angiosperm]]s, showing a different reproductive strategy than before and providing distinct morphological traits for most varieties of plants as opposed to prior periods and before the [[K-Pg extinction event]].<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Strullu-Derrien C, Selosse MA, Kenrick P, Martin FM | title = The origin and evolution of mycorrhizal symbioses: from palaeomycology to phylogenomics | journal = The New Phytologist | volume = 220 | issue = 4 | pages = 1012\u20131030 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 29573278 | doi = 10.1111/nph.15076 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The climate that allowed for these developments could be described as relatively warm, leading to higher sea levels and shallow inland bodies of water.<ref name=\":3\" /> These areas were occupied mostly by reptiles that fed on animals, and insects that fed on plants, showing a more complex ecosystem than was present in the [[Triassic period]] and further pushing evolution in plants and mycorrhizae via ever-present natural selection. There is plenty of plant evidence to support most of these findings; however, the information necessary to form hypotheses regarding the mycorrhizae of the time, as well as other related symbioses, is incredibly limited as the fossilization of such individuals is very rare.\n\n=== Third wave \u2013 Paleogene ===\nThe third wave of evolutionary diversification began in the [[Paleogene Period]] (24\u201375&nbsp;million years ago) and is closely linked with change in climate and soil conditions.<ref name=\":0\" /> The conditions that caused these changes are mostly due to an increase in disturbed niches and environments and the warming of global ecosystems, causing a shift in mycorrhizal types in plants within more complex soils.<ref name=\":3\" /> This wave consists of lineages of plants with root morphologies that are often inconsistent with the previously mentioned families from the second wave.<ref name=\":0\" /> These would be referred to as \"New Complex Root Clades,\" due to the complexities that would arise in peculiar environments between ectomycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants.<ref name=\":0\" /> While both the second and third waves are linked to climate change, the defining feature of the third wave is the increased variability within the families and complexities in plant-fungus associations.<ref name=\":3\" /> These stretches of diversification were brought about by an initially hot and humid climate, but became cooler and drier over time, forcing [[genetic drift]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThese three waves are what help divide and organize most of the mycorrhizae timeline without getting into specific genera and species. While it is important to mention the distinction of these fungal types and their differences, it is equally important to recognize their counterpart plant diversification as well. There are a number of notable nonmycorrhizal plants that speciate during the Cretaceous Period&mdash;while there was a spread in mycorrhizal plants, there was also a spread in nonmycorrhizal plants. This all helps play into a clearly picture of the distribution of plants and their symbiotic fungi over the course of an Earth's history.\n\n== The effect of climate on plants and mycorrhizae ==\nThere are various effects that a changing climate can have on the numerous species found within an ecosystem. This includes plants and their symbiotic relations. As it is understood, any particular mycorrhiza is expected to be both present and abundant in any of its respective niches so long as the environment can support its growth. However, sustainable environments are becoming uncommon due to the effects of a warming, changing climate. It is important to note that the relationship between the vascular host plant and mycorrhizae is [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]]. This means global environmental change first affects the host plant, which in turn impacts the mycorrhizae in a very similar way. Essentially, if the host plant experiences environmental stress, this will be passed along to the mycorrhizae, which could have negative consequences'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5043000/|title=Stressed out symbiotes: hypotheses for the influence of abiotic stress on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|last=Millar|first=Niall|date=|website=NCBI|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>'''. \n\n<u>[[Arbuscular mycorrhiza|Arbuscular mycorrhizae]]</u>, the most common form of mycorrhizae which are widespread \"essential components of soil biota in natural and agricultural ecosystems\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00747/full|title=Belowground Inoculation With Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Increases Local and Systemic Susceptibility of Rice Plants to Different Pest Organisms|last=Bernaola|first=Lina|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, are used as a benchmark for the impacts of climate change on mycorrhizae in the following sections. \n\n=== Increasing temperatures and excess CO<sub>2</sub> ===\nThe temperature of the globe is steadily rising due to human activity, where the majority of the blame can be placed on anthropogenic production of pollutant gases. The most common gas that is produced by both artificial and natural means is CO<sub>2</sub>, and its heavy collective concentration in the atmosphere traps a large amount of heat underneath the atmosphere.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal| vauthors = Monz CA, Hunt HW, Reeves FB, Elliott ET |date=1994-03-01|title=The response of mycorrhizal colonization to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and climate change in Pascopyrum smithii and Bouteloua gracilis |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=165|issue=1|pages=75\u201380|doi=10.1007/BF00009964 }}</ref> The heat affects fungi differently depending on what genus, species or strain they are; while some fungi suffer at certain temperatures, others thrive in them.<ref name=\":4\" /> This depends on which environments the fungi are most often found in. However, temperature also plays a vital role in availability of water and nutrients as the hotter climates will have an easier time absorbing nutrients but are also threatened by [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of proteins.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the soil is dried by excessive heat, the hyphae of the mycorrhizae as well as the plant root hairs will have far more difficulty obtaining both water and the nutrients to sustain their interactions.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhile temperature may play a key role in fungal and plant growth, there is equally as much dependence on the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is absorbed. The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> within the soil is different from the amount that is in the air; the presence of this CO<sub>2</sub> is a vital part of many plant cycles (such as photosynthesis) and due to the properties of plant-fungus symbiosis taking place in roots, mycorrhizae are affected as well. When plants are exposed to higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub>, they tend to take advantage of it and grow faster.<ref name=\":4\" /> This also increases the allocation of carbon to the plant's roots rather than the plant's shoots, which is beneficial to the symbiotic mycorrhizae.<ref name=\":4\" /> There is an increase in the amount of space that the roots can occupy and thus the cycle of trade between the plant and the fungi increases, showing potential for further growth and taking advantage of the available resources until the feedback becomes neutral.<ref name=\":4\" /> The allocated CO<sub>2</sub> that is provided to the mycorrhizae also allows them to grow at an increased rate at higher levels, meaning the hyphae of the fungi will also expand, however the direct benefits seem to cease there in accordance to the mycorrhizae, alone.<ref name=\":4\" /> \"Despite significant effects on root carbohydrate levels, there were generally no significant effects on mycorrhizal colonization.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> This means that while the plant may grow larger, the mycorrhizae will grow proportionally larger with the growth of the plant. In other words, the mycorrhizae's growth is caused by the growth of the plant; the opposite cannot be proven true even though these environmental factors affect both the mycorrhizae and the plant. CO<sub>2</sub> should not be thought of as entirely beneficial: its main contribution is to photosynthetic processes but the plant relies on it while the essential sugars that the mycorrhizae require can only be provided by the plant; they cannot be extracted directly from the soils.<ref name=\":4\" /> The effects CO<sub>2</sub> has on the environment are detrimental in the long run as it is a vital contributor to the problem of [[greenhouse gases]] and loss of territory in which plants and their respective mycorrhizae grow.\n\n== Mycorrhizae in Arctic Regions ==\nWhile it may seem like a barren landscape, the Arctic is actually home to huge populations of animals, plants, and fungi. The plants in these regions depend on their relationship with mycorrhizae, and without it, would not fare as well as they do in such harsh conditions. In Arctic regions, nitrogen and water are harder for plants to obtain as the ground is frozen, which makes mycorrhizae crucial to their fitness, health, and growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19190704|title=Mycorrhizal fungi supply nitrogen to host plants in Arctic tundra and boreal forests: 15N is the key signal.|last=Hobbie|first=JE|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nClimate change has been recognized to affect Arctic regions more drastically than non-Arctic regions, a process known as [[Arctic amplification|Arctic Amplification]].

Fungi tend to grow where there are already plants and probably animals because many of them are symbiotic in nature and the rely on very specific environments in order to grow. Plants on the other hand must rely on separate elements in order to spread, like the wind or other animals, and when seeds are planted the environments must still be sufficient enough to help them grow.<ref name=\":5\" /> Arbuscular mycorrhizae are the best example of this as it is found nearly anywhere where plants are growing in the wild. However, with changing climate comes change in environments. As climates warm or cool, plants tend to \"move\", that is \u2013 they exhibit biogeographic movement.<ref name=\":5\" /> Some habitats no longer remain viable to certain plants but then other previously hostile environments may become more hospitable to the same species.<ref name=\":5\" /> Once again, if a plant occupies an environment where mycorrhizae can grow and form a symbiosis with the plant, it will likely occur with seldom exceptions.\n\nNot all fungi can grow in the same places though, distinct types of fungi are necessary to consider. Even though some fungi can have a massive area of dispersal, they still succumb to the same barriers that most species do. Some elevations are too high or too low and limit the capacity to disperse spores, favoring similar elevation as opposed to an increase inclining or declining elevation.<ref name=\":5\" /> Some biomes are too wet or too dry for a plant to not only move to but grow and survive in, or the fungi that occupy one climate do not function as efficiently (if at all) in another climate, limiting the dispersal even more.<ref name=\":5\" /> There are other factors that will mediate the dispersal of fungi, creating boundaries that can cause speciation between fungal communities, such as distance, bodies of water, strength or direction of wind, even animal interactions There are \"structural differences, such as mushroom height, spore shape and size of the Buller\u2019s drop, that determine dispersal distances.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> Morphological reproductive traits such as these play a big role in dispersal, and if there is a barrier that isolates or eliminates these, such as a river or a lack of soil which can support mycorrhizal interactions due to something like falling pH levels from acid rain, essential tactics for germination become obsolete as the offspring do not survive and thus, the population cannot grow or move. [[Vertical transmission]] of mycorrhizae does not exist, so to move past these barriers requires alternative means of [[horizontal transmission]].<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison J, Moora M, \u00d6pik M, Adholeya A, Ainsaar L, B\u00e2 A, Burla S, Diedhiou AG, Hiiesalu I, Jairus T, Johnson NC, Kane A, Koorem K, Kochar M, Ndiaye C, P\u00e4rtel M, Reier \u00dc, Saks \u00dc, Singh R, Vasar M, Zobel M | title = FUNGAL SYMBIONTS.
