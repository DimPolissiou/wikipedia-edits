Although modest, they helped the national economy, despite the difficulties of 1941, quickly keep pace and the scale needed for a successful war.\n\nSince the late 1930s, vaults and warehouses have been built around the country. The largest warehouse, with natural cold, was the quarry in Sokolia Gori, in the suburbs of Samara. The warehouses were reinforced, pipes were placed in underground halls through which a cooling system was passed. Refrigeration warehouses are located in mines 300\u2013400 meters above the ground. The total product storage capacity at the same time was 16,400 tons. In the 1990s, with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and transformation to [[market economy]], the facility [[Privatization in Russia|was privatized]] and lost its importance. Currently, there is only one refrigeration warehouse (18&nbsp;\u00b0C) and some cells with natural cold (-3&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rosreserv.ru/Virtualnij_muzej/Istoricheskaja_spravka |title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 |publisher=rosreserv.ru |accessdate=2019-11-17}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1941 and 1945, about 20 million tons of bread, about 3 million tons of food, about 2 million tons of metals, coal - 16 million tons, petroleum products - 9 million tons, wood - 6 million cubic cubes were released from the state reserve The army and the economy. A significant portion of the products and materials supplied by the Allied Powers also moved through the bases of state reserves, from where they were distributed to the military or the defense industry.\n\nThe state reserve system was entrusted with the most important task of ensuring the elimination of the food voucher distribution system. By the end of 1947, mobile divisions were set up among office workers, traveling to the districts to ensure simultaneous release of accumulated goods across the country. On January 1, 1948, the government abolished the voucher system, only from that day onwards the reserve system and the government reserve went from war to peaceful work in peace.\n\nThe beginning of the Cold War gave rise to the creation of unprecedented volumes, but these reserves were not only used for military purposes. State reserves were used to eliminate the earthquake effects in Tashkent (1967) and Spitak (1988). In 1986, thousands of tons of lead for the construction of a sarcophagus over the Chernobyl nuclear power plant were moved from special storage facilities in the country quickly. In 1990, work began on the state reserve system for the establishment of a special fund of goods and materials intended to take precautionary measures in response to emergency and humanitarian assistance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rosreserv.ru/Virtualnij_muzej/Istoricheskaja_spravka |title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 |publisher=rosreserv.ru |accessdate=2019-11-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the United States' system of the USSR state reserve was split. Substantial objects and assets in the territory of the former Soviet republics have been transferred to the jurisdiction of the new governments. By order of the Russian President of November 25, 1991, the State Reserve Committee under the Russian Government was established. The committee, renamed the \"Russian Federation of State Reserves\" in 1992, was entrusted with the management of the collection operations and the management of state inventory and food stores in Russia.\n\nIn the 1990s, the state reserve system made a significant contribution to maintaining socio-political stability: up to 50 percent of the monthly consumption of products in certain subsidized areas was provided by the State Reserve Commission.\n\nOn November 23, 1994, the federal law \"On the State Material Reserve\" was adopted, which laid down general principles for its establishment and use of the state material reserve. The law introduced a new direction for the use of state reserves (in addition to providing emergency response and providing support in the event of disruptions in food supplies and raw materials) - which gave the committee regulatory influence on the market.\n\nOn May 25, 1999, under a [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] signed by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]], the State Committee for State Reserves became the Russian State Reserves Agency. In March 2004, as part of the federal reform initiated by President [[Vladimir Putin]], the agency was renamed the Federal State Reserve Agency (Rosrezerv) and transferred to the [[Ministry of Economic Development (Russia)|Ministry of Development and Trade]].\n\nOn December 28, 2010, amendments to the federal law \"On State Material Reserves\" were adopted and expanded the agency's

Although modest, they helped the national economy, despite the difficulties of 1941, quickly keep pace and the scale needed for a successful war.\n\nSince the late 1930s, vaults and warehouses have been built around the country. The largest warehouse, with natural cold, was the quarry in Sokolia Gori, in the suburbs of Samara. The warehouses were reinforced, pipes were placed in underground halls through which a cooling system was passed. Refrigeration warehouses are located in mines 300\u2013400 meters above the ground. The total product storage capacity at the same time was 16,400 tons. In the 1990s, with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and transformation to [[market economy]], the facility [[Privatization in Russia|was privatized]] and lost its importance. Currently, there is only one refrigeration warehouse (18&nbsp;\u00b0C) and some cells with natural cold (-3&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rosreserv.ru/Virtualnij_muzej/Istoricheskaja_spravka |title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 |publisher=rosreserv.ru |accessdate=2019-11-17}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1941 and 1945, about 20 million tons of bread, about 3 million tons of food, about 2 million tons of metals, coal - 16 million tons, petroleum products - 9 million tons, wood - 6 million cubic cubes were released from the state reserve The army and the economy. A significant portion of the products and materials supplied by the Allied Powers also moved through the bases of state reserves, from where they were distributed to the military or the defense industry.\n\nThe state reserve system was entrusted with the most important task of ensuring the elimination of the food voucher distribution system. By the end of 1947, mobile divisions were set up among office workers, traveling to the districts to ensure simultaneous release of accumulated goods across the country. On January 1, 1948, the government abolished the voucher system, only from that day onwards the reserve system and the government reserve went from war to peaceful work in peace.\n\nThe beginning of the Cold War gave rise to the creation of unprecedented volumes, but these reserves were not only used for military purposes. State reserves were used to eliminate the earthquake effects in Tashkent (1967) and Spitak (1988). In 1986, thousands of tons of lead for the construction of a sarcophagus over the Chernobyl nuclear power plant were moved from special storage facilities in the country quickly. In 1990, work began on the state reserve system for the establishment of a special fund of goods and materials intended to take precautionary measures in response to emergency and humanitarian assistance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rosreserv.ru/Virtualnij_muzej/Istoricheskaja_spravka |title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 |publisher=rosreserv.ru |accessdate=2019-11-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the United States' system of the USSR state reserve was split. Substantial objects and assets in the territory of the former Soviet republics have been transferred to the jurisdiction of the new governments. By order of the Russian President of November 25, 1991, the State Reserve Committee under the Russian Government was established. The committee, renamed the \"Russian Federation of State Reserves\" in 1992, was entrusted with the management of the collection operations and the management of state inventory and food stores in Russia.\n\nIn the 1990s, the state reserve system made a significant contribution to maintaining socio-political stability: up to 50 percent of the monthly consumption of products in certain subsidized areas was provided by the State Reserve Commission.\n\nOn November 23, 1994, the federal law \"On the State Material Reserve\" was adopted, which laid down general principles for its establishment and use of the state material reserve. The law introduced a new direction for the use of state reserves (in addition to providing emergency response and providing support in the event of disruptions in food supplies and raw materials) - which gave the committee regulatory influence on the market.\n\nOn May 25, 1999, under a [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] signed by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]], the State Committee for State Reserves became the Russian State Reserves Agency. In March 2004, as part of the federal reform initiated by President [[Vladimir Putin]], the agency was renamed the Federal State Reserve Agency (Rosrezerv) and transferred to the [[Ministry of Economic Development (Russia)|Ministry of Development and Trade]].\n\nOn December 28, 2010, amendments to the federal law \"On State Material Reserves\" were adopted and expanded the agency's powers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_5435/ |title=\u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \"\u041e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\" \u043e\u0442 29.12.1994 N 79-\u0424\u0417 (\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f)|publisher=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441|accessdate=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Government of the Russian Federation}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Government agencies of Russia]]\n[[Category:Consumer organizations in Russia]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 2004]]\n[[Category:2004 establishments in Russia]]\n[[Category:Regulation in Russia]]\n[[Category:Emergency management in Russia]]\n[[Category:Food security]]\n[[Category:Military economics]]\n[[Category:Emergency services in Russia]]\n", "name_user": "Rakoon", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Agency_for_State_Reserves_(Russia)"}

Small cars can be taken except in monsoons.<ref name=kedar/>\n\n==Legend==\nThe epic legend narrated on the creation of the Panch Kedar temples is that Pandavas of [[Mahabharata]] epic history,  while chasing Lord Shiva to seek his pardon for the [[fratricidal]] sins committed by them during the [[Kurukshetra war]], realized that Shiva, in order to distance himself from the Pandavas, took the incognito form of a bull. But when this form of Shiva was discerned by [[Bhima]], the second of the Pandava brothers, tried to hold on to the bull's tail and hind legs. But the bull vanished underground at Guptakashi. Subsequently, it reappeared in five different forms: His hump appeared at Kedarnath, his bahu (arm) was spotted at Tungnath, his head surfaced at Rudranath, the stomach and navel were traced at Madhyamaheswar and his jata (tress) was divined at Kalpeshwar.<ref name=travel>{{Cite web|url=http://traveluttarakhand.com/panchkedar.html#madhyamaheshwar#madhyamaheshwar|title=Panch Kedar Yatra|accessdate=2009-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524085601/http://traveluttarakhand.com/panchkedar.html#madhyamaheshwar|archive-date=24 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> \nAnother legend states that this place was much preferred by sages of [[folklore]] for meditation. Particular mention is made of sage Arghya who through his austere penance created [[Urvashi]], the famous [[apsara]] ([[nymph]]) at this place.  [[Durvasa]],  an ancient sage, son of [[Atri]] and [[Anasuya]], considered an incarnation of Shiva, known for his short temper did penance and meditated under the [[Kalpavriksha]], the wish fulfilling divine tree in the precincts of the temple.<ref name=char/> Further, it is said that Durvasa had given [[Kunti]], mother of Pandavas, a boon that \"she could invoke any of the forces of nature and they would appear before her and grant whatever she desired\". Once, when Pandavas, were in exile here, in order to test them Durvasa visited them along with his disciples and desired to be dined by them. Unfortunately, there was no food available within the house to feed the surprise guests. [[Draupadi]], wife of Pandavas, sought Lord [[Krishna]]'s help.

The temple's ancient legend linked to the [[Pandavas]], heroes of epic [[Mahabharata]] eminence is the fifth temple of the [[Panch Kedar]]s (five temples) of Shiva's five anatomical divine forms; the other four temples in the order of their worship are [[Kedarnath]], [[Rudranath]], [[Tungnath]] and [[Madhyamaheshwar]] temples; all in the Kedar Khand region of the [[Garhwal Himalaya|Garhwal]] [[Himalayas]].<ref name=kedar>{{Cite web|url=http://www.badrinath-kedarnath.gov.in/content-kedar.aspx?id=37|title=Kalpeshwar|accessdate=2009-07-17|publisher=Shri Badrinath -Shri Kedarnath Temple Committee}}</ref><ref name=uttar>{{cite book|author= J.

At this small stone temple, approached through a cave passage, the matted tress (''jata'') of Lord Shiva is worshipped. Hence, Lord Shiva is also called as Jatadhar or Jateshwar. Earlier it was approachable only by {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} trek from the nearest road head of Helang on the [[Rishikesh]]-[[Badrinath]] road but now the road goes up to Devgram village from where the trek now is just 300 metres. This road is good for bikes or cars with good ground clearance as it is half kuccha road which may get damaged during monsoons. Small cars can be taken except in monsoons.<ref name=kedar/>\n\n==Legend==\nThe epic legend narrated on the creation of the Panch Kedar temples is that Pandavas of [[Mahabharata]] epic history,  while chasing Lord Shiva to seek his pardon for the [[fratricidal]] sins committed by them during the [[Kurukshetra war]], realized that Shiva, in order to distance himself from the Pandavas, took the incognito form of a bull. But when this form of Shiva was discerned by [[Bhima]], the second of the Pandava brothers, tried to hold on to the bull's tail and hind legs. But the bull vanished underground at Guptakashi. Subsequently, it reappeared in five different forms: His hump appeared at Kedarnath, his bahu (arm) was spotted at Tungnath, his head surfaced at Rudranath, the stomach and navel were traced at Madhyamaheswar and his jata (tress) was divined at Kalpeshwar.<ref name=travel>{{Cite web|url=http://traveluttarakhand.com/panchkedar.html#madhyamaheshwar#madhyamaheshwar|title=Panch Kedar Yatra|accessdate=2009-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524085601/http://traveluttarakhand.com/panchkedar.html#madhyamaheshwar|archive-date=24 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> \nAnother legend states that this place was much preferred by sages of [[folklore]] for meditation. Particular mention is made of sage Arghya who through his austere penance created [[Urvashi]], the famous [[apsara]] ([[nymph]]) at this place.  [[Durvasa]],  an ancient sage, son of [[Atri]] and [[Anasuya]], considered an incarnation of Shiva, known for his short temper did penance and meditated under the [[Kalpavriksha]], the wish fulfilling divine tree in the precincts of the temple.<ref name=char/> Further, it is said that Durvasa had given [[Kunti]], mother of Pandavas, a boon that \"she could invoke any of the forces of nature and they would appear before her and grant whatever she desired\". Once, when Pandavas, were in exile here, in order to test them Durvasa visited them along with his disciples and desired to be dined by them. Unfortunately, there was no food available within the house to feed the surprise guests. [[Draupadi]], wife of Pandavas, sought Lord [[Krishna]]'s help. Krishna materialised on the scene and solved the problem.<ref name=jyoti>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jyotirlinga.com/panchakedar.htm|title=Panch Kedar|accessdate=2009-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831110615/http://www.jyotirlinga.com/panchakedar.htm|archive-date=31 August 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n;Worship\nThe temple priests at this temple also are the Dasnamis and Gossains, disciples of [[Adi Shankara]].

Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jennifer Ehle]], and [[Sanaa Lathan]]. The plot concerns the spread of a virus [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[fomite]]s, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a [[pandemic]],<ref name=Rogers20200402>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html|title='Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic |date=April 2, 2020 |last=Rogers |first=Kristen |website=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> and the introduction of a [[vaccine]] to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the [[Hyperlink cinema|multi-narrative \"hyperlink cinema\" style]], popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.\n\nFollowing their collaboration on ''[[The Informant!]]'' (2009), Soderbergh and screenwriter [[Scott Z. Burns]] discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, inspired by pandemics such as the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]]. Burns consulted with representatives of the [[World Health Organization]] as well as medical experts such as [[W. Ian Lipkin]] and [[Larry Brilliant|Lawrence \"Larry\" Brilliant]]. Principal photography started in [[Hong Kong]] in September 2010, and continued in [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[San Francisco]] until February 2011.\n\n''Contagion'' premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. It was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy. The film has received renewed popularity during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5811774/contagion-stars-psa-coronavirus/|title=Stars of 'Contagion' Reunite to Offer Coronavirus Advice |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 27, 2020 |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a business trip in Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago and meets a former lover for sex. Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his blog. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is eventually arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]].\n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree while clearing rainforest in China, disturbing the natural habitat of some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who transmits the virus to Beth in a handshake.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen.

Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jennifer Ehle]], and [[Sanaa Lathan]]. The plot concerns the spread of a virus [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[fomite]]s, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a [[pandemic]],<ref name=Rogers20200402>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html|title='Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic |date=April 2, 2020 |last=Rogers |first=Kristen |website=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> and the introduction of a [[vaccine]] to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the [[Hyperlink cinema|multi-narrative \"hyperlink cinema\" style]], popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.\n\nFollowing their collaboration on ''[[The Informant!]]'' (2009), Soderbergh and screenwriter [[Scott Z. Burns]] discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, inspired by pandemics such as the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]]. Burns consulted with representatives of the [[World Health Organization]] as well as medical experts such as [[W. Ian Lipkin]] and [[Larry Brilliant|Lawrence \"Larry\" Brilliant]]. Principal photography started in [[Hong Kong]] in September 2010, and continued in [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[San Francisco]] until February 2011.\n\n''Contagion'' premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. It was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy. The film has received renewed popularity during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5811774/contagion-stars-psa-coronavirus/|title=Stars of 'Contagion' Reunite to Offer Coronavirus Advice |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 27, 2020 |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a business trip in Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago and meets a former lover for sex. Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his blog. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]].\n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree while clearing rainforest in China, disturbing the natural habitat of some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who transmits the virus to Beth in a handshake.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen.
