The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the nine P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the nine P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

He was the most celebrated violin [[virtuoso]] of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1]] are among the best known of his compositions, and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers.\n[[File:Paganinis all six violin concertos Nikolay Madoyan Conductor Karen Durgaryan camera recording from hall Armenian National Academic Theater Symphonic Orchestra - Paganini's Cantabile.webm|thumb|Paganini: all six violin concertos]]\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Niccol\u00f2 Paganini ritratto giovanile.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of young Paganini]]\n\n===Childhood===\nNiccol\u00f2 Paganini was born in [[Genoa]], then capital of the [[Republic of Genoa]], the third of the six children of Antonio and Teresa (n\u00e9e Bocciardo) Paganini. Paganini's father was an unsuccessful trader, but he managed to supplement his income through playing music on the [[mandolin]]. At the age of five, Paganini started learning the mandolin from his father, and moved to the violin by the age of seven. His musical talents were quickly recognized, earning him numerous scholarships for violin lessons. The young Paganini studied under various local violinists, including Giovanni Servetto and Giacomo Costa, but his progress quickly outpaced their abilities. Paganini and his father then traveled to [[Parma]] to seek further guidance from [[Alessandro Rolla]]. But upon listening to Paganini's playing, Rolla immediately referred him to his own teacher, [[Ferdinando Paer]] and, later, Paer's own teacher, [[Gasparo Ghiretti]]. Though Paganini did not stay long with Paer or Ghiretti, the two had considerable influence on his composition style.\n\n===Early career===\nThe French invaded northern Italy in March 1796, and Genoa was not spared. The Paganinis sought refuge in their country property in Romairone, near [[Bolzaneto]]. It was in this period that Paganini is thought to have developed his relationship with the guitar.<ref>J.J. Sugden: ''Paganini, his Life and Work'', p. 17. UK 1980</ref> He mastered the guitar, but preferred to play it in exclusively intimate, rather than public concerts.<ref>P.J. Bone: ''The Guitar and Mandolin''. Schotts, UK 1954</ref> He later described the guitar as his \"constant companion\" on his concert tours. By 1800, Paganini and his father traveled to [[Livorno]], where Paganini played in concerts and his father resumed his maritime work. In 1801, the 18-year-old Paganini was appointed first violin of the [[Republic of Lucca]], but a substantial portion of his income came from freelancing. His fame as a violinist was matched only by his reputation as a gambler and womanizer.\n\nIn 1805, Lucca was annexed by [[Napoleon]]ic France, and the region was ceded to Napoleon's sister, [[Elisa Bonaparte|Elisa Baciocchi]]. Paganini became a violinist for the Baciocchi court, while giving private lessons to Elisa's husband, [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice]]. In 1807, Baciocchi became the [[Grand Duchess of Tuscany]] and her court was transferred to [[Florence]]. Paganini was part of the entourage, but, towards the end of 1809, he left Baciocchi to resume his freelance career.\n\n===Travelling virtuoso===\n[[File:Nicolo Paganini by Richard James Lane.jpg|thumb|upright|1831 bulletin advertising a performance of Paganini]]\nFor the next few years, Paganini returned to touring in the areas surrounding Parma and Genoa. Though he was very popular with the local audience, he was still not very well known in the rest of Europe. His first break came from an 1813 concert at [[La Scala]] in Milan. The concert was a great success. As a result, Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. His early encounters with [[Charles Philippe Lafont]] and [[Louis Spohr]] created intense rivalry. His concert activities, however, were still limited to Italy for the next few years.\n\nIn 1827, [[Pope Leo XII]] honoured Paganini with the [[Order of the Golden Spur]].<ref name=\"pd1900\">David, Paul. \"Paganini, Nicolo\", Grove (ed.) ''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (1900), Vol. II, pp. 628\u2013632.</ref><ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (1911), Vol. XX, p. 459, \"Paganini, Nicolo\".</ref> His fame spread across Europe with a concert tour that started in Vienna in August 1828, stopping in every major European city in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia until February 1831 in Strasbourg. This was followed by tours in Paris and Britain. His technical ability and his willingness to display it received much critical acclaim. In addition to his own compositions, theme and variations being the most popular, Paganini also performed modified versions of works (primarily concertos) written by his early contemporaries, such as [[Rodolphe Kreutzer]] and [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]].\n\nPaganini's travels also brought him into contact with eminent guitar virtuosi of the day, including [[Ferdinando Carulli]] in Paris and [[Mauro Giuliani]] in Vienna.<ref>Thomas F. Heck: ''Mauro Giuliani, a life for the Guitar'' (doctoral dissertation). GFA Reference, US 2013</ref> But this experience did not inspire him to play public concerts with guitar, and even performances of his own guitar trios and quartets were private to the point of being behind closed doors.\n\n===Late career and health decline===\nThroughout his life, Paganini was no stranger to chronic illnesses. Although no definite medical proof exists, he was reputed to have been affected by [[Marfan syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal|first=Myron R.|last=Schoenfeld|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/239/1/40|title=Nicolo Paganini \u2013 Musical Magician and Marfan Mutant?|date=January 2, 1978|volume=239|number=1|pages=40\u201342|journal=[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]|pmid=336919|accessdate=12 November 2011|doi=10.1001/jama.239.1.40}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.violinist.com/discussion/response.cfm?ID=13135 |title=Paganini's left hand |publisher=Violinist.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> or [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11694491 | volume=175 | issue=5 | title=Creativity and chronic disease.

He was diagnosed with [[syphilis]] as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[opium]], came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for [[tuberculosis]]. Though his recovery was reasonably quick, after the illness his career was marred by frequent cancellations due to various health problems, from the common cold to depression, which lasted from days to months.\n\nIn September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist [[Camillo Sivori]] and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. Neither, however, considered Paganini helpful or inspirational. In 1835, Paganini returned to Parma, this time under the employ of [[Archduchess]] [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] of Austria, Napoleon's second wife. He was in charge of reorganizing her court orchestra. However, he eventually conflicted with the players and court, so his visions never saw completion. In Paris, he befriended the 11-year-old Polish virtuoso [[Apollinaire de Kontski]], giving him some lessons and a signed testimonial. It was widely put about, falsely, that Paganini was so impressed with de Kontski's skills that he bequeathed him his violins and manuscripts.\n\n===Final years, death, and burial===\n[[File:Paganinitomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Paganini in [[Parma]], Italy]]\nIn 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseilles and, after a brief stay, travelled to Nice where his condition worsened. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the [[last rites]]. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused.<ref name=\"pd1900\" />\n\nA week later, on 27 May 1840, Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist [[Franti\u0161ek Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek]] persuaded Paganini's grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist's body. After this episode, Paganini's body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.\n\n===Personal and professional relationships===\nThough having no shortage of romantic conquests, Paganini was seriously involved with a singer named Antonia Bianchi from Como, whom he met in Milan in 1813. The two gave concerts together throughout Italy. They had a son, Achille Ciro Alessandro, born on 23 July 1825 in Palermo and baptized at San Bartolomeo's. They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achille on his European tours, and Achille later accompanied his father until the latter's death. He was instrumental in dealing with his father's burial, years after his death.\n\nThroughout his career, Paganini also became close friends with composers [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Hector Berlioz]]. Rossini and Paganini met in Bologna in the summer of 1818. In January 1821, on his return from Naples, Paganini met Rossini again in Rome, just in time to become the substitute conductor for Rossini's opera ''[[Matilde di Shabran]]'', upon the sudden death of the original conductor. Paganini's efforts earned gratitude from Rossini.\n\nPaganini met Berlioz in Paris, and was a frequent correspondent as a penfriend. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was not satisfied with the resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato ''[[Harold en Italie]]''. He never performed it, and instead it was premiered a year later by violist [[Chr\u00e9tien Urhan|Christian Urhan]]. He did however write his own ''Sonata per Gran Viola'' Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in ''Harold'', Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its [[sound box]].\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Strad-hubay-view.jpg|thumb|Views of the ''Hubay'' 1726 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]]]]\nPaganini was in possession of a number of fine stringed instruments. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in [[Livorno]], a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier [[Giuseppe Guarneri]], for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he refused to take it back. This particular violin came to be known as ''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]''.<ref name=\"Menuhin\">Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W. Davis. ''The Music of Man''. Methuen, 1979.</ref> On a later occasion in Parma, he won another valuable violin (also by Guarneri) after a difficult sight-reading challenge from a man named Pasini.\n\n[[File:Bartolomeo giuseppe guarneri, violino cannone, appartenuto a niccol\u00f2 paganini, cremona 1743.JPG|left|thumb|upright|''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]'' on exhibit at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Palazzo Doria-Tursi|it}} in Genoa, Italy]]\nOther instruments associated with Paganini include the ''Antonio [[Amati]]'' 1600, the ''[[Nicol\u00f2 Amati]]'' 1657, the ''[[List of Stradivarius instruments|Paganini-Desaint]]'' 1680 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]], the [[Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri|Guarneri-filius]] ''Andrea'' 1706, the ''[[Le Brun Stradivarius|Le Brun]]'' 1712 Stradivari, the ''[[Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume|Vuillaume]]'' c.&nbsp;1720 [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], the ''Hubay'' 1726 Stradivari, and the ''Comte&nbsp;Cozio di Salabue'' 1727 violins; the ''Countess of Flanders'' 1582 [[Gasparo da Sal\u00f2|da&nbsp;Sal\u00f2-di&nbsp;Bertolotti]], and the ''Mendelssohn'' 1731 Stradivari violas; the ''Piatti'' 1700 [[Matteo Goffriller|Goffriller]], the ''Stanlein'' 1707 Stradivari, and the ''Ladenburg'' 1736 Stradivari cellos; and the ''Grobert of Mirecourt'' 1820 (guitar).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/ClientBookLineCIMU/recherche/NoticeDetailleByID.asp?ID=0161650 |title=Mediatheque.cite |publisher=Mediatheque.cite-musique.fr |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com/archive/2008/01/23/histoire-d-une-guitare-romantique.html |title=Hautetfort.com |publisher=Boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> Four of these instruments were played by the [[Tokyo String Quartet]].\n\nOf his guitars, there is little evidence remaining of his various choices of instrument. The aforementioned guitar that he gave to Berlioz is a French instrument made by one Grobert of [[Mirecourt]]. The luthier made his instrument in the style of [[Ren\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Lac\u00f4te|Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te]], a more well-known Paris-based guitar-maker. It is preserved and on display in the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Musique]] in Paris.\n\nOf the guitars he owned through his life, there was an instrument by Gennaro Fabricatore that he had refused to sell even in his periods of financial stress, and was among the instruments in his possession at the time of his death. There is an unsubstantiated rumour that he also played [[Johann Georg Stauffer|Stauffer]] guitars; he may certainly have come across these in his meetings with Giuliani in Vienna.\n\n==Compositions==\n{{listen|type=music|\n|filename=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogv\n|title=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description=[[Joshua Bell]] and [[Sharon Isbin]] perform Paganini's ''Cantabile'' at the [[White House]] Evening of Classical Music on 4 November 2009.\n|filename2=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogg\n|title2=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description2=Bell and Isbin \u2013 audio only version\n|filename3=CELLO ENCORES JOHN MICHEL-Paganini Variations on One String.ogg\n|title3=Variations on One String (Moses Fantasy)\n|description3=Performed by John Michell (cello) with a pianist}}\n{{Main|List of compositions by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini}}\nPaganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which profoundly influenced the evolution of violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] were likely composed in the period between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the publication, in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including ''Le Streghe'', ''The Carnival of Venice'', and ''Nel cor pi\u00f9 non mi sento'', were composed, or at least first performed, before his European concert tour.\n\nGenerally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the [[timbre]] of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled ''Il Fandango Spanolo'' (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece ''Duetto Amoroso'', in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the ''Duetto'', which has been recorded. The existence of the ''Fandango'' is known only through concert posters.\n\nHowever, his works were criticized for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism, as pointed out by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]].<ref>Lev Solomonovich Ginzburg. ''Ysaye''. Paganiniana, 1980.</ref> [[Yehudi Menuhin]], on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of his reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition.<ref name=\"Menuhin\" /> The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as [[Giovanni Paisiello]], Gioachino Rossini and [[Gaetano Donizetti]], who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.<ref>N. Till: Rossini, pp. 50\u201351. Omnibus Press, 1987</ref>\n\nPaganini was also the inspiration of many prominent composers. Both \"La Campanella\" and the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|A&nbsp;minor Caprice (No.&nbsp;24)]] have been an object of interest for a number of composers. [[Franz Liszt]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Boris Blacher]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[George Rochberg]] and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]], among others, wrote well-known variations on these themes.\n\n==Violin technique==\n[[File:David d'Angers - Paganini.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Bust of Niccol\u00f2 Paganini by [[David d'Angers]] (1830\u20131833)]]\nThe Israeli violinist [[Ivry Gitlis]] once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. [[Arcangelo Corelli]] (1653\u20131713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument. In the meantime, the polyphonic capability of the violin was firmly established through the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|Sonatas and Partitas]] BWV 1001\u20131006 of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750). Other notable violinists included [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (1678\u20131741) and [[Giuseppe Tartini]] (1692\u20131770), who, in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow. Techniques requiring agility of the fingers and the bow were still considered unorthodox and discouraged by the established community of violinists.\n\nMuch of Paganini's playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two violinists, [[Pietro Locatelli]] (1693\u20131746) and [[August Duranowski]] (Auguste Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Durand) (1770\u20131834). During Paganini's study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled ''L'arte di nuova modulazione \u2013 Capricci enigmatici'' or ''The art of the new style \u2013 the enigmatic caprices''). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]] (1755\u20131824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics, both natural and artificial (which had previously not been attempted in performance), and the left hand [[pizzicato]] in his performance.<ref>Richard Taruskin, ''An Oxford History of Western Music Volume 5: Music in the Nineteenth Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009</ref> Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques, which are now incorporated into regular compositions.\n\nAnother aspect of Paganini's violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally long fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today's standards. His seemingly unnatural ability may have been a result of [[Marfan syndrome]].<ref>From [http://tafkac.org/celebrities/paganini_stories_myths.html Paganini stories myths.] The AFU and Urban Legends Archive.

The series focuses on Paganini's relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, [[Armen Dzhigarkhanyan]], played Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious [[Jesuit]] official. The information in the series is generally spurious, and it also plays to some of the myths and legends rampant during the musician's lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity.<ref>\"Paganini, Niccol\u00f2.\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Music is a question for which there is no answer.\" Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is \"rescued\" by the Devil, who appears in different guises, returning Paganini's violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini's salvation\u2014administered by a god-like Clockmaker\u2014turns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. \"Do not pity him, my dear,\" the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini's murdered wives. \"He is alone with the answer for which there is no question. The saved and the damned are the same.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Angelo Boscassi, ''Il Violino di Niccol\u00f2 Paganini conservato nel Palazzo Municipale di Genova'', Fratelli Pagano, 1909\n* Leopold Auer, ''Violin playing as I teach it'', Stokes, 1921 (reprint Dover, 1980)\n* Alberto Bachmann, ''An Encyclopedia of the violin'', Da Capo, 1925\n* Jeffrey Pulver, ''Paganini: The Romantic Virtuoso'', Herbert Joseph, 1936 (reprint Da Capo, 1970)\n* Geraldine I.C. de Courcy, ''Paganini the Genoese'', University of Oklahoma, 1957 (reprint Da Capo, 1977)\n* [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[William Primrose]], ''Violin and viola'', MacDonald and Jane's, 1976\n* Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W.

His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1]] are among the best known of his compositions, and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers.\n[[File:Paganinis all six violin concertos Nikolay Madoyan Conductor Karen Durgaryan camera recording from hall Armenian National Academic Theater Symphonic Orchestra - Paganini's Cantabile.webm|thumb|Paganini: all six violin concertos]]\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Niccol\u00f2 Paganini ritratto giovanile.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of young Paganini]]\n\n===Childhood===\nNiccol\u00f2 Paganini was born in [[Genoa]], then capital of the [[Republic of Genoa]], the third of the six children of Antonio and Teresa (n\u00e9e Bocciardo) Paganini. Paganini's father was an unsuccessful trader, but he managed to supplement his income through playing music on the [[mandolin]]. At the age of five, Paganini started learning the mandolin from his father, and moved to the violin by the age of seven. His musical talents were quickly recognized, earning him numerous scholarships for violin lessons. The young Paganini studied under various local violinists, including Giovanni Servetto and Giacomo Costa, but his progress quickly outpaced their abilities. Paganini and his father then traveled to [[Parma]] to seek further guidance from [[Alessandro Rolla]]. But upon listening to Paganini's playing, Rolla immediately referred him to his own teacher, [[Ferdinando Paer]] and, later, Paer's own teacher, [[Gasparo Ghiretti]]. Though Paganini did not stay long with Paer or Ghiretti, the two had considerable influence on his composition style.\n\n===Early career===\nThe French invaded northern Italy in March 1796, and Genoa was not spared. The Paganinis sought refuge in their country property in Romairone, near [[Bolzaneto]]. It was in this period that Paganini is thought to have developed his relationship with the guitar.<ref>J.J. Sugden: ''Paganini, his Life and Work'', p. 17. UK 1980</ref> He mastered the guitar, but preferred to play it in exclusively intimate, rather than public concerts.<ref>P.J. Bone: ''The Guitar and Mandolin''. Schotts, UK 1954</ref> He later described the guitar as his \"constant companion\" on his concert tours. By 1800, Paganini and his father traveled to [[Livorno]], where Paganini played in concerts and his father resumed his maritime work. In 1801, the 18-year-old Paganini was appointed first violin of the [[Republic of Lucca]], but a substantial portion of his income came from freelancing. His fame as a violinist was matched only by his reputation as a gambler and womanizer.\n\nIn 1805, Lucca was annexed by [[Napoleon]]ic France, and the region was ceded to Napoleon's sister, [[Elisa Bonaparte|Elisa Baciocchi]]. Paganini became a violinist for the Baciocchi court, while giving private lessons to Elisa's husband, [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice]]. In 1807, Baciocchi became the [[Grand Duchess of Tuscany]] and her court was transferred to [[Florence]]. Paganini was part of the entourage, but, towards the end of 1809, he left Baciocchi to resume his freelance career.\n\n===Travelling virtuoso===\n[[File:Nicolo Paganini by Richard James Lane.jpg|thumb|upright|1831 bulletin advertising a performance of Paganini]]\nFor the next few years, Paganini returned to touring in the areas surrounding Parma and Genoa. Though he was very popular with the local audience, he was still not very well known in the rest of Europe. His first break came from an 1813 concert at [[La Scala]] in Milan. The concert was a great success. As a result, Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. His early encounters with [[Charles Philippe Lafont]] and [[Louis Spohr]] created intense rivalry. His concert activities, however, were still limited to Italy for the next few years.\n\nIn 1827, [[Pope Leo XII]] honoured Paganini with the [[Order of the Golden Spur]].<ref name=\"pd1900\">David, Paul. \"Paganini, Nicolo\", Grove (ed.) ''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (1900), Vol. II, pp. 628\u2013632.</ref><ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (1911), Vol. XX, p. 459, \"Paganini, Nicolo\".</ref> His fame spread across Europe with a concert tour that started in Vienna in August 1828, stopping in every major European city in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia until February 1831 in Strasbourg. This was followed by tours in Paris and Britain. His technical ability and his willingness to display it received much critical acclaim. In addition to his own compositions, theme and variations being the most popular, Paganini also performed modified versions of works (primarily concertos) written by his early contemporaries, such as [[Rodolphe Kreutzer]] and [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]].\n\nPaganini's travels also brought him into contact with eminent guitar virtuosi of the day, including [[Ferdinando Carulli]] in Paris and [[Mauro Giuliani]] in Vienna.<ref>Thomas F. Heck: ''Mauro Giuliani, a life for the Guitar'' (doctoral dissertation). GFA Reference, US 2013</ref> But this experience did not inspire him to play public concerts with guitar, and even performances of his own guitar trios and quartets were private to the point of being behind closed doors.\n\n===Late career and health decline===\nThroughout his life, Paganini was no stranger to chronic illnesses. Although no definite medical proof exists, he was reputed to have been affected by [[Marfan syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal|first=Myron R.|last=Schoenfeld|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/239/1/40|title=Nicolo Paganini \u2013 Musical Magician and Marfan Mutant?|date=January 2, 1978|volume=239|number=1|pages=40\u201342|journal=[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]|pmid=336919|accessdate=12 November 2011|doi=10.1001/jama.239.1.40}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.violinist.com/discussion/response.cfm?ID=13135 |title=Paganini's left hand |publisher=Violinist.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> or [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11694491 | volume=175 | issue=5 | title=Creativity and chronic disease.

He was diagnosed with [[syphilis]] as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[opium]], came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for [[tuberculosis]]. Though his recovery was reasonably quick, after the illness his career was marred by frequent cancellations due to various health problems, from the common cold to depression, which lasted from days to months.\n\nIn September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist [[Camillo Sivori]] and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. Neither, however, considered Paganini helpful or inspirational. In 1835, Paganini returned to Parma, this time under the employ of [[Archduchess]] [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] of Austria, Napoleon's second wife. He was in charge of reorganizing her court orchestra. However, he eventually conflicted with the players and court, so his visions never saw completion. In Paris, he befriended the 11-year-old Polish virtuoso [[Apollinaire de Kontski]], giving him some lessons and a signed testimonial. It was widely put about, falsely, that Paganini was so impressed with de Kontski's skills that he bequeathed him his violins and manuscripts.\n\n===Final years, death, and burial===\n[[File:Paganinitomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Paganini in [[Parma]], Italy]]\nIn 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseilles and, after a brief stay, travelled to Nice where his condition worsened. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the [[last rites]]. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused.<ref name=\"pd1900\" />\n\nA week later, on 27 May 1840, Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist [[Franti\u0161ek Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek]] persuaded Paganini's grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist's body. After this episode, Paganini's body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.\n\n===Personal and professional relationships===\nThough having no shortage of romantic conquests, Paganini was seriously involved with a singer named Antonia Bianchi from Como, whom he met in Milan in 1813. The two gave concerts together throughout Italy. They had a son, Achille Ciro Alessandro, born on 23 July 1825 in Palermo and baptized at San Bartolomeo's. They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achille on his European tours, and Achille later accompanied his father until the latter's death. He was instrumental in dealing with his father's burial, years after his death.\n\nThroughout his career, Paganini also became close friends with composers [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Hector Berlioz]]. Rossini and Paganini met in Bologna in the summer of 1818. In January 1821, on his return from Naples, Paganini met Rossini again in Rome, just in time to become the substitute conductor for Rossini's opera ''[[Matilde di Shabran]]'', upon the sudden death of the original conductor. Paganini's efforts earned gratitude from Rossini.\n\nPaganini met Berlioz in Paris, and was a frequent correspondent as a penfriend. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was not satisfied with the resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato ''[[Harold en Italie]]''. He never performed it, and instead it was premiered a year later by violist [[Chr\u00e9tien Urhan|Christian Urhan]]. He did however write his own ''Sonata per Gran Viola'' Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in ''Harold'', Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its [[sound box]].\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Strad-hubay-view.jpg|thumb|Views of the ''Hubay'' 1726 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]]]]\nPaganini was in possession of a number of fine stringed instruments. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in [[Livorno]], a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier [[Giuseppe Guarneri]], for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he refused to take it back. This particular violin came to be known as ''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]''.<ref name=\"Menuhin\">Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W. Davis. ''The Music of Man''. Methuen, 1979.</ref> On a later occasion in Parma, he won another valuable violin (also by Guarneri) after a difficult sight-reading challenge from a man named Pasini.\n\n[[File:Bartolomeo giuseppe guarneri, violino cannone, appartenuto a niccol\u00f2 paganini, cremona 1743.JPG|left|thumb|upright|''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]'' on exhibit at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Palazzo Doria-Tursi|it}} in Genoa, Italy]]\nOther instruments associated with Paganini include the ''Antonio [[Amati]]'' 1600, the ''[[Nicol\u00f2 Amati]]'' 1657, the ''[[List of Stradivarius instruments|Paganini-Desaint]]'' 1680 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]], the [[Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri|Guarneri-filius]] ''Andrea'' 1706, the ''[[Le Brun Stradivarius|Le Brun]]'' 1712 Stradivari, the ''[[Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume|Vuillaume]]'' c.&nbsp;1720 [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], the ''Hubay'' 1726 Stradivari, and the ''Comte&nbsp;Cozio di Salabue'' 1727 violins; the ''Countess of Flanders'' 1582 [[Gasparo da Sal\u00f2|da&nbsp;Sal\u00f2-di&nbsp;Bertolotti]], and the ''Mendelssohn'' 1731 Stradivari violas; the ''Piatti'' 1700 [[Matteo Goffriller|Goffriller]], the ''Stanlein'' 1707 Stradivari, and the ''Ladenburg'' 1736 Stradivari cellos; and the ''Grobert of Mirecourt'' 1820 (guitar).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/ClientBookLineCIMU/recherche/NoticeDetailleByID.asp?ID=0161650 |title=Mediatheque.cite |publisher=Mediatheque.cite-musique.fr |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com/archive/2008/01/23/histoire-d-une-guitare-romantique.html |title=Hautetfort.com |publisher=Boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> Four of these instruments were played by the [[Tokyo String Quartet]].\n\nOf his guitars, there is little evidence remaining of his various choices of instrument. The aforementioned guitar that he gave to Berlioz is a French instrument made by one Grobert of [[Mirecourt]]. The luthier made his instrument in the style of [[Ren\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Lac\u00f4te|Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te]], a more well-known Paris-based guitar-maker. It is preserved and on display in the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Musique]] in Paris.\n\nOf the guitars he owned through his life, there was an instrument by Gennaro Fabricatore that he had refused to sell even in his periods of financial stress, and was among the instruments in his possession at the time of his death. There is an unsubstantiated rumour that he also played [[Johann Georg Stauffer|Stauffer]] guitars; he may certainly have come across these in his meetings with Giuliani in Vienna.\n\n==Compositions==\n{{listen|type=music|\n|filename=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogv\n|title=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description=[[Joshua Bell]] and [[Sharon Isbin]] perform Paganini's ''Cantabile'' at the [[White House]] Evening of Classical Music on 4 November 2009.\n|filename2=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogg\n|title2=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description2=Bell and Isbin \u2013 audio only version\n|filename3=CELLO ENCORES JOHN MICHEL-Paganini Variations on One String.ogg\n|title3=Variations on One String (Moses Fantasy)\n|description3=Performed by John Michell (cello) with a pianist}}\n{{Main|List of compositions by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini}}\nPaganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which profoundly influenced the evolution of violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] were likely composed in the period between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the publication, in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including ''Le Streghe'', ''The Carnival of Venice'', and ''Nel cor pi\u00f9 non mi sento'', were composed, or at least first performed, before his European concert tour.\n\nGenerally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the [[timbre]] of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled ''Il Fandango Spanolo'' (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece ''Duetto Amoroso'', in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the ''Duetto'', which has been recorded. The existence of the ''Fandango'' is known only through concert posters.\n\nHowever, his works were criticized for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism, as pointed out by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]].<ref>Lev Solomonovich Ginzburg. ''Ysaye''. Paganiniana, 1980.</ref> [[Yehudi Menuhin]], on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of his reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition.<ref name=\"Menuhin\" /> The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as [[Giovanni Paisiello]], Gioachino Rossini and [[Gaetano Donizetti]], who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.<ref>N. Till: Rossini, pp. 50\u201351. Omnibus Press, 1987</ref>\n\nPaganini was also the inspiration of many prominent composers. Both \"La Campanella\" and the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|A&nbsp;minor Caprice (No.&nbsp;24)]] have been an object of interest for a number of composers. [[Franz Liszt]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Boris Blacher]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[George Rochberg]] and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]], among others, wrote well-known variations on these themes.\n\n==Violin technique==\n[[File:David d'Angers - Paganini.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Bust of Niccol\u00f2 Paganini by [[David d'Angers]] (1830\u20131833)]]\nThe Israeli violinist [[Ivry Gitlis]] once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. [[Arcangelo Corelli]] (1653\u20131713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument. In the meantime, the polyphonic capability of the violin was firmly established through the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|Sonatas and Partitas]] BWV 1001\u20131006 of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750). Other notable violinists included [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (1678\u20131741) and [[Giuseppe Tartini]] (1692\u20131770), who, in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow. Techniques requiring agility of the fingers and the bow were still considered unorthodox and discouraged by the established community of violinists.\n\nMuch of Paganini's playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two violinists, [[Pietro Locatelli]] (1693\u20131746) and [[August Duranowski]] (Auguste Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Durand) (1770\u20131834). During Paganini's study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled ''L'arte di nuova modulazione \u2013 Capricci enigmatici'' or ''The art of the new style \u2013 the enigmatic caprices''). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]] (1755\u20131824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics, both natural and artificial (which had previously not been attempted in performance), and the left hand [[pizzicato]] in his performance.<ref>Richard Taruskin, ''An Oxford History of Western Music Volume 5: Music in the Nineteenth Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009</ref> Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques, which are now incorporated into regular compositions.\n\nAnother aspect of Paganini's violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally long fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today's standards. His seemingly unnatural ability may have been a result of [[Marfan syndrome]].<ref>From [http://tafkac.org/celebrities/paganini_stories_myths.html Paganini stories myths.] The AFU and Urban Legends Archive.

The series focuses on Paganini's relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, [[Armen Dzhigarkhanyan]], played Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious [[Jesuit]] official. The information in the series is generally spurious, and it also plays to some of the myths and legends rampant during the musician's lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity.<ref>\"Paganini, Niccol\u00f2.\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.'' Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2011.</ref> He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.\n\nIn [[Don Nigro]]'s satirical comedy play ''Paganini'' (1995), the great violinist seeks vainly for his salvation, claiming that he unknowingly [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul to the Devil]]. \"Variation upon variation,\" he cries at one point, \"but which variation leads to salvation and which to damnation? Music is a question for which there is no answer.\" Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is \"rescued\" by the Devil, who appears in different guises, returning Paganini's violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini's salvation\u2014administered by a god-like Clockmaker\u2014turns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. \"Do not pity him, my dear,\" the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini's murdered wives. \"He is alone with the answer for which there is no question. The saved and the damned are the same.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Angelo Boscassi, ''Il Violino di Niccol\u00f2 Paganini conservato nel Palazzo Municipale di Genova'', Fratelli Pagano, 1909\n* Leopold Auer, ''Violin playing as I teach it'', Stokes, 1921 (reprint Dover, 1980)\n* Alberto Bachmann, ''An Encyclopedia of the violin'', Da Capo, 1925\n* Jeffrey Pulver, ''Paganini: The Romantic Virtuoso'', Herbert Joseph, 1936 (reprint Da Capo, 1970)\n* Geraldine I.C. de Courcy, ''Paganini the Genoese'', University of Oklahoma, 1957 (reprint Da Capo, 1977)\n* [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[William Primrose]], ''Violin and viola'', MacDonald and Jane's, 1976\n* Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W.

The '''government budget balance''', also alternatively referred to as '''general government balance''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/weorept.aspx?sy=2006&ey=2008&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=80&pr1.y=6&c=998&s=NID_NGDP%2CNGSD_NGDP%2CPCPIPCH%2CGGB_NGDP%2CBCA%2CBCA_NGDPD&grp=1&a=1=Eur4 |title=IMF database |publisher=Imf.org |date=2006-09-14 |accessdate=2013-02-01}}</ref>  '''public budget balance''', or '''public fiscal balance''', is the overall difference between government revenues and spending. A positive balance is called a ''government budget surplus'', and a negative balance is a ''government budget deficit''. A budget is prepared for each level of government (from national to local) and takes into account public [[social security]] obligations.\n\nThe government budget balance can be broken down into the ''primary balance'' and interest payments on accumulated government debt; the two together give the budget balance. Furthermore, the budget balance can be broken down into the ''structural balance'' (also known as ''cyclically-adjusted balance'') and the cyclical component: the structural budget balance attempts to adjust for the impact of cyclical changes in [[Real gross domestic product|real GDP]], in order to indicate the longer-run budgetary situation.\n\nThe government budget surplus or deficit is a [[flow variable]], since it is an amount per unit of time (typically, per year). Thus it is distinct from [[government debt]], which is a [[stock variable]] since it is measured at a specific point in time. The cumulative flow of deficits equals the stock of debt.\n\n==  Sectoral balances ==\nThe government fiscal balance is one of three major sectoral balances in the national economy, the others being the foreign sector and the private sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by [[Identity (mathematics)|definition]]. For example, if there is a foreign financial surplus (or capital surplus) because capital is imported (net) to fund the [[trade deficit]], and there is also a private sector financial surplus due to household saving exceeding business investment, then by definition, there must exist a government budget deficit so all three net to zero. The government sector includes federal, state and local governments. For example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a capital surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP.<ref name=\"blogs.ft.com\">[http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/07/19/the-balance-sheet-recession-in-the-us/ Financial Times-Martin Wolf-The Balance Sheet Recession in the U.S. \u2013 July 2012]</ref>\n\nFinancial journalist [[Martin Wolf]] argued that sudden shifts in the private sector from deficit to surplus forced the government balance into deficit, and cited as example the U.S.: \"The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust.\"<ref name=\"blogs.ft.com\"/>\n\nEconomist [[Paul Krugman]] explained in December 2011 the causes of the sizable shift from private deficit to surplus: \"This huge move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of customers.\"<ref>[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/the-problem-2/ NYT-Paul Krugman-The Problem-December 2011]</ref>\n\nThe sectoral balances (also called sectoral financial balances) derive from the [[sectoral analysis]] framework for macroeconomic analysis of national economies developed by British economist [[Wynne Godley]].<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/goldmans-jan-hatzius-on-sectoral-balances-2012-12 Goldman's Top Economist Explains The World's Most Important Chart, And His Big Call For The US Economy]</ref> [[File:Sectoral Financial Balances in U.S. Economy.png|thumb|right|Sectoral financial balances in U.S. economy 1990\u20132012. By definition, the three balances must net to zero. Since 2009, the U.S. capital surplus and private sector surplus have driven a government budget deficit.]]\nGDP ([[Gross Domestic Product]]) is the value of all goods and services produced within a country during one year. GDP measures [[flow variable|flow]]s rather than [[stock variable|stock]]s (example: the [[public deficit]] is a flow, measured per unit of time, while the [[government debt]] is a stock, an accumulation). GDP can be expressed equivalently in terms of production or the types of newly produced goods purchased, as per the National Accounting relationship between aggregate spending and income:\n\n:<math>Y=C+I+G+(X-M)</math>\n\nwhere ''Y'' is GDP (production; equivalently, income), ''C'' is [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] spending, ''I'' is private [[investment#In macroeconomics|investment spending]], ''G'' is [[government spending]] on goods and services, ''X'' is exports and ''M'' is imports (so ''X'' \u2013 ''M'' is net exports).\n\nAnother perspective on the national income accounting is to note that households can allocate total income (Y) to the following uses:\n\n:<math>Y = C + S + T</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is total saving and ''T'' is total taxation net of [[transfer payment]]s.\n\nCombining the two perspectives gives\n\n:<math>C + S + T = Y = C + I + G + (X -M).</math>\n\nHence\n\n:<math>S + T = I + G + (X -M).</math>\n\nThis implies the accounting identity for the three sectoral balances \u2013 private domestic, government budget and external:\n\n:<math>(S - I) = (G -T) + (X -M).</math>\n\nThe sectoral balances equation says that total private saving (''S'') minus private investment (''I'') has to equal the public deficit (spending, ''G'', minus net taxes, ''T'') plus net exports (exports (''X'') minus imports (''M'')), where net exports is the net spending of non-residents on this country's production. Thus total private saving equals private investment plus the public deficit plus net exports.\n\nIn [[macroeconomics]], the [[Modern Money Theory]] describes any transactions between the government sector and the non-government sector as a vertical transaction. The government sector includes the treasury and the [[central bank]], whereas the non-government sector includes private individuals and firms (including the private banking system) and the external sector \u2013 that is, foreign buyers and sellers.<ref name=\"def1011\">[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=332 \"Deficit Spending 101 \u2013 Part 1 : Vertical Transactions\"] Bill Mitchell, 21 February 2009</ref>\n\nIn any given time period, the government's budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. Sectoral balances analysis shows that as a matter of accounting, [[government budget deficit]]s add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited, over the course of some time range, more money and bonds into private holdings than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money and bonds from private holdings via taxes than it has put back in via spending.\n\nTherefore, budget deficits, by definition, are equivalent to adding net financial assets to the private sector, whereas budget surpluses remove financial assets from the private sector.\n\nThis is represented by the identity:\n\n:<math>(G-T) = (S-I) -NX</math>\n\nwhere ''NX'' is net exports. This implies that private net saving is only possible if the government runs budget deficits; alternately, the private sector is forced to dissave when the government runs a budget surplus.\n\nAccording to the sectoral balances framework, budget surpluses offset net saving; in a time of high effective demand, this may lead to a private sector reliance on credit to finance consumption patterns. Hence, continual budget deficits are necessary for a growing economy that wants to avoid deflation. Therefore, budget surpluses are required only when the economy has excessive [[aggregate demand]], and is in danger of [[inflation]]. If the government issues its own currency, MMT tells us that the level of taxation relative to government spending (the government's budget deficit or surplus) is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and unemployment, and not a means of funding the government's activities per se.\n\n==Primary balance==\n\"Primary balance\" is defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) as government net borrowing or net lending, excluding interest payments on consolidated government liabilities.<ref name=\"OECD Definition\">{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6789|title=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms: Primary Balance|publisher=stats.oecd.org|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Primary deficit, total deficit, and debt==\n\nThe meaning of \"deficit\" differs from that of \"debt\", which is an accumulation of yearly deficits. Deficits occur when a government's expenditures exceed the revenue that it levies. The deficit can be measured with or without including the interest payments on the debt as expenditures.<ref name=\"macroeconomics56\">Michael Burda and Charles Wyplosz (1995), ''European Macroeconomics'', 2nd ed., Ch. 3.5.1, p. 56. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-877468-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''primary deficit'' is defined as the difference between current [[government spending]] on goods and services and total current revenue from all types of [[tax]]es net of [[transfer payment]]s. The ''total deficit'' (which is often called the fiscal deficit or just the 'deficit') is the primary deficit plus interest payments on the debt.<ref name=\"macroeconomics56\"/>\n\nTherefore, if <math>t</math> refers to an arbitrary year, <math>G_t</math> is government spending and <math>T_t</math> is tax revenue for the respective year, then\n:<math> \\text{Primary deficit} = G_t - T_t. \\,</math>\n\nIf <math>D_{t-1}</math> is last year's debt (the debt accumulated up to and including last year), and <math>r</math> is the interest rate attached to the debt, then the total deficit for year ''t'' is\n:<math> \\text{Total deficit}_t = r \\cdot D_{t-1} + G_t - T_t \\,</math>\n\nwhere the first term on the right side is interest payments on the outstanding debt.\n\nFinally, this year's debt can be calculated from last year's debt and this year's total deficit, using the '''government budget constraint''':\n:<math> {D_t} = (1+r)D_{t-1} + G_t - T_t. \\,</math>\n\nThat is, the debt after this year's government operations equals what it was a year earlier plus this year's total deficit, because the current deficit has to be financed by borrowing via the issuance of new bonds.\n\nEconomic trends can influence the growth or shrinkage of fiscal deficits in several ways.  Increased levels of economic activity generally lead to higher tax revenues, while government expenditures often increase during economic downturns because of higher outlays for social insurance programs such as [[unemployment benefit]]s. Changes in tax rates, tax enforcement policies, levels of social benefits, and other government policy decisions can also have major effects on public debt. For some countries, such as [[Norway]], [[Russia]], and members of the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), oil and gas receipts play a major role in public finances.\n\nInflation reduces the real value of accumulated debt. If investors anticipate future inflation, however, they will demand higher interest rates on government debt, making public borrowing more expensive.\n\n==Structural deficits, cyclical deficits, and the fiscal gap==\n{{Main|Structural and cyclical deficit}}\n[[File:Public Deficit of France.png|thumb|French government borrowing (budget deficits) as a percentage of GNP, 1960\u20132009.]]\nA government deficit can be thought of as consisting of two elements, ''structural'' and ''cyclical''. At the lowest point in the [[business cycle]], there is a high level of [[unemployment]]. This means that tax revenues are low and expenditure (e.g.,&nbsp;on [[social security]]) high. Conversely, at the peak of the cycle, unemployment is low, increasing tax  revenue and decreasing social security spending. The additional borrowing required at the low point of the cycle is the ''[[cyclical deficit]]''. By definition, the cyclical deficit will be entirely repaid by a cyclical surplus at the peak of the cycle.\n\nThe ''[[structural deficit]]'' is the deficit that remains across the business cycle, because the general level of government spending exceeds prevailing tax levels. The observed total budget deficit is equal to the sum of the structural deficit with the cyclical deficit or surplus.\n\nSome economists have criticized the distinction between cyclical and structural deficits, contending that the business cycle is too difficult to measure to make cyclical analysis worthwhile.<ref name=ftic-myth>{{cite web|last=Dillow|first=Chris|title=The myth of the structural deficit|url=http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/2012/01/25/comment/chris-dillow/the-myth-of-the-structural-deficit-kxaAou6Uxk3agiUtDUZEnI/article.html;jsessionid=A3610EF98F61FEE511F6E1D05D7697F5.mps-apr-02-8109|work=[[Investors Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Financial Times|The Financial Times Limited]]|accessdate=19 May 2013|date=15 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531163719/http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/2012/01/25/comment/chris-dillow/the-myth-of-the-structural-deficit-kxaAou6Uxk3agiUtDUZEnI/article.html;jsessionid=A3610EF98F61FEE511F6E1D05D7697F5.mps-apr-02-8109|archive-date=31 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[fiscal gap]]'', a measure proposed by economists [[Alan Auerbach]] and [[Laurence Kotlikoff]], measures the difference between government spending and revenues over the very long term, typically as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product.  The fiscal gap can be interpreted as the percentage increase in revenues or reduction of expenditures necessary to balance spending and revenues in the long run.  For example, a fiscal gap of 5% could be eliminated by an immediate and permanent 5% increase in taxes or cut in spending or some combination of both.<ref>[http://www.aarp.org/research/blueprint/overstatedproblem/the_fiscal_gap.html AARP article on the fiscal gap]</ref>\n\nIt includes not only the structural deficit at a given point in time, but also the difference between promised future government commitments, such as health and retirement spending, and planned future tax revenues. Since the elderly population is growing much faster than the young population in many developed countries, many economists argue that these countries have important fiscal gaps, beyond what can be seen from their deficits alone.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===National government budgets===\n{{update|date=November 2011}}\nData are for 2010:<ref>Data on the United States' federal debt can found at [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/govt.htm U.S.&nbsp;Treasury] website.

A prominent example of this was the [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Rothschild]] dynasty in the late 18th and 19th century, though there were many earlier examples ([[Peruzzi family]]).\n\nThese loans became popular when private financiers had amassed enough capital to provide them, and when governments were no longer able to simply print [[money]], with consequent [[inflation]], to finance their spending.\n\nLarge long-term loans are risky for the lender, and therefore commanded high interest rates.  To reduce their borrowing costs, governments began to issue bonds that were payable to the bearer (rather than the original purchaser) so that the lenders could sell on some or all of the debt to someone else.  This innovation reduced the risk for the lenders, and so the government could offer a lower interest rate.  Examples of bearer bonds are British [[Consols]] and American [[Treasury bill]] bonds.\n\n==Deficit spending==\n{{Main|Deficit spending}}\nAccording to most economists, during recessions, the government can stimulate the economy by intentionally running a deficit.                                  \nAs Professor [[William Vickrey]], awarded with the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences put it :\n\n{{quote|Deficits are considered to represent sinful profligate spending at the expense of future generations who will be left with a smaller endowment of invested capital.\n\nThis fallacy seems to stem from a false analogy to borrowing by individuals. Current reality is almost the exact opposite. Deficits add to the net disposable income of individuals, to the extent that government disbursements that constitute income to recipients exceed that abstracted from disposable income in taxes, fees, and other charges. This added purchasing power, when spent, provides markets for private production, inducing producers to invest in additional plant capacity, which will form part of the real heritage left to the future. This is in addition to whatever public investment takes place in infrastructure, education, research, and the like. Larger deficits, sufficient to recycle savings out of a growing gross domestic product (GDP) in excess of what can be recycled by profit-seeking private investment, are not an economic sin but an economic necessity. Deficits in excess of a gap growing as a result of the maximum feasible growth in real output might indeed cause problems, but we are nowhere near that level.\n\nEven the analogy itself is faulty. If General Motors, AT&T, and individual households had been required to balance their budgets in the manner being applied to the Federal government, there would be no corporate bonds, no mortgages, no bank loans, and many fewer automobiles, telephones, and houses.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/dlc/wp/econ/vickrey.html 15 Fatal Fallacies of Financial Fundamentalism-William Vickrey 1996]</ref>}}\n\n===Ricardian equivalence===\nThe [[Ricardian equivalence]] hypothesis, named after the English political economist and Member of Parliament [[David Ricardo]], states that because households anticipate that current public deficit will be paid through future taxes, those households will accumulate savings now to offset those future taxes.  If households acted in this way, a government would not be able to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy.  The Ricardian equivalence result requires several assumptions.  These include households acting as if they were infinite-lived dynasties as well as assumptions of no uncertainty and no liquidity constraints.\n\nAlso, for Ricardian equivalence to apply, the deficit spending would have to be permanent. In contrast, a one-time stimulus through deficit spending would suggest a lesser tax burden annually than the one-time deficit expenditure. Thus temporary deficit spending is still expansionary. Empirical evidence on Ricardian equivalence effects has been mixed.\n\n===Crowding-out hypothesis===\nThe crowding-out hypothesis is the conjecture that when a government experiences a deficit, the choice to borrow to offset that deficit draws on the pool of resources available for investment, and private investment gets crowded out.  This [[crowding out (economics)|crowding-out effect]] is induced by changes in the interest rate. When the government wishes to borrow, its demand for credit increases and the interest rate, or price of credit, increases.  This increase in the interest rate makes private investment more expensive as well and less of it is used.<ref>Harvey S. Rosen (2005), ''Public Finance'', 7th Ed., Ch. 18 p. 464.

Taxes may be increased for everyone/every entity across the board or lawmakers may decide to assign that tax burden to specific groups of people (higher-income individuals, businesses, etc.)  Lawmakers may also decide to cut government spending.\n\nLike with taxes, they could decide to cut the budgets of every government agency/entity by the same percentage or they may decide to give a greater budget cut to specific agencies. Many, if not all, of these decisions made by lawmakers are based on political ideology, popularity with their electorate, or popularity with their donors.\n\n===Changes in tax code===\nSimilar to increasing taxes, changes can be made to the tax code that increases tax revenue. Closing tax loopholes and allowing fewer [[Tax deduction|deductions]] are different from the act of increasing taxes but essentially have the same effect.\n\n===Reduce debt service liability===\nEvery year, the government must pay debt service payments on their overall public debt. These payments include principal and interest payments.  Occasionally, the government has the opportunity to refinance some of their public debt to afford them lower debt service payments. Doing this would allow the government to cut expenditures without cutting government spending.<ref>Steven A.

Surplus purchases are funded through increases in tax.\n\n===Balanced budget===\nAccording to Alesina, Favor & Giavazzi (2018), \u201cwe recognized that shifts in fiscal policy typically come in the form of multiyear plans adopted by governments with the aim of reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio over a period of time-typically three to four years. After reconstructing such plans, we divided them into two categories: expenditure-based plans, consisting mostly of spending cuts, and tax-based plans, consisting mostly of tax hikes.\u201d They suggest that paying down the national debt in twenty years is possible through a simplified income tax policy while requiring government officials to enact and follow a balanced budget with additional education on government spending and budgets at all levels of public education.

The '''government budget balance''', also alternatively referred to as '''general government balance''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/weorept.aspx?sy=2006&ey=2008&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=80&pr1.y=6&c=998&s=NID_NGDP%2CNGSD_NGDP%2CPCPIPCH%2CGGB_NGDP%2CBCA%2CBCA_NGDPD&grp=1&a=1=Eur4 |title=IMF database |publisher=Imf.org |date=2006-09-14 |accessdate=2013-02-01}}</ref>  '''public budget balance''', or '''public fiscal balance''', is the overall difference between government revenues and spending. A positive balance is called a ''government budget surplus'', and a negative balance is a ''government budget deficit''. A budget is prepared for each level of government (from national to local) and takes into account public [[social security]] obligations.\n\nThe government budget balance can be broken down into the ''primary balance'' and interest payments on accumulated government debt; the two together give the budget balance. Furthermore, the budget balance can be broken down into the ''structural balance'' (also known as ''cyclically-adjusted balance'') and the cyclical component: the structural budget balance attempts to adjust for the impact of cyclical changes in [[Real gross domestic product|real GDP]], in order to indicate the longer-run budgetary situation.\n\nThe government budget surplus or deficit is a [[flow variable]], since it is an amount per unit of time (typically, per year). Thus it is distinct from [[government debt]], which is a [[stock variable]] since it is measured at a specific point in time. The cumulative flow of deficits equals the stock of debt.\n\n==  Sectoral balances ==\nThe government fiscal balance is one of three major sectoral balances in the national economy, the others being the foreign sector and the private sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by [[Identity (mathematics)|definition]]. For example, if there is a foreign financial surplus (or capital surplus) because capital is imported (net) to fund the [[trade deficit]], and there is also a private sector financial surplus due to household saving exceeding business investment, then by definition, there must exist a government budget deficit so all three net to zero. The government sector includes federal, state and local governments. For example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a capital surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP.<ref name=\"blogs.ft.com\">[http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/07/19/the-balance-sheet-recession-in-the-us/ Financial Times-Martin Wolf-The Balance Sheet Recession in the U.S. \u2013 July 2012]</ref>\n\nFinancial journalist [[Martin Wolf]] argued that sudden shifts in the private sector from deficit to surplus forced the government balance into deficit, and cited as example the U.S.: \"The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance.

By definition, the three balances must net to zero. Since 2009, the U.S. capital surplus and private sector surplus have driven a government budget deficit.]]\nGDP ([[Gross Domestic Product]]) is the value of all goods and services produced within a country during one year. GDP measures [[flow variable|flow]]s rather than [[stock variable|stock]]s (example: the [[public deficit]] is a flow, measured per unit of time, while the [[government debt]] is a stock, an accumulation). GDP can be expressed equivalently in terms of production or the types of newly produced goods purchased, as per the National Accounting relationship between aggregate spending and income:\n\n:<math>Y=C+I+G+(X-M)</math>\n\nwhere ''Y'' is GDP (production; equivalently, income), ''C'' is [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] spending, ''I'' is private [[investment#In macroeconomics|investment spending]], ''G'' is [[government spending]] on goods and services, ''X'' is exports and ''M'' is imports (so ''X'' \u2013 ''M'' is net exports).\n\nAnother perspective on the national income accounting is to note that households can allocate total income (Y) to the following uses:\n\n:<math>Y = C + S + T</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is total saving and ''T'' is total taxation net of [[transfer payment]]s.\n\nCombining the two perspectives gives\n\n:<math>C + S + T = Y = C + I + G + (X -M).</math>\n\nHence\n\n:<math>S + T = I + G + (X -M).</math>\n\nThis implies the accounting identity for the three sectoral balances \u2013 private domestic, government budget and external:\n\n:<math>(S - I) = (G -T) + (X -M).</math>\n\nThe sectoral balances equation says that total private saving (''S'') minus private investment (''I'') has to equal the public deficit (spending, ''G'', minus net taxes, ''T'') plus net exports (exports (''X'') minus imports (''M'')), where net exports is the net spending of non-residents on this country's production. Thus total private saving equals private investment plus the public deficit plus net exports.\n\nIn [[macroeconomics]], the [[Modern Money Theory]] describes any transactions between the government sector and the non-government sector as a vertical transaction. The government sector includes the treasury and the [[central bank]], whereas the non-government sector includes private individuals and firms (including the private banking system) and the external sector \u2013 that is, foreign buyers and sellers.<ref name=\"def1011\">[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=332 \"Deficit Spending 101 \u2013 Part 1 : Vertical Transactions\"] Bill Mitchell, 21 February 2009</ref>\n\nIn any given time period, the government's budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. Sectoral balances analysis shows that as a matter of accounting, [[government budget deficit]]s add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited, over the course of some time range, more money and bonds into private holdings than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money and bonds from private holdings via taxes than it has put back in via spending.\n\nTherefore, budget deficits, by definition, are equivalent to adding net financial assets to the private sector, whereas budget surpluses remove financial assets from the private sector.\n\nThis is represented by the identity:\n\n:<math>(G-T) = (S-I) -NX</math>\n\nwhere ''NX'' is net exports. This implies that private net saving is only possible if the government runs budget deficits; alternately, the private sector is forced to dissave when the government runs a budget surplus.\n\nAccording to the sectoral balances framework, budget surpluses offset net saving; in a time of high effective demand, this may lead to a private sector reliance on credit to finance consumption patterns. Hence, continual budget deficits are necessary for a growing economy that wants to avoid deflation. Therefore, budget surpluses are required only when the economy has excessive [[aggregate demand]], and is in danger of [[inflation]]. If the government issues its own currency, MMT tells us that the level of taxation relative to government spending (the government's budget deficit or surplus) is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and unemployment, and not a means of funding the government's activities per se.\n\n==Primary balance==\n\"Primary balance\" is defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) as government net borrowing or net lending, excluding interest payments on consolidated government liabilities.<ref name=\"OECD Definition\">{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6789|title=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms: Primary Balance|publisher=stats.oecd.org|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Primary deficit, total deficit, and debt==\n\nThe meaning of \"deficit\" differs from that of \"debt\", which is an accumulation of yearly deficits. Deficits occur when a government's expenditures exceed the revenue that it levies. The deficit can be measured with or without including the interest payments on the debt as expenditures.<ref name=\"macroeconomics56\">Michael Burda and Charles Wyplosz (1995), ''European Macroeconomics'', 2nd ed., Ch. 3.5.1, p. 56. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-877468-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''primary deficit'' is defined as the difference between current [[government spending]] on goods and services and total current revenue from all types of [[tax]]es net of [[transfer payment]]s. The ''total deficit'' (which is often called the fiscal deficit or just the 'deficit') is the primary deficit plus interest payments on the debt.<ref name=\"macroeconomics56\"/>\n\nTherefore, if <math>t</math> refers to an arbitrary year, <math>G_t</math> is government spending and <math>T_t</math> is tax revenue for the respective year, then\n:<math> \\text{Primary deficit} = G_t - T_t. \\,</math>\n\nIf <math>D_{t-1}</math> is last year's debt (the debt accumulated up to and including last year), and <math>r</math> is the interest rate attached to the debt, then the total deficit for year ''t'' is\n:<math> \\text{Total deficit}_t = r \\cdot D_{t-1} + G_t - T_t \\,</math>\n\nwhere the first term on the right side is interest payments on the outstanding debt.\n\nFinally, this year's debt can be calculated from last year's debt and this year's total deficit, using the '''government budget constraint''':\n:<math> {D_t} = (1+r)D_{t-1} + G_t - T_t. \\,</math>\n\nThat is, the debt after this year's government operations equals what it was a year earlier plus this year's total deficit, because the current deficit has to be financed by borrowing via the issuance of new bonds.\n\nEconomic trends can influence the growth or shrinkage of fiscal deficits in several ways.  Increased levels of economic activity generally lead to higher tax revenues, while government expenditures often increase during economic downturns because of higher outlays for social insurance programs such as [[unemployment benefit]]s. Changes in tax rates, tax enforcement policies, levels of social benefits, and other government policy decisions can also have major effects on public debt. For some countries, such as [[Norway]], [[Russia]], and members of the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), oil and gas receipts play a major role in public finances.\n\nInflation reduces the real value of accumulated debt. If investors anticipate future inflation, however, they will demand higher interest rates on government debt, making public borrowing more expensive.\n\n==Structural deficits, cyclical deficits, and the fiscal gap==\n{{Main|Structural and cyclical deficit}}\n[[File:Public Deficit of France.png|thumb|French government borrowing (budget deficits) as a percentage of GNP, 1960\u20132009.]]\nA government deficit can be thought of as consisting of two elements, ''structural'' and ''cyclical''. At the lowest point in the [[business cycle]], there is a high level of [[unemployment]]. This means that tax revenues are low and expenditure (e.g.,&nbsp;on [[social security]]) high. Conversely, at the peak of the cycle, unemployment is low, increasing tax  revenue and decreasing social security spending. The additional borrowing required at the low point of the cycle is the ''[[cyclical deficit]]''. By definition, the cyclical deficit will be entirely repaid by a cyclical surplus at the peak of the cycle.\n\nThe ''[[structural deficit]]'' is the deficit that remains across the business cycle, because the general level of government spending exceeds prevailing tax levels. The observed total budget deficit is equal to the sum of the structural deficit with the cyclical deficit or surplus.\n\nSome economists have criticized the distinction between cyclical and structural deficits, contending that the business cycle is too difficult to measure to make cyclical analysis worthwhile.<ref name=ftic-myth>{{cite web|last=Dillow|first=Chris|title=The myth of the structural deficit|url=http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/2012/01/25/comment/chris-dillow/the-myth-of-the-structural-deficit-kxaAou6Uxk3agiUtDUZEnI/article.html;jsessionid=A3610EF98F61FEE511F6E1D05D7697F5.mps-apr-02-8109|work=[[Investors Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Financial Times|The Financial Times Limited]]|accessdate=19 May 2013|date=15 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531163719/http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/2012/01/25/comment/chris-dillow/the-myth-of-the-structural-deficit-kxaAou6Uxk3agiUtDUZEnI/article.html;jsessionid=A3610EF98F61FEE511F6E1D05D7697F5.mps-apr-02-8109|archive-date=31 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[fiscal gap]]'', a measure proposed by economists [[Alan Auerbach]] and [[Laurence Kotlikoff]], measures the difference between government spending and revenues over the very long term, typically as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product.  The fiscal gap can be interpreted as the percentage increase in revenues or reduction of expenditures necessary to balance spending and revenues in the long run.  For example, a fiscal gap of 5% could be eliminated by an immediate and permanent 5% increase in taxes or cut in spending or some combination of both.<ref>[http://www.aarp.org/research/blueprint/overstatedproblem/the_fiscal_gap.html AARP article on the fiscal gap]</ref>\n\nIt includes not only the structural deficit at a given point in time, but also the difference between promised future government commitments, such as health and retirement spending, and planned future tax revenues. Since the elderly population is growing much faster than the young population in many developed countries, many economists argue that these countries have important fiscal gaps, beyond what can be seen from their deficits alone.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===National government budgets===\n{{update|date=November 2011}}\nData are for 2010:<ref>Data on the United States' federal debt can found at [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/govt.htm U.S.&nbsp;Treasury] website.

A prominent example of this was the [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Rothschild]] dynasty in the late 18th and 19th century, though there were many earlier examples ([[Peruzzi family]]).\n\nThese loans became popular when private financiers had amassed enough capital to provide them, and when governments were no longer able to simply print [[money]], with consequent [[inflation]], to finance their spending.\n\nHowever, large, long-term loans had a high element of risk for the lender and consequently gave high interest rates. Governments later began to issue bonds that were payable to the bearer, rather than the original purchaser. This meant that someone who lent the state money could sell on the debt to someone else, reducing the risks involved and reducing the overall interest rates. Examples of this are British [[Consols]] and American [[Treasury bill]] bonds.\n\n==Deficit spending==\n{{Main|Deficit spending}}\nAccording to most economists, during recessions, the government can stimulate the economy by intentionally running a deficit.                                  \nAs Professor [[William Vickrey]], awarded with the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences put it :\n\n{{quote|Deficits are considered to represent sinful profligate spending at the expense of future generations who will be left with a smaller endowment of invested capital.\n\nThis fallacy seems to stem from a false analogy to borrowing by individuals. Current reality is almost the exact opposite. Deficits add to the net disposable income of individuals, to the extent that government disbursements that constitute income to recipients exceed that abstracted from disposable income in taxes, fees, and other charges. This added purchasing power, when spent, provides markets for private production, inducing producers to invest in additional plant capacity, which will form part of the real heritage left to the future. This is in addition to whatever public investment takes place in infrastructure, education, research, and the like. Larger deficits, sufficient to recycle savings out of a growing gross domestic product (GDP) in excess of what can be recycled by profit-seeking private investment, are not an economic sin but an economic necessity. Deficits in excess of a gap growing as a result of the maximum feasible growth in real output might indeed cause problems, but we are nowhere near that level.\n\nEven the analogy itself is faulty. If General Motors, AT&T, and individual households had been required to balance their budgets in the manner being applied to the Federal government, there would be no corporate bonds, no mortgages, no bank loans, and many fewer automobiles, telephones, and houses.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/dlc/wp/econ/vickrey.html 15 Fatal Fallacies of Financial Fundamentalism-William Vickrey 1996]</ref>}}\n\n===Ricardian equivalence===\nThe [[Ricardian equivalence]] hypothesis, named after the English political economist and Member of Parliament [[David Ricardo]], states that because households anticipate that current public deficit will be paid through future taxes, those households will accumulate savings now to offset those future taxes.  If households acted in this way, a government would not be able to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy.  The Ricardian equivalence result requires several assumptions.  These include households acting as if they were infinite-lived dynasties as well as assumptions of no uncertainty and no liquidity constraints.\n\nAlso, for Ricardian equivalence to apply, the deficit spending would have to be permanent. In contrast, a one-time stimulus through deficit spending would suggest a lesser tax burden annually than the one-time deficit expenditure. Thus temporary deficit spending is still expansionary. Empirical evidence on Ricardian equivalence effects has been mixed.\n\n===Crowding-out hypothesis===\nThe crowding-out hypothesis is the conjecture that when a government experiences a deficit, the choice to borrow to offset that deficit draws on the pool of resources available for investment, and private investment gets crowded out.  This [[crowding out (economics)|crowding-out effect]] is induced by changes in the interest rate. When the government wishes to borrow, its demand for credit increases and the interest rate, or price of credit, increases.  This increase in the interest rate makes private investment more expensive as well and less of it is used.<ref>Harvey S. Rosen (2005), ''Public Finance'', 7th Ed., Ch. 18 p. 464. McGraw-Hill Irwin, {{ISBN|0-07-287648-4}}</ref>\n\n==Potential policy solutions for unintended deficits==\n\n===Increase taxes or reduce government spending===\n[[File:Government surplus or deficit since 2001 (piiggs and US).svg|thumb|The government surplus/deficit of struggling European countries according to [[European sovereign debt crisis]]: [[Italy]], [[Cyprus]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] against the [[Eurozone]] and the [[United States]] (2000\u20132013).]]\n\nIf a reduction in a structural deficit is desired, either revenue must increase, spending must decrease, or both. Taxes may be increased for everyone/every entity across the board or lawmakers may decide to assign that tax burden to specific groups of people (higher-income individuals, businesses, etc.)  Lawmakers may also decide to cut government spending.\n\nLike with taxes, they could decide to cut the budgets of every government agency/entity by the same percentage or they may decide to give a greater budget cut to specific agencies. Many, if not all, of these decisions made by lawmakers are based on political ideology, popularity with their electorate, or popularity with their donors.\n\n===Changes in tax code===\nSimilar to increasing taxes, changes can be made to the tax code that increases tax revenue. Closing tax loopholes and allowing fewer [[Tax deduction|deductions]] are different from the act of increasing taxes but essentially have the same effect.\n\n===Reduce debt service liability===\nEvery year, the government must pay debt service payments on their overall public debt. These payments include principal and interest payments.  Occasionally, the government has the opportunity to refinance some of their public debt to afford them lower debt service payments. Doing this would allow the government to cut expenditures without cutting government spending.<ref>Steven A. Finkler (2005), ''Financial Management For Public, Health And Not-For-Profit Organizations'', 2nd Ed., Ch. 11, pp. 442\u201343. Pearson Education, Inc, {{ISBN|0-13-147198-8}}.</ref>\n \nA balanced budget is a practice that sees a government enforcing that payments, procurement of resources will only be done inline with realised revenues, such that a flat or a zero balance is maintained. Surplus purchases are funded through increases in tax.\n\n===Balanced budget===\nAccording to Alesina, Favor & Giavazzi (2018), \u201cwe recognized that shifts in fiscal policy typically come in the form of multiyear plans adopted by governments with the aim of reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio over a period of time-typically three to four years. After reconstructing such plans, we divided them into two categories: expenditure-based plans, consisting mostly of spending cuts, and tax-based plans, consisting mostly of tax hikes.\u201d They suggest that paying down the national debt in twenty years is possible through a simplified income tax policy while requiring government officials to enact and follow a balanced budget with additional education on government spending and budgets at all levels of public education.
