Its [[yeshivot]] (religious schools) attracted brilliant scholars, poets and grammarians. This period was marred by a pogrom in 1033, which is described by the [[Jewish Virtual Library]] as an isolated event primarily due to political conflict between the [[Maghrawa]] and  [[Ifrenid]] tribes.<ref name=\"Virtual Jewish World\">{{cite web|title=Virtual Jewish World: Fez, Morocco|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Fez.html|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=The Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Under the Almoravids===\nThe [[Almoravids]] (Arab. Al-Mur\u0101bi\u1e6d\u016bn; \"Warrior-Monks\"), confederation of [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes of the Sanhajah group who lived in the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[Sahara]] [[Desert]]. Their religious fervor and fighting capabilities enabled them to establish a formidable empire in the [[Morocco]] and [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Spain]] in the 11th and 12th centuries. Their theological Islamic zeal is attributed to Yahya ibn Ibrahim, their spiritual leader, as well as to the 'alim (religious scholar) 'Abd Allah ibn Yasin. Imbued with Islamic zeal, the Almoravids conquered Morocco and major sections of western Algeria between 1054 and 1092. In 1062 they turned [[Marrakesh]] into their base of operations and religious capital. Thenceforth, their main leaders embraced the title of Amir al-Muslimin (\"commander of the Muslims\") but nevertheless continued to recognize the legitimacy of a still higher authority in Islam: the Abbasid caliph in Iraq upon whom the title Amir al-Mu'min\u012bn (\"commander of the faithful\") had been bestowed. It was toward the end of the 11th century that the Castilian Christians who held on to parts of Spain began challenging the authority of the Almoravids and encroaching on their territories. The Almoravid leadership succeeded in temporarily repulsing the Christians and foiling their plans to conquer such key cities as [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].\n\nWith the exception of [[Valencia]], Muslim Spain remained under Almoravid control. Notwithstanding, perhaps the weakest aspect of Almoravid rule in Spain and the Maghreb is the fact that they were a Muslim Berber minority in charge of a Spanish-Arab empire. With the passage of time, they found it increasingly difficult to protect all their territorial possessions from the Christian reconquest, especially in the aftermath of the fall of Saragossa in 1118. Moreover, in 1125 the [[Almohads]] (those who advocated the \"Unity of Allah\"), a confederation of rival Berber tribes, began to rebel against them in the Atlas Mountains. Following a protracted struggle and relentless fighting, the Almohads defeated the Almoravids in 1147; they transformed [[Marrakesh]] into their own capital and extended their authority into Muslim Spain.\n\nThe position of the Jews under Almoravid domination was apparently free of major abuses, though there are reports of increasing social hostility against them \u2013 particularly in Fes.<ref>Norman Roth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bHh5plYLhHEC&pg=PA113&lpg=PA113&dq=almoravids+jews&source=bl&ots=dt-Wts_TKr&sig=Pr-FYcCPk7c9VMAHTVXN_m2CZDE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=98TYUem-LIfTtAa0zYDgCA&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg Jews, Visigoths, and Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict], Brill, 1994, pp.113-116.</ref> Unlike the problems encountered by the Jews during the rule of the [[Almohads]] (the Almoravids' successor dynasty), there are not many factual complaints of excesses, coercion, or malice on the part of the authorities toward the Jewish communities. It is known, however, that [[Yusuf Ibn Tashfin]] forbade Jews living in the capital city [[Marrakesh]]. It was allowed for them to trade there, but if a Jew was caught in the city during night hours it was punishable by death.<ref>M.J. Viguera. \"Almoravids.\" ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World''. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2014.</ref>\n\nUnder the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under [[Ali ibn Yusuf|Ali III]], than under his father [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]]). Among those who held the title of \"vizier\" ({{Lang|ar|\u0648\u0632\u064a\u0631}}) or \"nasih\" ({{Lang|ar|\u0646\u0627\u0635\u062d}}) in Almoravid times were the poet and physician [[Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu'allam]], [[Abraham ibn Me\u00efr ibn Kamnial]], [[Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar]], and [[Solomon ibn Farusal]].\n\n===Under the Almohads (1146-15th century)===\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Population}}\nThe Dhimmi status, which called for the payment of jizya (taxes for non-Muslims) in exchange for a certain level of protection for religious minorities, came to an end under the strict militant dynasty of the Almohads, who came into power in 1146. Instead, the Almohads forced Jews to choose between conversion to Islam or death, compelling many Jews to convert, or at least pretend to. Due to the many similarities between Jewish and Islamic practice, Jews felt as though they could clandestinely maintain their Jewish practices under the guise of Islam.<ref>Norman Arthur Stillman, The Jews of Arab Lands, (Philadelphia (Pa.): The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1979), 76.</ref> For example, names such as Benchekroun (initially Chokron or Choukroun or Chekroun depending on the pronunciation), El Kohen, and Kabbaj were Jewish in origin. [[Maimonides]], who was staying in Fez with his father, is said to have written to the communities to comfort and encourage his brethren and fellow believers in this time of oppression <ref>(see Ibn Verga \"Shebe? Yehudah\", ed. Wiener, p. 50</ref> In the above-mentioned elegy of [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], which appears to have been written at the commencement of the period of the [[Almohads]], and which is found in a Yemen siddur among the kinot prescribed for the Ninth of Ab, the Moroccan cities [[Ceuta]], [[Meknes]], the [[Draa River]] valley, Fez, and [[Segelmesa]] are especially emphasized as being exposed to great persecution. [[Joseph ha-Kohen]]<ref>(see Ibn Verga Eme? ha-Baka\", ed. Wiener, p. 20</ref> relates that no remnant of Israel was left from [[Tangier]] to Mehdia. \n\nDue to the nature of the forced conversions, the later Almohads were no longer content with the repetition of a mere formula of belief in the unity of God and in the prophetic calling of Muhammad. The third Almohad Prince, Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur, spoke on this matter, saying \u201cIf I were sure about the sincerity of their Islam, I would let them mix with the Muslims\u2026, and if I were sure of their unbelief, I would kill their men, enslave their offspring, and declare their property spoils for the Muslims. But I am uncertain about their case.\u201d<ref>Norman Arthur Stillman, The Jews of Arab Lands, (Philadelphia (Pa.): The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1979), 76.</ref> Thus, al-Mansur made an effort to distinguish the neo-Muslims from the \u201ctrue\u201d Muslims. He compelled them to wear distinguishing garments, with a very noticeable yellow cloth for a head-covering; from that time forward the clothing of the Jews formed an important subject in the legal regulations concerning them. \n\nThe reign of the Almohads on the whole exercised a most disastrous and enduring influence on the position of the Moroccan Jews. Already branded by their clothing as unbelievers, they furthermore became objects of scorn and violent despotic caprice from which there was no escape.\n\nAn account by Solomon Cohen dated January 1148 CE describes the Almohad conquests:\n<blockquote>\"Abd al-Mumin ... the leader of the Almohads after the death of Muhammad Ibn Tumart the Mahdi ... captured Tlemcen [in the Maghreb] and killed all those who were in it, including the Jews, except those who embraced Islam. ... [In Sijilmasa] One hundred and fifty persons were killed for clinging to their [Jewish] faith. ... One hundred thousand persons were killed in Fez on that occasion, and 120,000 in Marrakesh. The Jews in all [Maghreb] localities [conquered] ... groaned under the heavy yoke of the Almohads; many had been killed, many others converted; none were able to appear in public as Jews.\"<ref>{{harvp|Hirschberg|1974|pp=127\u2013128}}.

They were able to re-establish their lives and communities, returning to some sense of normalcy and security. They also established strong vertical relations with the Marinid sultans.<ref>Bernard Lewis, The Jews of Islam, (Princeton University Press, 1984), 151.</ref> When the still-fanatic mobs attacked them in 1275, the Merinid sultan [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq]] intervened personally to save them. The sovereigns of this dynasty benevolently received the Jewish ambassadors of the Christian kings of Spain and admitted Jews among their closest courtiers. Of these Jews, Khalifa b. Waqq\u0101sa (Ruqqasa) became steward of the household of the sultan [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf an-Nasr]] and his intimate counselor. A victim of palace intrigues, he was put to death in 1302. His nephew, who was also named Khalifa, held the same office and suffered the same fate (1310). However, there were no repercussions against the Moroccan Jews as a result of the execution of their powerful coreligionists. They were the principal factors in the prosperity of the country. The Sahara gold trade, which was of primary importance, and the exchange with the Christian countries were completely under their control. Their relatives and associates in the kingdom of Aragon financed, when necessary, the navies which defended the Moroccan ports. In addition to the jizya (tax paid by non-Muslims), they paid enormous sums to the treasury in customs duties for their imports and exports. In the outlying areas, particularly in the Atlas region where there were large concentrations of Jews of early origin, the Jews wielded great influence in both the political and spiritual domains. Jewish physicians enjoyed well-deserved renown. The study of Kabbalah, as well as philosophy, was then in vogue. The last Moroccan philosopher of the Middle Ages was Judah b. Nissim ibn Malkah, who was still alive in 1365.\n\nThe last ruler of the Marinid dynasty, [[Abd al-Haqq II]], appointed many Jews to high positions. The appointment of Jews to high positions, such as vizier, angered many Muslims, as they viewed such increases in Jewish power as transgressing the dhimmi status. Abd al-Basit b. Khalil, a medieval Moroccan author, claims that Jews became arrogant with their newfound prestige, using their power to command Muslims. This is a clear disruption to the established social order. Once a rumor began to circulate that the Jewish vizier in Fez, Aaron Batash, struck a Muslim woman, there were public outcries amongst Fez\u2019s Muslim population. They demanded the Mufti (Islamic legal expert) to issue a Fatwa (legal opinion) to permit the killing of Jews in the name of the Allah. The Mufti had no choice but to make these killings permissible. Thus, began the 1465 Moroccan revolt, one of the worst pogroms in Morocco\u2019s history.<ref>Abd al-Basit b.

During the murderous scenes enacted in 1391 in [[Spain]], Spanish-controlled [[Seville]], and [[Majorca]], the [[Sephardi Jews]] of Spain seized the opportunity to emigrate to North Africa in order to escape persecution. A hundred years later, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I of Castile]] issued the [[Alhambra Decree]] - an edict ordering the expulsion of practicing Jews from Spain. Consequently, the Jews were driven from Spain in 1492, and later from Portugal in 1496 following a similar decree by [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I of Portugal]]. The sudden inroad of Jews into Morocco and the whole of North Africa was then repeated on a much larger scale.\n\nFollowing the 1465 Moroccan revolt under the Marinid dynasty, the native Jewish community in Morocco had shrunken substantially, having been massacred and marginalized. The Moroccan Jewry began to recover from the pogroms of 1465 under the [[Wattasid dynasty]], a ruling group of Zenata Berbers which had gained control during the fall of the Marinid in 1472. The Jewish community in Morocco then swelled with the waves of refugees arriving from Spain and Portugal after 1492, increasing the cultural and economic power of the Moroccan Jewish community considerably. Incoming Sephardi Jews tended to be economically better off than their native counterparts, bringing with them specific ideas of culture shaped by centuries of life on the Iberian Peninsula. As a result, the Sephardic scholarly mercantile elite were quick to dominate Jewish communal life in Morocco.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book|last=Stillman|first=Norman|publisher=The Jewish Publication Society|year=1998|isbn=978-0827601987|location=|pages=79\u201380}}</ref>[[File:\u0645\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062f\u0646\u0627\u0646 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Ibn Danan Synagogue]] in [[Fez, Morocco|Fes]].]]A number of natives from Fez fled to Spain over the course of the fifteenth century and returned to Fez following 1492, acting as a unique bridge between the native Jews of Morocco and the newly arrived Sephardim. Among this group, the most outstanding representatives were the Ibn Danan family. Fleeing from Fez in either 1438 or 1465, the Ibn Danans settled in [[Granada]] where Rabbi Moses Maimon Ibn Danan and his son Saadiah achieved fame as scholars. Saadiah returned to Fez after the Spanish expulsion and served as a spiritual guide for other exiles, whilst identifying himself with the native Jews. The Ibn Danan family was among the intellectual and financial elite of Fez for centuries, creating alliances across Sephardi families and maintaining a prominent synagogue in Fez.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jewish Society in Fez, 1450-1700: Studies in Communal and Economic Life|last=Gerber|first=Jane|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|year=1997|isbn=978-9004058200|location=|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Spanish Jewish refugees brought important changes in city life and within the preexisting Jewish community. Jewish life in the Muslim interior of Morocco became dominated by the Sephardic plutocracy that continued to maintain control of the Moroccan Jewry up until modern times. Each local community had a ''rigid'', or ''shaykh al-Yahud'', who was appointed by the government. The chief figure in the larger Jewish community was the ''Nagid'' of the capital, who was invariably a court Jew.<ref name=\":0\" /> Throughout the Moroccan Jewish community, there were famous Sephardic ''dayyanim'' such as the Ibn Danans whose authority was largely recognized by Jews within the whole country.<ref name=\"Beit Hatfutsot\" /><ref name=\"1492 demography\">{{cite journal|date=1973|journal=Proceedings of the World Congress of Jewish Studies|volume=2, DIVISION B|pages=31\u201344|jstor=23529108|title=\u05d4\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05d2\u05e8\u05e4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e4\u05d0\u05e1 \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e0\u05ea 1492 / The Demography of the Jewish Community of Fez After 1492|last1=Gerber|first1=Jane S.|last2=\u05d2'|first2=\u05d2\u05e8\u05d1\u05e8}}</ref> However, the influx of refugees also caused overcrowding in the larger cities of Morocco and aroused uneasiness among both the Muslims, who feared an increase in the price of necessities, and the Jews already settled there, who had hitherto barely succeeded in creating a livelihood in handicrafts and petty commerce.\n\nWhile many Spanish Jewish exiles to Morocco were able to successfully integrate into the larger community in part due to their relative wealth, the problem of poverty among exiles still left a significant number of Jewish refugees vulnerable.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11020-morocco#anchor7|title=Morocco|last=Jacobs|first=Joseph|last2=Schloessinger|first2=Max|website=JewishEncyclopedia.com|last3=Deutsch|first3=Gotthard|last4=Meakin|first4=Budgett}}</ref> Many died of hunger and some returned to Spain;<ref>Ibn Verga, \"Shebe\u1e6d Yehudah\", p. 226</ref> most fled to Fez, where new challenges awaited them.

The Wattasids also took in their service some Jewish artisans and technicians who possessed strategic military skills.

While still recognizing the Wattasids as Sultans until 1528, Saadian's growing power led the Wattasids to attack them and, after an indecisive battle, to recognize their rule over southern Morocco<ref name=\"Bagley_102\">{{harvp|Kissling|Spuler|Barbour|Trimingham|1997|p=102}}</ref> through the [[Treaty of Tadla]].\n\nTheir reign over Morocco began with the reign of [[Sultan]] [[Mohammed ash-Sheikh]] in 1554, when he vanquished the last [[Wattasids]] at the [[Battle of Tadla]]. The Saadian rule ended in 1659 with the end of the reign of Sultan [[Ahmad el Abbas]].\nWhen, in 1578, the young king Sebastian with almost his whole army met death, and Portugal saw the end of her glory, in the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir|Battle of Alcazarquivir]], the few nobles who remained were taken captive and sold to the Jews in Fez and Morocco.

As they consolidated their authority in the country, however, they gradually evinced greater toleration toward the Jewish minority. Like their Wattasid predecessors, the Sa'di sultans now employed Jews as physicians, diplomatic emissaries, and interpreters. Beginning in 1603, Abraham bin Wach and later Judah Levi served as ministers of the treasury. Members of the Jewish aristocratic Cabessa and [[Pallache family|Palache]] families were recruited by the sultan's court as agents and negotiators with European merchants who entered the country.

According to Ch\u00e9nier, when Al-Raschid took the city of [[Marrakech]] in 1670, at the desire of the inhabitants he caused the Jewish counselor and governor of the ruling prince Abu Bakr, together with the latter and his whole family, to be publicly burned, in order to inspire terror among the Jews.<ref>Ch\u00e9nier, \"Recherches Historiques sur les Maures et Histoire de l'Empire de Maroc\", ii. 351, Paris, 1787</ref> He also tore down the [[synagogue]]s of the city, expelled many Jews from the Berber region of Sus and treated them tyrannically. His demands on the Jews in the way of taxes were enormous; he had them collected by Joshua ben Hamoshet, a rich Jew, to whom he was under obligations for various services and whom he appointed chief over the Jews. He even ordered the Jews to supply wine to the [[Christians|Christian]] [[slavery|slave]]s.\n\nIn 1668 the Jewish community of Chaouya settled in Fez after Mulai Rashid attacked the town of Chaouya. They were given three days to leave and left with their rabbi Maimon Aflalo. They numbered around 1300 households and possessed great wealth. After they moved to Fez they were granted their own [[synagogue]] .<ref name=\"1492 demography\" />\n\nMoulay Rashid's successor was his brother [[Ismail of Morocco|Ismail]] (Moulay Ismail) (1672), one of the cruelest of tyrants. On his accession Ismail appointed his Jewish adviser [[Joseph Toledani]], son of [[Daniel Toledani]], Moulay Raschid's counselor, to be his minister, in which capacity Joseph concluded a peace between [[Morocco]] and [[Holland]]. Under Ismail's rule the ruined synagogues were rebuilt, although his taxes on Jews were oppressive. One day, he threatened to compel them to accept [[Islam]] if their [[Messiah]] did not come within a definite time. The Jews understood the hint and satisfied his pious zeal with a very large sum of money.<ref name=\"ch\u00e9nier2\">Ch\u00e9nier, \"The Present State of the Empire of Morocco\", i. 354, London, 1788; compare {{harvp|Jost|1828|pp=viii. 42 et seq.}}</ref> The Jews, who served as tax-collectors on the whole coast, used to give Ismail a golden riding-outfit as an annual \"present\"\u2014an inducement to keep them in office\u2014and a hen and a dozen chickens fashioned in gold as a tax payment for the whole Jewish community.<ref name=\"ch\u00e9nier3\">Ch\u00e9nier, \"Recherches Historiques sur les Maures et Histoire de l'Empire de Maroc\", i. 326</ref> Ismail had another way of securing money: for a certain sum he would sell to an aspirant for honors the position and wealth of one of his favorites. In one such transaction Maimaran, who was chief ruler over the Jews of the realm, feared a rival in Moses ibn 'Attar, and offered the sultan a certain sum for his head. Ismail then let Moses ibn 'Attar know how much had been offered for his head, whereupon Ibn 'Attar offered double the sum for the head of his opponent. The sultan took the money from both, called them fools, and reconciled them to each other, whereupon Ibn 'Attar married a daughter of Maimaran and shared with his father-in-law reign over the Jews. The same Moses ibn 'Attar was Moorish plenipotentiary in the making of a compact with Great Britain in 1721.\n\nAfter 1700 Fez no longer attracted as many Jews as in the previous centuries, while others still continued to arrive, other retained residence in Fez, while spend their time elsewhere.<ref name=\"1492 demography\" />\n\nIn 1703 a controversy happened between the Jews of Chaouya residing in Fez to the rest of the Jewish community. They demanded from their communal leaders that the governmental taxes will be assessed for them separately.

Those two events, did not passed on eventually.<ref name=\"1492 demography\" />\n\nThe two communities, those who came from Spain (megorashim) and the locals, finally melded together.  [[Arabic]] was the main language, while unique Spanish rituals were kept and practiced. The number of the community members fluctuated through the following years. There were times of relative peace and times of epidemics and different crises. For example, in 1723 an extended drought transformed the [[mellah]] into a ghost town as many Jews escaped and abandoned the area. \"The houses of the rich are empty, their inhabitants have disappeared, the gates of the courtyards are closed, weeds grow up and robbers enter, stealing the doors and the beds.

As a punishment the richer Jews of [[Tetouan]], at his entry into the city, were tied to the tails of horses and dragged through the city. Many were killed in other ways or robbed. Jewish women were raped. The Spanish consul, Solomon Hazzan, was executed for alleged treachery, and the Jews of [[Tangier]], [[Asilah]], and Alcazarquivir were condemned to pay a large sum of money. Elijah, the minister of the former king, who had always opposed Yazid in the council, quickly embraced [[Islam]] to avoid being persecuted.  He died soon after. The cruelty of the persecutors reached its climax in Fez. In [[Rabat]], as in [[Meknes]], the Jews were ill-treated. In [[Mogador]], strife arose between the Jews and the city judge on the one hand, and the Moorish citizens on the other; the dispute was over the question of Jewish garb. Finally the Jews were ordered to pay 100,000 piasters and three shiploads of gunpowder; and most of them were arrested and beaten daily until the payment was made. Many fled beforehand to [[Gibraltar]] or other places; some died as [[martyr]]s; and some accepted Islam.<ref>{{harvp|Jost|1828|pp=44 et seq.}}</ref> The notables and the Muslim masses then rose to intervene on behalf of the Jews.

J.\" xxxvii. 120 et seq.</ref>\n\nFrom the second half of this century various accounts of travels exist which give information concerning the external position of the Jews. Ch\u00e9nier, for example, describes them as follows:\n<blockquote>\"The Jews possess neither lands nor gardens, nor can they enjoy their fruits in tranquillity. They must wear only black, and are obliged when they pass near [[mosque]]s, or through streets in which there are sanctuaries, to walk barefoot. The lowest among the [[Moors]] imagines he has a right to ill-treat a Jew, nor dares the latter defend himself, because the [[Koran]] and the judge are always in favor of the Mohammedan. Notwithstanding this state of oppression, the Jews have many advantages over the Moors: they better understand the spirit of trade; they act as agents and brokers, and they profit by their own cunning and by the ignorance of the Moors. In their commercial bargains many of them buy up the commodities of the country to sell again. Some have European correspondents; others are mechanics, such as goldsmiths, tailors, gunsmiths, millers, and masons. More industrious and artful, and better informed than the Moors, the Jews are employed by the emperor in receiving the customs, in coining money, and in all affairs and intercourse which the monarch has with the European merchants, as well as in all his negotiations with the various European governments.\"<ref>Ch\u00e9nier, \"The Present State of the Empire of Morocco\", i. 157</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Berber Jews.jpg|thumb|left|[[Berber Jews]] of the [[Atlas Mountains]], c. 1900.]]\nThere were, indeed, quite a number of such Jewish officials, negotiators, treasurers, councilors, and administrators at the Moroccan court, whom the European is inclined to call \"ministers\", but whom in reality the ruler used merely as intermediaries in extorting money from the people, and dismissed as soon as their usefulness in this direction was at an end. They were especially [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], the [[megorashim]], whose wealth, education, and statesmanship paved their way to the court here, as formerly in Spain. One of the first of such ministers was Shumel al-Barensi, at the beginning of the 16th century in Fez, who opened the \"state career\" to a long succession of coreligionists ending in the 19th century with [[Masado ben Leaho]], prime minister and representative councilor of the emperor in foreign affairs. It would be erroneous to suppose that these Jewish dignitaries of the state succeeded in raising the position and the influence of their fellow believers, or that they even attempted to do so. They were usually very glad if they themselves were able to remain in office to the end of their lives.\n\nMoroccan Jews were employed also as [[ambassador]]s to foreign courts. At the beginning of the 17th century Pacheco in the Netherlands; [[Shumel al-Farrashi]] at the same place in 1610; after 1675 [[Joseph Toledani]], who, as stated above, concluded peace with [[Holland]]; his son Hayyim in England in 1750; a Jew in Denmark. In 1780 [[Jacob ben Abraham Benider]] was sent as minister from Morocco to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]; in 1794 a Jew named Sumbal and in 1828 [[Me\u00efr Cohen Macnin]] were sent as Moroccan ambassadors to the English court.<ref>Picciotti, \"Sketches of Anglo-Jewish History\" p. 173, London, 1875</ref><ref>Meakin, \"The Moors\", London, 1902</ref>\n\nAnother event caused to a population decrease among the community was the two-year exile of the Jews from the mellah in 1790\u20131792, during the brief reign of sultan Malawy yazid . The whole community was forced to leave to Qasba Shrarda which was on the other side of Fez. This time the population of the Jews around the mellah was at the lowest stage of all time, and did not manage to \"heal\" itself. A [[mosque]] was built on the site of the main synagogue, under the order of yazid, tomb stones from a near Jewish cemetery was used to built the mosque, and the cemetery itself was moved to the entrance of the Muslim quarter along with the bones of the saintly rabbis.  The exile lasted around for two years, and only after the death of yazid, the [[qadi]] of Fez ordered the mosque to be torn down and the Jews were permitted to return to their quarter.<ref name=\"Beit Hatfutsot\" /><ref name=\"Virtual Jewish World\" /><ref name=\"The Jewish Quarter of Fez\" />\n\n===In the 19th century===\n[[File:J\u00fcdische Hochzeit in Marokko-1024.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish Wedding in Morocco by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], 1839, [[Louvre]], Paris]]\n[[File:F\u00eate juive \u00e0 T\u00e9touan, Alfred Dehodencq, 1865.jpg|thumb|Jewish Festival in [[T\u00e9touan|Tetuan]], [[Alfred Dehodencq]], 1865, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Paris Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\n[[File:Yeshiva morocco.jpg|thumb|right|''The reading of the bible by the rabbis'', [[Jean-Jules-Antoine Lecomte du Nou\u00ff|Lecomte de Nou\u00ff]], 1882]]\n\nThe 19th century, which brought emancipation to the Jews of many countries, failed to fundamentally alter the status of Moroccan Jews, but produced new divisions among them and entailed new sources of trouble.

This included a transformation of many Moroccan Jews' gender and sexual norms.

Two others had already been executed at the instigation of the Spanish [[consul]]; one of them publicly in [[Tangier]], the other in Safi. Sir Moses, supported by the British government, undertook a journey to Morocco to demand the liberation of the imprisoned Jews and, as he said in a letter to the sultan, to move the latter \"to give the most positive orders that Jews and Christians, dwelling in all parts of Your Majesty's dominions, shall be perfectly protected, and that no person shall molest them in any manner whatsoever in anything which concerns their safety and tranquillity; and that they may be placed in the enjoyment of the same advantages as all other subjects of Your Majesty.\" Montefiore was successful in both attempts.<ref>{{harvp|Parfitt|2000}}</ref>\n\nThe prisoners were liberated, and on February 15, 1864, the sultan published an edict granting equal rights of justice to the Jews.<ref>Diaries of Sir Moses and Lady Montefiore\", ii. 145 et seq., London, 1890; see also the account of the journey by Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, the physician who accompanied Montefiore, entitled \"Narrative of a Journey to Morocco\", London, 1866</ref> This edict of emancipation was confirmed by [[Mohammed IV of Morocco|Mohammed IV]]'s son and successor, [[Hassan I of Morocco|Moulay Hasan I]], on his accession to the throne 1873 and again on September 18, 1880, after the [[Conference of Madrid]].\n\nPro-Jewish reforms were often not executed by local magistrates in the fragmented sultanate, however, and even if they were they reignited animosity toward the Jewish population.

In 1948\u20139, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel.  After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year.  Through the early 1950s, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as a valuable source of labor for the Jewish State. From 1948 on many Jews left Fes. Most emigrated to Israel while others went to France and Canada.

Jews occupied several political positions, including three Members of the [[Parliament of Morocco]] and a Minister of Posts and Telegraphs.  However, emigration to Israel jumped from 8,171 in 1954 to 24,994 in 1955, increasing further in 1956.

By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\n\nThe [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide including in Morocco. By 1971, its Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this new wave of emigration went to Europe and North America rather than Israel. France for a time was a destination particularly for Moroccan Jews with European educations, who had economic opportunities there; one study of Moroccan Jewish brothers, one of whom settled in France and the other in Israel, showed that 28 percent of the brothers who settled in France became managers, businessmen or professionals (compared to 13 percent of their Israeli brothers) and only 4 percent unskilled workers (compared to over a third of their Israeli brothers).<ref>Michael Inbar and Chaim Adler, ''Ethnic Integration in Israel: A Comparative Study of Moroccan Brothers Who Settled in France and in Israel'', New Brunswick: Transaction, 1977, 35-36, 45</ref> Moroccan Jews in Israel, far more numerous, enjoyed less upward mobility: 51 percent were blue-collar in 1961 and 54 percent as late as 1981.<ref>Eliezer Ben-Rafael and Stephen Sharot, ''Ethnicity, REligion, and Class in Israeli Society'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991, 67</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nDespite their current small numbers, Jews continue to play a notable role in Morocco. The [[King of Morocco|King]] retains a Jewish senior adviser, [[Andr\u00e9 Azoulay]].  They are well represented in business and even a small number in politics and culture.

Its [[yeshivot]] (religious schools) attracted brilliant scholars, poets and grammarians. This period was marred by a pogrom in 1033, which is described by the [[Jewish Virtual Library]] as an isolated event primarily due to political conflict between the [[Maghrawa]] and  [[Ifrenid]] tribes.<ref name=\"Virtual Jewish World\">{{cite web|title=Virtual Jewish World: Fez, Morocco|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Fez.html|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=The Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Under the Almoravids===\nThe [[Almoravids]] (Arab. Al-Mur\u0101bi\u1e6d\u016bn; \"Warrior-Monks\"), confederation of [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes of the Sanhajah group who lived in the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[Sahara]] [[Desert]]. Their religious fervor and fighting capabilities enabled them to establish a formidable empire in the [[Morocco]] and [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Spain]] in the 11th and 12th centuries. Their theological Islamic zeal is attributed to Yahya ibn Ibrahim, their spiritual leader, as well as to the 'alim (religious scholar) 'Abd Allah ibn Yasin. Imbued with Islamic zeal, the Almoravids conquered Morocco and major sections of western Algeria between 1054 and 1092. In 1062 they turned [[Marrakesh]] into their base of operations and religious capital. Thenceforth, their main leaders embraced the title of Amir al-Muslimin (\"commander of the Muslims\") but nevertheless continued to recognize the legitimacy of a still higher authority in Islam: the Abbasid caliph in Iraq upon whom the title Amir al-Mu'min\u012bn (\"commander of the faithful\") had been bestowed. It was toward the end of the 11th century that the Castilian Christians who held on to parts of Spain began challenging the authority of the Almoravids and encroaching on their territories. The Almoravid leadership succeeded in temporarily repulsing the Christians and foiling their plans to conquer such key cities as [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].\n\nWith the exception of [[Valencia]], Muslim Spain remained under Almoravid control. Notwithstanding, perhaps the weakest aspect of Almoravid rule in Spain and the Maghreb is the fact that they were a Muslim Berber minority in charge of a Spanish-Arab empire. With the passage of time, they found it increasingly difficult to protect all their territorial possessions from the Christian reconquest, especially in the aftermath of the fall of Saragossa in 1118. Moreover, in 1125 the [[Almohads]] (those who advocated the \"Unity of Allah\"), a confederation of rival Berber tribes, began to rebel against them in the Atlas Mountains. Following a protracted struggle and relentless fighting, the Almohads defeated the Almoravids in 1147; they transformed [[Marrakesh]] into their own capital and extended their authority into Muslim Spain.\n\nThe position of the Jews under Almoravid domination was apparently free of major abuses, though there are reports of increasing social hostility against them \u2013 particularly in Fes.<ref>Norman Roth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bHh5plYLhHEC&pg=PA113&lpg=PA113&dq=almoravids+jews&source=bl&ots=dt-Wts_TKr&sig=Pr-FYcCPk7c9VMAHTVXN_m2CZDE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=98TYUem-LIfTtAa0zYDgCA&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg Jews, Visigoths, and Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict], Brill, 1994, pp.113-116.</ref> Unlike the problems encountered by the Jews during the rule of the [[Almohads]] (the Almoravids' successor dynasty), there are not many factual complaints of excesses, coercion, or malice on the part of the authorities toward the Jewish communities. It is known, however, that [[Yusuf Ibn Tashfin]] forbade Jews living in the capital city [[Marrakesh]]. It was allowed for them to trade there, but if a Jew was caught in the city during night hours it was punishable by death.<ref>M.J. Viguera. \"Almoravids.\" ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World''. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2014.</ref>\n\nUnder the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under [[Ali ibn Yusuf|Ali III]], than under his father [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]]). Among those who held the title of \"vizier\" ({{Lang|ar|\u0648\u0632\u064a\u0631}}) or \"nasih\" ({{Lang|ar|\u0646\u0627\u0635\u062d}}) in Almoravid times were the poet and physician [[Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu'allam]], [[Abraham ibn Me\u00efr ibn Kamnial]], [[Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar]], and [[Solomon ibn Farusal]].\n\n===Under the Almohads (1146-15th century)===\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Population}}\nThe tolerance of the jizya (the tax demanded of dhimmis) paying Jews and Christians in the cities of Morocco came to an end under the intolerant dynasty of the stern Almohades, who came into power in 1146. Here, as in other parts of North Africa, many Jews who shrank from emigrating pretended to embrace [[Islam]]. For example, names such as Benchekroun (initially Chokron or Choukroun or Chekroun depending on the pronunciation), El Kohen, and Kabbaj were Jewish in origin. [[Maimonides]], who was staying in Fez with his father, is said to have written to the communities to comfort and encourage his brethren and fellow believers in this time of oppression <ref>(see Ibn Verga \"Shebe? Yehudah\", ed. Wiener, p. 50</ref> In the above-mentioned elegy of [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], which appears to have been written at the commencement of the period of the [[Almohads]], and which is found in a Yemen siddur among the kinot prescribed for the Ninth of Ab, the Moroccan cities [[Ceuta]], [[Meknes]], the [[Draa River]] valley, Fez, and [[Segelmesa]] are especially emphasized as being exposed to great persecution. [[Joseph ha-Kohen]]<ref>(see Ibn Verga Eme? ha-Baka\", ed. Wiener, p. 20</ref> relates that no remnant of Israel was left from [[Tangier]] to Mehdia. Moreover, the later Almohads were no longer content with the repetition of a mere formula of belief in the unity of God and in the prophetic calling of [[Muhammad]]. [[Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur]], the third Almohad prince, suspecting the sincerity of the supposedly converted Jews, compelled them to wear distinguishing garments, with a very noticeable [[Yellow badge|yellow cloth]] for a head-covering; from that time forward the clothing of the Jews formed an important subject in the legal regulations concerning them. The reign of the Almohads on the whole exercised a most disastrous and enduring influence on the position of the Moroccan Jews. Already branded by their clothing as unbelievers, they furthermore became objects of scorn and violent despotic caprice from which there was no escape.\n\nAn account by Solomon Cohen dated January 1148 CE describes the Almohad conquests:\n<blockquote>\"Abd al-Mumin ... the leader of the Almohads after the death of Muhammad Ibn Tumart the Mahdi ... captured Tlemcen [in the Maghreb] and killed all those who were in it, including the Jews, except those who embraced Islam. ... [In Sijilmasa] One hundred and fifty persons were killed for clinging to their [Jewish] faith. ... One hundred thousand persons were killed in Fez on that occasion, and 120,000 in Marrakesh. The Jews in all [Maghreb] localities [conquered] ... groaned under the heavy yoke of the Almohads; many had been killed, many others converted; none were able to appear in public as Jews.\"<ref>{{harvp|Hirschberg|1974|pp=127\u2013128}}. Solomon Cohen's account comports with Arab historian Ibn Baydhaq's sequence of events. Citing from ''The Legacy of Jihad: Islamic Holy War and the Fate of Non-Muslims''by Andrew G Bostom, ed.

When the still-fanatic mobs attacked them in 1275, the Merinid sultan [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq]] intervened personally to save them. The sovereigns of this dynasty benevolently received the Jewish ambassadors of the Christian kings of Spain and admitted Jews among their closest courtiers. Of these Jews, Khalifa b. Waqq\u0101sa (Ruqqasa) became steward of the household of the sultan [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf an-Nasr]] and his intimate counselor. A victim of palace intrigues, he was put to death in 1302. His nephew, who was also named Khalifa, held the same office and suffered the same fate (1310). However, there were no repercussions against the Moroccan Jews as a result of the execution of their powerful coreligionists. They were the principal factors in the prosperity of the country. The Sahara gold trade, which was of primary importance, and the exchange with the Christian countries were completely under their control. Their relatives and associates in the kingdom of Aragon financed, when necessary, the navies which defended the Moroccan ports. In addition to the jizya (tax paid by non-Muslims), they paid enormous sums to the treasury in customs duties for their imports and exports. In the outlying areas, particularly in the Atlas region where there were large concentrations of Jews of early origin, the Jews wielded great influence in both the political and spiritual domains. Jewish physicians enjoyed well-deserved renown. The study of Kabbalah, as well as philosophy, was then in vogue. The last Moroccan philosopher of the Middle Ages was Judah b. Nissim ibn Malkah, who was still alive in 1365.\n\nThe last ruler of the Marinid dynasty, [[Abd al-Haqq II]], appointed many Jews to high positions. This angered many Muslims and was one of the main causes for the [[1465 Moroccan revolt]], in which the entire Jewish community of [[Fez]] was massacred.<ref>Maya Shatzmiller, \"The Berbers And The Islamic State:The Marinid Experience In Pre-Protectorate Morocco\", Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 2000, p. 67.</ref>\n\n===The Spanish Expulsion of the Jews===\n[[File:Charles Landelle-Juive de Tanger.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish woman from [[Tangier]] (1874)]]\nBy 1249, the Spanish ''[[Reconquista]]'' had concluded its main phase. During the murderous scenes enacted in 1391 in [[Spain]], Spanish-controlled [[Seville]], and [[Majorca]], the [[Sephardi Jews]] of Spain seized the opportunity to emigrate to North Africa in order to escape persecution. A hundred years later, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I of Castile]] issued the [[Alhambra Decree]] - an edict ordering the expulsion of practicing Jews from Spain. Consequently, the Jews were driven from Spain in 1492, and later from Portugal in 1496 following a similar decree by [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I of Portugal]]. The sudden inroad of Jews into Morocco and the whole of North Africa was then repeated on a much larger scale.\n\nFollowing the 1465 Moroccan revolt under the Marinid dynasty, the native Jewish community in Morocco had shrunken substantially, having been massacred and marginalized. The Moroccan Jewry began to recover from the pogroms of 1465 under the [[Wattasid dynasty]], a ruling group of Zenata Berbers which had gained control during the fall of the Marinid in 1472. The Jewish community in Morocco then swelled with the waves of refugees arriving from Spain and Portugal after 1492, increasing the cultural and economic power of the Moroccan Jewish community considerably. Incoming Sephardi Jews tended to be economically better off than their native counterparts, bringing with them specific ideas of culture shaped by centuries of life on the Iberian Peninsula. As a result, the Sephardic scholarly mercantile elite were quick to dominate Jewish communal life in Morocco.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book|last=Stillman|first=Norman|publisher=The Jewish Publication Society|year=1998|isbn=978-0827601987|location=|pages=79\u201380}}</ref>[[File:\u0645\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062f\u0646\u0627\u0646 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Ibn Danan Synagogue]] in [[Fez, Morocco|Fes]].]]A number of natives from Fez fled to Spain over the course of the fifteenth century and returned to Fez following 1492, acting as a unique bridge between the native Jews of Morocco and the newly arrived Sephardim. Among this group, the most outstanding representatives were the Ibn Danan family. Fleeing from Fez in either 1438 or 1465, the Ibn Danans settled in [[Granada]] where Rabbi Moses Maimon Ibn Danan and his son Saadiah achieved fame as scholars. Saadiah returned to Fez after the Spanish expulsion and served as a spiritual guide for other exiles, whilst identifying himself with the native Jews. The Ibn Danan family was among the intellectual and financial elite of Fez for centuries, creating alliances across Sephardi families and maintaining a prominent synagogue in Fez.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jewish Society in Fez, 1450-1700: Studies in Communal and Economic Life|last=Gerber|first=Jane|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|year=1997|isbn=978-9004058200|location=|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Spanish Jewish refugees brought important changes in city life and within the preexisting Jewish community. Jewish life in the Muslim interior of Morocco became dominated by the Sephardic plutocracy that continued to maintain control of the Moroccan Jewry up until modern times. Each local community had a ''rigid'', or ''shaykh al-Yahud'', who was appointed by the government. The chief figure in the larger Jewish community was the ''Nagid'' of the capital, who was invariably a court Jew.<ref name=\":0\" /> Throughout the Moroccan Jewish community, there were famous Sephardic ''dayyanim'' such as the Ibn Danans whose authority was largely recognized by Jews within the whole country.<ref name=\"Beit Hatfutsot\" /><ref name=\"1492 demography\">{{cite journal|date=1973|journal=Proceedings of the World Congress of Jewish Studies|volume=2, DIVISION B|pages=31\u201344|jstor=23529108|title=\u05d4\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05d2\u05e8\u05e4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e4\u05d0\u05e1 \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e0\u05ea 1492 / The Demography of the Jewish Community of Fez After 1492|last1=Gerber|first1=Jane S.|last2=\u05d2'|first2=\u05d2\u05e8\u05d1\u05e8}}</ref> However, the influx of refugees also caused overcrowding in the larger cities of Morocco and aroused uneasiness among both the Muslims, who feared an increase in the price of necessities, and the Jews already settled there, who had hitherto barely succeeded in creating a livelihood in handicrafts and petty commerce.\n\nWhile many Spanish Jewish exiles to Morocco were able to successfully integrate into the larger community in part due to their relative wealth, the problem of poverty among exiles still left a significant number of Jewish refugees vulnerable.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11020-morocco#anchor7|title=Morocco|last=Jacobs|first=Joseph|last2=Schloessinger|first2=Max|website=JewishEncyclopedia.com|last3=Deutsch|first3=Gotthard|last4=Meakin|first4=Budgett}}</ref> Many died of hunger and some returned to Spain;<ref>Ibn Verga, \"Shebe\u1e6d Yehudah\", p. 226</ref> most fled to Fez, where new challenges awaited them.

In response to this, King Manuel I issued a number of ordinances in 1499 forbidding the emigration of New Christians without explicit royal permission. Nevertheless, with monetary and transportive aid from figures already established in the Jewish diaspora, many New Christians succeeded in immigrating to North Africa.<ref>{{harvp|Kayserling|1865|pp=143 et seq.}}</ref>\n\nA new group of New Christians came to Morocco through the establishment of the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition in Portugal]] under [[Pope Paul III]] in 1536.<ref>{{harvp|Kayserling|1865|p=217}}</ref> In 1508, Portugal had come to occupy parts of Morocco, succeeding in conquering the old seaport town of [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]], which had a large number of Jewish inhabitants and had subsequently become an important commercial center.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvp|Kayserling|1865|pp=155 et seq.}}</ref> In 1510, Safi was besieged by a large [[Moors|Moorish]] army.

Men such as Rabbi Abraham b. Zamiro of Safi, and Jacob Rosales and Jacob Rute of Fez, were as much agents of Portugal as Morocco. The Wattasids also took in their service some Jewish artisans and technicians who possessed strategic military skills. These men were employed in much the same spirit as Christian mercenaries, and were generally not considered to be government officials with any administrative authority over Muslims.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Under Saadi dynasty===\nThe [[Saadi dynasty]] or '''Saadian dynasty''' was a dynasty of [[Arab]] descent that ruled Morocco from 1554 to 1659.\n\nFrom 1509 to 1554 they had ruled only in the south of [[Morocco]]. While still recognizing the Wattasids as Sultans until 1528, Saadian's growing power led the Wattasids to attack them and, after an indecisive battle, to recognize their rule over southern Morocco<ref name=\"Bagley_102\">{{harvp|Kissling|Spuler|Barbour|Trimingham|1997|p=102}}</ref> through the [[Treaty of Tadla]].\n\nTheir reign over Morocco began with the reign of [[Sultan]] [[Mohammed ash-Sheikh]] in 1554, when he vanquished the last [[Wattasids]] at the [[Battle of Tadla]]. The Saadian rule ended in 1659 with the end of the reign of Sultan [[Ahmad el Abbas]].\nWhen, in 1578, the young king Sebastian with almost his whole army met death, and Portugal saw the end of her glory, in the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir|Battle of Alcazarquivir]], the few nobles who remained were taken captive and sold to the Jews in Fez and Morocco. The Jews received the Portuguese knights, their former countrymen, into their houses very hospitably and let many of them go free on the promise that they would send back their ransom from Portugal.<ref>{{harvp|Kissling|Spuler|Barbour|Trimingham|1997|p=260}}</ref>\n\n[[Samuel Pallache]] of the Sephardi [[Pallache family]], having earned the confidence of [[Zaydan An-Nasser]], had a significant role in [[Morocco\u2013Netherlands relations]], serving as the interpreter for his embassador [[Hammu ben Bashir]] in a journey to the [[Dutch Republic]], then again with [[Ahmad ben Abdallah al-Hayti al-Maruni]], which led to the signing of the [[Dutch-Moroccan Treaty of Friendship and Free Commerce]] in 1611.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/man-three-worlds|title=A Man of Three Worlds {{!}} Johns Hopkins University Press Books|website=jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nNumerous newly immigrated Jews, whose descendants faithfully adhere to the use of their Spanish dialects, [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] and [[Haketia]] to the present day and who surpass older Jewish Moroccans in education and intellectual achievement, subsequently become prominent in Moroccan history. With their skill in European commerce, arts, and handicrafts, hitherto largely unknown to the [[Moors]], and with their wealth, Jews have contributed conspicuously to the rise and development of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] since its beginning in 1666.<ref>See G. B. Ramusio in [[Leo Africanus]], \"The History and Description of Africa\", ed. R. Brown, iii. 1004, London, 1896</ref>\nAt first the Sa'dis appeared to be fanatical religious zealots who were intolerant of non-Muslims. They imposed heavy taxes on the local Jewish community. As they consolidated their authority in the country, however, they gradually evinced greater toleration toward the Jewish minority. Like their Wattasid predecessors, the Sa'di sultans now employed Jews as physicians, diplomatic emissaries, and interpreters. Beginning in 1603, Abraham bin Wach and later Judah Levi served as ministers of the treasury. Members of the Jewish aristocratic Cabessa and [[Pallache family|Palache]] families were recruited by the sultan's court as agents and negotiators with European merchants who entered the country. Whereas the authorities increasingly proved to be friendly toward the Jews, the same could hardly be said of the Muslim masses as well as local urban and rural chieftains and governors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_17267.html|title=Sa'dis|author=|date=|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Under Moulay Rashid and Moulay Ismail===\n[[File:Moroccan Kabbalah.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] charm against scorpions from Morocco.]]\nThe Jews suffered much during the great conquests of [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay Rashid]], who united the separate parts of Morocco into one single state, and wished to add to it all northwest Africa. According to Ch\u00e9nier, when Al-Raschid took the city of [[Marrakech]] in 1670, at the desire of the inhabitants he caused the Jewish counselor and governor of the ruling prince Abu Bakr, together with the latter and his whole family, to be publicly burned, in order to inspire terror among the Jews.<ref>Ch\u00e9nier, \"Recherches Historiques sur les Maures et Histoire de l'Empire de Maroc\", ii. 351, Paris, 1787</ref> He also tore down the [[synagogue]]s of the city, expelled many Jews from the Berber region of Sus and treated them tyrannically. His demands on the Jews in the way of taxes were enormous; he had them collected by Joshua ben Hamoshet, a rich Jew, to whom he was under obligations for various services and whom he appointed chief over the Jews. He even ordered the Jews to supply wine to the [[Christians|Christian]] [[slavery|slave]]s.\n\nIn 1668 the Jewish community of Chaouya settled in Fez after Mulai Rashid attacked the town of Chaouya. They were given three days to leave and left with their rabbi Maimon Aflalo. They numbered around 1300 households and possessed great wealth. After they moved to Fez they were granted their own [[synagogue]] .<ref name=\"1492 demography\" />\n\nMoulay Rashid's successor was his brother [[Ismail of Morocco|Ismail]] (Moulay Ismail) (1672), one of the cruelest of tyrants. On his accession Ismail appointed his Jewish adviser [[Joseph Toledani]], son of [[Daniel Toledani]], Moulay Raschid's counselor, to be his minister, in which capacity Joseph concluded a peace between [[Morocco]] and [[Holland]]. Under Ismail's rule the ruined synagogues were rebuilt, although his taxes on Jews were oppressive. One day, he threatened to compel them to accept [[Islam]] if their [[Messiah]] did not come within a definite time. The Jews understood the hint and satisfied his pious zeal with a very large sum of money.<ref name=\"ch\u00e9nier2\">Ch\u00e9nier, \"The Present State of the Empire of Morocco\", i. 354, London, 1788; compare {{harvp|Jost|1828|pp=viii. 42 et seq.}}</ref> The Jews, who served as tax-collectors on the whole coast, used to give Ismail a golden riding-outfit as an annual \"present\"\u2014an inducement to keep them in office\u2014and a hen and a dozen chickens fashioned in gold as a tax payment for the whole Jewish community.<ref name=\"ch\u00e9nier3\">Ch\u00e9nier, \"Recherches Historiques sur les Maures et Histoire de l'Empire de Maroc\", i. 326</ref> Ismail had another way of securing money: for a certain sum he would sell to an aspirant for honors the position and wealth of one of his favorites. In one such transaction Maimaran, who was chief ruler over the Jews of the realm, feared a rival in Moses ibn 'Attar, and offered the sultan a certain sum for his head. Ismail then let Moses ibn 'Attar know how much had been offered for his head, whereupon Ibn 'Attar offered double the sum for the head of his opponent. The sultan took the money from both, called them fools, and reconciled them to each other, whereupon Ibn 'Attar married a daughter of Maimaran and shared with his father-in-law reign over the Jews. The same Moses ibn 'Attar was Moorish plenipotentiary in the making of a compact with Great Britain in 1721.\n\nAfter 1700 Fez no longer attracted as many Jews as in the previous centuries, while others still continued to arrive, other retained residence in Fez, while spend their time elsewhere.<ref name=\"1492 demography\" />\n\nIn 1703 a controversy happened between the Jews of Chaouya residing in Fez to the rest of the Jewish community. They demanded from their communal leaders that the governmental taxes will be assessed for them separately. Furthermore, they had a bad relations with the rest of the community, and tried to form separate agreements with the government. Those two events, did not passed on eventually.<ref name=\"1492 demography\" />\n\nThe two communities, those who came from Spain (megorashim) and the locals, finally melded together.  [[Arabic]] was the main language, while unique Spanish rituals were kept and practiced. The number of the community members fluctuated through the following years. There were times of relative peace and times of epidemics and different crises. For example, in 1723 an extended drought transformed the [[mellah]] into a ghost town as many Jews escaped and abandoned the area. \"The houses of the rich are empty, their inhabitants have disappeared, the gates of the courtyards are closed, weeds grow up and robbers enter, stealing the doors and the beds. Many houses have been demolished, their stones and rafters taken away.... Most of the streets of the mellah are deserted.\" Hunger took the lives of more than 2000 people and 1,000 more converted from Judaism.<ref name=\"The Jewish Quarter of Fez\">{{cite journal|date=September 2001|title=Inscribing Minority Space in the Islamic City: The Jewish Quarter of Fez (1438-1912)|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=60|issue=3|pages=310\u2013327|jstor=991758|last1=Miller|first1=Susan Gilson|last2=Petruccioli|first2=Attilio|last3=Bertagnin|first3=Mauro|doi=10.2307/991758}}</ref><ref name=\"1492 demography\" />\n\n===In the 18th century===\n[[File:Jews of Fez.jpg|thumb|Jews of Fez, c. 1900.]]\n[[File:A Jewish house in Mogador by Darondeau 1807 1841.jpg|thumb|upright|A Jewish house in [[Mogador]], by [[Darondeau]] (1807\u20131841).]]\nThe condition of the Jewish community was unchanged under [[Mohammed III of Morocco|Mohammed III]] (1757\u201389), who distinguished himself by his attempt to introduce European culture into his kingdom. His eldest son, Moulay Ali, governor of Fez, courageously opposed his father's suggestion to impose a tax upon that city in favor of his other brothers, which tax was to be paid by the Jewish community. He stated that the Jews of Fez were already so poor that they were unable to bear the present tax and that he was not willing to increase still further their misery.<ref>Ch\u00e9nier, \"The Present State of the Empire of Morocco\", i. 341</ref> His minister was the Jew [[Elijah ha-Levi]], who had at one time fallen into disgrace and had been given as a [[slavery|slave]] to a smuggler of [[Tunis]], but had been restored to favor.<ref>{{harvp|Jost|1828|p=45}}</ref> The accession to the throne of [[Yazid of Morocco|Yazid]], on the death of Mohammed III in 1789, led to a terrible massacre of the Moroccan Jews, having refused him their support in his fight with his brother for the succession. As a punishment the richer Jews of [[Tetouan]], at his entry into the city, were tied to the tails of horses and dragged through the city. Many were killed in other ways or robbed. Jewish women were raped. The Spanish consul, Solomon Hazzan, was executed for alleged treachery, and the Jews of [[Tangier]], [[Asilah]], and Alcazarquivir were condemned to pay a large sum of money. Elijah, the minister of the former king, who had always opposed Yazid in the council, quickly embraced [[Islam]] to avoid being persecuted.  He died soon after. The cruelty of the persecutors reached its climax in Fez. In [[Rabat]], as in [[Meknes]], the Jews were ill-treated. In [[Mogador]], strife arose between the Jews and the city judge on the one hand, and the Moorish citizens on the other; the dispute was over the question of Jewish garb. Finally the Jews were ordered to pay 100,000 piasters and three shiploads of gunpowder; and most of them were arrested and beaten daily until the payment was made. Many fled beforehand to [[Gibraltar]] or other places; some died as [[martyr]]s; and some accepted Islam.<ref>{{harvp|Jost|1828|pp=44 et seq.}}</ref> The notables and the Muslim masses then rose to intervene on behalf of the Jews. They hid many of them in their houses and saved a great many others.

J.\" xxxvii. 120 et seq.</ref>\n\nFrom the second half of this century various accounts of travels exist which give information concerning the external position of the Jews. Ch\u00e9nier, for example, describes them as follows:\n<blockquote>\"The Jews possess neither lands nor gardens, nor can they enjoy their fruits in tranquillity. They must wear only black, and are obliged when they pass near [[mosque]]s, or through streets in which there are sanctuaries, to walk barefoot. The lowest among the [[Moors]] imagines he has a right to ill-treat a Jew, nor dares the latter defend himself, because the [[Koran]] and the judge are always in favor of the Mohammedan. Notwithstanding this state of oppression, the Jews have many advantages over the Moors: they better understand the spirit of trade; they act as agents and brokers, and they profit by their own cunning and by the ignorance of the Moors. In their commercial bargains many of them buy up the commodities of the country to sell again. Some have European correspondents; others are mechanics, such as goldsmiths, tailors, gunsmiths, millers, and masons. More industrious and artful, and better informed than the Moors, the Jews are employed by the emperor in receiving the customs, in coining money, and in all affairs and intercourse which the monarch has with the European merchants, as well as in all his negotiations with the various European governments.\"<ref>Ch\u00e9nier, \"The Present State of the Empire of Morocco\", i. 157</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Berber Jews.jpg|thumb|left|[[Berber Jews]] of the [[Atlas Mountains]], c. 1900.]]\nThere were, indeed, quite a number of such Jewish officials, negotiators, treasurers, councilors, and administrators at the Moroccan court, whom the European is inclined to call \"ministers\", but whom in reality the ruler used merely as intermediaries in extorting money from the people, and dismissed as soon as their usefulness in this direction was at an end. They were especially [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], the [[megorashim]], whose wealth, education, and statesmanship paved their way to the court here, as formerly in Spain. One of the first of such ministers was Shumel al-Barensi, at the beginning of the 16th century in Fez, who opened the \"state career\" to a long succession of coreligionists ending in the 19th century with [[Masado ben Leaho]], prime minister and representative councilor of the emperor in foreign affairs. It would be erroneous to suppose that these Jewish dignitaries of the state succeeded in raising the position and the influence of their fellow believers, or that they even attempted to do so. They were usually very glad if they themselves were able to remain in office to the end of their lives.\n\nMoroccan Jews were employed also as [[ambassador]]s to foreign courts. At the beginning of the 17th century Pacheco in the Netherlands; [[Shumel al-Farrashi]] at the same place in 1610; after 1675 [[Joseph Toledani]], who, as stated above, concluded peace with [[Holland]]; his son Hayyim in England in 1750; a Jew in Denmark. In 1780 [[Jacob ben Abraham Benider]] was sent as minister from Morocco to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]; in 1794 a Jew named Sumbal and in 1828 [[Me\u00efr Cohen Macnin]] were sent as Moroccan ambassadors to the English court.<ref>Picciotti, \"Sketches of Anglo-Jewish History\" p. 173, London, 1875</ref><ref>Meakin, \"The Moors\", London, 1902</ref>\n\nAnother event caused to a population decrease among the community was the two-year exile of the Jews from the mellah in 1790\u20131792, during the brief reign of sultan Malawy yazid . The whole community was forced to leave to Qasba Shrarda which was on the other side of Fez. This time the population of the Jews around the mellah was at the lowest stage of all time, and did not manage to \"heal\" itself.

This included a transformation of many Moroccan Jews' gender and sexual norms. For many centuries, Moroccan Jews and Muslims had shared such customs as polygamy, segregation of the sexes, early ages of female marriage, and a tolerance for men's love of male youths that was in contrast to both Jewish and Islamic scriptural prescriptions.<ref>{{harvp|Drucker|2015|pp=4, 15}}</ref> The AIU set out to Europeanize Moroccan Jews' marriage patterns and family forms, combating prostitution, eliminating Jewish women's traditional head coverings, and reining-in on what it saw as Jewish men's promiscuity and homosexual tendencies.<ref>{{harvp|Drucker|2015|pp=7, 10\u201315}}</ref> These changes required, in the words of an AIU alumni association in Tangiers in 1901, that Jewish mores be \"disengaged from the Muslim spirit\"<ref>{{harvp|Marglin|2011|pp=595\u2013596}}</ref> \u2013 thus helping, like the AIU's activities generally, to increase Moroccan Jews' distance from an emerging Moroccan national identity.

Two others had already been executed at the instigation of the Spanish [[consul]]; one of them publicly in [[Tangier]], the other in Safi. Sir Moses, supported by the British government, undertook a journey to Morocco to demand the liberation of the imprisoned Jews and, as he said in a letter to the sultan, to move the latter \"to give the most positive orders that Jews and Christians, dwelling in all parts of Your Majesty's dominions, shall be perfectly protected, and that no person shall molest them in any manner whatsoever in anything which concerns their safety and tranquillity; and that they may be placed in the enjoyment of the same advantages as all other subjects of Your Majesty.\" Montefiore was successful in both attempts.<ref>{{harvp|Parfitt|2000}}</ref>\n\nThe prisoners were liberated, and on February 15, 1864, the sultan published an edict granting equal rights of justice to the Jews.<ref>Diaries of Sir Moses and Lady Montefiore\", ii. 145 et seq., London, 1890; see also the account of the journey by Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, the physician who accompanied Montefiore, entitled \"Narrative of a Journey to Morocco\", London, 1866</ref> This edict of emancipation was confirmed by [[Mohammed IV of Morocco|Mohammed IV]]'s son and successor, [[Hassan I of Morocco|Moulay Hasan I]], on his accession to the throne 1873 and again on September 18, 1880, after the [[Conference of Madrid]].\n\nPro-Jewish reforms were often not executed by local magistrates in the fragmented sultanate, however, and even if they were they reignited animosity toward the Jewish population. Thus, for example, the sultan [[Slimane of Morocco|Sulaiman]] (1795\u20131822) decreed that the Jews of Fez might wear shoes; but so many Jews were killed in the streets of that city as a result of the edict that they themselves asked the sultan to repeal it.

Around 2,500 live there now, mostly in [[Casablanca]], but also in [[Fes]] and other main cities.\n\nIn June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], and in Alcazarquivir killing 44 Jews.  In 1948\u20139, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel.  After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year.  Through the early 1950s, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as a valuable source of labor for the Jewish State. From 1948 on many Jews left Fes. Most emigrated to Israel while others went to France and Canada. In the 1950s and 1960s there were still active Jewish schools and organizations such as the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] which later closed as the Jewish population decreased.<ref name=\"Beit Hatfutsot\"/><ref name=\"Virtual Jewish World\"/><ref name=\"The Jewish Quarter of Fez\"/>\n\nIn 1956, Morocco attained independence.  Jews occupied several political positions, including three Members of the [[Parliament of Morocco]] and a Minister of Posts and Telegraphs.  However, emigration to Israel jumped from 8,171 in 1954 to 24,994 in 1955, increasing further in 1956.  Beginning in 1956, emigration to [[Israel]] was prohibited until 1961, although it continued illegally until it was officially resumed.<ref>[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm '&#39;Prohibitions on Communications and Emigration to Israel'&#39;].

When [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]] died, Jews joined Muslims in a national day of [[mourning]]. But over the next three years, more than 80,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to Israel.  By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\n\nThe [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide including in Morocco. By 1971, its Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this new wave of emigration went to Europe and North America rather than Israel. France for a time was a destination particularly for Moroccan Jews with European educations, who had economic opportunities there; one study of Moroccan Jewish brothers, one of whom settled in France and the other in Israel, showed that 28 percent of the brothers who settled in France became managers, businessmen or professionals (compared to 13 percent of their Israeli brothers) and only 4 percent unskilled workers (compared to over a third of their Israeli brothers).<ref>Michael Inbar and Chaim Adler, ''Ethnic Integration in Israel: A Comparative Study of Moroccan Brothers Who Settled in France and in Israel'', New Brunswick: Transaction, 1977, 35-36, 45</ref> Moroccan Jews in Israel, far more numerous, enjoyed less upward mobility: 51 percent were blue-collar in 1961 and 54 percent as late as 1981.<ref>Eliezer Ben-Rafael and Stephen Sharot, ''Ethnicity, REligion, and Class in Israeli Society'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991, 67</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nDespite their current small numbers, Jews continue to play a notable role in Morocco.

Jewish schools and synagogues receive government subsidies.  However, Jews were targeted in the Casablanca bombings of May 2003. King [[Hassan II]]'s pleas to former Moroccan Jews to return have largely been ignored.\n\nIn 2004 Marrakech had an aging population of about 260 Jews, most over the age of 60, while Casablanca had between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for [[Hello Kitty]] and [[Pikachu]].<ref name=\"SFGate\">{{Cite news |last=Kageyama |first=Yuri |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/01/24/entertainment/e091755S47.DTL |title=SpongeBob Goes Trendy to Win Japan Fans |date=January 24, 2007 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405192838/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F01%2F24%2Fentertainment%2Fe091755S47.DTL |archive-date=April 5, 2009}}</ref> The character also spawned a soap-filled sponge product manufactured by SpongeTech.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cohen |first=Melanie |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2010/07/13/spongetech-strikes-out-in-bankruptcy/?KEYWORDS=SpongeBob+SquarePants+%28character%29 |title=SpongeTech Strikes Out in Bankruptcy |date=July 13, 2010 |access-date=July 13, 2010 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal blogs}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2009, the Simmons Jewelry Co. released a $75,000 diamond pendant as part of a ''SpongeBob'' collection.<ref name=\"Pendant\">{{Cite news |last=Huff |first=Richard |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/spongebob-squarepants-nickelodeon-longest-running-shows-decade-article-1.435311 |title='SpongeBob SquarePants' one of Nickelodeon's longest-running shows after nearly a decade |work=New York Daily News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121072606/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/spongebob-squarepants-nickelodeon-longest-running-shows-decade-article-1.435311 |archive-date=January 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn May 17, 2013, [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] introduced the new ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' collection in stores and online in North America.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/bargain-mom/2013/04/build_a_bear_spongebob_square.html |title=Build A Bear SpongeBob Square Pants coming May 17 |last=Dedman |first=Christie |date=April 4, 2013 |publisher=AL.com |access-date=May 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130515005084/en/Build-A-Bear-Workshop-Splash-SpongeBob-SquarePants-Collection |title=Build-A-Bear Workshop Makes a Splash with New SpongeBob SquarePants Collection |date=May 15, 2013 |publisher=BusinessWire |access-date=May 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSpongeBob has also inspired vehicle designs.

James I was knighted by King [[James I of England|James I]], was elected [[Irish House of Commons|M.P.]] for [[Mallow (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Mallow]] in 1613, and served as [[auditor]]-general for Ireland till his death on May 14, 1632, in which capacity he was succeeded by his son.\n\nJames  Ware II  graduated from [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1616, having received an education in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Becoming interested in Irish history, he began assembling a very fine collection of Irish [[manuscripts]], and made transcriptions from works held in other collections, including that of his close friend [[James Ussher]], [[Bishop of Meath]]. He married Elizabeth Newman, daughter \nof  John  Newman of Dublin, in 1620.\n\n==1626 to 1639==\nKnighted in 1629, Sir James was elected Member of the [[Irish House of Commons]] (M.P.) for the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] in 1634.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} In 1638 he, with Sir [[Philip Perceval]] obtained the monopoly of granting licenses for the sale of ale and brandy.<ref>{{Cite DNB|title=Perceval, Philip}}</ref>\n\n===Publications 1626 to 1639===\nWare's first book, published in 1626, was ''Archiepisco Porum Cassiliensium & Tuamensium Vitae'', followed by ''Caenobia Cistertientia Hiberniae'' and ''De Praesulibus Lageniae'', both in 1631. In 1633 he published three edited works: [[Edmund Spenser]]'s 'View of the State of Ireland'; [[Meredith Hanmer]]'s 'History of Ireland'; and [[Edmund Campion]]'s 'History of Ireland'. His book of 1639, ''De Scriptoribus Hiberniae'' was to be the last published for fifteen years, due to his involvement in Irish and British politics.\n\n==Royalist activities==\nWare was an ardent [[royalist]] during the 1640s, during the [[Irish Confederate Wars]], which were part of the conflict known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], which consumed much of Ireland and Britain during the 1640s. He was a strong supporter of [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]]. His activities led to his imprisonment in the [[Tower of London]] for a year; following his release he returned to Dublin, only to be taken prisoner and hostage on the city's surrender to Colonel [[Michael Jones (soldier)|Michael Jones]] in June 1647. He was expelled to England that year, returned, and was expelled again in 1649. He spent some eighteen months exiled in France before travelling to London where he spent most of the 1650s.\n\n==Return to scholarship==\nWare's first new book since the 1630s was ''De Hibernia et Antiquitatibus eius Disquisitones'', published in London in 1654, and in a second edition in 1658. This was followed in 1656 by ''Opuscula Sancto Patricio Adscripta''.\n\nFollowing the restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], Ware returned to Dublin where he was re-elected as M.P. for Dublin University. He remained on close terms with Ormond, who frequently visited him for consultations at his home in Castle Street.\n\nThe year 1664 saw the publication of ''Venerabilis Bedae Epistolae Duae'' and ''Rerum Hibernicarum Annales ab Anno Domini 1485 ad Annum 1558''. In the following year, which saw the publication of ''De Praesulibus Hiberniae Commentarius'', he began a brief though fruitful collaboration with [[Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh]]. It was later stated that ''\"He always kept in his House an Irish [[Amanuensis]] to interpret and translate the Language for him, and at the Time of his Death one Dubley Firbisse served him in that Office.\"''\n\n==Family and death==\nWare's children  by Elizabeth Newman include James (died 1689), [[Robert Ware|Robert]] (died 1696) and Mary (died 1651). Mary married [[Sir Edward Crofton, 1st Baronet]] in 1647, he being a nephew of Thomas Crofton of Longford, Tireagh, Co. Sligo (another Thomas Crofton, of this family, killed Mac Fhirbhisigh in January 1671). A first cousin of Thomas Crofton of Longford was Catherine Crofton, daughter of John Crofton of Lisdorne, Co. Roscommon; Catherine was married to Reverend Joseph Ware, Dean of [[Diocese of Elphin|Elphin]], who is believed to have been a younger brother of Sir James. James Ware III had one daughter Mary (1651\u20131722) who married firstly Alexander Fraser and secondly  [[John St Leger (1674\u20131743)|Sir John St Leger]], Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]]: she was described as a lady of great wealth and \"questionable virtue\".\n\nWare died on Saturday 1 December 1666, aged seventy-two years and five days.

The ridges are broad, but are defended by steep valleys. Its summit is the highest point of the range and the [[registration county]] of [[Dumfriesshire|Dumfries]].\n\nWhite Coomb is most easily climbed from the [[National Trust for Scotland]] car park underneath the [[Grey Mare's Tail, Moffat Hills|Grey Mare's Tail]] waterfall, on the A708 from [[Moffat]] to [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], at NT 186146. The most direct route heads directly west up a steep ridge, but a more comfortable route follows a well built footpath above the north side of the waterfall. Above the waterfall, the fast flowing Tail Burn must be crossed to avoid a long detour; although there are plenty of natural stepping stones, spate or icy conditions may make their use dangerous. From across the stream, the best route through the peat and heather follows the course of a wall leading to the summit of Upper Tarnberry (546 m). From there, the east ridge, which is steep and craggy in places, leads to the broad summit.\n\nAn alternative ascent, described by the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' as one of \"Britain's finest half-day and day walks\", follows the Tail Burn to the outlet of [[Loch Skeen]] before ascending the ridge to Mid Craig, and passing Donald's Cleuch Head to reach the summit.

''Battlefield V'' is the sixteenth installment in the ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' series. It was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on November 20, 2018. Those who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game were granted early access to the game on November 15, 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/18/complete-guide-to-battlefield-5-preorder-bonuses|title=Complete Guide to Battlefield 5 Preorder Bonuses|last=Macy|first=Seth G.|website=IGN|date=October 18, 2018|access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref> and [[Origin Access]] Premium subscribers on PC received access to the game on November 9, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/9/18079060/battlefield-5-ea-subscribers-early-release-date|title=Players who buy Battlefield 5 have to wait the longest to play it|work=Polygon|access-date=November 9, 2018}}</ref> The game is based on [[World War II]] and is a thematic continuation of its [[World War I]] based precursor ''[[Battlefield 1]]''.\n\nPre-release reception of the game was mixed, with the announcement trailer causing backlash from some fans of the series for the degree of historical inaccuracy and the inclusion of female soldiers. Upon release, ''Battlefield V'' received generally favourable reviews from critics, being praised for its gameplay but criticized for its shortage of content at launch and lack of innovation. The game sold 7.3 million copies by the end of 2018 but was a commercial disappointment for Electronic Arts. \n\nThe game will receive its final content update in June.<ref>{{cite web |title=An update on the future of Battlefield V |url=https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1253307936962678784 |website=Twitter |publisher=Battlefield |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Correct, and we'll have more details about what's included in the summer update closer to that time. |url=https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1253314285201051649 |website=Twitter |publisher=Battlefield |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Battlefield V'' is focused extensively on party-based features and mechanics, scarcity of resources, and removing \"abstractions\" from game mechanics to increase realism.<ref name=\"vergereturn\" /> There is an expanded focus on player customization through the new [[Company (military unit)|Company]] system, where players can create multiple characters with cosmetic and weapon options.

The Grand Operations mode is an expansion of the \"Operations\" mode introduced in ''Battlefield 1'', which focuses on matches taking place across multiple stages to simulate a campaign from the war. In Grand Operations, each round will have specific objectives, and performance in each stage will influence the next. If the final day ends with a close margin of victory, the match will culminate with a \"Final Stand,\" with players fighting to the last man standing on a continually shrinking map. Similarly to ''Battlefield 1'', the game features a collection of single-player \"war stories\" based on aspects of World War II.<ref name=\"vergereturn\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384042/battlefield-5-release-date-trailer-video|last=Savov|first=Vlad|title=Battlefield V returns to World War II this October|work=The Verge|date=May 23, 2018|access-date=May 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530130250/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384042/battlefield-5-release-date-trailer-video|archive-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> The game also features a [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] mode not seen since ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' called \"Combined Arms,\" where up to four players can undertake missions together and features dynamic missions and objectives so missions cannot be played the same way each time.\n\nThe [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] mode is built around the franchise's \"core pillars of destruction, team play, and vehicles.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-09-battlefield-v-is-getting-a-battle-royale-mode-called-royale|title=Battlefield V is getting a battle royale mode called Royale|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=June 14, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-3231890|last=|first=|title=Battlefield 5: EA announces Battle Royale mode at E3 2018|work=TrustedReviews|date=June 9, 2018|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-battlefield-5-battle-royale-mode-announced/1100-6459536/|last=|first=|title=E3 2018: Battlefield 5 Battle Royale Mode Announced By EA|work=GameSpot|date=June 9, 2018|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref> The name \"Firestorm\" refers to a literal storm of fire that constricts players similar to the popular Battle Royale game mechanic of restricting the play area. Furthermore, this particular game mode was not developed by EA DICE themselves, but has been outsourced to [[Criterion Games]] and features the biggest map created by the franchise to date. It is playable by 64 players, which can be divided into up to 16 squads with a focus on team work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-07-burnout-creator-criterion-making-battlefield-5s-battle-royale-mode|title=Criterion making Battlefield 5's battle royale mode|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAs in ''Battlefield 1'', the single-player campaign is divided into an introduction followed by episodic ''War Stories,'' three of which were available at launch: ''\"Nordlys\"'' takes place from the point-of-view of a [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]] fighter taking part in the [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|sabotage of the German nuclear program]], ''\"Tirailleur\"'' tells the story of a [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese Tirailleur]] during [[Operation Dragoon]], and ''\"Under No Flag\"'' puts the player in the shoes of Billy Bridger, a convicted bank robber and explosives expert conscripted into the [[Special Boat Service]] to take part in [[Operation Albumen]]. The fourth campaign, ''\"The Last Tiger,\"'' was released on December 5, 2018, which depicts the struggles of a German [[Tiger I]] tank crew during the [[Ruhr Pocket]] in the closing days of the war.\n\n=== My Country Calling ===\nThe introductory episode of Battlefield V, titled \u201cMy Country Calling\u201d or \u201cPrologue\u201d, is a tutorial required upon first launching up the game. In it, the player learns the basic mechanics on how infantry, tanks, and planes, as well as setting the tone for future war stories. The prologue begins after Battlefield 1's \u201cStorm of Steel\u201d left off, before cutting to a black screen with white text, commentating on how society was quick to forget the horrors of the First World War. The prologue then jumps forward to London 1939, with Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war on Germany being played on the radio. The narration then begins before the player steps into the shoes of a British paratrooper, during a night raid at Narvik Docks, 1940. The player then must defeat several German soldiers before a Tiger I tank appears, and the screen fades to white. The player is then placed into control of tank commander Peter Muller, the main character of the \u201cLast Tiger\u201d war story. In this instance, however, the player is tasked with breaking British lines at Tobruk, before an artillery strike causes another character change. After the transition, the player is then put in control of a free French sniper, presumed to be one of the same solders as the \u201cTirailleur\u201d war story, around the Kasserine Pass. After sniping several enemies during an ambush sequence, the player character is then killed when a strafing run hits them. The camera then pans to a Bf 109 pilot titled Yellow-Seven. This time, the player must shoot down a variety of Blenheim and Spitfire aircraft, before being shot down themselves. Finally, the player takes the role of a British machine gunner during the Final Defense at Nijmegen Bridge, 1944. A V1 flying bomb soon detonates on their position, however, and the player goes into a last stand before getting killed in the onslaught of gunfire. Upon completion of all introductory segments, the player is then shown cinematic clips of the war stories, before being treated to the game's title card.\n\n=== Under No Flag ===\nIn the spring of 1942, convicted bank robber William Sidney \"Billy\" Bridger, the son of another infamous bank robber, Arthur Bridger, volunteers to join the British military in order to avoid jail time, and is assigned as a demolitions expert to a Special Boat Service team led by George Mason ([[Craig Fairbrass]]). Billy and Mason infiltrate occupied North Africa in order to sabotage German airfields. However, things don't go as planned at the first airfield; one of Billy's bombs (\"safecracker specials\") fails to detonate, much to Mason's anger, forcing Billy to commandeer an anti-aircraft gun to destroy the final plane. Mason is wounded, and after an argument with Mason about whose fault it was that Mason could have been killed, Billy and Mason steal a German's car and drive to the second airfield. However, due to Mason's wounds, Billy is forced to infiltrate the airfield alone. Billy is able to destroy the objectives, but detours to a nearby bunker to collect medical supplies for Mason, and uses the radio there to call HMS ''Sussex'' for evacuation. After destroying the base's radar stations, Billy returns to report to Mason. However, Mason is furious when he finds out Billy radioed for help, since it would alert the Germans to their exact location. A massive German force begins to pursue them and they are forced to hide in some ruins. Billy begins to express doubts at his own competence and their chances of survival, as well as grieving over his failure to please his father. Mason confides in Billy that he picked him to volunteer for the unit because his many attempts to rob banks, especially three of one bank, showed him as a \"tryer,\" a person who doesn't easily give up. Inspired, Billy fights alongside Mason in a last stand. They manage to hold off the German forces long enough for British reinforcements to arrive, and the Germans are subsequently routed. In the aftermath, Billy and Mason have a newfound respect for each other as they head off for their next mission.\n\n=== Nordlys ===\nIn the spring of 1943, in Rjukjan, Norway, a British commando unit is killed attempting to infiltrate a German occupied facility and Astrid, the Norwegian resistance fighter assisting them, is captured. Meanwhile, Astrid's daughter Solveig fights her way into the facility to rescue her. However, Astrid refuses to leave, insisting that the facility must be destroyed first since it is producing heavy water for Germany's nuclear weapon research. The pair manage to sabotage the facility, but much of the heavy water is evacuated by truck. They attempt to pursue, but are cornered on a bridge by German forces commanded by [[Leutnant]] Weber. Entrusting Solveig with the mission to destroy the heavy water, Astrid pushes her off the bridge to prevent her from being captured. Narrowly surviving the fall, Solveig carries on the mission, pursuing the trucks and destroying all of them. Unfortunately, the Germans have already loaded Astrid and some of the heavy water on board a U-boat, and Solveig is unable to board it. Astrid steals a grenade and uses it to destroy the U-boat and the heavy water, killing herself and Weber in the process. It is left unclear whether Solveig survived the explosion or not.\n\n=== Tirailleur ===\nIn the autumn of 1944 after the Allied [[landings at Normandy]], Senegalese soldiers are sent to help liberate France from German occupation. One of these soldiers is the young recruit Deme Cisse, who meets fellow soldier and older brother Idrissa upon arriving in France. However, Deme quickly experiences discrimination from the French army, with the Senegalese being blocked from fighting on the frontlines and instead assigned to perform menial tasks such as filling sandbags. Finally, the Senegalese are allowed to participate in an assault on a heavily fortified German position by moving to destroy a set of anti-aircraft guns defending the area. The Senegalese are ambushed on the way to their objective, but they are able to capture and hold a German strongpoint. Idrissa is reluctant to proceed further since their commanders are dead and they have no support, but Deme is determined to keep pushing to the anti-aircraft guns in order to win recognition from the French army, and he convinces the rest of the unit to follow him. They are successful in destroying the anti-aircraft guns, but suffer heavy casualties in the process. In addition, a wounded German soldier boasts they will be surrounded, destroyed in the inevitable counterattack, and that nobody will know they were even there. A hopeless Idrissa, fearing that he won't come home to his family alive, considers withdrawing, but Deme insists that they do what the Germans won't expect them to: directly attack the German headquarters. They manage to break into the headquarters, but are ambushed by a Tiger tank. Idrissa is mortally wounded after destroying the Tiger, much to Deme's shock. Despite Deme's unit having taken the headquarters, their involvement in the operation is covered up and forgotten. In the present, an elderly Deme recounts his story and declares that no matter what happens, nothing can erase what he and his comrades had done, and that he is proud of it.\n\n=== The Last Tiger ===\nIn the spring of 1945, veteran [[Tiger I]] commander Peter M\u00fcller and his tank crew participates in the defense of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] against invading American forces, with orders from High Command that all German soldiers must fight to the death. After surviving a series of heavy engagements, the Tiger is forced to take cover from Allied bombers. At the behest of Schr\u00f6der, the crew's young and fanatically patriotic gunner, M\u00fcller has young loader Hartmann scout the ruins ahead for a passage through. A large American tank column suddenly appears, forcing the crew to leave Hartmann behind. The Tiger receives orders to regroup at the cathedral with other remaining German forces for a final defense; en route, they discover Hartmann had been executed by [[hanging]] along with several other accused deserters. They reach the cathedral, only to find it abandoned and are quickly surrounded by the American army, who demand their surrender. With new orders to defend their position, the crew fights off the enemy before making their way to the bridge, which leads back to German lines. The bridge is suddenly destroyed by a series of explosions, and the Tiger is disabled. Kertz, the crew's veteran driver, expresses his disillusionment in the German cause and decides to desert despite M\u00fcller's pleading; Kertz is then shot and fatally wounded by Schr\u00f6der. As M\u00fcller cradles his friend's corpse, American soldiers arrive and again demand their surrender, but the fanatical Schr\u00f6der continues to fight. M\u00fcller discards his [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] and raises his arms in surrender, after which an enraged Schr\u00f6der aims his [[MP40]] at him. The screen cuts to black and a burst of gunfire is heard, leaving M\u00fcller's fate ambiguous.\n\n== Development ==\nDICE unveiled the first details surrounding ''Battlefield V'' on May 23, 2018, with more information to be unveiled during the EA Play press conference near [[E3 2018]] in June. DICE has stated that, unlike ''Battlefield 1'', it does not plan to use paid [[downloadable content]], or \"[[loot box]]es\" for non-cosmetic items within ''Battlefield V''; new content will be added to the game for all players over time (which, itself, will progress through the different stages of World War II), at no additional charge.<ref name=\"polygon-nopass\">{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|title=Battlefield 5 ditches the premium pass|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115940/https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|archive-date=May 24, 2018|work=Polygon|access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|title=\u2018Battlefield V\u2019 Hits Oct. 19, Explores WWII Free of Premium Pass, Loot Boxes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120154/http://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|archive-date=May 24, 2018|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=May 23, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=May 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The decision to exclude these features was made following the outrage over the loot box system in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'', another EA DICE title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|title=Here's Our First Look At Battlefield V, Which Goes Back To WWII|work=Kotaku|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115705/https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|archive-date=May 24, 2018|access-date=May 24, 2018|date=May 23, 2018|last=Scheirer|first=Jason}}</ref> The game was originally set to release on October 19, but was delayed to November 20 to enable the developers to \"make some final adjustments to core gameplay.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlefield-5-release-date-delayed-to-november/|title=Battlefield 5 release date delayed to November|publisher=}}</ref> It is one of the first major games to make use of real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and [[DLSS]], with help from [[Nvidia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/battlefield-5-ray-tracing-benchmarks,5911.html|title=Here's How Battlefield V Performs with Ray Tracing|last=Angelini|first=Chris|last2=Freedman|first2=Andrew E.|work=Tom's Hardware|date=November 16, 2018|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.techspot.com/article/1794-nvidia-rtx-dlss-battlefield/| title=Battlefield V DLSS Tested: Overpromised, Underdelivered| publisher=techspot.com| date=2019-02-19| accessdate=2020-04-06| quote=''Of course, this is to be expected.

In Grand Operations, each round will have specific objectives, and performance in each stage will influence the next. If the final day ends with a close margin of victory, the match will culminate with a \"Final Stand,\" with players fighting to the last man standing on a continually shrinking map. Similarly to ''Battlefield 1'', the game features a collection of single-player \"war stories\" based on aspects of World War II.<ref name=\"vergereturn\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384042/battlefield-5-release-date-trailer-video|last=Savov|first=Vlad|title=Battlefield V returns to World War II this October|work=The Verge|date=May 23, 2018|access-date=May 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530130250/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384042/battlefield-5-release-date-trailer-video|archive-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> The game also features a [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] mode not seen since ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' called \"Combined Arms,\" where up to four players can undertake missions together and features dynamic missions and objectives so missions cannot be played the same way each time.\n\nThe [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] mode is built around the franchise's \"core pillars of destruction, team play, and vehicles.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-09-battlefield-v-is-getting-a-battle-royale-mode-called-royale|title=Battlefield V is getting a battle royale mode called Royale|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=June 14, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-3231890|last=|first=|title=Battlefield 5: EA announces Battle Royale mode at E3 2018|work=TrustedReviews|date=June 9, 2018|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-battlefield-5-battle-royale-mode-announced/1100-6459536/|last=|first=|title=E3 2018: Battlefield 5 Battle Royale Mode Announced By EA|work=GameSpot|date=June 9, 2018|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref> The name \"Firestorm\" refers to a literal storm of fire that constricts players similar to the popular Battle Royale game mechanic of restricting the play area. Furthermore, this particular game mode was not developed by EA DICE themselves, but has been outsourced to [[Criterion Games]] and features the biggest map created by the franchise to date. It is playable by 64 players, which can be divided into up to 16 squads with a focus on team work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-07-burnout-creator-criterion-making-battlefield-5s-battle-royale-mode|title=Criterion making Battlefield 5's battle royale mode|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAs in ''Battlefield 1'', the single-player campaign is divided into an introduction followed by episodic ''War Stories,'' three of which were available at launch: ''\"Nordlys\"'' takes place from the point-of-view of a [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]] fighter taking part in the [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|sabotage of the German nuclear program]], ''\"Tirailleur\"'' tells the story of a [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese Tirailleur]] during [[Operation Dragoon]], and ''\"Under No Flag\"'' puts the player in the shoes of Billy Bridger, a convicted bank robber and explosives expert conscripted into the [[Special Boat Service]] to take part in [[Operation Albumen]]. The fourth campaign, ''\"The Last Tiger,\"'' was released on December 5, 2018, which depicts the struggles of a German [[Tiger I]] tank crew during the [[Ruhr Pocket]] in the closing days of the war.\n\n=== My Country Calling ===\nThe introductory episode of Battlefield V, titled \u201cMy Country Calling\u201d or \u201cPrologue\u201d, is a tutorial required upon first launching up the game. In it, the player learns the basic mechanics on how infantry, tanks, and planes, as well as setting the tone for future war stories. The prologue begins after Battlefield 1's \u201cStorm of Steel\u201d left off, before cutting to a black screen with white text, commentating on how society was quick to forget the horrors of the First World War. The prologue then jumps forward to London 1939, with Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war on Germany being played on the radio. The narration then begins before the player steps into the shoes of a British paratrooper, during a night raid at Narvik Docks, 1940. The player then must defeat several German soldiers before a Tiger I tank appears, and the screen fades to white. The player is then placed into control of tank commander Peter Muller, the main character of the \u201cLast Tiger\u201d war story. In this instance, however, the player is tasked with breaking British lines at Tobruk, before an artillery strike causes another character change. After the transition, the player is then put in control of a free French sniper, presumed to be one of the same solders as the \u201cTirailleur\u201d war story, around the Kasserine Pass. After sniping several enemies during an ambush sequence, the player character is then killed when a strafing run hits them. The camera then pans to a Bf 109 pilot titled Yellow-Seven. This time, the player must shoot down a variety of Blenheim and Spitfire aircraft, before being shot down themselves. Finally, the player takes the role of a British machine gunner during the Final Defense at Nijmegen Bridge, 1944. A V1 flying bomb soon detonates on their position, however, and the player goes into a last stand before getting killed in the onslaught of gunfire. Upon completion of all introductory segments, the player is then shown cinematic clips of the war stories, before being treated to the game's title card.\n\n=== Under No Flag ===\nIn the spring of 1942, convicted bank robber William Sidney \"Billy\" Bridger, the son of another infamous bank robber, Arthur Bridger, volunteers to join the British military in order to avoid jail time, and is assigned as a demolitions expert to a Special Boat Service team led by George Mason ([[Craig Fairbrass]]). Billy and Mason infiltrate occupied North Africa in order to sabotage German airfields. However, things don't go as planned at the first airfield; one of Billy's bombs (\"safecracker specials\") fails to detonate, much to Mason's anger, forcing Billy to commandeer an anti-aircraft gun to destroy the final plane. Mason is wounded, and after an argument with Mason about whose fault it was that Mason could have been killed, Billy and Mason steal a German's car and drive to the second airfield. However, due to Mason's wounds, Billy is forced to infiltrate the airfield alone. Billy is able to destroy the objectives, but detours to a nearby bunker to collect medical supplies for Mason, and uses the radio there to call HMS ''Sussex'' for evacuation. After destroying the base's radar stations, Billy returns to report to Mason. However, Mason is furious when he finds out Billy radioed for help, since it would alert the Germans to their exact location. A massive German force begins to pursue them and they are forced to hide in some ruins. Billy begins to express doubts at his own competence and their chances of survival, as well as grieving over his failure to please his father. Mason confides in Billy that he picked him to volunteer for the unit because his many attempts to rob banks, especially three of one bank, showed him as a \"tryer,\" a person who doesn't easily give up. Inspired, Billy fights alongside Mason in a last stand. They manage to hold off the German forces long enough for British reinforcements to arrive, and the Germans are subsequently routed. In the aftermath, Billy and Mason have a newfound respect for each other as they head off for their next mission.\n\n=== Nordlys ===\nIn the spring of 1943, in Rjukjan, Norway, a British commando unit is killed attempting to infiltrate a German occupied facility and Astrid, the Norwegian resistance fighter assisting them, is captured. Meanwhile, Astrid's daughter Solveig fights her way into the facility to rescue her. However, Astrid refuses to leave, insisting that the facility must be destroyed first since it is producing heavy water for Germany's nuclear weapon research. The pair manage to sabotage the facility, but much of the heavy water is evacuated by truck. They attempt to pursue, but are cornered on a bridge by German forces commanded by [[Leutnant]] Weber. Entrusting Solveig with the mission to destroy the heavy water, Astrid pushes her off the bridge to prevent her from being captured. Narrowly surviving the fall, Solveig carries on the mission, pursuing the trucks and destroying all of them. Unfortunately, the Germans have already loaded Astrid and some of the heavy water on board a U-boat, and Solveig is unable to board it. Astrid steals a grenade and uses it to destroy the U-boat and the heavy water, killing herself and Weber in the process. It is left unclear whether Solveig survived the explosion or not.\n\n=== Tirailleur ===\nIn the autumn of 1944 after the Allied [[landings at Normandy]], Senegalese soldiers are sent to help liberate France from German occupation. One of these soldiers is the young recruit Deme Cisse, who meets fellow soldier and older brother Idrissa upon arriving in France. However, Deme quickly experiences discrimination from the French army, with the Senegalese being blocked from fighting on the frontlines and instead assigned to perform menial tasks such as filling sandbags. Finally, the Senegalese are allowed to participate in an assault on a heavily fortified German position by moving to destroy a set of anti-aircraft guns defending the area. The Senegalese are ambushed on the way to their objective, but they are able to capture and hold a German strongpoint. Idrissa is reluctant to proceed further since their commanders are dead and they have no support, but Deme is determined to keep pushing to the anti-aircraft guns in order to win recognition from the French army, and he convinces the rest of the unit to follow him. They are successful in destroying the anti-aircraft guns, but suffer heavy casualties in the process. In addition, a wounded German soldier boasts they will be surrounded, destroyed in the inevitable counterattack, and that nobody will know they were even there. A hopeless Idrissa, fearing that he won't come home to his family alive, considers withdrawing, but Deme insists that they do what the Germans won't expect them to: directly attack the German headquarters. They manage to break into the headquarters, but are ambushed by a Tiger tank. Idrissa is mortally wounded after destroying the Tiger, much to Deme's shock. Despite Deme's unit having taken the headquarters, their involvement in the operation is covered up and forgotten. In the present, an elderly Deme recounts his story and declares that no matter what happens, nothing can erase what he and his comrades had done, and that he is proud of it.\n\n=== The Last Tiger ===\nIn the spring of 1945, veteran [[Tiger I]] commander Peter M\u00fcller and his tank crew participates in the defense of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] against invading American forces, with orders from High Command that all German soldiers must fight to the death. After surviving a series of heavy engagements, the Tiger is forced to take cover from Allied bombers. At the behest of Schr\u00f6der, the crew's young and fanatically patriotic gunner, M\u00fcller has young loader Hartmann scout the ruins ahead for a passage through. A large American tank column suddenly appears, forcing the crew to leave Hartmann behind. The Tiger receives orders to regroup at the cathedral with other remaining German forces for a final defense; en route, they discover Hartmann had been executed by [[hanging]] along with several other accused deserters. They reach the cathedral, only to find it abandoned and are quickly surrounded by the American army, who demand their surrender. With new orders to defend their position, the crew fights off the enemy before making their way to the bridge, which leads back to German lines. The bridge is suddenly destroyed by a series of explosions, and the Tiger is disabled. Kertz, the crew's veteran driver, expresses his disillusionment in the German cause and decides to desert despite M\u00fcller's pleading; Kertz is then shot and fatally wounded by Schr\u00f6der. As M\u00fcller cradles his friend's corpse, American soldiers arrive and again demand their surrender, but the fanatical Schr\u00f6der continues to fight. M\u00fcller discards his [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] and raises his arms in surrender, after which an enraged Schr\u00f6der aims his [[MP40]] at him. The screen cuts to black and a burst of gunfire is heard, leaving M\u00fcller's fate ambiguous.\n\n== Development ==\nDICE unveiled the first details surrounding ''Battlefield V'' on May 23, 2018, with more information to be unveiled during the EA Play press conference near [[E3 2018]] in June. DICE has stated that, unlike ''Battlefield 1'', it does not plan to use paid [[downloadable content]], or \"[[loot box]]es\" for non-cosmetic items within ''Battlefield V''; new content will be added to the game for all players over time (which, itself, will progress through the different stages of World War II), at no additional charge.<ref name=\"polygon-nopass\">{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|title=Battlefield 5 ditches the premium pass|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115940/https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|archive-date=May 24, 2018|work=Polygon|access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|title=\u2018Battlefield V\u2019 Hits Oct. 19, Explores WWII Free of Premium Pass, Loot Boxes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120154/http://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|archive-date=May 24, 2018|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=May 23, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=May 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The decision to exclude these features was made following the outrage over the loot box system in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'', another EA DICE title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|title=Here's Our First Look At Battlefield V, Which Goes Back To WWII|work=Kotaku|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115705/https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|archive-date=May 24, 2018|access-date=May 24, 2018|date=May 23, 2018|last=Scheirer|first=Jason}}</ref> The game was originally set to release on October 19, but was delayed to November 20 to enable the developers to \"make some final adjustments to core gameplay.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlefield-5-release-date-delayed-to-november/|title=Battlefield 5 release date delayed to November|publisher=}}</ref> It is one of the first major games to make use of real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and [[DLSS]], with help from [[Nvidia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/battlefield-5-ray-tracing-benchmarks,5911.html|title=Here's How Battlefield V Performs with Ray Tracing|last=Angelini|first=Chris|last2=Freedman|first2=Andrew E.|work=Tom's Hardware|date=November 16, 2018|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.techspot.com/article/1794-nvidia-rtx-dlss-battlefield/| title=Battlefield V DLSS Tested: Overpromised, Underdelivered| publisher=techspot.com| date=2019-02-19| accessdate=2020-04-06| quote=''Of course, this is to be expected.

His memorial, [[Saint George's Day]], is traditionally celebrated on 23 April.

The saint's veneration dates to the 5th century with some certainty, and possibly still to the 4th. The addition of the [[Saint George and the Dragon|dragon legend]] dates to the 11th century.\n\nThe earliest text which preserves fragments of George's narrative is in a Greek hagiography which is identified by [[Hippolyte Delehaye]] of the scholarly [[Bollandist]]s to be a [[palimpsest]] of the 5th century.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/actasanctorum12unse#page/n148/mode/1up Acta Sanctorum], Volume 12, as republished in 1866</ref>\nAn earlier work by [[Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church history]]'', written in the 4th century, contributed to the legend but did not name George or provide significant detail.<ref>[[Church History (Eusebius)]], book 8, chapter 5; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0640%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D1 Greek text here], and [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0265-0339,_Eusebius_Caesariensis,_Historia_ecclesiastica_%5BSchaff%5D,_EN.pdf English text here].

In the [[Tridentine Calendar]] of 1568, it was given the [[ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite|rank]] of \"Semidouble\". In [[Pope Pius XII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955 calendar]] this rank was reduced to \"Simple\", and in [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|1960 calendar]] to a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|\"Commemoration\"]]. Since [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]], it appears as an optional \"[[Memorial (liturgy)|Memorial]]\". In some countries, such as [[England]], the rank is higher. In England, it is a Solemnity (Roman Catholic) or Feast ([[Church of England]]): if it falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.<ref>The Divine Office: Table of Liturgical Days, Section I (RC) and Calendar, Lectionary and Collects (Church House Publishing 1997) p. 12 (C of E)</ref>\n\nSaint George is very much honoured by the Eastern Orthodox Church, wherein he is referred to as a \"Great Martyr\", and in [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] overall. His [[calendar of saints|major feast day]] is on 23 April (Julian calendar 23 April currently corresponds to Gregorian calendar 6 May). If, however, the feast occurs before [[Easter]], it is celebrated on [[Easter Monday]], instead. The Russian Orthodox Church also celebrates two additional feasts in honour of St. George. One is on 3 November, commemorating the [[consecration]] of a [[cathedral]] dedicated to him in Lydda during the reign of [[Constantine the Great]] (305\u201337). When the church was consecrated, the [[relic]]s of the Saint George were transferred there. The other feast is on 26 November for a church dedicated to him in [[Kiev]], ''circa'' 1054.\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], Saint George's day ({{lang-bg|\u0413\u0435\u0440\u0433\u044c\u043e\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d}}) is celebrated on 6 May, when it is customary to slaughter and roast a lamb. Saint George's day is also a [[public holiday]].\n\nIn [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] refers to Saint George as ''Sveti Djordje'' (''\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0402\u043e\u0440\u0452\u0435'') or ''Sveti Georgije'' (''\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0458\u0435''). Saint George's day (''\u0110ur\u0111evdan'') is celebrated on 6 May, and is a common [[slava]] (patron saint day) among ethnic [[Serbs]].\n\nIn [[Egypt]], the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] refers to Saint George ({{Lang-cop|\u2ca0\u2c93\u2c87\u2c85\u2c93\u2c9f\u2ca5 \u2c84\u2c89\u2c9f\u2ca3\u2c85\u2c93\u2c9f\u2ca5 or \u2c85\u2c89\u2cb1\u2ca3\u2c85\u2c93\u2c9f\u2ca5}}) as the \"Prince of Martyrs\" and celebrates his martyrdom on the 23rd of [[Paremhat]] of the [[Coptic calendar]] equivalent to 1 May.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\nThe [[Copts]] also celebrate the consecration of the first church dedicated to him on seventh of the month of Hatour of the Coptic calendar usually equivalent to 17 November.\n\nIn [[India]], the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]], one of the oriental catholic churches ([[Eastern Catholic Churches]]) and Malankara Orthodox Church venerate Saint George.

[[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] attributed the victory of the Portuguese in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385 to Saint George. During the reign of [[John I of Portugal]] (1357\u20131433), Saint George became the patron saint of Portugal and the King ordered that the saint's image on the horse be carried in the ''[[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]'' procession. The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on 23 April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art \u2013 \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" \u2013 probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]].

When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized).\nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend'').

[[Herbert Thurston]] in ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states that based upon an ancient cultus, narratives of the early pilgrims, and the early dedications of churches to Saint George, going back to the fourth century, \"there seems, therefore, no ground for doubting the historical existence of St. George\", although no faith can be placed in either the details of his history or his alleged exploits.<ref name=\"CE1913\">{{Cite CE1913 |last=Thurston |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Thurston |wstitle=St. George}} \"There seems, therefore, no ground for doubting the historical existence of St. George, even though he is not commemorated in the Syrian, or in the primitive Hieronymian Martyrologium, but no faith can be placed in the attempts that have been made to fill up any of the details of his history. For example, it is now generally admitted that St. George cannot safely be identified by the nameless martyr spoken of by Eusebius (Church History VIII.5), who tore down Diocletian's edict of persecution at Nicomedia. The version of the legend in which Diocletian appears as persecutor is not primitive. Diocletian is only a rationalized form of the name Dadianus. Moreover, the connection of the saint's name with Nicomedia is inconsistent with the early cultus at Diospolis. Still less is St. George to be considered, as suggested by Gibbon, Vetter, and others, a legendary double of the disreputable bishop, George of Cappadocia, the Arian opponent of St. Athanasius.\"</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Donald Attwater]], \"No historical particulars of his life have survived, ... The widespread veneration for St George as a soldier saint from early times had its centre in Palestine at Diospolis, now [[Lod|Lydda]].

[[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] attributed the victory of the Portuguese in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385 to Saint George. During the reign of [[John I of Portugal]] (1357\u20131433), Saint George became the patron saint of Portugal and the King ordered that the saint's image on the horse be carried in the ''[[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]'' procession. The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on 23 April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art - \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" - probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]].

When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized). \nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{For|equestrian depictions|Saint George and the Dragon#Iconography}}\n{{commons|Saint George structured art gallery}}\n\n===Eastern===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tetarteron sb1975.jpg|[[Tetarteron]] of [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (12th century) showing a bust of Saint George\nFile:Novgorod George.jpg|[[Saint George (icon, 1130)|Novgorod icon]] (1130)\nFile:Georgeladoga.jpg|A 12th-century depiction of St&nbsp;George in a church at the Russian village of [[Staraya Ladoga]]\nFile:LifeofStGeorge.JPG|Scenes from the life of Saint George, [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]], Bulgaria (15th century)\nFile:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|A 15th-century battle flag of [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] representing Saint George\nFile:St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter.JPG|A plaque, on which is represented St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter (15th century)\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De slag bij Adua TMnr 5956-2.jpg|\"[[Ethiopian Empire]] forces, assisted by St George (top), win the [[Battle of Adwa]] against [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

Optical storage, [[read-only memory|read-only]] CD-ROM followed by writeable CD and later read-only or writeable DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] players, became common in laptops early in the 2000s.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Compaqarmada7800.jpg|thumb|[[Compaq]] Armada laptop from the late 1990s]]\n[[File:Macbook Air.jpg|thumb|Apple [[MacBook Air]], an ultraportable laptop weighing under {{convert|3.0|lb|kg|2|abbr=on}}]]\n[[File:ThinkPad X220.jpg|thumb|[[Lenovo]]'s [[ThinkPad]] business laptop, originally an [[IBM]] product]]\n\n[[File:Asus Transformer Pad TF701T Tablet and Keyboard Dock.png|thumb|[[ASUS Transformer|Asus Transformer Pad]], a hybrid tablet, powered by [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Operating system|OS]]]]\n[[File:Microsoft Surface Pro 3 with Type Cover.jpg|thumb|[[Microsoft Surface Pro 3]], 2-in-1 detachable]]\n[[File:Alienware.JPG|thumb|[[Alienware]] gaming laptop]]\n[[Image:Toughbook-cf-m34 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Toughbook|Panasonic Toughbook]] CF-M34, a rugged laptop/subnotebook]]\n\nSince the introduction of portable computers during the late 1970s, their form has changed significantly, [[spawning]] a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses.  Except where there is a distinct legal [[trademark]] around a term (notably [[Ultrabook]]), there are rarely hard distinctions between these classes and their usage has varied over time and between different sources.\n\n===Traditional laptop===\nThe form of the traditional laptop computer is a clamshell, with a screen on one of its inner sides and a keyboard on the opposite, facing the screen. It can be easily folded to conserve space while traveling. The screen and keyboard are inaccessible while closed. Devices of this form are commonly called a 'traditional laptop' or notebook, particularly if they have a screen size of 11 to 17 inches measured diagonally and run a full-featured operating system like [[Windows 10]], [[macOS]], or [[GNU]]/[[Linux_kernel|Linux]]. Traditional laptops are the most common form of laptops, although [[Chromebook]]s, Ultrabooks, convertibles and 2-in-1s (described below) are becoming more common, with similar performance being achieved in their more portable or affordable forms.\n\n===Subnotebook===\n{{Main|Subnotebook}}\n\nA ''subnotebook'' or an ''ultraportable'', is a laptop designed and marketed with an emphasis on portability (small size, low weight, and often longer battery life). Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred.

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

Rugged laptops are usually designed from scratch, rather than adapted from regular consumer laptop models. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/rugged-laptop.html |title=Rugged Laptop: Choices, Pointers &amp; Specs of Buying Rugged Laptops |accessdate=27 November 2008 |publisher=Linux-on-laptops.com}}</ref> and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.\n\nThe design features found in rugged laptops include a rubber sheeting under the keyboard keys, sealed port and connector covers, passive cooling, very bright displays easily readable in daylight, cases and frames made of lightweight magnesium alloys that are much stronger than plastics found in commercial laptops, and solid-state storage devices or hard disk drives that are shock mounted to withstand constant vibrations. Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] and adapted to mobile use, although desktop systems increasingly use the same smaller, lower-power parts which were originally developed for mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D\u00e9 specialist voor smartphone, tablet en laptop reparaties|title=Laptop reparatie|url=https://www.smart-repair.nl/laptop/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Smartrepair Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Almere en Utrecht|agency=www.smart-repair.nl|date=4 January 2013|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable, with the exception of components which can be detached, such as a battery or CD/CDR/DVD drive. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large \"tower\" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new [[motherboard]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and other components can be added. In a very compact laptop, such as laplets, there may be no upgradeable components at all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+3+Teardown/26595|website=iFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]], and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards and inability to upgrade components.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Building Blocks Platform,|url=http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516184350/http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2006|publisher=Intel|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following sections summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts.<ref name=\"parts-kate\">{{cite web |title = What Makes Laptops Work&nbsp;\u2013 The Laptop Motherboard |url = http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/laptopstabletpcs/tp/laptopmotherboards.htm |author = Catherine Roseberry |publisher = About.com |accessdate =15 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Display===\nInternally, a display is an LCD panel which could be CCFL or LED [[Backlight|backlit]] which interfaces to the laptop using the [[LVDS]] protocol, while externally, it can be a glossy screen or a matte screen. Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor. SSDs have a higher data transfer rate, lower power consumption, lower failure rate, and a larger capacity<ref name=\"behardware 2011\">BeHardware reported lower retailer return rates for SSDs than HDDs between April and October 2010. {{cite web | url=http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | title=Components returns rates | date=6 May 2011 | publisher=BeHardware | first=Marc | last=Prieur | accessdate=10 February 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214142908/http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | archive-date=14 February 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>A 2011 study by [[Intel]] on the use of 45,000 SSDs reported an annualized failure rate of 0.61% for SSDs, compared with 4.85% for HDDs. {{cite web | url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/it-management/intel-it/intel-it-validating-reliability-of-intel-solid-state-drives-brief.html | title=Validating the Reliability of Intel\u00ae Solid-State Drives |publisher=Intel|date=July 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"behardware 2012\">{{cite web | url = http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | publisher = BeHardware | title = Components returns rates (7) | first = Marc | last = Prieur | date = 16 November 2012 | accessdate = 25 August 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809033951/http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | archive-date = 9 August 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Samsung 16TB SSD is the World's Largest Hard Drive|url = http://petapixel.com/2015/08/15/samsung-16tb-ssd-is-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/|website = PetaPixel|accessdate = 20 September 2015}}</ref> compared to HDDs. However, HDDs have a significantly lower cost.\n\nMost laptops can contain a single 2.5-inch drive, but a small number of laptops with a screen wider than 15 inches can house two drives. Some laptops support a hybrid mode, combining a 2.5-inch drive, typically a spacious HDD for data, with an mSATA or M.2 SDD drive, typically having less capacity, but a significantly faster read/write speed. The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters.

[[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use. It renders Web pages quickly, launches most applications without becoming too bogged down and generally doesn't feel like it's a budget laptop.''\" {{cite web | last = Reid | first = Rory | title = MSI Wind Review | publisher = CNET Australia | date = 7 July 2008 | url = http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | accessdate = 28 November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205092148/http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | archivedate = 5 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Most higher-end laptops are sufficiently powerful for high-resolution movie playback, some 3D gaming and video editing and encoding. However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.\n\n=====Neck and spine=====\nA laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a [[Docking station#Computer stands|computer stand]].\n\n=====Possible effect on fertility=====\nA study by [[State University of New York]] researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap, potentially putting [[sperm count]] at risk. The study, which included roughly two dozen men between the ages of 21 and 35, found that the sitting position required to balance a laptop can increase scrotum temperature by as much as {{convert|2.1|C-change|0}}.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops. One study found that a laptop is three times more likely to break during the first year of use than a desktop.<ref>{{cite web| title = Gartner: Notebook PCs still prone to hardware failure| date = 27 June 2006| publisher = IDG News Service / ITWorld| url = http://www.itworld.com/060627notebookpc| accessdate =27 November 2008}}</ref> To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a lint-free or [[microfiber]] cloth for the LCD screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft. Setting one's laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterwards), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186235/how-to-secure-your-computer-with-a-bios-or-uefi-password/|title=How to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186881/hard-disk-passwords-explained-should-you-set-one-to-secure-your-files/|title=Hard Disk Passwords Explained: Should You Set One to Secure Your Files?|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref> Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them,<ref>[http://www.intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html#.UP2bUFSzBJN#ixzz2Ucm2oKSg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040557/http://intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html|date=6 June 2013}}, Ponemon Institute, The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem, September 2010</ref> however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery.

Several major brands that offer notebooks in various classes are listed in the adjacent box.\nThe major brands usually offer good service and support, including well-executed documentation and driver downloads that remain available for many years after a particular laptop model is no longer produced. Capitalizing on service, support, and brand image, laptops from major brands are more expensive than laptops by smaller brands and [[Original design manufacturer|ODMs]]. Some brands specialize in a particular class of laptops, such as gaming laptops ([[Alienware]]), high-performance laptops ([[HP Envy]]), netbooks ([[EeePC]]) and laptops for children ([[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]]).\n\nMany brands, including the major ones, do not design and do not manufacture their laptops. Instead, a small number of Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) design new models of laptops, and the brands choose the models to be included in their lineup. In 2006, 7 major ODMs manufactured 7 of every 10 laptops in the world, with the largest one ([[Quanta Computer]]) having 30% of world market share.<ref>{{cite web |title=Identical Laptops, Different Prices: Don't Be Fooled by Branding |url-access=registration |publisher=Info-Tech Research Group |date=10 October 2006 |url= http://www.infotech.com/research/identical-laptops-different-prices-dont-be-fooled-by-branding |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> Therefore, identical models are available both from a major label and from a low-profile ODM in-house brand.\n\n=== Market share ===\nBattery-powered portable computers had just 2% worldwide market share in 1986.<ref>{{cite news| title = Lap-top computers gain stature as power grows| work = Daily News of Los Angeles (CA)| date = 12 April 1987| url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&p_theme=la&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EF513A9C40DA46F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM| accessdate =1 November 2008 }}</ref> However, laptops have become increasingly popular, both for business and personal use.<ref name=\"Computer Economics, Inc\">{{cite web| title = The Falling Costs of Mobile Computing| work = Falling Costs of Mobile Computing Drive Corporate Adoption| publisher = Computer Economics, Inc.|date=December 2005| url = http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1084| accessdate =1 November 2008 }}</ref> Around 109 million notebook PCs shipped worldwide in 2007, a growth of 33% compared to 2006.<ref name=\"ssev2011-09-12\">[http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20080131PD209.html Worldwide notebook shipments grow 33% on year in 2007, says IDC], 31 January 2008, Yen Ting Chen, DigiTimes, retrieved at 12 September 2011</ref> In 2008 it was estimated that 145.9 million notebooks were sold, and that the number would grow in 2009 to 177.7 million.<ref name=\"ee2009-01-10\">[http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=YN1M2POYEMEN0QSNDLSCKHA?articleID=212701251 Analysis: Did Intel underestimate netbook success?], Accessed at 10 January 2009</ref> The third quarter of 2008 was the first time when worldwide notebook PC shipments exceeded [[Desktop computer|desktops]], with 38.6 million units versus 38.5 million units.<ref name=\"Computer Economics, Inc\"/><ref name=\"is2009-01-13\">[http://www.isuppli.com/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=19823 Notebook PC Shipments Exceed Desktops for First Time in Q3], isuppli.com, accessed at 13 January 2009</ref><ref name=\"NYT09\">{{cite news| title =The PC Doesn't Have to Be an Anchor|work=The New York Times|author= Randall Stross| date =18 April 2008| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/business/19digi.html?_r=1&ref=technology| accessdate =20 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/04/17/intel_laptop_desktop_crossover/ |title=Intel: laptop/desktop crossover coming sooner than expected |work=The Register, UK |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007091449/http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/04/17/intel_laptop_desktop_crossover/ |archive-date=7 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMay 2005 was the first time notebooks outsold desktops in the US over the course of a full month; at the time notebooks sold for an average of $1,131 while desktops sold for an average of $696.<ref>Michael Singer.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.

Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred. Netbooks are a more basic and cheaper type of subnotebook, and while some ultrabooks have a screen size too large to qualify as subnotebooks, certain ultrabooks fit in the subnotebook category. One notable example of a subnotebook is the [[Apple MacBook Air]].\n\n===Netbook===\n{{main|Netbook}}\n\nThe netbook is an inexpensive, light-weight, energy-efficient form of laptop, especially suited for wireless communication and Internet access.<ref name=\"upenn\">{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-net-impact-of-netbooks-it-depends-on-who-uses-them-for-what/|title=The Net Impact of Netbooks?

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. These include [[Asus Transformer|Asus's Transformer Pad]] devices, examples of [[hybrid tablet|hybrids]] with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.\n\n===Desktop replacement===\n{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}\n{{See also|Gaming computer#Gaming laptop computers}}\n\nA desktop-replacement laptop is a class of large device which is not intended primarily for mobile use. These devices are bulkier and not as portable as other laptops, and are intended for use as compact and transportable alternatives to a desktop computer.<ref name=\"types_cnet\">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7602_7-1016082-2.html |title=Laptop Buying Guide |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. }}</ref> Desktop replacements are larger and typically heavier than other classes of laptops. They are capable of containing more powerful components and have a 15-inch or larger display.<ref name=\"types_cnet\"/> Desktop replacement laptops' operation time on batteries is typically shorter than other laptops; in rare cases they have no [[battery (electricity)|battery]] at all. In the past, some laptops in this class used a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance for the same price at the expense of battery life, although this practice has largely died out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html |title=Desktop notebooks stake their claim |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |date=8 January 2003 }}</ref> The names ''Media Center Laptops'' and ''Gaming Laptops'' are used to describe specialized notebook computers, often overlapping with the desktop replacement form factor.<ref name=\"types_pcmag\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2311016,00.asp |title= Types of Laptops: How Do You Compute |accessdate=7 November 2008 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. |date=18 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Rugged laptop===\n{{Main|Rugged computer}}\n\nA rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are usually designed from scratch, rather than adapted from regular consumer laptop models. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/rugged-laptop.html |title=Rugged Laptop: Choices, Pointers &amp; Specs of Buying Rugged Laptops |accessdate=27 November 2008 |publisher=Linux-on-laptops.com}}</ref> and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.\n\nThe design features found in rugged laptops include a rubber sheeting under the keyboard keys, sealed port and connector covers, passive cooling, very bright displays easily readable in daylight, cases and frames made of lightweight magnesium alloys that are much stronger than plastics found in commercial laptops, and solid-state storage devices or hard disk drives that are shock mounted to withstand constant vibrations. Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] and adapted to mobile use, although desktop systems increasingly use the same smaller, lower-power parts which were originally developed for mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D\u00e9 specialist voor smartphone, tablet en laptop reparaties|title=Laptop reparatie|url=https://www.smart-repair.nl/laptop/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Smartrepair Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Almere en Utrecht|agency=www.smart-repair.nl|date=4 January 2013|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable, with the exception of components which can be detached, such as a battery or CD/CDR/DVD drive. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large \"tower\" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new [[motherboard]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and other components can be added. In a very compact laptop, such as laplets, there may be no upgradeable components at all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+3+Teardown/26595|website=iFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]], and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards and inability to upgrade components.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Building Blocks Platform,|url=http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516184350/http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2006|publisher=Intel|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following sections summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts.<ref name=\"parts-kate\">{{cite web |title = What Makes Laptops Work&nbsp;\u2013 The Laptop Motherboard |url = http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/laptopstabletpcs/tp/laptopmotherboards.htm |author = Catherine Roseberry |publisher = About.com |accessdate =15 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Display===\nInternally, a display is an LCD panel which could be CCFL or LED [[Backlight|backlit]] which interfaces to the laptop using the [[LVDS]] protocol, while externally, it can be a glossy screen or a matte screen. Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor. SSDs have a higher data transfer rate, lower power consumption, lower failure rate, and a larger capacity<ref name=\"behardware 2011\">BeHardware reported lower retailer return rates for SSDs than HDDs between April and October 2010. {{cite web | url=http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | title=Components returns rates | date=6 May 2011 | publisher=BeHardware | first=Marc | last=Prieur | accessdate=10 February 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214142908/http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | archive-date=14 February 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>A 2011 study by [[Intel]] on the use of 45,000 SSDs reported an annualized failure rate of 0.61% for SSDs, compared with 4.85% for HDDs. {{cite web | url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/it-management/intel-it/intel-it-validating-reliability-of-intel-solid-state-drives-brief.html | title=Validating the Reliability of Intel\u00ae Solid-State Drives |publisher=Intel|date=July 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"behardware 2012\">{{cite web | url = http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | publisher = BeHardware | title = Components returns rates (7) | first = Marc | last = Prieur | date = 16 November 2012 | accessdate = 25 August 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809033951/http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | archive-date = 9 August 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Samsung 16TB SSD is the World's Largest Hard Drive|url = http://petapixel.com/2015/08/15/samsung-16tb-ssd-is-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/|website = PetaPixel|accessdate = 20 September 2015}}</ref> compared to HDDs. However, HDDs have a significantly lower cost.\n\nMost laptops can contain a single 2.5-inch drive, but a small number of laptops with a screen wider than 15 inches can house two drives. Some laptops support a hybrid mode, combining a 2.5-inch drive, typically a spacious HDD for data, with an mSATA or M.2 SDD drive, typically having less capacity, but a significantly faster read/write speed. The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters.

[[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time. The trolleys are used in schools that have replaced their traditional static computer labs<ref name=\"doug\">{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Dough|title=Getting rid of the ICT suite|url=http://dougwoods.co.uk/blog/getting-rid-of-the-ict-suite/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006051528/http://dougwoods.co.uk/blog/getting-rid-of-the-ict-suite/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 October 2010|work=Blog}}</ref> suites of desktop equipped with \"tower\" computers, but do not have enough plug sockets in an individual classroom to charge all of the devices.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use. It renders Web pages quickly, launches most applications without becoming too bogged down and generally doesn't feel like it's a budget laptop.''\" {{cite web | last = Reid | first = Rory | title = MSI Wind Review | publisher = CNET Australia | date = 7 July 2008 | url = http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | accessdate = 28 November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205092148/http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | archivedate = 5 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Most higher-end laptops are sufficiently powerful for high-resolution movie playback, some 3D gaming and video editing and encoding. However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.\n\n=====Neck and spine=====\nA laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a [[Docking station#Computer stands|computer stand]].\n\n=====Possible effect on fertility=====\nA study by [[State University of New York]] researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap, potentially putting [[sperm count]] at risk.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops.

Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft. Setting one's laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterwards), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186235/how-to-secure-your-computer-with-a-bios-or-uefi-password/|title=How to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186881/hard-disk-passwords-explained-should-you-set-one-to-secure-your-files/|title=Hard Disk Passwords Explained: Should You Set One to Secure Your Files?|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref> Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them,<ref>[http://www.intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html#.UP2bUFSzBJN#ixzz2Ucm2oKSg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040557/http://intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html|date=6 June 2013}}, Ponemon Institute, The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem, September 2010</ref> however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery.

Several major brands that offer notebooks in various classes are listed in the adjacent box.\nThe major brands usually offer good service and support, including well-executed documentation and driver downloads that remain available for many years after a particular laptop model is no longer produced. Capitalizing on service, support, and brand image, laptops from major brands are more expensive than laptops by smaller brands and [[Original design manufacturer|ODMs]]. Some brands specialize in a particular class of laptops, such as gaming laptops ([[Alienware]]), high-performance laptops ([[HP Envy]]), netbooks ([[EeePC]]) and laptops for children ([[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]]).\n\nMany brands, including the major ones, do not design and do not manufacture their laptops. Instead, a small number of Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) design new models of laptops, and the brands choose the models to be included in their lineup.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.
