She was also a [[journalist]] for the newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and won a [[National Newspaper Award]] in 1992 for critical writing.\n\n== Biography ==\nVal Ross was born in [[Toronto]] in 1950, to Jack and Erma Ross, and had one younger brother, Philip (\"Pip\"). Val attended the Institute of Child Study, a progressive primary school operated by the University of Toronto.  After completing high school at [[Jarvis Collegiate Institute]], she considered becoming a visual artist and studied at [[St Martin's School of Art]] in [[London, England]]. Eventually she graduated with a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Toronto]].\n\nBefore establishing her career as a freelance writer, she worked in [[urban planning]], tourism writing and as a broadcaster at [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].  She traveled extensively, developing her interests in community, culture and media.\n\nIn the early 1970s she began studying Washin Ryu, a form of karate taught by Sensei Burt Konzak, attaining a brown belt. Val was also highly involved with several groups of women in the Toronto area that met frequently for recreational walks (The \"Walking Women\").\n\nShe wrote for ''[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]]'', ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]'', and ''[[Toronto Life]]'', and then was hired as a staff writer and editor at ''[[Maclean's]]'', where she worked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She reported on the conflict in El Salvador, and became an important voice for human rights and freedom of expression.  She spent the remainder of her career at ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', as a publishing reporter, as deputy editor of the Comment section, and as an arts reporter.\n\nShe wrote two children's books, 2003's ''The Road to There'' and 2006's ''You Can't Read This''.

{"title_page": "The Midland Group", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2011}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2011}}\n'''The Midland Group''' was an organisation that presented new art in [[Nottingham]] and the [[East Midlands]] between 1943 and 1987.\n\n== History 1943\u20131987  ==\n\nThe Midland Group of Artists was established in Nottingham in 1943. Its first gallery occupied one room, at 38 Bridlesmith Gate. After several moves the group settled at 11 East Circus Street from 1961-1977.  Throughout the sixties, it provided \u2018a forum for progressive and experimental visual arts in Nottingham'.<ref>H. Neate (2012) \u2018Provinciality and the Art World: The Midland Group 1961-1977\u2019, Social and Cultural Geography 13(3): p. 275</ref>  In 1976 the group was re-formed as the Midland Art and Community Centre Ltd,<ref>Midland Group Archive, Nottinghamshire County Council (DDMA 1/16 [Administration])</ref> although it continued to be popularly known as the Midland Group. With the aid of a series of Arts Council grants, it re-located to new premises in the Lace Market district of Nottingham, leasing a property at Carlton Street from Nottingham City Council. The move officially took place in 1977, although the new premises only became usable in stages as various parts of the building were renovated and refurbished according to the Group\u2019s plans, creating designated spaces for administration, exhibitions, performance and cinema, as well as a roof terrace, bar and shop.<ref>Midland Group Archive, Nottinghamshire County Council (DDMA 1/24/1-72 [Administration])</ref>\n\nThe Midland Group frequently reached out to other regional arts centres around the country. Most prominent among these were Bristol\u2019s Arnolfini Gallery and the Ikon in Birmingham. A representative from the Arnolfini served on the general committee of the Midland Group in 1974  and in the same year, in the lead-up to company registration, a committee member had reported that the Ikon\u2019s constitution could \u2018serve as a good model\u2019 on which to base that of the Midland Group . In addition, there are records of an official visit conducted by the Director to the Arnolfini (1975) and an \u2018experimental cultural visit\u2019 to Amsterdam with the Ikon (1983).\n\nAt Carlton Street, the Midland Group continued to programme a wide range of events and exhibitions. Following its reincorporation as an Art Centre in 1976, a number of sub-committees were created in areas including Craft, Film, Fine Art, Photography and Performance. In the 1980s the Midland Group had a particularly profound effect on the development of Performance and Live Art, Its 'Performance Platform' organised by Steve Rogers, was the starting point for the National Review of Live Art.  \nAlso important to its work as an arts centre at this time was the Group\u2019s education programme, including outreach work with  local schools during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>Midland Group Archive, Nottinghamshire County Council (DDMA 6 [Education])</ref>\n\nWhen the Midland Group dissolved in 1987, its New Cinema was merged with the Nottingham Film Theatre to become City Lights Cinema. Likely contributing factors to its eventual dissolution in the 1980s were government spending cuts and problematic management regimes. Although they may be a subject of intrigue, the causes of its demise do not relate directly to the work that was carried out by the Group in terms of exhibitions, events and education.\n\n== Legacies  ==\n\n'''The New Midland Group''' is an artists' led consortium for Nottingham city made up of three independent artist studios Backlit, One Thoresby Street and Primary developing the ongoing legacy of The Midland Group.\n\n'''The Midland Group Archives (Nottinghamshire County Archive)'''\n\nThe Midland Group\u2019s collected paperwork was deposited with Nottinghamshire County Archive in January 1988. The period following company registration (1976-1987) contains the most comprehensive holdings and the earliest extent of the archive is a series of secretarial reports from 1961\u20131965. The period documented by the Archives records the Group\u2019s changing form, from a gallery to an arts centre, with the development of the new Carlton St premises being a key part of that process.\n\nUp until its incorporation as a limited company in 1976, the Midland Group is said to have \u2018always been organised on a fairly informal basis\u2019 . During this time, the key actor was Sylvia Cooper, who, in her role as the Group\u2019s first full-time Director from 1963, organised much of the Group\u2019s activities including writing to artists, events management, fundraising, curating exhibitions and hiring staff. During this time a general committee did exist, including representatives from the local city and county councils and the UK Arts Council.\n\nAfter Silvia Cooper\u2019s retirement from the Group in 1979, a number of group members were employed as Director or Acting Director. In 1983, funding was devolved from the Arts Council to East Midlands Arts, coinciding with the East Midlands Arts review of the Midland Group . In 1981 it was noted that the Arts Council and East Midlands Arts were \u2018unhappy with the structure of the Midland Group\u2019, a view which indicates the increased involvement of national and regional structures in the direction of the Group at this time.\n\n== Selected exhibitions and events (1961\u20131986)  ==\n*1961\tMidland Young Contemporaries\n*1961\tModern Argentine Painting & Sculpture\n*1962\tGroup Project One \u2013 A Demonstration of Visual Sensations\n*1962\tNew Art from Rhodesia\n*1966\tNew American Painting & Sculpture (Incl.

Its first gallery occupied one room, at 38 Bridlesmith Gate. After several moves the group settled at 11 East Circus Street from 1961-1977.  Throughout the sixties, it provided \u2018a forum for progressive and experimental visual arts in Nottingham'.<ref>H.

With the aid of a series of Arts Council grants, it re-located to new premises in the Lace Market district of Nottingham, leasing a property at Carlton Street from Nottingham City Council. The move officially took place in 1977, although the new premises only became usable in stages as various parts of the building were renovated and refurbished according to the Group\u2019s plans, creating designated spaces for administration, exhibitions, performance and cinema, as well as a roof terrace, bar and shop.<ref>Midland Group Archive, Nottinghamshire County Council (DDMA 1/24/1-72 [Administration])</ref>\n\nThe Midland Group frequently reached out to other regional arts centres around the country. Most prominent among these were Bristol\u2019s Arnolfini Gallery and the Ikon in Birmingham. A representative from the Arnolfini served on the general committee of the Midland Group in 1974  and in the same year, in the lead-up to company registration, a committee member had reported that the Ikon\u2019s constitution could \u2018serve as a good model\u2019 on which to base that of the Midland Group . In addition, there are records of an official visit conducted by the Director to the Arnolfini (1975) and an \u2018experimental cultural visit\u2019 to Amsterdam with the Ikon (1983).\n\nAt Carlton Street, the Midland Group continued to programme a wide range of events and exhibitions.

In its first week, the album sold 247,000 copies, debuting at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It was their third and last album released under [[Hollywood Records]], and their last before a hiatus, which lasted from October 2013 to March 2019.\n\n==Background==\nIn an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Nick Jonas explained the title, ''Lines, Vines and Trying Times'' as \"a bit of poetry we came up with on the set for the TV show.\" On the meaning, he stated, \"Lines are something that someone feeds you, whether it's good or bad. Vines are the things that get in the way of the path that you're on, and trying times \u2014 well, obviously we're younger guys, but we're aware of what's going on in the world and we're trying to bring some light to it.\" He noted, \"this new album for us, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a big jump, but it definitely is a progression in our music and a growth for us.

It was released June 16, 2009 in the US. The album received mixed reviews from critics and fans. In its first week, the album sold 247,000 copies, debuting at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It was their third and last album released under [[Hollywood Records]], and their last before a hiatus, which lasted from October 2013 to March 2019.\n\n==Background==\nIn an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Nick Jonas explained the title, ''Lines, Vines and Trying Times'' as \"a bit of poetry we came up with on the set for the TV show.\" On the meaning, he stated, \"Lines are something that someone feeds you, whether it's good or bad. Vines are the things that get in the way of the path that you're on, and trying times \u2014 well, obviously we're younger guys, but we're aware of what's going on in the world and we're trying to bring some light to it.\" He noted, \"this new album for us, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a big jump, but it definitely is a progression in our music and a growth for us. It has a lot more kinds of horns and a lot more strings.\" Added Joe Jonas, \"there\u2019s more to the music rather than just a typical kind of relationship song.\"\n\nIn another interview, Nick Jonas explained that the album is \"our journal in songs,\" mostly about \"all things we've gone through, personal experiences we get inspiration from.\" He also added that \"we've also been working on trying to use metaphors...to kind of mask a literal thing that happens to us.\" Kevin Jonas also added that \"the overall message is it's the same old Jonas Brothers, in a sense\" and that they will be adding \"different musical instruments that are going to add and build to the sound we already have.\" Musical influences for this album include [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Zutons]], [[Coldplay]] and [[Neil Diamond]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n==Promotion==\nThe Jonas Brothers were promoting the album on their [[Jonas Brothers World Tour 2009|2009 world tour]] which began on May 18, 2009 in [[Lima, Peru]].<ref name=\"JonasMyspace\">{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/jonasbrothers|title=Jonas Brothers at Myspace Music|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> The track \"Fly with Me\" was featured during the end credits of ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]''.<ref name=\"FlyWithMeNight\">{{cite web|url=http://music.ninemsn.com.au/blog.aspx?blogentryid=416187&showcomments=true|title=Jonas Brothers spend a Night at the Museum|accessdate=2009-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530114050/http://music.ninemsn.com.au/blog.aspx?blogentryid=416187&showcomments=true|archive-date=2009-05-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> They've hosted three live web chats via [[Facebook]] (May 7, May 28 and June 4) to promote the album.<ref name=\"livechat1\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=6|title=Thursday, May 07, 2009 - LIVE FACEBOOK WEBCAST TODAY 5PM PDT!!!|date=2009-05-07|publisher=Jonas Brothers via Myspace Blogs|accessdate=2009-06-05|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121211041606/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=6|archive-date=2012-12-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"livechat2&3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=2 |title=\"Friday, May 29, 2009 - Last Night's Chat\" and \"Friday, May 29, 2009 -  NEXT LIVE FACEBOOK WEBCAST JUNE 4TH!!!\" |date=2009-05-29 |publisher=Jonas Brothers via Myspace Blogs |accessdate=2009-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426201846/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=2 |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}</ref> The brothers performed songs off the album for a [[Wal-Mart]] Soundcheck [[concert]] which was released on June 9, 2009.<ref name=\"WalmartSoundcheck\">{{cite web|url=http://soundcheck.walmart.com/jonas-brothers|title=Soundcheck - Jonas Brothers|accessdate=2009-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524091219/http://soundcheck.walmart.com/jonas-brothers|archive-date=2009-05-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> They performed on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on June 12, 2009 as part of GMA's Summer Concert Series.<ref name=\"GMAConcertJonas\">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/SummerConcert/story?id=7502433&page=1\n| title=\"GMA\" summer concerts in central park|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> [[Radio Disney]] premiered all the songs from the album over a period of four days between June 11 and June 14.
