The largest membership is represented by [[the Scout Association]] of the [[United Kingdom]], while there is also a presence of [[traditional Scouting]] groups, such as the [[Baden-Powell Scouts' Association]].\n\nThe Scout Association administers the region into 9 [[Scout Counties]].\n\nThere are also student associations at various universities in the region, each of which is affiliated to the [[Student Scout and Guide Organisation]]. These are centred at [[Oxford University]] ([[Oxford University Scout and Guide Group]]\u2014the oldest such organisation in the United Kingdom), the [[University of Reading]], the [[University of Surrey]] and the [[University of Southampton]].<ref>[http://www.ssago.org.uk/clubs/england/ SSAGO England]</ref><ref>[http://www.ousgg.org.uk/history.html OUSGG History]</ref>\n\n==The Scout Association Counties==\n\n===Royal Berkshire Scout County===\n\n[[File:Royal Berkshire Scout County (The Scout Association).png|thumb|100px|County badge as worn on the uniform of Scouting members in '''Royal Berkshire''']]\n\n'''Royal Berkshire''' is a Scout County concurrent with the [[ceremonial county]] of [[Berkshire]], and provides Scouting opportunities for 7,500 young people and adults in the area. The County includes the towns of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Bracknell]], [[Slough]] and [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], and their immediate environs.<ref>[http://www.berkshirescouts.org.uk/ Berkshire Scouts Website]</ref>\n\nManagement of Scouting in the County of Berkshire is currently divided into eleven [[Scout District]]s:\n\n* Kennet District\n* Loddon District\n* Maidenhead District<ref>[http://www.maidenheadscouts.org.uk/ Maidenhead District]</ref>\n* Pang Valley District\n* Reading Central District\n* Slough District\n* South Berkshire District\n* South-East Berkshire District\n* Taceham Hundred District\n* Windsor and Eton District\n* Wokingham District\n\n<gallery perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Loddon District (The Scout Association).png\nFile:Reading Central District (The Scout Association).png\nFile:Taceham Hundred District (The Scout Association).png\n</gallery>\n\nThe district map has been redrawn several time through the county's history, with the latest change at the end of 2005 to merge the district of East Reading into its two neighbours, Reading Central and Loddon.\n\nSome aspects of Scouting are run cross-District, for example, Pang Valley and Reading Central have been running a shared [[Young Leaders (The Scout Association)|Young Leader]] programme since late 2005, and the [[Explorer Scouts|Explorer Scout]] Units have been running joint activities and events, too.<ref>[http://www.reading-explorers.co.uk Reading Explorer Scouts]</ref>\n\n====Notable Scout Groups====\n\n* The ''1st Reading (YMCA) Sea Scout Group'' is one of the founding troops of 1908.<ref name=\"tsa_first_tps\">{{cite web | title = The First Troops | publisher = The Scout Association |date=August 2006 | url = http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs295303.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2007-02-14}}</ref>\n\n====WINGS====<!-- This section is linked from [[World Scout Jamboree]] and Wing (disambiguation)-->\nWINGS is a major event, open to all Scouts and Guides aged 10 to 25 in all parts of the world, and is normally held every 5 years in the County. It is a collaboration between Berkshire Scouts and [[Girlguiding South West England|Girlguiding Royal Berkshire]]. Participants camp in [[Windsor Great Park]], where many of the activities also take place. Other nearby sites are also made use of, such as Dorneywood Scout Camp and Wraysbury Lake.\n\nThe most recent event took place in August 2009 and provided an international experience with seven days of adventure, challenge and fun with opportunities to work with others from across the world and build new and lasting friendships. This was a year later than normal due to the World Scout Jamboree taking place in 2007.<ref>[http://www.wings2009.org.uk WINGS 2009]</ref> WINGS2009 was themed on Making A Difference, with participants encouraged to consider their role in making a positive impact on the lives of others alongside taking part in the fun, challenge and adventure offered by Scouting and Guiding.\n\nThe next event is due in the summer of 2014. It is anticipated to be around the same time as previous events in Windsor Great Park. The Steering Group was established in September 2010 and reports to the trustees of both organisations on high-level planning, financial budgeting and risk management.
