Although combined stations and hotels were common in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 19th century, Place Viger was the only such combination in Canada.\n\nPlace Viger was designed by [[Bruce Price]] for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], and was built near what was then the central core of Montreal, in proximity to the [[Old Montreal|financial district]], the [[Montreal City Hall|city hall]], the port and the court house.  The mayor of Montreal, [[Raymond Pr\u00e9fontaine]], strongly encouraged its construction in an area central to the [[French Canadian]] \u00e9lites, in contrast to the rival [[Windsor Hotel (Montreal)|Windsor Hotel]] to the west, which was perceived to cater to the city's [[English language|anglophone]] classes. The rail station served as the terminus of the CP passenger rail lines running into downtown Montreal from the north and east. It replaced the older [[Dalhousie Station (Montreal)|Dalhousie Station]]. Its counterpart terminus for CP passenger rail lines running into downtown Montreal from the south and west was [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]].\n\nConstructed in the [[Ch\u00e2teauesque|French ch\u00e2teau-style]] common to [[Canada's railway hotels|railway hotels]] built by Canadian Pacific, Place Viger housed the railway station in its lower levels and a luxurious hotel on the upper floors. Place Viger enjoyed an enviable setting adjacent to the gardens of Viger Square, allowing both railway travellers and hotel guests to stroll along the garden paths.  \n\nThe shifting of Montreal's commercial core to the north-west, and the onset of the [[Great Depression in Canada|economic depression]] of the 1930s, proved disastrous for Place Viger.  The hotel closed in 1935.  In 1951, the railway station was also closed, and the building was sold to the City of Montreal.  The interiors were gutted and transformed into nondescript office space, and the building was renamed ''\u00c9difice Jacques-Viger''. \n[[File:PlaceViger.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|Place Viger, {{circa|1900}}]]\nThe Viger Square gardens were destroyed in the 1970s to allow for the construction of the [[Quebec Autoroute 720|''Autoroute Ville-Marie'' highway]]. After the highway was completed, although a new [[Viger Square]] was created on the concrete deck covering the highway, it was poorly designed, desolate and underused, despite sculptural works by artists including [[Charles Daudelin]]. For decades, the old Place Viger station sat isolated and neglected, a striking historic building surrounded by parking lots and concrete.\n[[File:Place Viger Hotel & station, Montreal.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|left|[[Detroit Publishing Company|Detroit Publishing Co.]] [[Photographic plate|glass negative]], {{circa|1901}}]]\n\n[[File:Place Viger about 1901.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|View from gardens, {{circa|1901}}]]\nIn 2003, the ''[[Commission scolaire de Montr\u00e9al]]'', the City of Montreal and the Quebec provincial government announced that Place Viger would house a new ''\u00c9cole des m\u00e9tiers du tourisme'' (a school of tourism).  In 2004, the [[Ville-Marie (borough)|Borough of Ville-Marie]] announced that it would restore what remains of the nearby public gardens, by replacing much of the concrete in Viger Square with trees, paths and other soft landscaping.\n\nPlace Viger was sold in 2005 to a developer who intended to convert the building to apartments and a new hotel.

Although combined stations and hotels were common in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 19th century, Place Viger was the only such combination in Canada.\n\nPlace Viger was designed by [[Bruce Price]] for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], and was built near what was then the central core of Montreal, in proximity to the [[Old Montreal|financial district]], the [[Montreal City Hall|city hall]], the port and the court house.  The mayor of Montreal, [[Raymond Pr\u00e9fontaine]], strongly encouraged its construction in an area central to the [[French Canadian]] \u00e9lites, in contrast to the rival [[Windsor Hotel (Montreal)|Windsor Hotel]] to the west, which was perceived to cater to the city's [[English language|anglophone]] classes. The rail station served as the terminus of the CP passenger rail lines running into downtown Montreal from the north and east. It replaced the older [[Dalhousie Station (Montreal)|Dalhousie Station]]. Its counterpart terminus for CP passenger rail lines running into downtown Montreal from the south and west was [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]].\n\nConstructed in the [[Ch\u00e2teauesque|French ch\u00e2teau-style]] common to [[Canada's railway hotels|railway hotels]] built by Canadian Pacific, Place Viger housed the railway station in its lower levels and a luxurious hotel on the upper floors. Place Viger enjoyed an enviable setting adjacent to the gardens of Viger Square, allowing both railway travellers and hotel guests to stroll along the garden paths.  \n\nThe shifting of Montreal's commercial core to the north-west, and the onset of the [[Great Depression in Canada|economic depression]] of the 1930s, proved disastrous for Place Viger.  The hotel closed in 1935.  In 1951, the railway station was also closed, and the building was sold to the City of Montreal.  The interiors were gutted and transformed into nondescript office space, and the building was renamed ''\u00c9difice Jacques-Viger''. \n[[File:PlaceViger.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|Place Viger, {{circa|1900}}]]\nThe Viger Square gardens were destroyed in the 1970s to allow for the construction of the [[Quebec Autoroute 720|''Autoroute Ville-Marie'' highway]]. After the highway was completed, although a new [[Viger Square]] was created on the concrete deck covering the highway, it was poorly designed, desolate and underused, despite sculptural works by artists including [[Charles Daudelin]]. For decades, the old Place Viger station sat isolated and neglected, a striking historic building surrounded by parking lots and concrete.\n[[File:Place Viger Hotel & station, Montreal.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|left|[[Detroit Publishing Company|Detroit Publishing Co.]] [[Photographic plate|glass negative]], {{circa|1901}}]]\n\n[[File:Place Viger about 1901.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|View from gardens, {{circa|1901}}]]\nIn 2003, the ''[[Commission scolaire de Montr\u00e9al]]'', the City of Montreal and the Quebec provincial government announced that Place Viger would house a new ''\u00c9cole des m\u00e9tiers du tourisme'' (a school of tourism).  In 2004, the [[Ville-Marie (borough)|Borough of Ville-Marie]] announced that it would restore what remains of the nearby public gardens, by replacing much of the concrete in Viger Square with trees, paths and other soft landscaping.\n\nPlace Viger was sold in 2005 to a developer who intended to convert the building to apartments and a new hotel. However, the developer suffered financial difficulties and finally resold the property in 2012.<ref>http://coolopolis.blogspot.ca/2012/12/viger-square-hotel-80-years-of.html</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, the new owner, real estate developer Jesta along with partners, announced a $250 million mixed-use redevelopment plan for the complex, including residential and office space.<ref name=\"Bergeron\">{{cite news|url=http://affaires.lapresse.ca/economie/immobilier/201405/28/01-4770671-projet-de-250-millions-a-la-gare-viger.php|title=Projet de 250 millions \u00e0 la Gare Viger|last=Bergeron|first=Maxime|work=[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]|publisher=28 May 2014|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> In September of that same year, software provider [[Lightspeed (company)|Lightspeed]] announced that it would be moving its Montreal offices to the Viger complex.<ref name=\"Magder\">{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/as-lightspeed-moves-into-new-digs-it-will-be-hard-to-match-current-space|title=As Lightspeed moves into new digs, it will be hard to match current space|last=Magder|first=Jason|date=17 September 2014|work=Montreal Gazette|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> [[Lightspeed (company)|Lightspeed]] moved in Viger castle in April 2015.<ref>http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1529803/redevelopment-of-gare-viger-first-phase-nearing-completion-as-lightspeed-and-brasseur-de-montreal-take-up-residence Redevelopment of Gare Viger</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |title= Castles of the North: Canada's grand hotels|editor1-last= Chisholm|editor1-first= Barbara|year= 2001|publisher= Lynx Images|location= [[Toronto]]|isbn= 978-1-894073-14-1|oclc= 45190818}}\n*{{cite book |title= Montreal metropolis, 1880-1930|editor1-last= Gournay|editor1-first= Isabelle|editor2-last= Vanlaethem|editor2-first= France|year= 1998|publisher= [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]], [[Fitzhenry & Whiteside|Stoddart]]|location= Toronto|isbn= 978-0-7737-5974-9|oclc= 47971401}}\n* http://coolopolis.blogspot.ca/2012/12/viger-square-hotel-80-years-of.html\n{{refend}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Place Viger}}\n*[http://www.csdm.qc.ca/Csdm/communiques/2003/C_2003_03_10_1.asp Commission scolaire de Montr\u00e9al - Le ch\u00e2teau du tourisme] {{in lang|fr}}\n*[http://bibnum2.banq.qc.ca/bna/patrie/src/1908/12/09/82779_063_0511.pdf 1908 article in ''La Patrie'' announcing construction of annex] {{in lang|fr}}\n*[http://www.vigerdmc.com/documents/fr/3_13.pdf Interior view of Place Viger, May 2007]\n*[http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1529803/redevelopment-of-gare-viger-first-phase-nearing-completion-as-lightspeed-and-brasseur-de-montreal-take-up-residence Redevelopment of Gare Viger - First phase nearing completion as Lightspeed and Brasseur de Montr\u00e9al take up residence]\n\n{{Canada's railway hotels}}\n{{Defunct hotels in Canada}}\n\n[[Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1898]]\n[[Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1898]]\n[[Category:Hotels in Montreal]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Montreal]]\n[[Category:Defunct hotels in Canada]]\n[[Category:Old Montreal]]\n[[Category:Ch\u00e2teauesque architecture in Canada]]\n[[Category:Disused railway stations in Canada]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1898]]\n[[Category:Hotels established in 1898]]\n[[Category:Hotels disestablished in 1935]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 1951]]\n[[Category:Canadian Pacific Railway hotels]]\n[[Category:Canadian Pacific Railway stations in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Montreal]]\n[[Category:1898 establishments in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Bruce Price buildings]]\n[[Category:1951 disestablishments in Quebec]]\n", "name_user": "Objectivesea", "label": "safe", "comment": "in --> into", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_Viger"}

She starred in ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965), playing [[Maria von Trapp]], and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]].\n\nBetween 1964 and 1986, she starred in ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' (1964), ''[[Hawaii (1966 film)|Hawaii]]'' (1966), ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966), ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' (1967), ''[[Star!

When a young Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by a [[ENT specialist|throat specialist]], the doctor concluded that she had \"an almost adult [[larynx]].\"<ref name=\":0\" /> In spite of the fact that her voice teacher, English soprano [[Lilian Stiles-Allen]], continually encouraged her to pursue opera, Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and \"too big a stretch\". At the time, Andrews described her own voice as \"extremely high and thin\", feeling that it lacked \"the necessary guts and weight for opera\", preferring musical theatre instead. As Andrews aged, so did her voice, which began to naturally deepen. Losing her vast upper register, her \"top notes\" became increasingly difficult to sing while \"her middle register matured into the warm golden tone\" for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|title = Julie Andrews, the operatic sensation that never was|date = 26 May 2014|accessdate = 23 August 2014|website = The Daily Telegraphy|publisher = Telegraph Media Group Limited|last = Wong|first = Tim|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306122658/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|archive-date = 6 March 2016|url-status=dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMusically, Andrews had always preferred singing music that was \"bright and sunny\", choosing to avoid songs that were sad, depressing, upsetting, or written in a minor key, for fear of losing her voice \"in a mess of emotion\".
