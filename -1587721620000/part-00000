There is zero empirical scientific evidence supporting the law of attraction, and it is widely considered a pseudoscience. \n\nAdvocates generally combine [[cognitive reframing]] techniques with affirmations and [[creative visualization]] to replace limiting or self-destructive (\"negative\") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive (\"positive\") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is the idea that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also \"feel\" (through [[creative visualization]]) that the desired changes have already occurred. This combination of positive thought and positive emotion is believed to allow one to attract positive experiences and opportunities by achieving resonance with the proposed energetic law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/what-is-the-law-of-attraction/|title=What Is The Law Of Attraction|last1=Hurst|first1=Katherine|date=|website=The Law Of Attraction|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe Law of Attraction has no scientific basis<ref name=\"Scientific American\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Shermer | first = Michael\n  | authorlink = Michael Shermer\n  | title = The (Other) Secret\n  | journal = [[Scientific American]]\n  | volume = 296\n  | issue = 6\n  | pages = 39\n  | date = 1 June 2007\n  | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0607-39\n  | pmid = 17663221\n }}</ref> and has been dubbed a [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=\"Live Science\">{{cite web\n  | last = Radford | first = Benjamin\n  | authorlink = Benjamin Radford\n  | title = The Pseudoscience of 'The Secret'\n  | work = [[Live Science]]\n  | date = 3 February 2009\n  | url = http://www.livescience.com/5303-pseudoscience-secret.html\n  | accessdate = 31 March 2017\n}}</ref> A number of researchers have criticized the misuse of scientific concepts by its proponents.<ref name=\"Scientific American\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=Cosmic Mind |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |publisher=University of Colorado |authorlink=Victor_Stenger |pages=8\u201319 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924013317/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"Leon Lederman 1993 189\u2013198\">{{cite book |title=The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question |pages=189\u2013198 |author=Leon Lederman |author2=Dick Teresi |date=1993 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}</ref><ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci Non-science posing as science; Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[New Thought]] movement grew out of the teachings of [[Phineas Quimby]] in the early 19th century. Early in his life, Quimby was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Early 19th century medicine had no reliable cure for tuberculosis. Quimby took to horse riding and noted that intense excitement temporarily relieved him from his affliction. This method for relieving his pain and seemingly subsequent recovery prompted Phineas to pursue a study of \"Mind over Body\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=n|title=Phineas Parkhurst Quimby|url=http://phineasquimby.wwwhubs.com/|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>  Although he never used the words \"Law of Attraction\", he explained this in a statement that captured the concept in the field of health: {{quote|the trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in, and we put a value on it according to its worth. Therefore if your mind has been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth, I come in contact with your enemy and restore you to your health and happiness. This I do partly mentally and partly by talking till I correct the wrong impressions and establish the Truth, and the Truth is the cure.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Quimby Manuscripts|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/quimbyPhineas/manuscripts/pages/quimby-manuscripts-194.htm|publisher=New Thought library|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn 1877, the term \"Law of Attraction\" appeared in print for the first time in a book written by the Russian occultist [[Helena Blavatsky]], in a context alluding to an attractive power existing between elements of spirit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Isis Unveiled|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/isis/iu1-10.htm|publisher=Theosophical University Press, page 340|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first articulator of the Law as general principle was [[Prentice Mulford]]. Mulford, a pivotal figure in the development of New Thought thinking, discusses the Law of Attraction at length in his essay \"The Law of Success\",<ref>{{cite book|title=Your Forces and How to Use Them, Vol. 1|url=https://archive.org/stream/yourforcesandho09mulfgoog#page/n66/mode/2up|publisher=New York, F.J.

In this, Mulford was followed by other New Thought authors, such as Henry Wood (starting with his ''God\u2019s Image in Man'',<ref>{{cite book|title=God's Image in Man, Ch. 6, \"The Universality of Law\"|url=https://archive.org/stream/godsimageinmans01woodgoog#page/n134/mode/2up|publisher=Lee and Shepard Publishers, 1892}}</ref> 1892), and [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] (starting with his first book, ''What All the World's A-Seeking'',<ref>{{cite book|title=What All the World's A-Seeking|url=https://archive.org/details/whatallworldsas00tringoog|publisher=New Canaan, Conn., Keats Pub|year=1973}}</ref> 1896).

The belief was that for students to succeed academically (and largely, in life), they must develop a positive sense of their own self-worth. The rationale behind this theory comes from the perspective that people who are successful are also generally positive when discussing their success (e.g., motivational speakers), therefore one\u2019s success must be related to how they view themselves. Thus, the American education system received a complete reconstruction to ensure students felt valued in their academic efforts. Grading curves were implemented so that fewer students were held back, honour rolls were removed to prevent lower-achieving individuals from feeling disappointed in themselves, and teachers could no longer grade assignments using red ink as this was viewed as \u201cstigmatizing\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Skeptic |date=2009|volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=30-38 |title=Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the positive thinking movement|last1=Salerno |first1=S }}</ref>. Students were no longer held to the same standard of achievement. It was later realized that this system was ultimately unsuccessful in promoting success; lower-achieving students who were advanced further into higher-level grades were unable, or unwilling to, garner an understanding of the curriculum. Thus, in spite of having grandiose self-value, student academic achievement was unable to match it.

There is zero empirical scientific evidence supporting the law of attraction, and it is widely considered a pseudoscience. \n\nAdvocates generally combine [[cognitive reframing]] techniques with affirmations and [[creative visualization]] to replace limiting or self-destructive (\"negative\") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive (\"positive\") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is the idea that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also \"feel\" (through [[creative visualization]]) that the desired changes have already occurred. This combination of positive thought and positive emotion is believed to allow one to attract positive experiences and opportunities by achieving resonance with the proposed energetic law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/what-is-the-law-of-attraction/|title=What Is The Law Of Attraction|last1=Hurst|first1=Katherine|date=|website=The Law Of Attraction|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe Law of Attraction has no scientific basis<ref name=\"Scientific American\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Shermer | first = Michael\n  | authorlink = Michael Shermer\n  | title = The (Other) Secret\n  | journal = [[Scientific American]]\n  | volume = 296\n  | issue = 6\n  | pages = 39\n  | date = 1 June 2007\n  | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0607-39\n  | pmid = 17663221\n }}</ref> and has been dubbed a [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=\"Live Science\">{{cite web\n  | last = Radford | first = Benjamin\n  | authorlink = Benjamin Radford\n  | title = The Pseudoscience of 'The Secret'\n  | work = [[Live Science]]\n  | date = 3 February 2009\n  | url = http://www.livescience.com/5303-pseudoscience-secret.html\n  | accessdate = 31 March 2017\n}}</ref> A number of researchers have criticized the misuse of scientific concepts by its proponents.<ref name=\"Scientific American\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=Cosmic Mind |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |publisher=University of Colorado |authorlink=Victor_Stenger |pages=8\u201319 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924013317/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"Leon Lederman 1993 189\u2013198\">{{cite book |title=The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question |pages=189\u2013198 |author=Leon Lederman |author2=Dick Teresi |date=1993 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}</ref><ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci Non-science posing as science; Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[New Thought]] movement grew out of the teachings of [[Phineas Quimby]] in the early 19th century. Early in his life, Quimby was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Early 19th century medicine had no reliable cure for tuberculosis. Quimby took to horse riding and noted that intense excitement temporarily relieved him from his affliction. This method for relieving his pain and seemingly subsequent recovery prompted Phineas to pursue a study of \"Mind over Body\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=n|title=Phineas Parkhurst Quimby|url=http://phineasquimby.wwwhubs.com/|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>  Although he never used the words \"Law of Attraction\", he explained this in a statement that captured the concept in the field of health: {{quote|the trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in, and we put a value on it according to its worth. Therefore if your mind has been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth, I come in contact with your enemy and restore you to your health and happiness.

In this, Mulford was followed by other New Thought authors, such as Henry Wood (starting with his ''God\u2019s Image in Man'',<ref>{{cite book|title=God's Image in Man, Ch. 6, \"The Universality of Law\"|url=https://archive.org/stream/godsimageinmans01woodgoog#page/n134/mode/2up|publisher=Lee and Shepard Publishers, 1892}}</ref> 1892), and [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] (starting with his first book, ''What All the World's A-Seeking'',<ref>{{cite book|title=What All the World's A-Seeking|url=https://archive.org/details/whatallworldsas00tringoog|publisher=New Canaan, Conn., Keats Pub|year=1973}}</ref> 1896).

Holding the belief that positive thinking will manifest positivity in one\u2019s life diminishes the value of hard work and perseverance, such as in the 1970s pursual of \u201cself-esteem-based education\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Skeptic |date=2009|volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=30-38 |title=Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the positive thinking movement|last1=Salerno |first1=S }}</ref>. The belief was that for students to succeed academically (and largely, in life), they must develop a positive sense of their own self-worth. The rationale behind this theory comes from the perspective that people who are successful are also generally positive when discussing their success (e.g., motivational speakers), therefore one\u2019s success must be related to how they view themselves. Thus, the American education system received a complete reconstruction to ensure students felt valued in their academic efforts. Grading curves were implemented so that fewer students were held back, honour rolls were removed to prevent lower-achieving individuals from feeling disappointed in themselves, and teachers could no longer grade assignments using red ink as this was viewed as \u201cstigmatizing\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Skeptic |date=2009|volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=30-38 |title=Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the positive thinking movement|last1=Salerno |first1=S }}</ref>. Students were no longer held to the same standard of achievement. It was later realized that this system was ultimately unsuccessful in promoting success; lower-achieving students who were advanced further into higher-level grades were unable, or unwilling to, garner an understanding of the curriculum. Thus, in spite of having grandiose self-value, student academic achievement was unable to match it. While empirical research has shown that there is an existing relationship between student self-worth and school achievement <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=2008|volume=45|pages=559-564 |title=Relations of academic and general self-esteem to school achievement|last1=Pullmann |first1=H |last2=Allik|first2=J }}</ref>, the motivation of students to work hard and achieve based on their own academic merit cannot be discounted.\n\n==Prominent supporters==\n\n* In 1891 Californian author and humorist [[Prentice Mulford]] used the term Law of Attraction in his essays ''Some Laws of Health and Beauty'' and ''Good And Ill Effects of Thought''.\n* In 1897 [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] wrote ''In Tune with the Infinite''.

Some of the major topics in this field include [[social status]], structural \npower, [[Social change|sociocultural change]], [[social inequality]] and [[prejudice]], [[leadership]] and [[Group behaviour|intra-group behavior]], [[Social exchange theory|social exchange]], [[group conflict]], [[impression formation]] and [[Impression management|management]], [[Conversation analysis|conversation structures]], [[socialization]], [[social constructionism]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[role]]s, and [[emotional labor]]. \n\nThe primary methods of data collection are [[Sampling (statistics)|sample surveys]], [[Observational study|field observations]], [[Vignette (psychology)|vignette studies]], [[field experiment]]s, and [[Design of experiments|controlled experiments]].\n\n== History ==\nSociological social psychology emerged in 1902 with a landmark study by sociologist [[Charles Cooley]], entitled ''Human Nature and the Social Order'', which presented Cooley's concept of the [[Looking-glass self|''looking-glass self'']]. The first textbook in social psychology by a sociologist appeared in 1908: ''Social Psychology'' by [[Edward Alsworth Ross]]. The area's main journal was founded as ''Sociometry'' by [[Jacob L. Moreno]] in 1937, however its name would change to ''Social Psychology'' in 1978, and to ''[[Social Psychology Quarterly]]'' in 1979.\n\nIn the 1920s, [[W. I. Thomas]] contributed the notion of the [[definition of the situation|''definition of the situation'']], with a proposition, referred to as ''the'' ''[[Thomas theorem]]'', that became a basic tenet of sociology and sociological social psychology: \"if men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOne of the major currents of theory in this area sprang from work by philosopher and sociologist [[George Herbert Mead]] at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1894 forward.  Mead generally is credited as the founder of [[symbolic interactionism]]. Mead's colleague and disciple at Chicago, sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]], coined the name of the framework in 1937.\n\nSociologist [[Talcott Parsons]], at [[Harvard University]] from 1927 forward, developed a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] [[Action theory (sociology)|theory of action]] which was adapted to [[Communication in small groups|small group research]] by Parsons' student and colleague, [[Robert Freed Bales]], resulting in a body of observational studies of [[Social relation|social interaction]] in groups using Bales' behavior coding scheme, Interaction Process Analysis.<ref>Bales, Robert Freed (1950), ''Interaction Process Analysis'', New York: Addison-Wesley. Some studies using the method are included in Hare, A. Paul, Edgar F. Borgatta, & R. F. Bales (1955), ''Small Groups: Studies in Social Interaction'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf.</ref> During his 41-year tenure at Harvard, Bales mentored a distinguished group of sociological social psychologists concerned with [[Group dynamics|group processes]] and other topics in sociological social psychology.<ref>See the list of Bales' students at pages 332-3 of R. F. Bales (1999), ''Social Interaction Systems: Theory and Measurement'', New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction.</ref>\n\n==Major frameworks==\n\n=== Symbolic interactionism ===\n{{main|Symbolic interactionism}}\nContemporary symbolic interactionism originated out of ideas of George Herbert Mead and [[Max Weber]]. In this framework meanings are constructed during social interaction, and constructed meanings influence the process of social interaction. Many symbolic interactionists see the self as a core meaning constructed through social relations, and influencing social relations.\n\nThe structural school of symbolic interactionism uses shared social knowledge from a [[Macrosociology|macro-level]] [[culture]], [[natural language]], [[Institution|social institution]], or [[organization]] to explain relatively enduring patterns of social interaction and psychology at the [[Microsociology|micro-level]], typically investigating these matters with [[Quantitative research|quantitative methods]]. Identity theory,<ref>[[Sheldon Stryker|Stryker, Sheldon]], & Burke, Peter J. (2000). \"The past, present, and future of an identity theory\". ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''63''': 284\u2013297. Burke, P. J., and Jan E. Stets (2009). ''Identity Theory'', New York, Oxford University Press.</ref> [[affect control theory]],<ref>Heise, David R. (1979). ''Understanding Events: Affect and the Construction of Social Action'', New York: Cambridge University Press. MacKinnon, N. J. (1994). ''Symbolic Interactionism as Affect Control'', Albany, NY, State University of New York Press. Heise, D. R. (2007). ''Expressive Orider: Confirming Sentiments in Social Actions'', New York, Springer.</ref> and the Iowa School<ref>Miller, Dan E. (2011). \"Toward a Theory of Interaction: The Iowa School,\" ''Symbolic Interaction'' '''34''': 340-348.</ref> are major programs of research in this tradition. Identity Theory and Affect Control Theory both focus on how actions control mental states, thereby manifesting the underlying cybernetic nature of the approach, evident in Mead's writings<ref>MacKinnon, Neil J. (1994). ''Symbolic Interactionism as Affect Control'', Albany, NY, State University of New York Press. Pp. 3-5.</ref> Affect Control Theory provides a [[mathematical model]] of [[role theory]] and of [[labeling theory]].\n\nProcess symbolic interactionism stems from the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] and considers the meanings underlying social interactions to be situated, creative, fluid, and often contested. Researchers in this tradition frequently use [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] methods. A journal, ''Symbolic Interaction'', was founded in 1977 by the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction as a central outlet for the empirical research and [[Conceptual system|conceptual studies]] produced by scholars in this area.\n\n[[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] symbolic interactionists understand the notions of self and identity to be increasingly fragmented and illusory, and consider attempts at theorizing to be [[meta-narrative]]s with no more authority than other conversations. The approach is presented in detail by ''The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research''.<ref>Denzin, Norman K. and Yvonna S. Lincoln, Eds. (2005). ''The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research'', Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage Publications.</ref>\n\n=== Social exchange ===\n{{main|Social exchange theory}}\n[[Social exchange theory]] emphasizes the idea that social action is the result of ''personal choices'' made in order to maximize benefits and minimize costs. A key component of this theory is the postulation of the ''\"comparison level of alternatives\"'', which is the actor's sense of the best possible alternative (i.e. the choice with the highest net benefits or lowest net costs).\n\nTheories of social exchange share many essential features with classical economic theories like [[rational choice theory]]. However, social exchange theories differ from economic theories by making predictions about the relationships between persons, and not just the evaluation of goods. For example, social exchange theories  have been used to predict human behaviour in romantic relationships by taking into account each actor's subjective sense of costs (i.e., volatility, economic dependence), benefits (i.e., attraction, chemistry, attachment), and comparison level of alternatives (i.e., if any viable alternative mates are available).\n\n=== Theory of status characteristics and expectation states ===\n{{main|Expectation states theory}}\n[[Expectation states theory]] and its popular \"sub-theory\", status characteristics theory, proposes that individuals use available social information to form expectations for themselves and others. Group members use stereotypes about competence to attempt to determine who will be comparatively more skilled in any given task, indicating to whom the group should listen and accord [[Social status|status]]. Group members use known ability on the task at hand, membership in social categories (race, gender, age, education, etc.), and observed dominance behaviors (glares, rate of speech, interruptions, etc.) to determine everyone's relative ability and assign rank accordingly. While exhibiting dominant behavior or being of a certain race, for instance, has no direct connection to actual ability, implicit cultural beliefs about who is relatively more or less socially valued drive group members to \"act as if\" they believe some people have more useful contributions than others. As such, the theory has been used to explain the rise, persistence, and enactment of [[social status|status hierarchies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|title=Why Status Matters for Inequality|journal=American Sociological Review|date=2014|volume=79|issue=1|pages=1\u201316|doi=10.1177/0003122413515997}}</ref>\n\n=== Social structure and personality ===\nThis research perspective deals with relationships between large-scale social systems and individual behaviors and mental states including feelings, attitudes and values, and mental faculties.<ref>McLeod, Jane D. and Kathryn J. Lively (2003). \u201cSocial Structure and Personality.\u201d Pp. 77-102 in ''Handbook of Social Psychology'' edited by [[John DeLamater|J. DeLamater]]. New York: Kluwer/Plenum.</ref> Some researchers focus on issues of health and how social networks bring useful social support to the ill. Another line of research deals with how education, occupation, and other components of social class impact values. Some studies assess emotional variations, especially in happiness versus alienation and anger, among individuals in different structural positions.\n\n=== Social influence ===\n{{Main|Social influence}}\nSocial influence is a factor in every individual's life. Social influence takes place when one's thoughts, actions and feelings are affected by other people. It is a way of interaction that affects individual behavior and can occur within groups and between groups. It is a fundamental process that affects ways of socialization, conformity, leadership and social change.<ref>Smith, J. R., Louis, W. R., & Schultz, P. W. (2011). Introduction: Social influence in action. Group Processes & GP Intergroup Relations, 14(5), 599\u2013603.</ref>\n\n=== Dramaturgy ===\nAnother aspect of microsociology aims to focus on individual behavior in social settings. One specific researcher in the field, [[Erving Goffman]], claims that humans tend to believe that they are actors on a stage. He explains his theories in his book [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]. He argues that as a result, individuals will further proceed with their actions based on the response of that individual's 'audience' or in other words, the people to whom he is speaking. Much like a play, Goffman believes that rules of conversing and communication exist: to display confidence, display sincerity, and avoid infractions which are otherwise known as embarrassing situations. Breaches of such rules are what make social situations awkward.<ref>{{cite web|author=Your Name Here |url=http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/TheoryNotes/Goffman.htm |title=Goffman: PSEL |publisher=Soc.duke.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Group processes ===\nFrom the sociological perspective, group processes scholars study how [[Power (social and political)|power]], [[Social status|status]], [[justice]], and [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] impact the structure and interactions that take place within groups. Group processes scholars study how group size affects the type and quality of interactions that take place between group members, an area of study initiated by the work of the German social theorist, [[Georg Simmel]]. '''Dyads''' consist of two people and '''triads''' consist of three people, and the fundamental difference is that one person who leaves a dyad dissolves that group whereas the same is not true of a triad. The difference between these two types of groups also indicates the fundamental nature of group size, which is that every additional member of a group increases the group's stability but also decreases the possible amount of intimacy or interactions between any two members. [[Social group|Groups]] are also distinguished in terms of how and why the members know each other, and this stems from whether they are members of '''primary groups''' consisting of close friends and family held together by '''expressive ties'''; '''secondary groups''' consisting of coworkers, colleagues, classmates, etc. held together by '''instrumental ties'''; or '''reference groups''' consisting of people who do not necessarily know or interact with each other but who use each other for standards of comparison for appropriate behaviors. Group processes researchers also study interactions between groups, such as in the case of [[Muzafer Sherif]]'s [[Realistic conflict theory#Robbers cave study|Robbers Cave Experiment]].<ref>Rohall, D.E., Milkie, M.A., Lucas, J.W. 2014.

The first textbook in social psychology by a sociologist appeared in 1908\u2014''Social Psychology'' by [[Edward Alsworth Ross]]. The area's main journal was founded as ''Sociometry'' by [[Jacob L. Moreno]] in 1937. The journal's name changed to ''Social Psychology'' in 1978, and to ''[[Social Psychology Quarterly]]'' in 1979.\n\nIn the 1920s [[W. I. Thomas]] contributed the notion of the [[definition of the situation]], with the [[Thomas theorem|proposition]] that became a basic tenet of sociology and sociological social psychology: \"If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.\"\n\nOne of the major currents of theory in this area sprang from work by philosopher and sociologist [[George Herbert Mead]] at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1894 forward.  Mead generally is credited as the founder of [[symbolic interactionism]]. Mead's colleague and disciple at Chicago, sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]], coined the name of the framework in 1937.\n\nSociologist [[Talcott Parsons]], at [[Harvard University]] from 1927 forward, developed a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] [[Action theory (sociology)|theory of action]] which was adapted to [[Communication in small groups|small group research]] by Parsons' student and colleague, [[Robert Freed Bales]], resulting in a body of observational studies of [[Social relation|social interaction]] in groups using Bales' behavior coding scheme, Interaction Process Analysis.<ref>Bales, Robert Freed (1950), ''Interaction Process Analysis'', New York: Addison-Wesley. Some studies using the method are included in Hare, A. Paul, Edgar F. Borgatta, & R. F. Bales (1955), ''Small Groups: Studies in Social Interaction'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf.</ref> During his 41-year tenure at Harvard, Bales mentored a distinguished group of sociological social psychologists concerned with [[Group dynamics|group processes]] and other topics in sociological social psychology.<ref>See the list of Bales' students at pages 332-3 of R. F. Bales (1999), ''Social Interaction Systems: Theory and Measurement'', New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction.</ref>\n\n==Major frameworks==\n\n=== Symbolic interactionism ===\n{{main|Symbolic interactionism}}\nContemporary symbolic interactionism originated out of ideas of George Herbert Mead and [[Max Weber]]. In this framework meanings are constructed during social interaction, and constructed meanings influence the process of social interaction. Many symbolic interactionists see the self as a core meaning constructed through social relations, and influencing social relations.\n\nThe structural school of symbolic interactionism uses shared social knowledge from a [[Macrosociology|macro-level]] [[culture]], [[natural language]], [[Institution|social institution]], or [[organization]] to explain relatively enduring patterns of social interaction and psychology at the [[Microsociology|micro-level]], typically investigating these matters with [[Quantitative research|quantitative methods]]. Identity theory,<ref>[[Sheldon Stryker|Stryker, Sheldon]], & Burke, Peter J. (2000). \"The past, present, and future of an identity theory\". ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''63''': 284\u2013297. Burke, P. J., and Jan E. Stets (2009). ''Identity Theory'', New York, Oxford University Press.</ref> [[affect control theory]],<ref>Heise, David R. (1979). ''Understanding Events: Affect and the Construction of Social Action'', New York: Cambridge University Press. MacKinnon, N. J. (1994). ''Symbolic Interactionism as Affect Control'', Albany, NY, State University of New York Press. Heise, D. R. (2007). ''Expressive Orider: Confirming Sentiments in Social Actions'', New York, Springer.</ref> and the Iowa School<ref>Miller, Dan E. (2011). \"Toward a Theory of Interaction: The Iowa School,\" ''Symbolic Interaction'' '''34''': 340-348.</ref> are major programs of research in this tradition. Identity Theory and Affect Control Theory both focus on how actions control mental states, thereby manifesting the underlying cybernetic nature of the approach, evident in Mead's writings<ref>MacKinnon, Neil J. (1994). ''Symbolic Interactionism as Affect Control'', Albany, NY, State University of New York Press. Pp. 3-5.</ref> Affect Control Theory provides a [[mathematical model]] of [[role theory]] and of [[labeling theory]].\n\nProcess symbolic interactionism stems from the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] and considers the meanings underlying social interactions to be situated, creative, fluid, and often contested. Researchers in this tradition frequently use [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] methods. A journal, ''Symbolic Interaction'', was founded in 1977 by the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction as a central outlet for the empirical research and [[Conceptual system|conceptual studies]] produced by scholars in this area.\n\n[[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] symbolic interactionists understand the notions of self and identity to be increasingly fragmented and illusory, and consider attempts at theorizing to be [[meta-narrative]]s with no more authority than other conversations. The approach is presented in detail by ''The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research''.<ref>Denzin, Norman K. and Yvonna S. Lincoln, Eds. (2005). ''The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research'', Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage Publications.</ref>\n\n=== Social exchange ===\n{{main|Social exchange theory}}\n[[Social exchange theory]] emphasizes the idea that social action is the result of ''personal choices'' made in order to maximize benefits and minimize costs. A key component of this theory is the postulation of the ''\"comparison level of alternatives\"'', which is the actor's sense of the best possible alternative (i.e. the choice with the highest net benefits or lowest net costs).\n\nTheories of social exchange share many essential features with classical economic theories like [[rational choice theory]]. However, social exchange theories differ from economic theories by making predictions about the relationships between persons, and not just the evaluation of goods. For example, social exchange theories  have been used to predict human behaviour in romantic relationships by taking into account each actor's subjective sense of costs (i.e., volatility, economic dependence), benefits (i.e., attraction, chemistry, attachment), and comparison level of alternatives (i.e., if any viable alternative mates are available).\n\n=== Theory of status characteristics and expectation states ===\n{{main|Expectation states theory}}\n[[Expectation states theory]] and its popular \"sub-theory\", status characteristics theory, proposes that individuals use available social information to form expectations for themselves and others. Group members use stereotypes about competence to attempt to determine who will be comparatively more skilled in any given task, indicating to whom the group should listen and accord [[Social status|status]]. Group members use known ability on the task at hand, membership in social categories (race, gender, age, education, etc.), and observed dominance behaviors (glares, rate of speech, interruptions, etc.) to determine everyone's relative ability and assign rank accordingly. While exhibiting dominant behavior or being of a certain race, for instance, has no direct connection to actual ability, implicit cultural beliefs about who is relatively more or less socially valued drive group members to \"act as if\" they believe some people have more useful contributions than others. As such, the theory has been used to explain the rise, persistence, and enactment of [[social status|status hierarchies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|title=Why Status Matters for Inequality|journal=American Sociological Review|date=2014|volume=79|issue=1|pages=1\u201316|doi=10.1177/0003122413515997}}</ref>\n\n=== Social structure and personality ===\nThis research perspective deals with relationships between large-scale social systems and individual behaviors and mental states including feelings, attitudes and values, and mental faculties.<ref>McLeod, Jane D. and Kathryn J. Lively (2003). \u201cSocial Structure and Personality.\u201d Pp. 77-102 in ''Handbook of Social Psychology'' edited by [[John DeLamater|J. DeLamater]]. New York: Kluwer/Plenum.</ref> Some researchers focus on issues of health and how social networks bring useful social support to the ill. Another line of research deals with how education, occupation, and other components of social class impact values. Some studies assess emotional variations, especially in happiness versus alienation and anger, among individuals in different structural positions.\n\n=== Social influence ===\n{{Main|Social influence}}\nSocial influence is a factor in every individual's life. Social influence takes place when one's thoughts, actions and feelings are affected by other people. It is a way of interaction that affects individual behavior and can occur within groups and between groups. It is a fundamental process that affects ways of socialization, conformity, leadership and social change.<ref>Smith, J. R., Louis, W. R., & Schultz, P. W. (2011). Introduction: Social influence in action. Group Processes & GP Intergroup Relations, 14(5), 599\u2013603.</ref>\n\n=== Dramaturgy ===\nAnother aspect of microsociology aims to focus on individual behavior in social settings. One specific researcher in the field, [[Erving Goffman]], claims that humans tend to believe that they are actors on a stage. He explains his theories in his book [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]. He argues that as a result, individuals will further proceed with their actions based on the response of that individual's 'audience' or in other words, the people to whom he is speaking. Much like a play, Goffman believes that rules of conversing and communication exist: to display confidence, display sincerity, and avoid infractions which are otherwise known as embarrassing situations. Breaches of such rules are what make social situations awkward.<ref>{{cite web|author=Your Name Here |url=http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/TheoryNotes/Goffman.htm |title=Goffman: PSEL |publisher=Soc.duke.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Group processes ===\nFrom the sociological perspective, group processes scholars study how [[Power (social and political)|power]], [[Social status|status]], [[justice]], and [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] impact the structure and interactions that take place within groups. Group processes scholars study how group size affects the type and quality of interactions that take place between group members, an area of study initiated by the work of the German social theorist, [[Georg Simmel]]. '''Dyads''' consist of two people and '''triads''' consist of three people, and the fundamental difference is that one person who leaves a dyad dissolves that group whereas the same is not true of a triad. The difference between these two types of groups also indicates the fundamental nature of group size, which is that every additional member of a group increases the group's stability but also decreases the possible amount of intimacy or interactions between any two members. [[Social group|Groups]] are also distinguished in terms of how and why the members know each other, and this stems from whether they are members of '''primary groups''' consisting of close friends and family held together by '''expressive ties'''; '''secondary groups''' consisting of coworkers, colleagues, classmates, etc. held together by '''instrumental ties'''; or '''reference groups''' consisting of people who do not necessarily know or interact with each other but who use each other for standards of comparison for appropriate behaviors. Group processes researchers also study interactions between groups, such as in the case of [[Muzafer Sherif]]'s [[Realistic conflict theory#Robbers cave study|Robbers Cave Experiment]].<ref>Rohall, D.E., Milkie, M.A., Lucas, J.W. 2014.

The show played several large cities before reaching [[New York City]]. In mid-November, Adelaide travelled from [[Chicago]] (where she'd been performing) to [[New York City]] in her [[Packard]] automobile with her husband Bert. When they arrived in New York, Adelaide was approached in 7th Avenue by a reporter who enquired about her career plans.<ref>''The Pittsburgh Courier'', Pittsburgh, 19 November 1927, front page \u2013 'They Always Come Back For More,\u2019 says Adelaide \u2013 Adelaide Hall report & photograph: https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=30987648&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjQwMDA3ODExLCJpYXQiOjE1NzE0ODQ5NTEsImV4cCI6MTU3MTU3MTM1MX0.vQF9B_O3GWoXhj74SJP8_ICp4wIHl4jUNTrlrvKpgf0</ref> Adelaide, however, declined to enlighten the reporter. Nevertheless, Miss Hall's reappearance in [[New York City]] garnered much speculation, as she was featured on the front pages of several newspapers, encouraging rumours she would soon be starring in a big [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show. In the meantime, Hall and Ellington appeared together in ''Dance Mania'' at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]], Harlem from 14 November for one week before heading off with the show to play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Standard Theatre.<ref>[http://www.ellingtonweb.ca/Hostedpages/TDWAW/DropdownmenuDRAFT.html#dec27 ''Dance Mania'' dates] listed on Ellingtonweb.</ref> In ''Dance Mania'' Hall closed the first half of the bill and Duke and his orchestra performed in the second half. Duke had a new number \"[[Creole Love Call]]\", which he included in his set. When Adelaide first heard the number back in October, she recounted, \n<blockquote>I was standing in the wings behind the piano when Duke first played it (\"[[Creole Love Call]]\"). I started humming along with the band. He stopped the number and came over to me and said, \"That's just what I was looking for. Can you do it again?\" I said, \"I can't, because I don't know what I was doing.\" He begged me to try. Anyway, I did, and sang this counter melody, and he was delighted and said \"Addie, you're going to record this with the band.\" A couple of days later I did.<ref name=Voce /></blockquote> \n[[File:Cotton Club 1930.jpg|thumb|[[Cotton Club]], [[Harlem]]]]\nWhen Duke was recounting the incident to a reporter he explained, \"We had to do something to employ Adelaide Hall,\" and then added, \"I always say we are primitive artists, we only employ the materials at hand \u2026 the band is an accumulation of personalities, tonal devices.\"<ref>David Bradbury, ''Duke Ellington'', Haus Publishing Ltd, 2005 ({{ISBN|1-904341-66-7}}), p. 19.</ref> On 4 December 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra commenced their residency at Harlem's [[Cotton Club]] in a revue called ''Rhythmania''.

Plus it also talks about how she'd had a hard time growing up, because her sister \u2013 who she was very close to \u2013 had died tragically of an illness.... So anyway, there's a point in the story where she describes her close relationship with her father, which I think kind of resonated with me \u2013 where she talks about the conversations she had with him and how he used to say to her randomly 'Sing to the moon and the stars will shine', which kind of became her thing really that she just took with her everywhere.... And I don't know why, but for some reason it just struck some kind of chord with me \u2013 you know, it was just something I seemed to connect with at that time. And so because of that, it then became a saying that I liked to use myself....

The show played several large cities before reaching [[New York City]]. In mid-November, Adelaide travelled from [[Chicago]] (where she'd been performing) to [[New York City]] in her [[Packard]] automobile with her husband Bert. When they arrived in New York, Adelaide was approached in 7th Avenue by a reporter who enquired about her career plans.<ref>''The Pittsburgh Courier'', Pittsburgh, 19 November 1927, front page \u2013 'They Always Come Back For More,\u2019 says Adelaide \u2013 Adelaide Hall report & photograph: https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=30987648&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjQwMDA3ODExLCJpYXQiOjE1NzE0ODQ5NTEsImV4cCI6MTU3MTU3MTM1MX0.vQF9B_O3GWoXhj74SJP8_ICp4wIHl4jUNTrlrvKpgf0</ref> Adelaide, however, declined to enlighten the reporter. Nevertheless, Miss Hall's reappearance in [[New York City]] garnered much speculation, as she was featured on the front pages of several newspapers, encouraging rumours she would soon be starring in a big [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show. In the meantime, Hall and Ellington appeared together in ''Dance Mania'' at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]], Harlem from 14 November for one week before heading off with the show to play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Standard Theatre.<ref>[http://www.ellingtonweb.ca/Hostedpages/TDWAW/DropdownmenuDRAFT.html#dec27 ''Dance Mania'' dates] listed on Ellingtonweb.</ref> In ''Dance Mania'' Hall closed the first half of the bill and Duke and his orchestra performed in the second half. Duke had a new number \"[[Creole Love Call]]\", which he included in his set. When Adelaide first heard the number back in October, she recounted, \n<blockquote>I was standing in the wings behind the piano when Duke first played it (\"[[Creole Love Call]]\"). I started humming along with the band. He stopped the number and came over to me and said, \"That's just what I was looking for. Can you do it again?\" I said, \"I can't, because I don't know what I was doing.\" He begged me to try. Anyway, I did, and sang this counter melody, and he was delighted and said \"Addie, you're going to record this with the band.\" A couple of days later I did.<ref name=Voce /></blockquote> \n[[File:Cotton Club 1930.jpg|thumb|[[Cotton Club]], [[Harlem]]]]\nWhen Duke was recounting the incident to a reporter he explained, \"We had to do something to employ Adelaide Hall,\" and then added, \"I always say we are primitive artists, we only employ the materials at hand \u2026 the band is an accumulation of personalities, tonal devices.\"<ref>David Bradbury, ''Duke Ellington'', Haus Publishing Ltd, 2005 ({{ISBN|1-904341-66-7}}), p. 19.</ref> On 4 December 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra commenced their residency at Harlem's [[Cotton Club]] in a revue called ''Rhythmania''.

Plus it also talks about how she'd had a hard time growing up, because her sister \u2013 who she was very close to \u2013 had died tragically of an illness.... So anyway, there's a point in the story where she describes her close relationship with her father, which I think kind of resonated with me \u2013 where she talks about the conversations she had with him and how he used to say to her randomly 'Sing to the moon and the stars will shine', which kind of became her thing really that she just took with her everywhere.... And I don't know why, but for some reason it just struck some kind of chord with me \u2013 you know, it was just something I seemed to connect with at that time. And so because of that, it then became a saying that I liked to use myself.... So yeah, because it's become something I personally like to express, I just thought 'Sing to the Moon' would also make a good title for the album as a whole.<ref name=\"bluesandsoul.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/826/great_expectations/|title=Laura Mvula: Reflections of...|author=Stephen Clark \u2013 Design|work=bluesandsoul.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 11 August 2014, Mvula released her second album, an orchestral version of her top 10 debut album ''[[Sing to the Moon]]'',<ref>[http://www.bowers-wilkins.co.uk/Society_of_Sound/Society_of_Sound/Music/Laura-Mvula.html \"Laura Mvula releases orchestral recording of 'Sing to the Moon'\"].

That same year, he had an uncredited brief appearance in the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' as a gang member. This was followed by appearances in the television series ''[[The Bill]]'', ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'' and ''[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]''.\n\nMcFadden then rose to fame for portraying the role of [[Phil Mitchell]] in the [[BBC One|BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]''. He joined ''EastEnders'' at the beginning of 1990, at the same time as [[Ross Kemp]], who played Phil's younger brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]]. During that time, his character was involved in numerous storylines, such as [[Sharongate]] (where it was revealed that he had an affair with his brother's wife [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]]) in 1994, and the [[Who Shot Phil?]] storyline in March 2001; where his character was shot and wounded by a mystery attacker.

He left ''EastEnders'' in late 2003 for a one-year break to concentrate on [[pantomimes]]. His character was written out of the series after being framed for an armed robbery by [[Den Watts]] (played by [[Leslie Grantham]]), and going on the run after breaking out of prison. During his break from ''EastEnders'', he presented the reality fighting series ''Britain's Hardest'' which was an underground competition broadcast on [[Sky One]]. He returned to ''EastEnders'' for two episodes in April 2005. In the story, Phil returned to Walford in need of financial help, only to be arrested and returned to prison. In October 2005, he returned on a permanent basis, after his character was cleared of armed robbery.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared in the film ''[[Provoked (film)|Provoked]]''. He has also appeared as Captain Hook in a pantomime production of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'' from 2010 to 2011 at [[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan]].

This was followed by appearances in the television series ''[[The Bill]]'', ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'' and ''[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]''.\n\nMcFadden then rose to fame for portraying the role of [[Phil Mitchell]] in the [[BBC One|BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]''. He joined ''EastEnders'' at the beginning of 1990, at the same time as [[Ross Kemp]], who played Phil's younger brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]]. During that time, his character was involved in numerous storylines, such as [[Sharongate]] (where it was revealed that he had an affair with his brother's wife [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]]) in 1994, and the [[Who Shot Phil?]] storyline in March 2001; where his character was shot and wounded by a mystery attacker.

During his break from ''EastEnders'', he presented the reality fighting series ''Britain's Hardest'' which was an underground competition broadcast on [[Sky One]]. He returned to ''EastEnders'' for two episodes in April 2005. In the story, Phil returned to Walford in need of financial help, only to be arrested and returned to prison.

He directed praise to the album's slower songs, particularly \"So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth\" and \"You'll Miss Me When I'm Not Around\", comparing the latter to songs by [['Til Tuesday]] and [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]].<ref name=\"The Independent rev\"/> [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the \"prosaic, realistic and affecting\" lyrics throughout the album while questioning its concept and criticizing some of its \"musical experiments\" such as the chorus of \"4\u00c6M\" and the \"smeared\" vocals of \"New Gods\".<ref name=\"The Guardian rev\"/> Rhian Daly of ''[[NME]]'' expressed a similar opinion in regards to the album's concept, calling it \"fragmented ... rather than being a unifying thing to tie every song neatly together\", and praised ''Miss Anthropocene''{{'}}s mix of sounds, pointing to the \"eerie\" \"New Gods\" and \"intergalactic rave-pop\" of \"Violence\" as highlights while acclaiming the album's \"euphoric\" closer \"Idoru\".<ref name=\"NME rev\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Standard edition<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/miss-anthropocene/1487294744|title=Miss Anthropocene by Grimes|website=Apple Music|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| all_writing = [[Claire Boucher]], except where noted\n| title1 = So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth\n| note1 = Art Mix\n| length1 = 6:08\n| title2 = Darkseid\n| note2 = with \u6f58PAN; writers: Boucher, Pan Wei-Ju\n| length2 = 3:44\n| title3 = [[Delete Forever]]\n| length3 = 3:57\n| title4 = [[Violence (song)|Violence]]\n| note4 = with i_o; writers: Boucher, Garrett Lockhart\n| length4 = 3:40\n| title5 = 4\u00c6M\n| note5 = writers: Boucher, Ganesh Chandanshive, Siddharth-Garima, Sanjal Bhandari, Nasir Faraaz\n| length5 = 4:30\n| title6 = New Gods\n| note6 = producers: Boucher, [[Dan Carey (record producer)|Dan Carey]]\n| length6 = 3:15\n| title7 = [[My Name Is Dark]]\n| note7 = Art Mix\n| length7 = 5:56\n| title8 = You'll Miss Me When I'm Not Around\n| length8 = 2:41\n| title9 = Before the Fever\n| length9 = 3:37\n| title10 = Idoru\n| note10 = Art Mix\n| length10 = 7:12\n| total_length = 44:40\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Japanese CD edition bonus track<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diskunion.net/indiealt/ct/detail/AWS191115GRIMES|title=MISS ANTHROPOCENE / \u30df\u30b9\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30dd\u30bb\u30f3/GRIMES/\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0\u30b9\uff5cROCK / POPS / INDIE\uff5c\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30e6\u30cb\u30aa\u30f3\uff65\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7|website=diskunion.net|language=ja|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| total_length = 50:15\n| title11 = [[We Appreciate Power]]\n| note11 = featuring [[Hana (American musician)|Hana]]; writers: Boucher, Hana Pestle, Chris Greatti\n| length11 = 5:35\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Deluxe digital version bonus tracks<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/ca/album/miss-anthropocene-deluxe/1488048682|title=Miss Anthropocene (Deluxe) by Grimes|website=Apple Music|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| total_length = 67:08\n| title12 = So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth\n| note12 = Algorithm Mix\n| length12 = 3:52\n| title13 = [[Violence (song)|Violence]]\n| note13 = with i_o) (Club Mix\n| length13 = 4:12\n| title14 = [[My Name Is Dark]]\n| note14 = Algorithm Mix\n| length14 = 4:03\n| title15 = Idoru\n| note15 = Algorithm Mix\n| length15 = 4:46\n}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n* The vinyl version contains the \"algorithm mix\" versions of \"So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth\", \"My Name Is Dark\", and \"Idoru\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://4ad.com/|title=The official website for independent record label 4AD.|website=4AD|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/grimes-miss-anthropocene-so-heavy/|title=Grimes releases cover, tracklist and release date for new album 'Miss Anthropocene'|website=Tone Deaf|last=Di Iorio|first=Michael|date=November 16, 2019|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n* \"You'll Miss Me When I'm Not Around\" and \"Before the Fever\" are stylized in [[sentence case]].\n* \"Idoru\" is stylized in [[all caps]].\n\n==Personnel==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]] \u2013 vocals, production, engineering\n* i_o \u2013 production {{small|(track 4)}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2019/09/grimes-i_o-violence-video-watch/|title=Grimes Releases Video for New Song \"Violence\": Watch|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|last=Cook-Wilson|first=Winston|date=September 5, 2019|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n* Chris Greatti \u2013 production {{small|(track 11)}}<ref name=\"Chris Greatti\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bqx8Z--l9V2/|title=Chris Greatti on Instagram: \"N\u00fc @grimes opus \"We Appreciate Power\" out now!
