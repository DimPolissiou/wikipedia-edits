Trelawny was born in England to a family of modest income but extensive ancestral history. Though his father became wealthy while he was a child, Edward had an antagonistic relationship with him. After an unhappy childhood, he was sent away to a school. He was assigned as a volunteer in the [[Royal Navy]] shortly before he turned thirteen.\n\nTrelawny served on multiple ships as a naval volunteer while in his teen years. He traveled to India and saw combat during engagements with the [[French Navy]]. He did not care for the naval lifestyle, however, and left at nineteen years of age without becoming a commissioned officer. After retiring from the navy, he had a brief and unhappy marriage in England. He then moved to Switzerland and later Italy where he met Shelley and Byron. He became friends with the two poets, and helped teach them about sailing. He enjoyed inventing elaborate stories about his time in the navy, and in one he claimed to have deserted and become a pirate in India. After Shelley's death, Trelawny identified his body and arranged the funeral and burial.\n\nTrelawny then travelled to Greece with Lord Byron in order to fight in the [[Greek War of Independence]]. Byron and Trelawny split up near Greece and Trelawny travelled into Greece to act as the agent of Lord Byron. After Byron died, Trelawny oversaw the preparations for the funeral and the return of his body to England. He also wrote his obituaries. Trelawny joined the cause of the Greek [[Warlord]] [[Odysseas Androutsos]] and helped to provide him with additional arms. He also married Odysseas' sister Teritza. After Odysseas fell out of favour with the Greek government and was arrested, Trelawny took control of his mountain fortress. During this time, Trelawny survived an assassination attempt. After leaving Greece, he divorced Teritza and returned to England. In England he was well received by members of London society. He then wrote a memoir titled ''Adventures of a Younger Son''. After the book was published he travelled to America for two years before returning to England. He then became politically active but soon remarried and moved to the English countryside.\n\nHe then lived the life of a country squire for 12 years and raised a family with his third wife. They eventually separated and he moved back to London with a mistress. He then wrote a well received book about Shelley and Byron. He soon became friends with several prominent artists and writers in London. He was able to share his firsthand experience with Romantic-era writers with the leading Victorian writers of the day. He later retired to [[Sompting]], where he led an [[Asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. He died in Sompting at the age of 88, having outlived almost all of his friends from the Romantic era.\n\n==Early life==\nTrelawny's birthplace is unknown, although he claimed that he was born in [[Cornwall]]. Some of his biographers have contended that he was actually born in London, as he was baptised in [[Marylebone]] as John Trelawney on 29 November 1792.<ref name=Armstrongp9/> His father, [[Charles Trelawny-Brereton]] (a descendant of [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 2nd Baronet]], who married Mary, daughter of [[Sir Edward Seymour, 2nd Baronet]], a descendant of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]]) was a British military officer who retired after reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel.<ref name=StClairp3/> His mother, Maria Hawkins, was of Cornish descent.<ref name=Armstrongp5>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=5}}</ref><ref name=Armstrongp8>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=8}}</ref> She had inherited a small sum of money from her father, but the family soon spent most of the inheritance. When Edward was six years of age, his father inherited a large sum of money from one of his wealthy cousins. The family soon used the inheritance to move to London, where they lived in a large house. As a condition of receiving the inheritance, his father was required to adopt the last name \"Brereton\". His cousin, Owen Brereton, wished to have his last name continued along with his wealth.<ref name=StClairp3/> They lived in [[Cheshire]] while Edward was a young man.<ref name=Armstrongp9>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=9}}</ref>\n\nAt some point in his youth, he began referring to himself as Edward, which was the name used by most of his friends. Later in his life he referred to himself as \"John Edward\" for several years. Edward later recalled that his father had a fierce temper. He described his father's disposition as often \"tyrannical\". His father also tried to calculate the financial worth of all his relatives and kept detailed records of the numbers.<ref name=StClairp3>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=3}}</ref> In addition to his father, many of Edward Trelawny's other ancestors had strong tempers, as well.<ref name=Armstrongp4>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=4}}</ref> His elder uncle on his mother's side, [[Sir Christopher Hawkins, 1st Baronet|Sir Christopher Hawkins]] was also wealthy. He held a seat in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] and in 1809 Trelawny's father also became a Member of the British Parliament.<ref name=StClairp4/> As a child, he was often told of the long history and adventures of his ancestors in the Trelawny family. As an adult, he was proud of having such prestigious ancestors.<ref name=StClairp6>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=6}}</ref> The recorded history of his family dated back to the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]] and included many prominent citizens.<ref name=Armstrongp1/>\n\nEdward had five siblings who survived to adulthood and several who died as children. Edward shared a disdain for his father with his siblings. Though he hated his father, Edward was close with his mother. His mother worked hard to find wealthy husbands for her daughters, to the extent that her actions were satirised by some. In addition, many people found her to be a disagreeable person as she grew older.<ref name=StClairp4>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=4}}</ref> Trelawny's parents regarded their children as potential sinners and frequently used harsh measures to try to instill a sense of discipline in them. He resented being treated in this manner.<ref name=Armstrongp1>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=1}}</ref><ref name=Armstrongp14>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=14}}</ref>\n\nEdward only had one brother, Harry Trelawny. They were close in age and were close friends during their childhood.<ref name=Armstrongp9/> Harry was quiet and reserved, which sharply contrasted with Edward's extroverted and confrontational personality.<ref name=Armstrongp14/>\n\nAs an adult, Edward Trelawny often told stories about his childhood that focused on his early willingness to take confrontational positions and conceal things from others.<ref name=StClairp5>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=5}}</ref> One often used story described the time that he killed a vicious Raven which had belonged to his father. He cited this event as an example of his habit of accepting offences up to a certain point before later taking revenge as the offences mounted. He later described the Raven incident in his autobiography, ''Adventures of a Younger Son''.<ref name=Armstrongp10>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=10}}</ref> In the book he described the fight with the raven as the \"most awful duel\" that he ever had.<ref name=Armstrongp12>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=12}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nAt the age of eight Charles Brereton decided to send Edward to live at the [[Seyer school]], which was located two miles from their home in [[Bristol]] at that time. Trelawny later claimed that his father had resisted sending him to the school for some time due to its cost, but decided to enroll him after he caught him stealing apples from an orchard in the back yard. Trelawny hated the school and was angry at his father for sending him there. He often complained that the school served terrible food and subjected him to frequent flogging as a form of punishment.<ref name=StClairp7>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=7}}</ref> In addition to flogging, one of his classmates recorded that caning was a frequent method of punishment there, as well.<ref name=StClairp8/> The school's treatment of its students was actually comparable to many other schools of that time.<ref name=Armstrongp15>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=15}}</ref> He was also bullied and treated cruelly by other students there.<ref name=StClairp11>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=11}}</ref>\n\nThe schoolmaster there frequently condemned the [[French Revolution]]. These condemnations may have given Trelawny an early sympathy with revolutionary ideals.<ref name=StClairp8>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=8}}</ref> He was expelled from the school after two years due to violent behaviour towards teachers as well as starting fires after being confined in his room as punishment.<ref name=StClairp9>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\n==Naval career==\n[[Image:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|300px|\nThe Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up by [[J. M. W. Turner]],1838]]\nCharles Brereton had originally hoped that his sons would attend Oxford. He became disappointed by the slow pace of Edward's learning as a child.<ref name=Armstrongp19>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=19}}</ref> In October 1805, shortly before his thirteenth birthday, he enrolled Edward in the Royal Navy as a first class volunteer. The younger sons of the [[gentry]] traditionally entered the military at that time.<ref name=StClairp10/> His family enrolled him as early as they could because seniority was crucial to career advancement at that time.<ref name=StClairp13>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=13}}</ref>\n\nHis first experiences in the navy were serving on ships that had returned from the Battle of Trafalgar with many badly wounded sailors.<ref name=StClairp10>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=10}}</ref> In November he was transferred to ''Temeraire'' and then to ''Colossus''. He later attended a naval school in [[Portsmouth]]. In 1806 he served aboard HMS ''Woolwich''. While serving on ''Woolwich'' he travelled to the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and to [[St. Helena]]. In 1808 he moved to the frigate ''Resistance'', and in 1809 to the frigate ''Cornelia''. While serving aboard ''Cornelia'' he travelled to [[Bombay]].<ref name=Prellp50>{{Harvnb|Prell|2008|p=50}}</ref> Trelawny's name was entered on the books of HMS ''Superb'' as volunteer first class in October 1812.<ref name=Prellp50/>\n\nTrelawny was initially happy to have joined the navy and enjoyed the rough lifestyle there.<ref name=Armstrongp21>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=21}}</ref><ref name=StClairp12>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=12}}</ref> He often exaggerated his age while he was in the navy. Some biographers believe he commanded a vessel as a midshipman in an engagement with the French at [[Mauritius]] in 1810.<ref name=StClairp14>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=14}}</ref> Some also believe that he was wounded engaging the French in [[Java]] in August 1811. He left the Navy in 1812 at the age of 19; receiving a final settlement of pay in 1815.<ref name=StClairp16>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=16}}</ref> He had grown to resent the discipline of the Navy due in part to the frequent punishment that he experienced. He was often sent to the [[Mast (sailing)|masthead]] for several hours at a time.<ref name=StClairp18>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=18}}</ref> During that time, he frequently entertained fantasies of [[mutiny]] and [[desertion]].<ref name=StClairp19>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=19}}</ref> Some biographers believe that Trelawny was inspired by hearing accounts of the French pirate [[Robert Surcouf]].<ref name=StClairp23>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=23}}</ref> He was never commissioned as a lieutenant, though many of his contemporaries were.<ref name=StClairp24>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=24}}</ref> This disappointed him, although he began referring to himself as Lieutenant Trelawny anyway.<ref name=StClairp25>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==First marriage==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Trelawny.Trial.jpg|thumb|\n]] -->Trelawny returned to England in 1812. Soon after he arrived he fell in love with Caroline, daughter of John Addison, of Bengal.<ref>The Baronetage of England, fifth ed., vol. I, 1824, John Debrett p. 116</ref>  She was several years younger than he but as well educated; she had studied [[French Language|French]] and was a skilled [[Piano|pianist]]. Though both of their families disapproved of the match they were not dissuaded. Trelawny's father was particularly infuriated by his son's disobedience. They were married in May 1813<ref>Debrett's Baronetage of England 1824, vol. I, p. 116 gives the date as 7 Dec. 1812</ref> and first lived in [[London]] before moving to [[Bristol]]. After their first daughter was born in 1814, they experienced financial difficulties that forced Trelawny to ask his father for money.<ref name=StClairp25/> Although he had a mutually disdainful relationship with his father,<ref name=StClairp17>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=17}}</ref> he was able to secure extra funds. Edward and Caroline soon became unhappy, causing Edward to begin leaving home often to spend time with his friends<ref name=\"StClairp25\"/> or to travel to the theatre by himself. Their second child was born in 1816.<ref name=StClairp26>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=26}}</ref>\n\nCaroline soon began having an affair with a much older man, a naval captain named Coleman. They successfully hid the affair from Trelawny for some time, he discovered it long after many others had known. Although he dearly wished to fight a duel with Coleman, he simply filed for divorce instead.<ref name=StClairp29>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=29}}</ref> The proceedings were well covered in many of London's \"penny press\" tabloid papers. This publicity caused Trelawny tremendous frustration and humiliation. The divorce order was granted in July 1817, but was not finalised until 1819.<ref name=StClairp26/><ref name=StClairp36>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=36}}</ref> Caroline was granted custody of the elder child and Edward kept the younger.<ref name=StClairp30>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=30}}</ref>\n\n==Studies==\nTrelawny's father soon attempted to purchase him a commission in the [[British Army]], but he refused to consider joining the army. His father was furious at his refusal, leading to their estrangement. Brereton became estranged with Harry around the same time, due to a marriage that he entered into against his father's wishes.<ref name=StClairp26/> Edward began staying with a former landlord whom he had befriended.<ref name=StClairp29/> She helped him find someone to take care of his child. Trelawny then began using the name \"Edward\" rather than \"John\".<ref name=StClairp30/>\n\nDue in part to the short time he spent in school, Trelawny struggled with spelling as a young man. He often spelled phonetically. This caused him significant difficulties when he tried to correspond with his friends. His spelling indicated a strong [[West Country dialects|Westcountry accent]]. His parents were concerned about this, particularly his habit of occasionally misspelling his own name. His problem with spelling might have been due to [[dyslexia]], evidence for which has been provided by one of Trelawny's biographers.<ref name=Prellp47>{{Harvnb|Prell|2011|p=47}}</ref> After he left the Navy he read voraciously. He often read [[Shakespeare's plays]] and attended the theatres in [[Covent Garden]].<ref name=StClairp32>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=32}}</ref> He began incorporating references to Shakespeare in his personal letters.<ref name=StClairp33>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=33}}</ref> He also enjoyed reading the works of [[Lord Byron]], including ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]''.<ref name=StClairp34>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=34}}</ref> During this time he also accompanied his mother and sisters on a trip to Paris.<ref name=Prellp18>{{Harvnb|Prell|2011|p=18}}</ref>\n\n==Switzerland==\nEven though they often quarrelled, Charles Brereton continued to provide Trelawny with an allowance. He received an allowance of \u00a3300 a year, which was roughly the same amount as retired captains received as a pension at that time. He began to present himself as Captain Edward Trelawny, Royal Navy, Retired.<ref name=Prellp18/> He decided to leave England to find a cheaper place to live. After initially considering a move to [[Buenos Aires]], he decided to move to [[Switzerland]].<ref name=StClairp36/> In Switzerland he was not directly affected by the [[inflation]] that was occurring in England. After moving to [[Geneva]] he soon became bored by the city and spent much of his time hunting and fishing expeditions.<ref name=StClairp37>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=37}}</ref> In the summer of 1820, while staying in [[Lausanne]], Trelawny befriended a local bookseller. The bookseller soon recommended to him that he read ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab]]'' by Percy Bysshe Shelley. This was the first time that he had heard of Percy Shelley. He read ''Queen Mab'' and he greatly enjoyed the work.<ref name=Gryllsp67>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=67}}</ref>\n\nHe soon met [[Edward Ellerker Williams]] and [[Thomas Medwin]] at the home of a friend in [[Geneva]].<ref name=StClairp39>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=39}}</ref> He had served on the same ship as Williams in the navy, although not at the same time.<ref name=Prellp50/> They also introduced him to the work of Percy Bysshe Shelley.<ref name=StClairp40>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=40}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1820 Trelawny learned that his father had died and returned to England from Switzerland.<ref name=StClairp40/> After arriving in England he learned that he only had received a much smaller inheritance than he had expected. He was sorely disappointed and soon returned to Switzerland.<ref name=StClairp41>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=41}}</ref>\n\n==Pisa==\nIn early 1822 he travelled to [[Pisa]] to meet [[Edward Ellerker Williams]] and his wife [[Jane Williams|Jane]], Thomas Medwin, Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, and Lord Byron.<ref name=StClairp43>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=43}}</ref> Trelawny greatly enjoyed meeting Percy and Mary Shelley after having looked forward to meeting them for some time. He also met Mary's half-sister [[Claire Clairmont]].<ref name=Gryllsp73>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=73}}</ref> Trelawny began spending much of his time with Mary Shelley. He often accompanied her to parties because Percy Shelley hated to do so.<ref name=Gryllsp75>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=75}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny had many similarities to Percy Shelley, including the fact that he had the same class, age, and preferences. He began to emulate Shelley in some additional ways, such as his attitudes toward authority figures.<ref name=StClairp62>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=62}}</ref> Mary Shelley enjoyed his company, as well and was fascinated by the stories that Trelawny told of his naval career.<ref name=StClairp63>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=63}}</ref> Lord Byron was initially surprised by the resemblance Trelawny bore to some of the pirates that he had written about, and once described Trelawny as the \"personification of my Corsair\".<ref name=Gryllsp74>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=74}}</ref> In some ways, Trelawny did not fit in with his new friends due to his lack of wealth and education.<ref name=StClairp47>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=47}}</ref> He had had more adventurous experiences than his friends by that time, however. He often exaggerated these experiences in conversation, especially when discussing the details of his naval career.<ref name=StClairp50>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=50}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Captain Trelawny.jpg|thumb|300px|Copy of an 1822 signature of Edward John Trelawny indicating he was a captain.]]\n\nTrelawny invented a fictional story of his activities as a teenager. The story featured him deserting from the navy and traveling throughout Asia. During this time he claimed to have formed a band of pirates who fought against the British Navy. His descriptions of his adventures often included duels and romance, such as his marrying an Arab girl name Zella who was later poisoned by a jealous rival. These stories were often violent, but his friends found them exciting.<ref name=StClairp58>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=58}}</ref> Trelawny often used real events as the baseline for his stories, and then greatly embellished the events that actually took place.<ref name=StClairp70>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=70}}</ref> His biographers have been divided as to whether he intentionally exaggerated to create a persona or if he really came to believe the stories that he created.<ref name=Prellp17>{{Harvnb|Prell|2011|p=17}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny greatly enjoyed his time in Pisa. He was active during his time there and practised boxing and fencing with his friends. He frequently attended theaters with them at night.<ref name=StClairp59>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=59}}</ref> He also enjoyed listening to Jane Williams sing and play songs with the guitar that Shelley had given to her.<ref name=StClairp61/>\n\nIn March Trelawny was involved in a high-profile confrontation that took place while he was travelling with Byron, Shelley, and some of their friends. The incident began when an Italian soldier confronted Count John Taafe, who was travelling with Shelley, Trelawny, Byron, and Byron's entourage. Although Shelley was slightly wounded as he fell from his horse chasing after the soldier, one of Byron's servants later caught the soldier and wounded him severely. The incident was controversial and received a significant amount of publicity in Pisa. This was in part due to the anti-English sentiment that existed there at that time. After a lengthy investigation by the Italian authorities, Trelawny and his friends were cleared of all charges that had been pending against them.<ref name=StClairp61>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=61}}</ref><ref name=Gryllsp81>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=81}}</ref>\n\nShelley and Edward Williams had wanted to begin sailing for some time, and Trelawny used his naval experience to help them make plans.<ref name=Prellp136>{{Harvnb|Prell|2007|p=136}}</ref> Together they decided to have an American-style [[schooner]] constructed; he had often observed this type of boat during his time in the navy.<ref name=\"Prellp136\"/><ref name=StClairp66>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=66}}</ref> After Shelley and Williams had constructed their boat, the ''Don Juan'', Trelawny was hired by Byron to be the Captain of his vessel, the ''Bolivar''.<ref name=StClairp69>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=69}}</ref> Trelawny also moved into a room in Byron's mansion at that time.<ref name=Gryllsp85>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=85}}</ref> Trelawny's friend [[Daniel Roberts (Royal Navy officer)|Daniel Roberts]] designed and supervised the construction of both vessels.<ref name=Prellp47/> The construction of the ''Bolivar'' cost \u00a3750, a sum which Byron found irritatingly high.<ref name=Gryllsp83>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=83}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Funeral of Shelley by Louis Edouard Fournier.jpg|thumb|400px| ''The Funeral of Shelley'', by [[Louis \u00c9douard Fournier]]]]\n\nTrelawny had planned to accompany the ''Don Juan'' in the ''Bolivar'' during the voyage in which the ''Don Juan'' sank. He was held back by the [[Port Authority]] because he was not carrying his port clearance with him, though he had sailed without bringing his clearance several times in the past.<ref name=\"Prellp136\"/><ref name=Gryllsp88>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=88}}</ref> After Shelley and Williams did not return to their home by the time that they were expected, Jane Williams and Mary Shelley informed Trelawny that their husbands were missing. He began making urgent inquiries and attempted to find news about them. For the next several days, he frequently met with members of the Italian Coast Guard and promised them rewards if they were able to find the boat.<ref name=Gryllsp90>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=90}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shelley's body was found, Trelawny was able to confirm the identity of the body. He then notified their wives and escorted Mary and Jane to Pisa for the funeral.<ref name=StClairp79>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=79}}</ref> Trelawny made the arrangements for the cremation and oversaw the ceremony. After Shelley's body was cremated, Trelawny removed what he thought was Shelley's unburned heart from the fire. He later wrote a full account of the funeral.<ref name=Gryllsp945>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|pp=94\u201395}}</ref> He also arranged to have a memorial built at Shelley's final resting place in Rome.<ref name=StClairp84>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=84}}</ref> Trelawny then reserved a spot for himself in the same cemetery.<ref name=Gryllsp103>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=103}}</ref>\n\nAfter the funeral, Trelawny went on a hunting trip with Daniel Roberts.<ref name=Gryllsp100>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=100}}</ref> After he returned, he soon developed tension with Byron, in part due to Byron's habit of leaving bills unpaid. This often put Trelawny in a difficult position as the captain of his boat.<ref name=StClairp85>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=85}}</ref> Byron sold the ''Bolivar'' for 400 [[guinea (coin)|guinea]]s in late 1822.<ref name=Gryllsp110>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=110}}</ref><ref name=StClairp86/> This left Trelawny unemployed. He split his time between [[Genoa]] and [[Albaro]], and hunted often. He began spending much of his time with Mary Shelley<ref name=StClairp86>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=86}}</ref> and he supplied the funds for her to return to England. Trelawny soon fell in love with [[Claire Clairmont]].<ref name=StClairp88>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=88}}</ref> She ultimately spurned his proposals, however. He decided to move after his mother found his address and began sending him letters.<ref name=StClairp89>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=89}}</ref>\n\n==Greece==\nShelley had been supportive of the idea of Greek independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] before he died.<ref name=StClairp91>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=91}}</ref> In June 1823 Byron decided to go to Greece to fight for independence, and Trelawny enthusiastically accompanied him.<ref name=StClairp92>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=92}}</ref> With the assistance of Captain Daniel Roberts, Byron chartered a boat named ''Hercules'' to transport them there.<ref name=Prellp47/><ref name=Prellp1>{{Harvnb|Prell|2011|p=1}}</ref><ref name=Gryllsp114>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=114}}</ref> During the voyage, Trelawny and Byron sometimes irritated each other.

They then left him in [[Kefalonia]] and traveled to Greece.<ref name=StClairp95>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=95}}</ref> Byron approved of Trelawny's plan to travel deeper into Greece and presented him with a sword and a letter of introduction shortly before he departed. Byron also asked them to soon return to him with more information.<ref name=Gryllsp119>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=119}}</ref>\n\nAfter initially staying with a shepherd after they arrived in Greece, they travelled to [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]]. Trelawny wore authentic [[Souliotes|Souliote]] dress on the journey. After arriving in Tripoli, Trelawny met with [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] whom he soon came to strongly dislike.<ref name=StClairp97>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=97}}</ref> He also met [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], whom he later came to admire. They traveled together to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], on the journey Trelawny viewed the sites of previous battles. He recorded that he could see the bones of those who had been slain there.<ref name=StClairp98>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=98}}</ref> He spoke with many Greek leaders after arriving in Salamis. He was well respected as the agent of Lord Byron, whom they held in high esteem. He frequently [[Byron's letters|corresponded with Lord Byron]] and encouraged him to come to Greece.<ref name=StClairp99>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=99}}</ref> He was disappointed when Byron did not come for some time, and that when he did come he came to territory that was overseen by Mavrokordatos. Trelawny, however, greatly enjoyed [[Corinth]] and [[Athens]]. Rumours later emerged that he purchased a [[harem]] of twelve to fifteen women while staying in Athens. However, some have maintained that he may have actually redeemed the women from slavery.<ref name=StClairp100>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=100}}</ref><ref name=Gryllsp149>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=149}}</ref>\n\nHe soon left on a raiding expedition with the warlord [[Odysseas Androutsos]], who controlled  much of Eastern Greece.<ref name=StClairp101>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=101}}</ref> Trelawny thought highly of Odysseas, describing him as a brother and comparing him to [[George Washington]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].<ref name=Gryllsp129/><ref name=StClairp102/><ref name=Gryllsp124>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=124}}</ref> During this time Trelawny commanded a group of twenty-five [[Albania]]n soldiers.<ref name=Gryllsp124/> In the winter of 1823\u201324, Odysseas and his men fought several battles with the Turks and destroyed villages in the [[Euboea]] region.<ref name=StClairp102>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=102}}</ref> Trelawny lobbied Byron to send them more arms, but Byron decided to wait before shipping any to consider the political implications. Some have called into question the effectiveness of Odysseas' campaign and many view Byron's delay as a polite refusal.<ref name=Gryllsp125>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=125}}</ref>\n\nAfter Byron died in April 1824, Trelawny returned from an expedition with Odysseas. Trelawny claimed that upon arriving in [[Messolonghi]], he began overseeing the funeral preparations.<ref name=StClairp103>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=103}}</ref> In the days before his death, Byron often said he wished Trelawny would return to him.  Trelawny then wrote several accounts of Byron's last years and sent them to papers in England. In these accounts he often exaggerated the role he played in Byron's life.<ref name=StClairp105>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=105}}</ref> Shortly after Byron died, Trelawny reported he took the opportunity to view his deformed foot with a servant of Byron's.\n\n==Mountain fortress==\n[[Image:Trelawny.by.Severn.jpg|thumb|Trelawny by [[Joseph Severn]]]]\n\nTrelawny then began lobbying members of the London Greek Committee to fully support Odysseas.<ref name=StClairp107>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=107}}</ref> He also lobbied for a Greek Congress and criticised Mavrokordatos.<ref name=StClairp108>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=108}}</ref> In a letter to Mary Shelley Trelawny described Mavrokordatos as a \"miserable Jew\" and said that he hoped to see him [[behead]]ed.<ref name=Gryllsp129>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=129}}</ref> Trelawny was able to transfer some portions of weapons shipments from London to Odysseas. This was a controversial move among Greek leaders and the London Greek Committee, many of whom saw it as a foolish move.<ref name=StClairp110>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=110}}</ref> He also suggested that the Greek authorities should hire [[privateer]]s to harass Turkish ships.<ref name=Gryllsp128>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=128}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1824 Trelawny brought a load of guns to the fortified cave in which Odysseas was based. He arrived with a British military officer, Whitcomb, and a military engineer, Fenton.<ref name=StClairp113>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=113}}</ref> Trelawny recorded that Odysseas commanded a force of 5,000 men, who killed over 20,000 people during their campaign.<ref name=StClairp114>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=114}}</ref> Odysseas and his men retired to Parnassus after they learned the Greek government would not give them more funds. The Greek Government had decided to try to raise a regular army and take power away from the warlords. The size of his force soon diminished.<ref name=StClairp115>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=115}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny hoped to convince Odysseas to leave with him for the Ionian islands, but Odysseas refused. He also helped Odysseas hide some valuable antiquities; they were never found. Some sources claim that Odysseas was attempting to strike a deal with the Turks at that time.<ref name=StClairp116>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=116}}</ref> Trelawny soon married Teritza, the half-sister of Odysseas. She was much younger than he, and was probably a teenager.<ref name=StClairp118/> Some have speculated that their wedding was performed by a local [[Greek Orthodox]] priest.<ref name=Gryllsp131>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=131}}</ref> Teritza then lived with him in the cave. At this point Trelawny's life had actually began to resemble many of the stories that he had previously constructed about his past.<ref name=StClairp118>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=118}}</ref> Word soon spread to England that Trelawny was working for the Turks with Odysseas now.<ref name=StClairp120>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=120}}</ref> Trelawny again tried to convince Odysseas to escape with him to the Ionian Islands in order to prevent the Greek government from arresting him.<ref name=Gryllsp131/> Odysseas was caught on his way to find a boat.<ref name=\"Gryllsp131\"/> He was charged with treason and imprisoned in Athens. Trelawny administered the cave in his absence.<ref name=StClairp121>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=121}}</ref>\n\n===Assassination attempt===\nTension between Trelawny and his two English companions Fenton and Whitcomb had been growing. When a shooting match was proposed, Trelawny arrogantly said that even with a pistol he could outshoot the other two with rifles.<ref name =Crane>{{Harvnb|Crane|1999|p=203}}</ref> During the contest, when Trelawny was checking the target, he was shot in the back by Whitcomb, who was urged on by Fenton. Fenton was quickly shot and killed by one of Trelawny's Greek soldiers. Seeing this, Whitcomb tried to flee but was captured by soldiers.<ref name=StClairp122>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=122}}</ref> The soldiers initially hung Whitcomb off a cliff by his ankles as punishment, but Trelawny asked them to stop and they imprisoned the man. There was no doctor available and Trelawny lived on a diet of raw eggs that was suggested by his wife, who attended to him there. He needed to have a musket ball removed, however. His men soon kidnapped a [[Trachis|Klept]] doctor and forced him to operate at gunpoint. The doctor's efforts were unsuccessful. Although Trelawny was in poor condition for several weeks he eventually recovered. His living assailant was later released. The soldiers wanted to roast Whitcomb alive, but Trelawny insisted on releasing him.<ref name=Gryllsp1345>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|pp=134\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny was bedridden for five weeks after he was shot. After word spread to England that Trelawny had survived, many of his relatives unsuccessfully lobbied the British government to extract him from Greece. The British Army Major D'Arcy Bacon learned of his situation and came to an agreement with Mavrokordatos to allow Trelawny to leave Greece.<ref name=StClairp1235/> Bacon went searching for Trelawny and was captured by some of Odysseas' soldiers. They had mistaken him for a doctor and hoped that he would operate on Trelawny.<ref name=Gryllsp1345/> A British [[Corvette]] sailed to Corinth to pick him up, Teritza accompanied him. His story was widely published in English newspapers then.<ref name=StClairp1235>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|pp=123\u2013125}}</ref> Some biographers believe that Fenton and Whitcomb were bribed by Mavrokordatos to kill Trelawny and give over the cave. Bacon successfully lobbied the Greek government to allow him to leave the country.<ref name=\"StClairp122\"/> Odysseas was executed in Athens shortly before the attempt on Trelawny's life.<ref name=StClairp1235/> Trelawny regained full use of his arm, but he walked with a slight hunch after recovering from his injury.<ref name=StClairp126>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=126}}</ref>\n\n==Return to England==\nTrelawny moved to [[Zakynthos|Zante]] in May 1826 and stayed there for a year.<ref name=StClairp127/> There he lived next to the house of [[Thomas Gordon (British Army officer)|Thomas Gordon]].<ref name=Gryllsp142>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=142}}</ref> While they were living in Zante, Teritza gave birth to their first child, Zella.<ref name=Gryllsp146>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=146}}</ref>\n\nHe filed for divorce from Teritza in 1827 in [[Kefalonia]] after four years of marriage. There were later rumours that Trelawny had been abusive towards her and had forbidden her to wear non-Greek clothing.<ref name=StClairp127>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=127}}</ref> Teritza then moved into a nunnery and gave birth to their second child there.<ref name=StClairp127/><ref name=Gryllsp146/> The child died at a young age, however.<ref name=\"StClairp127\"/><ref name=\"Gryllsp146\"/> Teritza was awarded a small alimony and soon left the nunnery to remarry. Her second husband was a Greek chieftain.<ref name=\"Gryllsp149\"/>\n\nTrelawny then returned to England to visit his family in Cornwall.<ref name=StClairp129>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=129}}</ref> He also visited Mary Shelley, and asked her to consider entering a romantic relationship with him.<ref name=StClairp130>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=130}}</ref> She refused his offers, however. He also briefly visited [[Claire Clairmont]] in Italy in 1828. Though he was attracted to her, she too spurned his advances, although they did correspond up until her death in 1879.<ref name=StClairp131/>\n\nIn 1828 he began referring to himself as \"John Edward Trelawny\", but he returned to \"Edward John Trelawny\" three years later.<ref name=StClairp131>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=131}}</ref> In late 1828 he returned to England and met with [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg]] and Jane Williams.

He then decided to write about himself. He discussed many actual events in his life, but greatly embellished many details.<ref name=StClairp134>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=134}}</ref> He also discussed radical politics in the book.<ref name=StClairp144>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=144}}</ref>\n\nIn 1829 Trelawny made plans to live with his three daughters in Italy. He abandoned this plan after his eldest daughter died and his finances became strained. His financial problems were caused in part by a large gift to the Medwin family after they encountered financial difficulties.<ref name=StClairp135>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=135}}</ref>\n\n==''Adventures of a Younger Son''==\nTrelawny wrote ''Adventures of a Younger Son'' in Arcetti while staying in a room that he rented from Charles Armitage Brown. Brown was irritated that Trelawny burned furniture for firewood, but agreed to copy-edit the book for him.<ref name=StClairp136>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=136}}</ref> He began work on the book in 1829 but did not finish it until 1831.<ref name=Prellp51>{{Harvnb|Prell|2008|p=51}}</ref> He was likely dyslexic and his draft required extensive editing by Brown.<ref name=Prellp49>{{Harvnb|Prell|2008|p=49}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny then sent his draft to Mary Shelley to arrange publication under the title ''A Man's Life''. Mary insisted on removing some passages from the book that could be viewed as offensive.<ref name=StClairp136/> He decided to publish it anonymously, but it was expected that many would be able to guess his identity. He did not earn as much money from the publisher as he had hoped.<ref name=StClairp137>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=137}}</ref> In Autumn 1831 his book was finally published.<ref name=StClairp138>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=138}}</ref>\n\nHis book was published anonymously but within a month it had become well known that he was the author.<ref name=Prellp5>{{Harvnb|Prell|2008|p=5}}</ref> Most contemporary reviewers accepted the book as factual,<ref name=StClairp140>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=140}}</ref> but subsequent scholarship has demonstrated that most of the book is no more than a fictional account of his life. Writing in the ''Keats-Shelley Journal'' of 1956, Anne Hill concluded that \"the proportion of truth to fiction in ''Adventures of a younger son'' turns out to be small, not more than one tenth.\" His biography has since been translated into French, German, Swedish, and Gaelic.<ref name=Prellp1/> Trelawny returned to England in 1832 and was famous and well received by London society and was treated like a hero. He began meeting with Godwin regularly.<ref name=\"StClairp140\"/>\n\n==America==\n[[File:EJTbySevern1838.jpg|thumb|Trelawny by [[Joseph Severn]], 1838]]\nHis younger daughter by his first wife was adopted by a British General and his youngest daughter was adopted by an Italian family. Trelawny's financial condition became much better around then.<ref name=StClairp143>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=143}}</ref> In 1832, while on a visit to [[Liverpool]], he decided to travel to the United States.<ref name=\"StClairp144\"/> He arrived in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] in early 1833. He then travelled to New York in early summer. In New York he met Fenimore Cooper and Fanny Kemble.<ref name=StClairp146>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=146}}</ref> They then travelled to Niagara. Wherever they went he often talked of staying permanently. He repeatedly raised political issues and furiously argued when disagreed with.<ref name=StClairp148>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=148}}</ref> In August he decided to try to swim across the rapids below the falls. He successfully made it across, but nearly drowned on the way back.<ref name=StClairp149>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=149}}</ref> He then travelled to Saratoga, New Haven, New York, and Philadelphia.<ref name=StClairp150>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=150}}</ref> He then returned to Charleston, preferring the climate there. He was disappointed that his atheism was poorly received in the United States.<ref name=StClairp151>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=151}}</ref> He later claimed to have travelled to California in 1833. He was bothered by the way that wealthy Americans tried to copy the habits of Europe.<ref name=StClairp152>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=152}}</ref> It is unknown exactly what he did in late 1833 early 1834, some have speculated that he made plans to build a utopian community. He travelled to Philadelphia again by autumn 1834. He was depressed at that time, and returned to England in spring 1835.\n\n==Philosophical Radicals==\nUpon his return to England, Trelawny became politically active with a group known as the [[Philosophical Radicals]]. The group advocated [[left-wing politics]] and often focused its efforts on the [[rights of women]].<ref name=StClairp155>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=155}}</ref> Trelawny began associating with its supporters, many of whom were among the upper-class members of London society.<ref name=StClairp156>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=156}}</ref> Most of London society was willing to overlook his claims of disloyalty against the British after his claimed desertion and accepted him into society.<ref name=StClairp160>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=160}}</ref> At this time many women were attracted to him, and there was frequent speculation about his sexual escapades in many London tabloids, such as ''[[The Satirist]]''.<ref name=StClairp157>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=157}}</ref>\n\nHe soon had a falling out with Mary Shelley. He was offended in part because she turned to [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg]] for advice instead of asking him. He later described Mary as \"the blab of blabs\" in a letter to [[Claire Clairmont]].<ref name=StClairp158>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=158}}</ref> Trelawny and Mary Shelley also disagreed about a custody reform bill that was proposed by the Philosophic Radicals.<ref name=StClairp159>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=159}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time he published short stories about piracy.<ref name=StClairp162>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=162}}</ref> In 1839 he disappeared from London society due to a controversial new romance.<ref name=StClairp163>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=163}}</ref>\n\n==Third marriage==\nHe moved into a villa on Putney Hill that was owned by John Temple Leader, a political friend of his.<ref name=StClairp164>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=164}}</ref> His affair with Augusta Goring began shortly after he returned to England. She claimed to have been badly treated by her husband,<ref name=Armstrongp352>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=352}}</ref> who was a member of Parliament. Many people in London society believed that he was practising a strict ascetic routine there.<ref name=StClairp165>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=165}}</ref> Trelawny then eloped with Augusta. After she separated from her husband she began using a [[pseudonym]].<ref name=StClairp166>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=166}}</ref> She gave birth to a son in August 1839.<ref name=\"StClairp165\"/> Her husband tracked her down, however, and filed for divorce. The divorce was granted in 1841. Trelawny married Augusta and they settled in a small country town of Usk, in Monmouthshire, Wales and bought a farmhouse. They had a daughter Laetitia there as well.<ref name=\"StClairp166\"/> They later moved to a large house on a 440-acre farm two miles outside Usk.<ref name=StClairp167>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=167}}</ref> He worked hard maintaining the farm and was friends with several leading citizens from the town. He lived in Usk in Wales for twelve years total, which was longer than he had ever lived in one place in his entire life.<ref name=StClairp168>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=168}}</ref> He planted trees and lawns and flower gardens.<ref name=Armstrongp354>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=354}}</ref> Townspeople were offended by his breaking the sabbath.<ref name=Armstrongp355>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=355}}</ref> In the mid-1850s he began writing a book about his memories of Byron and Shelley.

This book was better received than previous biographies of Shelley, such as ''[[The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley]]''.

His first memoir was republished then, as well.<ref name=StClairp175>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=175}}</ref> He often edited his letters before they were published.

The characterizations of him vary greatly. Several of the authors were negative in their portrayal of him, others presented a favourable romantic portrait, and some have presented a mixed picture of his character. The authors of the biographies conducted varying amounts of scholarship and often contradicted each other about details of Trelawny's life.<ref name=Prellp2>{{Harvnb|Prell|2008|p=2}}</ref> Trelawny has been credited with helping Byron and Shelley become recognized as celebrities after their deaths.

Trelawny was born in England to a family of modest income but extensive ancestral history. Though his father became wealthy while he was a child, Edward had an antagonistic relationship with him. After an unhappy childhood, he was sent away to a school. He was assigned as a volunteer in the [[Royal Navy]] shortly before he turned thirteen.\n\nTrelawny served on multiple ships as a naval volunteer while in his teen years. He traveled to India and saw combat during engagements with the [[French Navy]]. He did not care for the naval lifestyle, however, and left at nineteen years of age without becoming a commissioned officer. After retiring from the navy, he had a brief and unhappy marriage in England. He then moved to Switzerland and later Italy where he met Shelley and Byron. He became friends with the two poets, and helped teach them about sailing. He enjoyed inventing elaborate stories about his time in the navy, and in one he claimed to have deserted and become a pirate in India. After Shelley's death, Trelawny identified his body and arranged the funeral and burial.\n\nTrelawny then travelled to Greece with Lord Byron in order to fight in the [[Greek War of Independence]]. Byron and Trelawny split up near Greece and Trelawny travelled into Greece to act as the agent of Lord Byron. After Byron died, Trelawny oversaw the preparations for the funeral and the return of his body to England. He also wrote his obituaries. Trelawny joined the cause of the Greek [[Warlord]] [[Odysseas Androutsos]] and helped to provide him with additional arms. He also married Odysseas' sister Teritza. After Odysseas fell out of favour with the Greek government and was arrested, Trelawny took control of his mountain fortress. During this time, Trelawny survived an assassination attempt. After leaving Greece, he divorced Teritza and returned to England. In England he was well received by members of London society. He then wrote a memoir titled ''Adventures of a Younger Son''. After the book was published he travelled to America for two years before returning to England. He then became politically active but soon remarried and moved to the English countryside.\n\nHe then lived the life of a country squire for 12 years and raised a family with his third wife. They eventually separated and he moved back to London with a mistress. He then wrote a well received book about Shelley and Byron. He soon became friends with several prominent artists and writers in London. He was able to share his firsthand experience with Romantic-era writers with the leading Victorian writers of the day. He later retired to [[Sompting]], where he led an [[Asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. He died in Sompting at the age of 88, having outlived almost all of his friends from the Romantic era.\n\n==Early life==\nTrelawny's birthplace is unknown, although he claimed that he was born in [[Cornwall]]. Some of his biographers have contended that he was actually born in London, as he was baptised in [[Marylebone]] as John Trelawney on 29 November 1792.<ref name=Armstrongp9/> His father, [[Charles Trelawny-Brereton]] (a descendant of [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 2nd Baronet]], who married Mary, daughter of [[Sir Edward Seymour, 2nd Baronet]], a descendant of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]]) was a British military officer who retired after reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel.<ref name=StClairp3/> His mother, Maria Hawkins, was of Cornish descent.<ref name=Armstrongp5>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=5}}</ref><ref name=Armstrongp8>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=8}}</ref> She had inherited a small sum of money from her father, but the family soon spent most of the inheritance. When Edward was six years of age, his father inherited a large sum of money from one of his wealthy cousins. The family soon used the inheritance to move to London, where they lived in a large house. As a condition of receiving the inheritance, his father was required to adopt the last name \"Brereton\". His cousin, Owen Brereton, wished to have his last name continued along with his wealth.<ref name=StClairp3/> They lived in [[Cheshire]] while Edward was a young man.<ref name=Armstrongp9>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=9}}</ref>\n\nAt some point in his youth, he began referring to himself as Edward, which was the name used by most of his friends. Later in his life he referred to himself as \"John Edward\" for several years. Edward later recalled that his father had a fierce temper. He described his father's disposition as often \"tyrannical\". His father also tried to calculate the financial worth of all his relatives and kept detailed records of the numbers.<ref name=StClairp3>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=3}}</ref> In addition to his father, many of Edward Trelawny's other ancestors had strong tempers, as well.<ref name=Armstrongp4>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=4}}</ref> His elder uncle on his mother's side, [[Sir Christopher Hawkins, 1st Baronet|Sir Christopher Hawkins]] was also wealthy. He held a seat in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] and in 1809 Trelawny's father also became a Member of the British Parliament.<ref name=StClairp4/> As a child, he was often told of the long history and adventures of his ancestors in the Trelawny family. As an adult, he was proud of having such prestigious ancestors.<ref name=StClairp6>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=6}}</ref> The recorded history of his family dated back to the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]] and included many prominent citizens.<ref name=Armstrongp1/>\n\nEdward had five siblings who survived to adulthood and several who died as children. Edward shared a disdain for his father with his siblings. Though he hated his father, Edward was close with his mother. His mother worked hard to find wealthy husbands for her daughters, to the extent that her actions were satirised by some. In addition, many people found her to be a disagreeable person as she grew older.<ref name=StClairp4>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=4}}</ref> Trelawny's parents regarded their children as potential sinners and frequently used harsh measures to try to instill a sense of discipline in them. He resented being treated in this manner.<ref name=Armstrongp1>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=1}}</ref><ref name=Armstrongp14>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=14}}</ref>\n\nEdward only had one brother, Harry Trelawny. They were close in age and were close friends during their childhood.<ref name=Armstrongp9/> Harry was quiet and reserved, which sharply contrasted with Edward's extroverted and confrontational personality.<ref name=Armstrongp14/>\n\nAs an adult, Edward Trelawny often told stories about his childhood that focused on his early willingness to take confrontational positions and conceal things from others.<ref name=StClairp5>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=5}}</ref> One often used story described the time that he killed a vicious Raven which had belonged to his father. He cited this event as an example of his habit of accepting offences up to a certain point before later taking revenge as the offences mounted. He later described the Raven incident in his autobiography, ''Adventures of a Younger Son''.<ref name=Armstrongp10>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=10}}</ref> In the book he described the fight with the raven as the \"most awful duel\" that he ever had.<ref name=Armstrongp12>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=12}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nAt the age of eight Charles Brereton decided to send Edward to live at the [[Seyer school]], which was located two miles from their home in [[Bristol]] at that time. Trelawny later claimed that his father had resisted sending him to the school for some time due to its cost, but decided to enroll him after he caught him stealing apples from an orchard in the back yard. Trelawny hated the school and was angry at his father for sending him there. He often complained that the school served terrible food and subjected him to frequent flogging as a form of punishment.<ref name=StClairp7>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=7}}</ref> In addition to flogging, one of his classmates recorded that caning was a frequent method of punishment there, as well.<ref name=StClairp8/> The school's treatment of its students was actually comparable to many other schools of that time.<ref name=Armstrongp15>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=15}}</ref> He was also bullied and treated cruelly by other students there.<ref name=StClairp11>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=11}}</ref>\n\nThe schoolmaster there frequently condemned the [[French Revolution]]. These condemnations may have given Trelawny an early sympathy with revolutionary ideals.<ref name=StClairp8>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=8}}</ref> He was expelled from the school after two years due to violent behaviour towards teachers as well as starting fires after being confined in his room as punishment.<ref name=StClairp9>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\n==Naval career==\n[[Image:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|300px|\nThe Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up by [[J. M. W. Turner]],1838]]\nCharles Brereton had originally hoped that his sons would attend Oxford. He became disappointed by the slow pace of Edward's learning as a child.<ref name=Armstrongp19>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=19}}</ref> In October 1805, shortly before his thirteenth birthday, he enrolled Edward in the Royal Navy as a first class volunteer. The younger sons of the [[gentry]] traditionally entered the military at that time.<ref name=StClairp10/> His family enrolled him as early as they could because seniority was crucial to career advancement at that time.<ref name=StClairp13>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=13}}</ref>\n\nHis first experiences in the navy were serving on ships that had returned from the Battle of Trafalgar with many badly wounded sailors.<ref name=StClairp10>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=10}}</ref> In November he was transferred to ''Temeraire'' and then to ''Colossus''. He later attended a naval school in [[Portsmouth]]. In 1806 he served aboard HMS ''Woolwich''. While serving on ''Woolwich'' he travelled to the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and to [[St. Helena]]. In 1808 he moved to the frigate ''Resistance'', and in 1809 to the frigate ''Cornelia''. While serving aboard ''Cornelia'' he travelled to [[Bombay]].<ref name=Prellp50>{{Harvnb|Prell|2008|p=50}}</ref> Trelawny's name was entered on the books of HMS ''Superb'' as volunteer first class in October 1812.<ref name=Prellp50/>\n\nTrelawny was initially happy to have joined the navy and enjoyed the rough lifestyle there.<ref name=Armstrongp21>{{Harvnb|Armstrong|1940|p=21}}</ref><ref name=StClairp12>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=12}}</ref> He often exaggerated his age while he was in the navy. Some biographers believe he commanded a vessel as a midshipman in an engagement with the French at [[Mauritius]] in 1810.<ref name=StClairp14>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=14}}</ref> Some also believe that he was wounded engaging the French in [[Java]] in August 1811. He left the Navy in 1812 at the age of 19; receiving a final settlement of pay in 1815.<ref name=StClairp16>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=16}}</ref> He had grown to resent the discipline of the Navy due in part to the frequent punishment that he experienced. He was often sent to the [[Mast (sailing)|masthead]] for several hours at a time.<ref name=StClairp18>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=18}}</ref> During that time, he frequently entertained fantasies of [[mutiny]] and [[desertion]].<ref name=StClairp19>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=19}}</ref> Some biographers believe that Trelawny was inspired by hearing accounts of the French pirate [[Robert Surcouf]].<ref name=StClairp23>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=23}}</ref> He was never commissioned as a lieutenant, though many of his contemporaries were.<ref name=StClairp24>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=24}}</ref> This disappointed him, although he began referring to himself as Lieutenant Trelawny anyway.<ref name=StClairp25>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==First marriage==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Trelawny.Trial.jpg|thumb|\n]] -->Trelawny returned to England in 1812. Soon after he arrived he fell in love with Caroline, daughter of John Addison, of Bengal.<ref>The Baronetage of England, fifth ed., vol. I, 1824, John Debrett p. 116</ref>  She was several years younger than he but as well educated; she had studied [[French Language|French]] and was a skilled [[Piano|pianist]]. Though both of their families disapproved of the match they were not dissuaded. Trelawny's father was particularly infuriated by his son's disobedience. They were married in May 1813<ref>Debrett's Baronetage of England 1824, vol. I, p. 116 gives the date as 7 Dec. 1812</ref> and first lived in [[London]] before moving to [[Bristol]]. After their first daughter was born in 1814, they experienced financial difficulties that forced Trelawny to ask his father for money.<ref name=StClairp25/> Although he had a mutually disdainful relationship with his father,<ref name=StClairp17>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=17}}</ref> he was able to secure extra funds. Edward and Caroline soon became unhappy, causing Edward to begin leaving home often to spend time with his friends<ref name=\"StClairp25\"/> or to travel to the theatre by himself. Their second child was born in 1816.<ref name=StClairp26>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=26}}</ref>\n\nCaroline soon began having an affair with a much older man, a naval captain named Coleman. They successfully hid the affair from Trelawny for some time, he discovered it long after many others had known. Although he dearly wished to fight a duel with Coleman, he simply filed for divorce instead.<ref name=StClairp29>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=29}}</ref> The proceedings were well covered in many of London's \"penny press\" tabloid papers. This publicity caused Trelawny tremendous frustration and humiliation. The divorce order was granted in July 1817, but was not finalised until 1819.<ref name=StClairp26/><ref name=StClairp36>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=36}}</ref> Caroline was granted custody of the elder child and Edward kept the younger.<ref name=StClairp30>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=30}}</ref>\n\n==Studies==\nTrelawny's father soon attempted to purchase him a commission in the [[British Army]], but he refused to consider joining the army. His father was furious at his refusal, leading to their estrangement. Brereton became estranged with Harry around the same time, due to a marriage that he entered into against his father's wishes.<ref name=StClairp26/> Edward began staying with a former landlord whom he had befriended.<ref name=StClairp29/> She helped him find someone to take care of his child. Trelawny then began using the name \"Edward\" rather than \"John\".<ref name=StClairp30/>\n\nDue in part to the short time he spent in school, Trelawny struggled with spelling as a young man. He often spelled phonetically. This caused him significant difficulties when he tried to correspond with his friends. His spelling indicated a strong [[West Country dialects|Westcountry accent]]. His parents were concerned about this, particularly his habit of occasionally misspelling his own name. His problem with spelling might have been due to [[dyslexia]], evidence for which has been provided by one of Trelawny's biographers.<ref name=Prellp47>{{Harvnb|Prell|2011|p=47}}</ref> After he left the Navy he read voraciously. He often read [[Shakespeare's plays]] and attended the theatres in [[Covent Garden]].<ref name=StClairp32>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=32}}</ref> He began incorporating references to Shakespeare in his personal letters.<ref name=StClairp33>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=33}}</ref> He also enjoyed reading the works of [[Lord Byron]], including ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]''.<ref name=StClairp34>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=34}}</ref> During this time he also accompanied his mother and sisters on a trip to Paris.<ref name=Prellp18>{{Harvnb|Prell|2011|p=18}}</ref>\n\n==Switzerland==\nEven though they often quarrelled, Charles Brereton continued to provide Trelawny with an allowance. He received an allowance of \u00a3300 a year, which was roughly the same amount as retired captains received as a pension at that time. He began to present himself as Captain Edward Trelawny, Royal Navy, Retired.<ref name=Prellp18/> He decided to leave England to find a cheaper place to live. After initially considering a move to [[Buenos Aires]], he decided to move to [[Switzerland]].<ref name=StClairp36/> In Switzerland he was not directly affected by the [[inflation]] that was occurring in England. After moving to [[Geneva]] he soon became bored by the city and spent much of his time hunting and fishing expeditions.<ref name=StClairp37>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=37}}</ref> In the summer of 1820, while staying in [[Lausanne]], Trelawny befriended a local bookseller. The bookseller soon recommended to him that he read ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab]]'' by Percy Bysshe Shelley. This was the first time that he had heard of Percy Shelley. He read ''Queen Mab'' and he greatly enjoyed the work.<ref name=Gryllsp67>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=67}}</ref>\n\nHe soon met [[Edward Ellerker Williams]] and [[Thomas Medwin]] at the home of a friend in [[Geneva]].<ref name=StClairp39>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=39}}</ref> He had served on the same ship as Williams in the navy, although not at the same time.<ref name=Prellp50/> They also introduced him to the work of Percy Bysshe Shelley.<ref name=StClairp40>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=40}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1820 Trelawny learned that his father had died and returned to England from Switzerland.<ref name=StClairp40/> After arriving in England he learned that he only had received a much smaller inheritance than he had expected. He was sorely disappointed and soon returned to Switzerland.<ref name=StClairp41>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=41}}</ref>\n\n==Pisa==\nIn early 1822 he travelled to [[Pisa]] to meet [[Edward Ellerker Williams]] and his wife [[Jane Williams|Jane]], Thomas Medwin, Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, and Lord Byron.<ref name=StClairp43>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=43}}</ref> Trelawny greatly enjoyed meeting Percy and Mary Shelley after having looked forward to meeting them for some time. He also met Mary's half-sister [[Claire Clairmont]].<ref name=Gryllsp73>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=73}}</ref> Trelawny began spending much of his time with Mary Shelley. He often accompanied her to parties because Percy Shelley hated to do so.<ref name=Gryllsp75>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=75}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny had many similarities to Percy Shelley, including the fact that he had the same class, age, and preferences. He began to emulate Shelley in some additional ways, such as his attitudes toward authority figures.<ref name=StClairp62>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=62}}</ref> Mary Shelley enjoyed his company, as well and was fascinated by the stories that Trelawny told of his naval career.<ref name=StClairp63>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=63}}</ref> Lord Byron was initially surprised by the resemblance Trelawny bore to some of the pirates that he had written about, and once described Trelawny as the \"personification of my Corsair\".<ref name=Gryllsp74>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=74}}</ref> In some ways, Trelawny did not fit in with his new friends due to his lack of wealth and education.<ref name=StClairp47>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=47}}</ref> He had had more adventurous experiences than his friends by that time, however. He often exaggerated these experiences in conversation, especially when discussing the details of his naval career.<ref name=StClairp50>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=50}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Captain Trelawny.jpg|thumb|300px|Copy of an 1822 signature of Edward John Trelawny indicating he was a captain.]]\n\nTrelawny invented a fictional story of his activities as a teenager. The story featured him deserting from the navy and traveling throughout Asia. During this time he claimed to have formed a band of pirates who fought against the British Navy. His descriptions of his adventures often included duels and romance, such as his marrying an Arab girl name Zella who was later poisoned by a jealous rival. These stories were often violent, but his friends found them exciting.<ref name=StClairp58>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=58}}</ref> Trelawny often used real events as the baseline for his stories, and then greatly embellished the events that actually took place.<ref name=StClairp70>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=70}}</ref> His biographers have been divided as to whether he intentionally exaggerated to create a persona or if he really came to believe the stories that he created.<ref name=Prellp17>{{Harvnb|Prell|2011|p=17}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny greatly enjoyed his time in Pisa. He was active during his time there and practised boxing and fencing with his friends. He frequently attended theaters with them at night.<ref name=StClairp59>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=59}}</ref> He also enjoyed listening to Jane Williams sing and play songs with the guitar that Shelley had given to her.<ref name=StClairp61/>\n\nIn March Trelawny was involved in a high-profile confrontation that took place while he was travelling with Byron, Shelley, and some of their friends. The incident began when an Italian soldier confronted Count John Taafe, who was travelling with Shelley, Trelawny, Byron, and Byron's entourage. Although Shelley was slightly wounded as he fell from his horse chasing after the soldier, one of Byron's servants later caught the soldier and wounded him severely. The incident was controversial and received a significant amount of publicity in Pisa. This was in part due to the anti-English sentiment that existed there at that time. After a lengthy investigation by the Italian authorities, Trelawny and his friends were cleared of all charges that had been pending against them.<ref name=StClairp61>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=61}}</ref><ref name=Gryllsp81>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=81}}</ref>\n\nShelley and Edward Williams had wanted to begin sailing for some time, and Trelawny used his naval experience to help them make plans.<ref name=Prellp136>{{Harvnb|Prell|2007|p=136}}</ref> Together they decided to have an American-style [[schooner]] constructed; he had often observed this type of boat during his time in the navy.<ref name=\"Prellp136\"/><ref name=StClairp66>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=66}}</ref> After Shelley and Williams had constructed their boat, the ''Don Juan'', Trelawny was hired by Byron to be the Captain of his vessel, the ''Bolivar''.<ref name=StClairp69>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=69}}</ref> Trelawny also moved into a room in Byron's mansion at that time.<ref name=Gryllsp85>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=85}}</ref> Trelawny's friend [[Daniel Roberts (Royal Navy officer)|Daniel Roberts]] designed and supervised the construction of both vessels.<ref name=Prellp47/> The construction of the ''Bolivar'' cost \u00a3750, a sum which Byron found irritatingly high.<ref name=Gryllsp83>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=83}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Funeral of Shelley by Louis Edouard Fournier.jpg|thumb|400px| ''The Funeral of Shelley'', by [[Louis \u00c9douard Fournier]]]]\n\nTrelawny had planned to accompany the ''Don Juan'' in the ''Bolivar'' during the voyage in which the ''Don Juan'' sank. He was held back by the [[Port Authority]] because he was not carrying his port clearance with him, though he had sailed without bringing his clearance several times in the past.<ref name=\"Prellp136\"/><ref name=Gryllsp88>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=88}}</ref> After Shelley and Williams did not return to their home by the time that they were expected, Jane Williams and Mary Shelley informed Trelawny that their husbands were missing. He began making urgent inquiries and attempted to find news about them. For the next several days, he frequently met with members of the Italian Coast Guard and promised them rewards if they were able to find the boat.<ref name=Gryllsp90>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=90}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shelley's body was found, Trelawny was able to confirm the identity of the body. He then notified their wives and escorted Mary and Jane to Pisa for the funeral.<ref name=StClairp79>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=79}}</ref> Trelawny made the arrangements for the cremation and oversaw the ceremony. After Shelley's body was cremated, Trelawny removed what he thought was Shelley's unburned heart from the fire. He later wrote a full account of the funeral.<ref name=Gryllsp945>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|pp=94\u201395}}</ref> He also arranged to have a memorial built at Shelley's final resting place in Rome.<ref name=StClairp84>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=84}}</ref> Trelawny then reserved a spot for himself in the same cemetery.<ref name=Gryllsp103>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=103}}</ref>\n\nAfter the funeral, Trelawny went on a hunting trip with Daniel Roberts.<ref name=Gryllsp100>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=100}}</ref> After he returned, he soon developed tension with Byron, in part due to Byron's habit of leaving bills unpaid. This often put Trelawny in a difficult position as the captain of his boat.<ref name=StClairp85>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=85}}</ref> Byron sold the ''Bolivar'' for 400 [[guinea (coin)|guinea]]s in late 1822.<ref name=Gryllsp110>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=110}}</ref><ref name=StClairp86/> This left Trelawny unemployed. He split his time between [[Genoa]] and [[Albaro]], and hunted often. He began spending much of his time with Mary Shelley<ref name=StClairp86>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=86}}</ref> and he supplied the funds for her to return to England. Trelawny soon fell in love with [[Claire Clairmont]].<ref name=StClairp88>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=88}}</ref> She ultimately spurned his proposals, however. He decided to move after his mother found his address and began sending him letters.<ref name=StClairp89>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=89}}</ref>\n\n==Greece==\nShelley had been supportive of the idea of Greek independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] before he died.<ref name=StClairp91>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=91}}</ref> In June 1823 Byron decided to go to Greece to fight for independence, and Trelawny enthusiastically accompanied him.<ref name=StClairp92>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=92}}</ref> With the assistance of Captain Daniel Roberts, Byron chartered a boat named ''Hercules'' to transport them there.<ref name=Prellp47/><ref name=Prellp1>{{Harvnb|Prell|2011|p=1}}</ref><ref name=Gryllsp114>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=114}}</ref> During the voyage, Trelawny and Byron sometimes irritated each other.

They then left him in [[Kefalonia]] and traveled to Greece.<ref name=StClairp95>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=95}}</ref> Byron approved of Trelawny's plan to travel deeper into Greece and presented him with a sword and a letter of introduction shortly before he departed. Byron also asked them to soon return to him with more information.<ref name=Gryllsp119>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=119}}</ref>\n\nAfter initially staying with a shepherd after they arrived in Greece, they travelled to [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]]. Trelawny wore authentic [[Souliotes|Souliote]] dress on the journey. After arriving in Tripoli, Trelawny met with [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] whom he soon came to strongly dislike.<ref name=StClairp97>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=97}}</ref> He also met [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], whom he later came to admire. They traveled together to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], on the journey Trelawny viewed the sites of previous battles. He recorded that he could see the bones of those who had been slain there.<ref name=StClairp98>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=98}}</ref> He spoke with many Greek leaders after arriving in Salamis. He was well respected as the agent of Lord Byron, whom they held in high esteem. He frequently [[Byron's letters|corresponded with Lord Byron]] and encouraged him to come to Greece.<ref name=StClairp99>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=99}}</ref> He was disappointed when Byron did not come for some time, and that when he did come he came to territory that was overseen by Mavrokordatos. Trelawny, however, greatly enjoyed [[Corinth]] and [[Athens]]. Rumours later emerged that he purchased a [[harem]] of twelve to fifteen women while staying in Athens. However, some have maintained that he may have actually redeemed the women from slavery.<ref name=StClairp100>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=100}}</ref><ref name=Gryllsp149>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=149}}</ref>\n\nHe soon left on a raiding expedition with the warlord [[Odysseas Androutsos]], who controlled  much of Eastern Greece.<ref name=StClairp101>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=101}}</ref> Trelawny thought highly of Odysseas, describing him as a brother and comparing him to [[George Washington]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].<ref name=Gryllsp129/><ref name=StClairp102/><ref name=Gryllsp124>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=124}}</ref> During this time Trelawny commanded a group of twenty-five [[Albania]]n soldiers.<ref name=Gryllsp124/> In the winter of 1823\u201324, Odysseas and his men fought several battles with the Turks and destroyed villages in the [[Euboea]] region.<ref name=StClairp102>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=102}}</ref> Trelawny lobbied Byron to send them more arms, but Byron decided to wait before shipping any to consider the political implications. Some have called into question the effectiveness of Odysseas' campaign and many view Byron's delay as a polite refusal.<ref name=Gryllsp125>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=125}}</ref>\n\nAfter Byron died in April 1824, Trelawny returned from an expedition with Odysseas. Trelawny claimed that upon arriving in [[Messolonghi]], he began overseeing the funeral preparations.<ref name=StClairp103>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=103}}</ref> In the days before his death, Byron often said he wished Trelawny would return to him.  Trelawny then wrote several accounts of Byron's last years and sent them to papers in England. In these accounts he often exaggerated the role he played in Byron's life.<ref name=StClairp105>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=105}}</ref> Shortly after Byron died, Trelawny reported he took the opportunity to view his deformed foot with a servant of Byron's.\n\n==Mountain fortress==\n[[Image:Trelawny.by.Severn.jpg|thumb|Trelawny by [[Joseph Severn]]]]\n\nTrelawny then began lobbying members of the London Greek Committee to fully support Odysseas.<ref name=StClairp107>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=107}}</ref> He also lobbied for a Greek Congress and criticised Mavrokordatos.<ref name=StClairp108>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=108}}</ref> In a letter to Mary Shelley Trelawny described Mavrokordatos as a \"miserable Jew\" and said that he hoped to see him [[behead]]ed.<ref name=Gryllsp129>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=129}}</ref> Trelawny was able to transfer some portions of weapons shipments from London to Odysseas. This was a controversial move among Greek leaders and the London Greek Committee, many of whom saw it as a foolish move.<ref name=StClairp110>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=110}}</ref> He also suggested that the Greek authorities should hire [[privateer]]s to harass Turkish ships.<ref name=Gryllsp128>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=128}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1824 Trelawny brought a load of guns to the fortified cave in which Odysseas was based. He arrived with a British military officer, Whitcomb, and a military engineer, Fenton.<ref name=StClairp113>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=113}}</ref> Trelawny recorded that Odysseas commanded a force of 5,000 men, who killed over 20,000 people during their campaign.<ref name=StClairp114>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=114}}</ref> Odysseas and his men retired to Parnassus after they learned the Greek government would not give them more funds. The Greek Government had decided to try to raise a regular army and take power away from the warlords. The size of his force soon diminished.<ref name=StClairp115>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=115}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny hoped to convince Odysseas to leave with him for the Ionian islands, but Odysseas refused. He also helped Odysseas hide some valuable antiquities; they were never found. Some sources claim that Odysseas was attempting to strike a deal with the Turks at that time.<ref name=StClairp116>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=116}}</ref> Trelawny soon married Teritza, the half-sister of Odysseas. She was much younger than he, and was probably a teenager.<ref name=StClairp118/> Some have speculated that their wedding was performed by a local [[Greek Orthodox]] priest.<ref name=Gryllsp131>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|p=131}}</ref> Teritza then lived with him in the cave. At this point Trelawny's life had actually began to resemble many of the stories that he had previously constructed about his past.<ref name=StClairp118>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=118}}</ref> Word soon spread to England that Trelawny was working for the Turks with Odysseas now.<ref name=StClairp120>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=120}}</ref> Trelawny again tried to convince Odysseas to escape with him to the Ionian Islands in order to prevent the Greek government from arresting him.<ref name=Gryllsp131/> Odysseas was caught on his way to find a boat.<ref name=\"Gryllsp131\"/> He was charged with treason and imprisoned in Athens. Trelawny administered the cave in his absence.<ref name=StClairp121>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=121}}</ref>\n\n===Assassination attempt===\nTension between Trelawny and his two English companions Fenton and Whitcomb had been growing. When a shooting match was proposed, Trelawny arrogantly said that even with a pistol he could outshoot the other two with rifles.<ref name =Crane>{{Harvnb|Crane|1999|p=203}}</ref> During the contest, when Trelawny was checking the target, he was shot in the back by Whitcomb, who was urged on by Fenton. Fenton was quickly shot and killed by one of Trelawny's Greek soldiers. Seeing this, Whitcomb tried to flee but was captured by soldiers.<ref name=StClairp122>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=122}}</ref> The soldiers initially hung Whitcomb off a cliff by his ankles as punishment, but Trelawny asked them to stop and they imprisoned the man. There was no doctor available and Trelawny lived on a diet of raw eggs that was suggested by his wife, who attended to him there. He needed to have a musket ball removed, however. His men soon kidnapped a [[Trachis|Klept]] doctor and forced him to operate at gunpoint. The doctor's efforts were unsuccessful. Although Trelawny was in poor condition for several weeks he eventually recovered. His living assailant was later released. The soldiers wanted to roast Whitcomb alive, but Trelawny insisted on releasing him.<ref name=Gryllsp1345>{{Harvnb|Grylls|1950|pp=134\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny was bedridden for five weeks after he was shot. After word spread to England that Trelawny had survived, many of his relatives unsuccessfully lobbied the British government to extract him from Greece. The British Army Major D'Arcy Bacon learned of his situation and came to an agreement with Mavrokordatos to allow Trelawny to leave Greece.<ref name=StClairp1235/> Bacon went searching for Trelawny and was captured by some of Odysseas' soldiers. They had mistaken him for a doctor and hoped that he would operate on Trelawny.<ref name=Gryllsp1345/> A British [[Corvette]] sailed to Corinth to pick him up, Teritza accompanied him. His story was widely published in English newspapers then.<ref name=StClairp1235>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|pp=123\u2013125}}</ref> Some biographers believe that Fenton and Whitcomb were bribed by Mavrokordatos to kill Trelawny and give over the cave.

There were later rumours that Trelawny had been abusive towards her and had forbidden her to wear non-Greek clothing.<ref name=StClairp127>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=127}}</ref> Teritza then moved into a nunnery and gave birth to their second child there.<ref name=StClairp127/><ref name=Gryllsp146/> The child died at a young age, however.<ref name=\"StClairp127\"/><ref name=\"Gryllsp146\"/> Teritza was awarded a small alimony and soon left the nunnery to remarry.

Though he was attracted to her, she too spurned his advances, although they did correspond up until her death in 1879.<ref name=StClairp131/>\n\nIn 1828 he began referring to himself as \"John Edward Trelawny\", but he returned to \"Edward John Trelawny\" three years later.<ref name=StClairp131>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=131}}</ref> In late 1828 he returned to England and met with [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg]] and Jane Williams.

He then decided to write about himself. He discussed many actual events in his life, but greatly embellished many details.<ref name=StClairp134>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=134}}</ref> He also discussed radical politics in the book.<ref name=StClairp144>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=144}}</ref>\n\nIn 1829 Trelawny made plans to live with his three daughters in Italy. He abandoned this plan after his eldest daughter died and his finances became strained.

Brown was irritated that Trelawny burned furniture for firewood, but agreed to copy-edit the book for him.<ref name=StClairp136>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=136}}</ref> He began work on the book in 1829 but did not finish it until 1831.<ref name=Prellp51>{{Harvnb|Prell|2008|p=51}}</ref> He was likely dyslexic and his draft required extensive editing by Brown.<ref name=Prellp49>{{Harvnb|Prell|2008|p=49}}</ref>\n\nTrelawny then sent his draft to Mary Shelley to arrange publication under the title ''A Man's Life''. Mary insisted on removing some passages from the book that could be viewed as offensive.<ref name=StClairp136/> He decided to publish it anonymously, but it was expected that many would be able to guess his identity. He did not earn as much money from the publisher as he had hoped.<ref name=StClairp137>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=137}}</ref> In Autumn 1831 his book was finally published.<ref name=StClairp138>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=138}}</ref>\n\nHis book was published anonymously but within a month it had become well known that he was the author.<ref name=Prellp5>{{Harvnb|Prell|2008|p=5}}</ref> Most contemporary reviewers accepted the book as factual,<ref name=StClairp140>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=140}}</ref> but subsequent scholarship has demonstrated that most of the book is no more than a fictional account of his life. Writing in the ''Keats-Shelley Journal'' of 1956, Anne Hill concluded that \"the proportion of truth to fiction in ''Adventures of a younger son'' turns out to be small, not more than one tenth.\" His biography has since been translated into French, German, Swedish, and Gaelic.<ref name=Prellp1/> Trelawny returned to England in 1832 and was famous and well received by London society and was treated like a hero.

He then travelled to New York in early summer. In New York he met Fenimore Cooper and Fanny Kemble.<ref name=StClairp146>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=146}}</ref> They then travelled to Niagara. Wherever they went he often talked of staying permanently. He repeatedly raised political issues and furiously argued when disagreed with.<ref name=StClairp148>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=148}}</ref> In August he decided to try to swim across the rapids below the falls.

He travelled to Philadelphia again by autumn 1834. He was depressed at that time, and returned to England in spring 1835.\n\n==Philosophical Radicals==\nUpon his return to England, Trelawny became politically active with a group known as the [[Philosophical Radicals]]. The group advocated [[left-wing politics]] and often focused its efforts on the [[rights of women]].<ref name=StClairp155>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=155}}</ref> Trelawny began associating with its supporters, many of whom were among the upper-class members of London society.<ref name=StClairp156>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=156}}</ref> Most of London society was willing to overlook his claims of disloyalty against the British after his claimed desertion and accepted him into society.<ref name=StClairp160>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=160}}</ref> At this time many women were attracted to him, and there was frequent speculation about his sexual escapades in many London tabloids, such as ''[[The Satirist]]''.<ref name=StClairp157>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=157}}</ref>\n\nHe soon had a falling out with Mary Shelley. He was offended in part because she turned to [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg]] for advice instead of asking him. He later described Mary as \"the blab of blabs\" in a letter to [[Claire Clairmont]].<ref name=StClairp158>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=158}}</ref> Trelawny and Mary Shelley also disagreed about a custody reform bill that was proposed by the Philosophic Radicals.<ref name=StClairp159>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=159}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time he published short stories about piracy.<ref name=StClairp162>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=162}}</ref> In 1839 he disappeared from London society due to a controversial new romance.<ref name=StClairp163>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=163}}</ref>\n\n==Third marriage==\nHe moved into a villa on Putney Hill that was owned by John Temple Leader, a political friend of his.<ref name=StClairp164>{{Harvnb|St Clair|1977|p=164}}</ref> His affair with Augusta Goring began shortly after he returned to England.

After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''. With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records.\n\nParton's music includes 25 [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with [[Reba McEntire]]). She has 41 career top-10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. She has garnered ten [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, ten [[Country Music Association Awards]], seven [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 47 Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\", \"[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\". She is also [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|one of the few]] to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]].

Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy\", which went to number 17.

As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|work=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s \"[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]\", released in late 1967, reached the country top 10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top-10 singles for the pair.\n\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]\", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo efforts \u2013 even \"[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]\", which later became a standard \u2013 were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored.

Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' \"[[Mule Skinner Blues]]\", a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, \"[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]\". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits \u2013 including her signature song \"[[Coat of Many Colors]]\" (number four, 1971) \u2013 in addition to her duets. Top-20 singles included \"The Right Combination\" and \"Burning the Midnight Oil\" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); \"Lost Forever in Your Kiss\", (with Wagoner) \"[[Touch Your Woman]]\", (1972) \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" and \"Travelin' Man\" (1973).<ref name=\"DollyPartonEntertainment.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\".

In a 2019 episode of the [[Sky Arts]] music series ''Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road'', Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she'd composed both \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson \"Buddy, that was a good night.\" Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with \"[[The Bargain Store]]\".<ref>[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts \u2013 The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.</ref>\n\n===1976\u20131986: Pop transition===\n[[File:Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg|thumb|upright|Parton in 1977]]\nFrom 1974 to 1980, she consistently charted in the country [[Top 40|Top 10]], with eight singles reaching number one.

With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs \u2013 the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]\" \u2013 and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest...First Gathering \u2013 18th Solo Album|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single \"[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]\" made much of an impression on the pop charts.\n\nAfter ''New Harvest'''s disappointing chart performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]],'' became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart.

A second single, the double A-sided \"[[Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top 20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously.

During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again'''s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher...

In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special ''The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music'', performed live at the [[Ford Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and whose audience included President [[Jimmy Carter]].\nHer commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the [[Donna Summer]]-written \"[[Starting Over Again (Donna Summer song)|Starting Over Again]]\", \"[[Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\", which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.<ref name=\"allMusicGuide\"/> She had another Top 10 single that year with \"Making Plans\", a single released from a 1980 [[Porter & Dolly|reunion album with Porter Wagoner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Between Me And You compilation w/Porter Wagoner|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/just-between-you-and-me-compilation/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dolly Parton holding a baby in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], 1983]]\nThe theme song to the 1980 feature film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', in which she starred along with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], \"9 to 5\", not only reached number one on the country chart, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] charts, giving her a triple number-one hit.

''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses]]\".

Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful.

After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''. With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records.\n\nParton's music includes 25 [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with [[Reba McEntire]]). She has 41 career top-10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. She has garnered ten [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, ten [[Country Music Association Awards]], seven [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 47 Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\", \"[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\". She is also [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|one of the few]] to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]]. As an actress, she has starred in films such as ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), for which she earned [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], as well as ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' (1984), ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' (1989), ''[[Straight Talk]]'' (1992) and ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' (2012).\n\n==Early life and career==\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]] in [[Pittman Center, Tennessee|Pittman Center]], a very small community in [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of [[East Tennessee]].{{sfn|Parton|1994}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Randy L.

Her father, known as \"Lee\", worked in the mountains of East Tennessee, first as a [[sharecropper]] and later tending his own small tobacco farm and acreage. He also worked construction jobs to supplement the farm's small income. Mr. Parton was illiterate but Dolly Parton often says despite that fact, he was one of the smartest people she's known in regards to business and making a profit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daddy's Dinner Bucket: Mr. Lee Parton|url=http://dollyparton.com/front-porch-stories/daddys-dinner-bucket-lee-parton/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Parton|1994}}<ref name=\"belfasttelegraphifightilliteracy\">{{cite news|title=Dolly Parton: 'I fight illiteracy for my father'|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/dolly-parton-i-fight-illiteracy-for-my-father-35185084.html|access-date=July 3, 2018|work=Belfast Telegraph|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> Avie Lee was homemaker for the large family. Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with songs and tales of mountain folklore. Avie Lee's father, Jake Owens, was a [[Pentecostal]] preacher, so Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly. Parton has long credited her father for her business savvy, and her mother's family for her musical abilities.{{sfn|Parton|1994}}\nWhile Dolly Parton was still very young, her family moved to a farm on nearby Locust Ridge. Most of her cherished memories of youth happened there, and it is the place about which she wrote the song \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home (song)|My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" in the 1970s.

Her songs were recorded by many other artists during this period, including [[Kitty Wells]] and [[Hank Williams Jr.]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Whitburn|2005|pages=108, 422}}.</ref> She signed with [[Monument Records]] in 1965, at age 19; she initially was pitched as a [[bubblegum pop]] singer. She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby\", did not crack the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.\n\nAfter her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\", as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy\", which went to number 17.

As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|work=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s \"[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]\", released in late 1967, reached the country top 10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top-10 singles for the pair.\n\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]\", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo efforts \u2013 even \"[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]\", which later became a standard \u2013 were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly and Uncle Bill Owens start Owe-Par Publishing Company|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/owe-par-publishing-company/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.\n\nBy 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' \"[[Mule Skinner Blues]]\", a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, \"[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]\". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits \u2013 including her signature song \"[[Coat of Many Colors]]\" (number four, 1971) \u2013 in addition to her duets. Top-20 singles included \"The Right Combination\" and \"Burning the Midnight Oil\" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); \"Lost Forever in Your Kiss\", (with Wagoner) \"[[Touch Your Woman]]\", (1972) \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" and \"Travelin' Man\" (1973).<ref name=\"DollyPartonEntertainment.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\".

(It eventually also charted in the U.K., reaching number seven in 1976, representing Parton's first U.K. success). Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated.

That decision has been credited with helping to make her many millions of dollars in royalties from the song over the years.

In a 2019 episode of the [[Sky Arts]] music series ''Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road'', Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she'd composed both \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson \"Buddy, that was a good night.\" Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with \"[[The Bargain Store]]\".<ref>[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts \u2013 The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.</ref>\n\n===1976\u20131986: Pop transition===\n[[File:Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg|thumb|upright|Parton in 1977]]\nFrom 1974 to 1980, she consistently charted in the country [[Top 40|Top 10]], with eight singles reaching number one.

Her siblings Randy and Stella both received recording contracts of their own.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\nParton began to embark on a high-profile crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with [[Sandy Gallin]], who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs \u2013 the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]\" \u2013 and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest...First Gathering \u2013 18th Solo Album|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single \"[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]\" made much of an impression on the pop charts.\n\nAfter ''New Harvest'''s disappointing chart performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]],'' became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first top-ten single on the pop chart (#3). A second single, the double A-sided \"[[Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top 20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-[[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Official Song List|url=http://dollyparton.com/music-discography-song-list/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton and Burnett.jpg|thumb|upright|left|With [[Carol Burnett]], 1980]]\nIn 1978, Parton won a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her ''Here You Come Again'' album. She continued to have hits with \"[[Heartbreaker (Dolly Parton song)|Heartbreaker]]\", (1978) \"[[Baby I'm Burning]]\" (1979) and \"[[You're the Only One (Dolly Parton song)|You're the Only One]],\" (1979) all of which charted in the pop [[Top 40]] and topped the country chart. \"[[Sweet Summer Lovin']]\" (1979) became the first Parton single in two years to not top the country chart (though it did reach the Top 10). During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again'''s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher... Special|television special]], and her own joint special with [[Carol Burnett]] on CBS, ''Carol and Dolly in Nashville''.\n\nParton served as one of three co-hosts (along with [[Roy Clark]] and [[Glen Campbell]]) on the CBS special ''Fifty Years of Country Music''. In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special ''The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music'', performed live at the [[Ford Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and whose audience included President [[Jimmy Carter]].\nHer commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the [[Donna Summer]]-written \"[[Starting Over Again (Donna Summer song)|Starting Over Again]]\", \"[[Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\", which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.<ref name=\"allMusicGuide\"/> She had another Top 10 single that year with \"Making Plans\", a single released from a 1980 [[Porter & Dolly|reunion album with Porter Wagoner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Between Me And You compilation w/Porter Wagoner|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/just-between-you-and-me-compilation/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dolly Parton holding a baby in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], 1983]]\nThe theme song to the 1980 feature film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', in which she starred along with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], \"9 to 5\", not only reached number one on the country chart, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] charts, giving her a triple number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top 10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had 12 Top-10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of \"I Will Always Love You,\" from the feature film ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982) scraped the Top 50 that year and her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" (written by the [[Bee Gees]] and produced by [[Barry Gibb]]), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with \"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\", \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\", \"[[Tennessee Homesick Blues]]\" (1984), \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), \"[[Don't Call It Love]]\" (1985) and \"[[Think About Love]]\" (1986) all reaching the country Top 10 (\"Tennessee Homesick Blues\" and \"Think About Love\" reached number one; \"Real Love\" also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit).

The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on ''Billboard's'' Country Albums chart, and also reached the top 10 on ''Billboard'''s Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\", which went to number one. ''Trio'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]],'' (1987) including the single \"[[The River Unbroken]]\", Parton focused on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses]]\". Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the charts.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton with square red earrings.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dolly Parton at a recording session ca 1989]]A duet with [[Ricky Van Shelton]], \"[[Rockin' Years]]\" (1991) reached number one, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded \"I Will Always Love You\" for the soundtrack of the feature film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful. But her 1993 album ''[[Slow Dancing with the Moon]]'' won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart. She recorded \"The Day I Fall in Love\" as a duet with [[James Ingram]] for the feature film ''[[Beethoven's 2nd (film)|Beethoven's 2nd]]'' (1993). The songwriters (Ingram, [[Carole Bayer Sager]], and [[Clif Magness]]) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast.

The following year, ''[[Treasures (Dolly Parton album)|Treasures]]'', an album of covers of 1960s/70s hits was released, and featured a diverse collection of material, including songs by [[Mac Davis]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Cat Stevens]], and [[Neil Young]]. Her recording of Stevens' \"[[Peace Train]]\" was later re-mixed and released as a dance single, reaching ''Billboard's ''dance singles chart. Her 1998 country-rock album ''[[Hungry Again]]'' was made up entirely of her own compositions.

Usually, the champions of a division are promoted in the next year to the immediately upper level.\n\n==History==\nThe Second Level of the Bahia State Championship is competed since 1922, and was not held from 1924 to 1934, in 1938, from 1942 to 1964, in 1966, in 1969, in 1970, from 1972 to 1974, from 1976 to 1980 and in 2005. The Third Level was only held in 2000.\n\n==Competition format==\nThe 2019 Second Level was competed by six clubs which played against each other twice. The two best placed clubs qualified to the final. In the final the two clubs played against each other twice, and the champion of the competition was promoted to the following year's first level.\n\nThe 2012 Third Level was competed by four clubs, mainly as a qualifying stage to that year's Second Level. The clubs played against each other twice, with the two best placed being qualified to the Second Level and the best placed beind declared champions.\n\n==Participants==\n===Second Level===\n''2019 edition''\n*[[Cana\u00e3 Esporte Clube|Cana\u00e3]]\n*[[Doce Mel Esporte Clube|Doce Mel]]\n*[[Gal\u00edcia Esporte Clube|Gal\u00edcia]]\n*[[Esporte Clube Ol\u00edmpia|Ol\u00edmpia]]\n*[[Pitua\u00e7u Futebol Clube Cajazeiras|PFC Cajazeiras]]\n*[[UNIRB Futebol Clube|UNIRB]]\n\n===Third Level===\n''2012 edition''\n*[[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Desportiva Comunit\u00e1ria Astro|Astro]]\n*[[Atl\u00e2ntico Esporte Clube|Atl\u00e2ntico]]\n*[[Sport Clube Cama\u00e7ariense|Cama\u00e7ariense]]\n*[[Cruzeiro Futebol Clube (BA)|Cruzeiro]]\n\n==List of champions==\nThe table below shows the lower level champions of Baiano State Championship.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:87%; width:60%;\"\n|-\n!

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. This improves nothing in their relationship, with Sarah Ruth judging Parker for having so many tattoos and Parker constantly deciding that he would not return home to her that day, yet he always finds himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back; even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, and in the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention, so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequented in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story closes with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt.

In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''. O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by the lifestyle that Parker led, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy.
