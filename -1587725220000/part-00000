Though there are only 23 levels, the lack of a level skip and game continues means this is an average-difficulty endurance contest which will take some time to finish.\" Giving a final score of 7 out of 10.<ref name=ign-lynx>{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/07/07/rygar |title=An above average arcade conversion for Atari Lynx. |publisher=IGN Entertainment |author=Robert A.

Ashley|William Henry Ashley]] and [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]]. Among the original employees, known as \"Ashley's Hundred,\" were [[Jedediah Smith]], who went on to take a leading role in the company's operations, and [[Jim Bridger]], who was among those who bought out Smith and his partners in 1830. It was Bridger and his partners who gave the enterprise the name \"Rocky Mountain Fur Company.\"\n\nThe company became a pioneer in western exploration, most notably in the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River Valley]]. The operations of other aspiring organizations like the [[American Fur Company]] would often overlap, causing a fierce rivalry. Growing competition motivated the trappers to explore and head deeper into the wilderness. This led to greater knowledge of the topography and to great reductions in the [[beaver]] populations.\n\nEventually the intense competition for fewer and fewer beavers and the transient style of fur hats brought the Rocky Mountain Fur Company down. Nearly a decade after its founding, the stock holders sold all their shares, leaving behind a legacy in terms of both western settlement and folklore. The US government, seeking geographic knowledge or travel advice regarding the West, would seek out former members of the company as consultants. Ashley himself later became a congressman whose expertise was Western affairs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The American Fur Trade of the Far West: a History of the Pioneer Trading Posts and Early Fur Companies of the Missouri Valley and the Rocky Mountains and of the Overland Commerce with Santa Fe.|last = Chittenden|first = Hiram Martin|publisher = Academic Reprints|year = 1954|isbn = |location = Stanford, CA|pages = }}</ref>\n\n== Founding ==\nIn the early 1820s General William Ashley, of the Missouri militia, was looking to enter state politics but needed to raise funds to do so.

To counteract his previous financial failures, he looked west to the fur trade.\n\nJoining him as a partner was Major Andrew Henry, a long-time friend of Ashley's. Canvasing the local St. Louis area in 1822, they published an ad in the ''Missouri Republican'' (266 Chittenden). It targeted \"One Hundred enterprising young men . . . to ascend the river Missouri to its source, there to be employed for one, two, or three years.\" The caliber of men sought by Ashley and Henry would serve as the prototypical \"mountain man\".

Smith, Jackson and William Sublette bought the Company in 1826, and sold out to Bridger, Milton Sublette, Fitzpatrick and two others in 1830, at which time the enterprise was given the name by which it is most commonly referred to.\n\nThe payment method was uniquely designed by Ashley. Leveraging employment costs, Ashley and Henry had their trappers keep half of their proceeds and forfeit the other half to management.

As the company considered building outposts along the river, Ashley soon discovered that the Missouri Fur Company had already done so. Eventually Ashley and his company moved farther west to the mountain range for which it was named.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Majority of Scoundrels : an Informal History of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company|last = Berry|first = Don|publisher = Harper|year = 1961|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}</ref>\n\nForging new paths and discovering landscapes unknown to whites, the Rocky Mountain Fur Company ultimately pioneered a new style in the fur trade. Known as the brigade-rendezvous system, Major Henry's system was formed in part as a reaction to a July 1822 law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Indians. Prior to this point, the fur trade had relied on Indians to do the actual trapping and hunting that produced the furs; they were then brought to trading posts where, with increasing frequency, the Indians were given liquor both as an actual medium of exchange, and in order to render them pliant and easily cheated. The pattern was so firmly established that it was difficult to conduct business without a substantial supply of alcohol. Henry's plan made Indian trappers and trading posts unnecessary; he trained young white and [[met\u00eds]] men to trap and had them meet him at rendezvous, which were temporary trade gatherings that could be located wherever it was convenient.\n\nAshley and his men had mixed success.  By the middle of the decade, the company had a firm grasp of the Rockies. Headquartered in the Green River Valley, trappers found numerous spots to collect valuable pelts. Some of these locations included: Horse Creek, La Barge Creek, Fontenolle Creek, and Black Fork. Two popular trading destinations were Pierre's Hole in Idaho and Fort Bonneville (also called Fort Nonsense) in Wyoming. In some cases, however, the company took heavy losses. Losing supplies and even men, some expeditions ended in catastrophe. On two separate occasions, trappers were killed by Blackfeet and Arikara Indians. Another blow was when Major Andrew Henry, considered the most experienced trapper, left the company in 1824. Two years later Ashley followed suit to embark on a political career. In 1826 he sold his company off to a group of his employees. Nonetheless, the Rocky Mountain Fur Company continued for eight more years. None of these setbacks spelled the end for Ashley's Hundred, but soon the company confronted the same set of problems that faced the entire industry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Decline and demise ==\nLike all fur companies at the time, Ashley's Hundred went out of business in face of deepening financial woes. Competition, which bred bitter rivalries, helped to price the Rocky Mountain Fur Company out of the market. Declining beaver populations and shifting fashions did the rest of the damage.\n\nRocky Mountain trappers encroached on competitors' territory, resulting in bitter turf wars. The Rocky Mountain Fur Company was a rival to [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[American Fur Company]]. They frequently held their rendezvous near a Hudson's Bay Company post to draw off some of their Indian trade, and their trappers went into the [[Snake River|Snake]], [[Umpqua River|Umpqua]] and [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] valleys, all of which were considered the domain of the Hudson's Bay Company.<ref name=\":0\"/> By 1832, the competition was at its height. So too was the growing Native American resentment, which resulted in several skirmishes. Moreover, unbridled competition dwindled the available fur supply. A once healthy population of beaver, otter, bear, and muskrat disappeared; the companies found it harder and harder to trap. This only led to greater struggle for the zones with abundant game. The larger American and Hudson's Bay companies also had an advantage over the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. With access to a wider land base, these two companies undersold their smaller competitor. Even more catastrophic was the fading popularity of the fur hat. Once a staple of European and American fashion, fur hats fell out of fashion in the 1830s, replaced by newly popular [[silk]] hats. By 1834, the company was in trouble. Facing insolvency, the partners decided to sell off their assets. A once bitter rival, the American Fur Company, quickly absorbed Ashley's creation.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"Malone 54-56\">{{cite book|last1=Malone|first1=Michael P.|last2=Roeder|first2=Richard B.|last3=Lang|first3=William L.|title=Montana : a history of two centuries|date=1991|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle, WA|edition=Revised|pages=54\u201356}}</ref>\n\n== Trapping a legacy ==\nFew knew the Rocky Mountains better than Ashley's Hundred. Among Euro-Americans, they had the greatest knowledge of a vast and treacherous terrain and shared this knowledge with both government and private parties.

The station is licensed to [[Boyertown, Pennsylvania]] and serves the [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] area. The station is under ownership of WDAC radio company. WBYN has two transmitters. The main transmitter is in a rural area 6 miles away from the station. The auxiliary transmitter and tower is located behind the station at 280 Mill street. Its coordinates are  {{Coord|40|19|04.64|N|75|38|59.81|W|region:US-PA_type:landmark}}.\n\n==History==\nThe station was founded by Dave Hendricks and was first assigned the call sign WBYO in 1969. The station employed a Christian teaching format with traditional Christian music played in between features. The station was a commercial operation but steered clear of [[Contemporary Christian Music]] except for a few hours on Saturday afternoon. On September 14, 1989, the station was sold and changed the call sign to WYCL and flipped to a gold based downtempo [[Adult Contemporary]] music format. The station played a couple new songs per hour but leaned light. The station played several uptempo songs an hour. Artists included [[The Beatles]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Chicago]], [[Supremes]], [[Elton John]], [[The Stylistics]], [[George Michael]], and others. After a few years the station proved to be unsuccessful with the new format and went bankrupt. On January 24, 1992, the station was sold to WDAC Radio Inc. It was assigned the call sign WBYN and returned to Christian radio format which consisted of preaching, teaching, traditional Christian music, and information features.  The station would sell time blocks to various ministries. On September 19, 2005, the call sign was slightly altered to WBYN-FM in preparation for a simulcast with 1160 AM (formerly WYNS), which adopted the WBYN call sign a week later.\n\nThe music was traditional Christian music and played a few hours in mornings, late afternoons, and weekends. Some time in the 1990s, the station began mixing in softer contemporary Christian artists as well as Contemporary Praise and Worship Music. By 2000, the station was playing mostly Praise and Worship music and adopted the phrase \"Life Changing Radio\".\n\n===WFKB Frank FM===\n[[Image:wfkb.jpg|thumb|left|WFKB logo used from 2006-2009]]\nWBYN and WBYN-FM were entered into an LMA with [[Nassau Broadcasting Partners]] early in 2006. WBYN 1160 kept the Christian format while WBYN-FM became \"Frank FM\" WFKB on March 15, 2006, broadcasting an [[Adult Rock]]/[[Classic rock]] hybrid formatted [[radio station]]. Frank FM had live air personalities during the day. Ken And Jenn in the morning, Randi Ellis middays (also PD/MD), Brian DiMario in afternoons, former Y100 Philadelphia jock John Von and Mike Roberts at night.  Frank FM was also the launching pad for a then weekend personality named Rob Soscia, who now goes by his real name Brian Soscia and hosts The Soscia Network Radio Show formerly of Philadelphia's Mix 106.1 and now 2-7pm Mon-Fri on 93.7 WSTW. Other on-air personalities included Jay Pinnel and Zack Morse. The station started off as a hybrid of [[Hot AC]], [[Classic Hits]] and [[Pop Alternative]] playing over 2000 songs. By the end of 2006, the station evolved into more of a heavily rock leaning classic hits format, including songs up until 1995. Core artists included [[Billy Joel]], [[Kansas]], [[Phil Collins]], [[The Beatles]], [[Elton John]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[James Taylor]], [[The Who]], [[Neil Young]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[The Cars]], and many others. WFKB also began broadcasting in [[HD Radio]] and began to multicast.

On March 31, 2009 the station dropped the Frank FM format and reverted to a similar religious format it had been broadcasting prior to the LMA but not identical programming to 1160 WBYN which was on WBYN-FM HD-2. Nassau did acquire WBYN 1160. That station, therefore, kept the religious format that previously aired on WBYN-FMHD2. WBYN-FM's religious format focuses slightly more on music and slightly less on teaching, though Nassau's 1160 WBYN religious format has a moderate amount of overlap with WBYN-FM's format. So WBYN and WBYN-FM are separately owned. WBYN-FM has opted not to broadcast on HD1 or HD2 for the time being. Though not consecutively, 107.5 has been a Christian formatted station on the FM dial for over fifty years now, all in all.\n\nFrom the Newsletter: \"The Nassau-WDAC deal struck in August 2005 was for an eventual purchase price of $22 million, and an LMA fee of $100,000 the first year, rising to $300,000 in the third year.
