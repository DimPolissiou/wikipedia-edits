It argues that the news was often buried in the back pages in part due to the view about [[Judaism]] of the paper's Jewish publisher, [[Arthur Hays Sulzberger]]. It also gives a critical look at the work of ''Times'' [[correspondent]]s in Europe.\n\n==Argument==\n\n===Placement of news articles===\nThe placement of news articles in a newspaper is a good indication of the importance given by the newspaper to a story.  ''The Times'' consistently placed major stories about the Nazi treatment of European Jews on back pages \"by the soap and shoe polish ads.\"<ref name='Goldman 2005'>{{cite journal |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Spring2006/review_goldman.html|title=In Denial |journal=Columbia Magazine |date=Spring 2005 |first=Ari L. |last=Goldman |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref> Leff found that during the period September 1939 to May 1945 very few stories about Jewish victims made the ''Times'' front page. \"The story of the Holocaust\u2014meaning articles that focused on the discrimination, deportation, and destruction of the Jews\u2014made the ''Times'' front page just 26 times, and only in six of those stories were Jews identified on the front as the primary victims.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Leff |first1=Laurel |title=Buried by the Times: the Holocaust and America's most important newspaper |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-521-81287-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/buriedbytimeshol0000leff/page/2 2\u20133] |url=https://archive.org/details/buriedbytimeshol0000leff/page/2}}</ref>\n\n===Terminology===\nLeff points out that the ''Times'' often used a more generic term such as refugee or nationality to refer to Nazi victims who were Jewish.  In his review, Gal Beckerman writes, \"More shocking even than the chronic burying of articles with the word {{'}}Jew{{'}} in them is how often that word was rubbed out of articles that specifically dealt with the Jewish condition. It's almost surreal at times. How could you possibly tell the story of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] without mentioning Jews? But ''The Times'' did, describing how {{'}}500,000 persons \u2026 were herded into less than 7 percent of Warsaw\u2019s buildings,{{'}} and how {{'}}400,000 persons were deported{{'}} to their deaths at Treblinka.

In December 1942 in a memo to ''New York Times'' staff he wrote \"I have been trying to instruct the people around here on the subject of the word 'Jews', i.e., that they are neither a race nor a people, etc.,\"<ref name='Beckerman 2005' /> Former ''New York Times'' journalist [[Ari Goldman]], in his review of the book, writes: \"There can be little doubt that Sulzberger's views about Judaism trickled down to the editors making the decisions about what to put in the newspaper every day.\"<ref name='Goldman 2005' />\n\n===Staff biases===\nLeff examines the stances and performances of the ''Times''{{'}}s reporting and editorial staff. In the field, \"She exposes the disturbing Nazi and Vichy attachments of a few European correspondents.\"<ref name='Beckerman 2005' /> While back in New York, Sulzberger's bias was shared by other Jewish staffers: \"Between them and influential Catholics among the crucial night editors, who decided where to place news items, the imperiled Jews of Europe had no advocate in the newsroom.\"<ref name='Cesarani 2005'/>\n\n==Conclusion==\nBlame for the lack of coverage: Beside the biases and lack of competence of the European correspondents, Leff \"points out the problems with journalistic convention of the time, which preferred reprinting government pronouncements to digging for unknown stories. There was also, of course, a disorganized Jewish community and a Roosevelt administration too preoccupied with the war, both not pushing hard enough for front-page coverage. But the bulk of the blame, in Leff\u2019s telling, falls squarely at the feet of ''The Times''{{'}}s publisher, Sulzberger.\"<ref name='Beckerman 2005' />\n\nA number of observers have observed how badly informed the American public was about the Nazis' systematic murder of European Jews.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Stember, ed.|title=Jews in the Mind of America |url=https://archive.org/details/jewsinmindofamer00stem|url-access=registration|year=1966 |pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wyman |first=David S. |authorlink=David Wyman |year=1984 |title=[[The Abandonment of the Jews|The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust]] |location=New York,&nbsp;NY |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lipstadt |first=Deborah E. |authorlink=Deborah Lipstadt|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-17/books/bk-16467_1_free-press|title=Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust, 1933-1945 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |year=1986 |isbn=0-02-919161-0}}</ref> Leff points out that the way the Times covered the Holocaust \"contributed to the public's ignorance.\" But in addition to poorly informing the public, \"''The Times''{{'}} coverage mattered so much,\" she writes, \"because other bystanders, particularly the American government, American Jewish groups, and the rest of the American press, took cues from the paper.

English historian, [[David Cesarani]] reviewing the book in the ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'' wrote: \"The light which Laurel Leff sheds on US government policy adds to the value of her densely documented and judiciously written study.

Leff documents this in great detail both in terms of what The Times published and in terms of the opinions of its publisher at the time, Arthur Hays Sulzberger.\"<ref name='Goldman 2005' />\n\nThroughout the book Leff's outrage concerning the behavior of ''The Times'' is apparent. Beckerman comments favorably on it:  \"Beneath every word of Laurel Leff\u2019s extraordinary and thorough new study of ''The New York Times''{{'}}s coverage of what we now call the Holocaust is this same desire\u2014for the paper to be shocked and outraged beyond its very black-and-white bounds.\" <ref name='Beckerman 2005' />\n\nHowever one reviewer criticized her approach. \"The tone of Leff's account is one of unremitting outrage. When ''The Times'' fails to report any Holocaust-related event, she is outraged. If the paper reports on it, she's outraged that the report isn't on the front page. When a Holocaust story is on the front page, she complains that it isn't high enough on the front page. When there is no editorial on some Holocaust-related subject, she is outraged, and if there is an editorial, she's outraged that it isn't the lead editorial. She is regularly outraged when either reportage or commentary, wherever placed, mentions not Jews alone but other victims as well. When one item made clear that a majority of those killed at a certain locale were Jews, she complains that this was noted 'only once' in the story.

He wrote: \"As Laurel Leff, an assistant professor at the Northeastern School of Journalism, has concluded, it was a tragic demonstration of how {{'}}the facts didn't speak for themselves.{{'}} She has been the most diligent independent student of ''The Times''{{'}}s Holocaust coverage and deftly summarized her findings last year in ''The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics''. {{'}}You could have read the front page of ''The New York Times'' in 1939 and 1940\", she wrote, \"without knowing that millions of Jews were being sent to Poland, imprisoned in ghettos, and dying of disease and starvation by the tens of thousands. You could have read the front page in 1941 without knowing that the Nazis were machine-gunning hundreds of thousands of Jews in the Soviet Union.\" Frankel called it \"the century's bitterest journalistic failure\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-turning-away-from-the-holocaust.html?pagewanted=print&src=pm Frankel]</ref>\n\n===Honors and awards===\n* Best media history book, [[American Journalism Historians Association]] \n* Best history book, ''[[Foreword Reviews|Foreword Magazine]]''\n\n==Related work==\nLeff's ongoing work on American responses to the Holocaust continues to draw commentary.
