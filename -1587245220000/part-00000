A major figure in the development of post-Independence New York City and State, Varick became the [[List of mayors of New York City|45th Mayor of New York City]] in 1789 and served eleven concurrent one-year terms until 1801.<ref name=\"dlib\">{{cite web|title=Guide to the Papers of Richard Varick 1743-1871 (Bulk 1775-1830)  MS 655|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/varick/|website=dlib.nyu.edu|publisher=[[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nPrevious to his terms as mayor, Varick served as the [[Recorder of New York City|14th Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life & family==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> Both Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

The resulting 44 letterbooks contain copies of all documents dating from May, 1775 to June, 1785.

Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Recorder & Attorney General of New York (1784 - 1789)===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City (1789 - 1801)===\n[[File:Richard varick 1805 john trumbull.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick (c.1805) by [[John Trumbull]] which still hangs today in [[New York City Hall]]]]\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nVarick would peak politically as the Mayor of New York City for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801. <ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he would continue his establishment of the technocratic structure that would ensure New York City\u2019s place as the commercial capital of the United States, despite the political capital moving to Philadelphia, then Washington D.C. At this time in history, there was no precedent of commercial and political leadership between split between two cities. \n\nIn 1791, the major financial crisis would hit the United States in New York due to a scheme to manipulate the financial markets, which had no formal structure of any kind. Varick would have to increase officers to protect the guilty parties from mobs gathering outside the prison. This would lead to a group of merchants making the \"Buttonwood Agreement\u201d in 1792 which was the seed of the New York Stock Exchange. \n\nIn the summer of 1793 a yellow fever epidemic sent New Yorkers \"fleeing north\" to nearby healthful Greenwich Village. This epidemic would lead to the creation of what would become the New York City Department of Health. Which was timely as there were further epidemics in 1795, 1796, 1798, 1799, and 1800. \n\nIn 1794, public anger at Federalist political ideals spilled into the streets with Varick\u2019s support of the [[Jay Treaty]]. An angry mob would almost physically run him out of the city. \n\nVarick ran int moe trouble when he tried to pressure the city\u2019s 1,000 or so licensed workers \u2014 tavern keepers, grocers, butchers and cartmen, all of whom had licenses to work for the city \u2014 to vote for Federalist candidates. \u201cThis went completely contrary to the egalitarian sentiment of the time,\u201d Dr. Hodges said. \nVarick\u2019s heavy-handed ways, Dr. Hodges said, pushed many of the workers away from the Federalists, represented by Alexander Hamilton, and into the opposing Democratic-Republican faction, represented by Thomas Jefferson. In 1797, after losing his seat representing New York State in the U.S. Senate, Aaron Burr took control of Tammany Hall and used it to assail Varick for his use of marketing and tax-licensing fees. Burr would win the state's electoral vote in the 1800 presidential election leading to a wide sweeping rout of [[Federalist]] politicians across New York, including Varick in 1801.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Sewell|title=Third Term No Charm, Historians Say|date=2008|publisher=[[New York Times]]|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/third-term-no-charm-historians-say/|accessdate=16 April 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Prospect hall richard varick residence jersey city 1812.png]]\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life & family==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> Both Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Recorder & Attorney General of New York (1784 - 1789)===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789.

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City (1789 - 1801)===\n[[File:Richard varick 1805 john trumbull.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick (c.1805) by [[John Trumbull]] which still hangs today in [[New York City Hall]]]]\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nVarick would peak politically as the Mayor of New York City for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801. <ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he would continue his establishment of the technocratic structure that would ensure New York City\u2019s place as the commercial capital of the United States, despite the political capital moving to Philadelphia, then Washington D.C. At this time in history, there was no precedent of commercial and political leadership between split between two cities. \n\nIn 1791, the major financial crisis would hit the United States in New York due to a scheme to manipulate the financial markets, which had no formal structure of any kind. Varick would have to increase officers to protect the guilty parties from mobs gathering outside the prison. This would lead to a group of merchants making the \"Buttonwood Agreement\u201d in 1792 which was the seed of the New York Stock Exchange. \n\nIn the summer of 1793 a yellow fever epidemic sent New Yorkers \"fleeing north\" to nearby healthful Greenwich Village. This epidemic would lead to the creation of what would become the New York City Department of Health. Which was timely as there were further epidemics in 1795, 1796, 1798, 1799, and 1800. \n\nIn 1794, public anger at Federalist political ideals spilled into the streets with Varick\u2019s support of the [[Jay Treaty]]. An angry mob would almost physically run him out of the city. \n\nVarick ran int moe trouble when he tried to pressure the city\u2019s 1,000 or so licensed workers \u2014 tavern keepers, grocers, butchers and cartmen, all of whom had licenses to work for the city \u2014 to vote for Federalist candidates. \u201cThis went completely contrary to the egalitarian sentiment of the time,\u201d Dr. Hodges said. \nVarick\u2019s heavy-handed ways, Dr. Hodges said, pushed many of the workers away from the Federalists, represented by Alexander Hamilton, and into the opposing Democratic-Republican faction, represented by Thomas Jefferson. In 1797, after losing his seat representing New York State in the U.S. Senate, Aaron Burr took control of Tammany Hall and used it to assail Varick for his use of marketing and tax-licensing fees. Burr would win the state's electoral vote in the 1800 presidential election leading to a wide sweeping rout of [[Federalist]] politicians across New York, including Varick in 1801.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Sewell|title=Third Term No Charm, Historians Say|date=2008|publisher=[[New York Times]]|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/third-term-no-charm-historians-say/|accessdate=16 April 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development.

Most ghazals have between seven and twelve ''shers''. For a poem to be considered a true ghazal, it must have no fewer than five couplets. Almost all ghazals confine themselves to less than fifteen couplets (poems that exceed this length are more accurately considered as ''qasidas''). Ghazal couplets end with the same rhyming pattern and are expected to have the same meter. The ghazal's uniqueness arises from its rhyme and refrain rules, referred to as the {{'}}''[[qaafiyaa]]''{{'}} and {{'}}''[[radif]]''{{'}} respectively. A ghazal's rhyming pattern may be described as AA, BA, CA, DA, ... and so on.<ref name=\"Kanda\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUKKvNDYyUEC&pg=PA2|title=Masterpieces of Urdu Ghazal from the 17th to the 20th Century|last=Kanda|first=K.C.|publisher=Sterling Publishing|year=1992|isbn=978-81-207-1195-2|pages=2}}</ref>\n\nIn its strictest form, a ghazal must follow five rules:\n\n# '''''[[Matla|Matlaa]]''''': The first ''sher'' in a ghazal is called the {{'}}''matlaa''{{'}}. Both lines of the ''matla'' must contain the ''qaafiyaa'' and ''radif''. The ''matlaa'' sets the tone of the ghazal, as well as its rhyming and refrain pattern. .\n# '''''[[Radif]]/Radeef''''': The refrain word or phrase. Both lines of the ''matlaa'' and the second lines of all subsequent ''shers'' must end in the same refrain word called the ''radif''. \n# '''''[[Qaafiyaa]]''''': The rhyming pattern. The ''radif'' is immediately preceded by words or phrases with the same end rhyme pattern, called the ''qaafiyaa''. \n# '''''[[Maqta|Maqtaa]]/Maktaa''''': The last couplet of the ghazal is called the ''maqtaa''.  It is common in ghazals for the poet's ''nom de plume'',  known as ''[[takhallus]]'' to be featured in the ''maqtaa''. The ''maqtaa'' is typically more personal than the other couplets in a ghazal. The creativity with which a poet incorporates homonymous meanings of their ''takhallus'' to offer additional layers of meaning to the couplet is an indicator of their skill.\n# '''''Bah{{'}}r/[[Beher (poetry)|Beher]]''''': Each line of a ghazal must follow the same metrical pattern and syllabic (or [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]]) count. \n\nUnlike in a ''[[nazm]]'', a ghazal's couplets do not need a common theme or continuity. Each sher is self-contained and independent from the others, containing the complete expression of an idea. However, the ''shers'' all contain a thematic or tonal connection to each other, which may be highly allusive.<ref name=\"Kanda\" /> A near-universal convention (although not a hard rule) that traces its history to the origins of the ghazal form is that the poem is addressed to a female beloved by a male narrator.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins in Arabia ===\nThe ghazal originated in Arabia in the 7th century,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ghazal|title=Ghazal \u2013 Islamic literature|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref> evolving from the ''[[qasida]]'', a much older pre-Islamic Arabic poetic form.<ref name=\"Kanda\" /> ''Qa\u1e63\u012bdas'' were typically much longer poems, with up to 100 couplets. Thematically, ''qa\u1e63\u012bdas'' did not include love, and were usually [[panegyric]]s for a tribe or ruler, lampoons, or moral maxims. However, the ''qa\u1e63\u012bda's'' opening prelude, called the ''[[Nas\u012bb (poetry)|nas\u012bb]],'' was typically nostalgic and/or romantic in theme, and highly ornamented and stylized in form. In time, the ''nas\u012bb'' began to be written as standalone, shorter poems, which became the ghazal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe ghazal came into its own as a poetic genre during the Umayyad Era (661\u2013750) and continued to flower and develop in the early Abbasid Era. The Arabic ghazal inherited the formal verse structure of the ''qa\u1e63\u012bda'', specifically, a strict adherence to meter and the use of the [[Qaafiyaa]], a common end rhyme on each couplet (called a ''bayt'' in Arabic and a ''sher'' in Persian).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe nature of the ghazals also changed to meet the demands of musical presentation, becoming briefer in length. Lighter poetic meters, such as ''khaf\u00eef'', ''ramal'', and ''muqtarab'' were preferred, instead of longer, more ponderous meters favored for ''[[Qasida|qa\u1e63\u012bdas]]'' (such as ''k\u00e2mil'', ''bas\u00eet'', and ''rajaz''). Topically, the ghazal focus also changed from nostalgic reminisces of the homeland and loved-ones, towards romantic or erotic themes \u2013 These included sub-genres with themes of courtly love (''udhar\u00ee''), eroticism (''hiss\u00ee''), homoeroticism (''mudhakkar''''')''', and as a highly stylized introduction to a larger poem (''tamh\u00eed\u00ee'').<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Dayf, Shawq\u00ee.

The popularity of ghazals in a particular region was usually preceded by a spread of the Arabic language in that country. In medieval Spain, ghazals written in Hebrew as well as Arabic have been found as far back the 11th century. It is possible that ghazals were also written in the [[Mozarabic language]]. Ghazals in the Arabic form have also been written in a number of major West African literary languages like [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Fula language|Fulfulde]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Dispersion into Persia ===\n\n==== Early Arabo-Persian ghazals (10th to 11th century) ====\nHowever, the most significant changes to the ghazal occurred in its introduction into Iran in the 10th century.<ref name=\"Kanda\" /> The early Persian ghazals largely imitated the themes and form of the Arabian ghazal. These \"Arabo-Persian\" ghazals introduced two differences compared to their Arabian poetic roots. Firstly, the Persian ghazals did not employ radical enjambment between the two halves of the couplet, and secondly, the Persian ghazals formalized the use of the common rhyme in both lines of the opening couplet (''\"'''matla'''\"'').<ref name=\":1\" /> The imitation of Arabian forms in Persia extended to the ''qa\u1e63\u012bda'', which was also popular in Persia.\n\nBecause of its comparative brevity, thematic variety and suggestive richness, the ghazal soon eclipsed the ''qa\u1e63\u012bda'', and became the most popular poetry form in Persia.<ref name=\"Kanda\" /> Much like Arabian ghazals, early Persian ghazals typically employed more musical meters compared to other Persian poetry forms.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Rudaki]] (858\u2013941 CE) is considered the most important Persian ghazal poet of this period, and the founder of classical Persian literature.\n\n==== Early Persian ghazal poetry (12th to early 13th century) ====\nThe Persian ghazal evolved into its own distinctive form between the 12th and 13th centuries. Many of those innovations created what we now recognize as the archetypical ghazal form. These changes occurred in two periods, separated by the Mongol Invasion of Persia from 1219\u20131221 AD.\n\nThe 'Early Persian poetry' period spanned approximately one century, from the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid era]] (which lasted until 1187) till a little after the Mongol Invasion. Apart from the movement towards brevity, this period also saw two significant and lasting changes to the ghazal form.\n\nThe first change was the adoption of the ''[[Takhallus]]'', the practice of mentioning the poet's pen-name in the final couplet (called the {{'}}'''''maqta'''''{{'}}). The adoption of the ''takhallus'' became a gradually accepted part of the ghazal form, and by the time of [[Saadi Shirazi]] (1210\u20131291 AD), the most important ghazal poet of this period, it had become ''de rigueur.''<ref name=\":1\" /> The second marked change from Arabian ghazal form in Persian ghazals was a movement towards far greater autonomy between the couplets.\n\n==== Late Persian poetry in the Early Mongol Period (1221\u2013) ====\nThe ghazal later spread throughout the Middle East and South Asia. It was famous all around the Indian subcontinent in the 18th and 19th centuries {{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Introduction into South Asia ===\n[[File:Amir Khusro.jpg|thumb|Amir Khusrow teaching his disciples in a miniature from a manuscript of ''Majlis al-Ushshaq'' by [[Husayn Bayqarah]].

When the Sultan invited Hafez to complete an incomplete ghazal by the ruler, the renowned poet responded by acknowledging the grandeur of the king's court and the literary quality of Bengali-Persian poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Persian|title=Persian \u2013 Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170102112117/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Persian|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt is said that [[Atul Prasad Sen]] pioneered the introduction of Bengali ghazals.<ref name=\"garland\">{{cite book|first=Alison|last=Arnold|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2000|isbn=0-8240-4946-2|page=851}}</ref> Residing in [[Lucknow]], he was inspired by Persian ghazals and experimented a stream of Bengali music which was later enriched profusely by the contribution of [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] and [[Moniruddin Yusuf]].<ref name=\"som\">{{cite book|first=Shovan|last=Som|title=Atul Prasad Sen'er Shreshtha Kabita|publisher=Bharbi|year=2002|page=142}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf9nvzmIVvY|title=Rereading Kazi Nazrul Islam|last1=Hussain|first1=Azfar|format=Video lecture|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tns.thenews.com.pk/firoza-begum-a-taste-of-bengal/|title=A taste of Bengal|last=Ali|first=Sarwat|date=21 September 2014|website=The News International|publisher=The News on Sunday|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628184010/http://tns.thenews.com.pk/firoza-begum-a-taste-of-bengal/|archive-date=28 June 2018|url-status=live|access-date=28 June 2018|quote=Firoza Begum too sang these Bengali ghazals of Nazrul Islam}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/05/25/d70525140299.htm|title=Nazrul: An ardent lover of humanity|last=Islam|first=Mohammad Shafiqul|date=25 May 2007|work=The Daily Star|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204123949/http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/05/25/d70525140299.htm|archive-date=4 February 2018|url-status=live|access-date=28 June 2018|quote=He is best known for his songs, in which he pioneered new forms such as Bengali ghazals}}</ref><ref name=\"MOF2\">{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/fe0899/f1608991.html|title=Nazrul Islam: The unparalleled lyricist and composer of Bengal|last=Chaudhuri|first=Dilip|date=22 September 2006|publisher=Press Information Bureau, [[Government of India]]|archive-url=http://nazrul.com.bd/nazrul/works_on_nazrul/articles/chaudhuri_lyricist.htm|archive-date=8 February 1999|url-status=|accessdate=22 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n\"The ghazal was initially composed to a purely religious theme\".<ref>Hattangadi, Vidya.[https://drvidyahattangadi.com/listen-timeless-ghazals/.html \"Listen to some of the Timeless Ghazals\"],\"drvidyahattangadi\",August 16, 2018</ref> Now in this era Ghazals are more likely to have romantic themes.<ref>[https://www.shehnaiwaden.com/wedding-singers-delhi/gazhal-singers.html \"Gazhal Singers\"],\"www.shehnaiwaden.com\"</ref>\n\n=== Unconditional, superior love ===\n[[File:Bodleian MS. Ouseley Add. 166 fol 13b.jpg|thumbnail|right|Layla visits Majnun in the wilderness; the story of [[Layla and Majnun]] is one of the most famous Arabic tales of unrequited, unconditional love]]\n\nCan usually be interpreted for a higher being or for a mortal beloved. Love is always viewed as something that will complete a human being, and if attained will lift him or her into the ranks of the wise, or will bring satisfaction to the soul of the poet. Traditional ghazal law may or may not have an explicit element of sexual desire in it, and the love may be spiritual. The love may be directed to either a man or a woman.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shayari Network|url=https://www.shayaribox.com/}}</ref>\n\nThe ghazal is always written from the point of view of the unrequited lover whose beloved is portrayed as unattainable{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}. Most often, either the beloved has not returned the poet's love or returns it without sincerity or else the societal circumstances do not allow it. The lover is aware and resigned to this fate but continues loving nonetheless; the lyrical impetus of the poem derives from this tension. Representations of the lover's powerlessness to resist his feelings often include lyrically exaggerated violence. The beloved's power to captivate the speaker may be represented in extended metaphors about the \"arrows of his eyes\", or by referring to the beloved as an assassin or a killer. Take, for example, the following couplets from [[Amir Khusro]]'s Persian ghazal ''Nemidanam che manzel b\u016bd shab'':\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|fa-Latn|nemidanam che manzel b\u016bd shab jayi ke man b\u016bdam;\nbe har s\u016b raghse besmel b\u016bd shab jayi ke man b\u016bdam.\npari peykar negari sarv ghadi laleh rokhsari;\nsarapa afat-e del b\u016bd shab jayi ke man b\u016bdam.}}\n|\nI wonder what was the place where I was last night,\nAll around me were half-slaughtered victims of love, tossing about in agony.\nThere was a nymph-like beloved with cypress-like form and tulip-like face,\nRuthlessly playing havoc with the hearts of the lovers.}}\n\n=== Sufism ===\nMany of the major historical ghazal poets were either avowed Sufis themselves (like [[Rumi]] or [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]]), or were sympathizers with Sufi ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Most ghazals can be viewed in a spiritual context, with the Beloved being a metaphor for God or the poet's spiritual master. It is the intense Divine Love of Sufism that serves as a model for all the forms of love found in ghazal poetry.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nMost ghazal scholars today recognize that some ghazal couplets are exclusively about Divine Love (ishq-e-haqiqi). Others are about \"earthly love\" (ishq-e-majazi), but many of them can be interpreted in either context.\n\nTraditionally invoking melancholy, love, longing, and metaphysical questions, ghazals are often sung by Afghan, Pakistani, and Indian musicians. The form has roots in seventh-century Arabia{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}},{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and gained prominence in the thirteenth- and fourteenth centuries, thanks to such Persian poets as Rumi and Hafiz, and later to Indian poets such as [[Mirza Ghalib]]. In the eighteenth-century, the ghazal was used by poets writing in Urdu. Among these poets, [[Ghalib]] is the recognized master{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}.\n\n== Important ghazal poets ==\n<!-- Don't add anyone who has no article. -->\nGhazals were written by [[Rumi]], [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] and [[Saadi Shirazi]] of [[Persia]]; the [[Turkic peoples|Azerbaijani Turkish]] poet [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]; [[Mirza Ghalib]] and [[Muhammad Iqbal]] of [[North India]]; and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] of [[Bengal]]. Through the influence of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] (1749\u20131832), the ghazal became very popular in [[Germany]] during the 19th century; the form was used extensively by [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert]] (1788\u20131866) and [[August von Platen]] (1796\u20131835). The [[Kashmir]]i poet [[Agha Shahid Ali]] was a proponent of the form, both in English and in other languages; he edited a volume of \"real Ghazals in English\". Ghazals were also written by [[Motiram Bhatta|Moti Ram Bhatta]] (1866\u20131896), the pioneer of Nepali ghazal writing in [[Nepali language|Nepali]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weallnepali.com/sahitya-sumana/motiram-bhatta|title=Hamza Sinwari Bhatta \u2013 We All Nepali|website=www.weallnepali.com|access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref> Ghazals were also written by [[Hamza Shinwari]], He is known as the father of [[Pashto]] Ghazals.\n\n=== Important poets of Persian ghazal ===\nIn [[Persian language|Persian]], prominent and acclaimed ghazal poets include [[Hafez|Hafiz]], [[Rumi]], [[Saadi Shirazi]], [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi]], [[Khwaju Kermani]], [[Saib Tabrizi]], [[Hossein Monzavi]], [[Maryam Jafari Azarmani]], [[Wali Mohammed Wali]], [[Mirza Ghalib]], [[Mir Taqi Mir]], [[Momin Khan Momin]], [[Daagh Dehlvi]], [[Khwaja Haidar Ali Aatish]], [[Jan Nisar Akhtar]], [[Khwaja Mir Dard]], [[Jaun Elia]], [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]], [[Ahmad Faraz]], [[Firaq Gorakhpuri]], [[Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Syed Amin Ashraf]], [[Qamar Jalalabadi]], [[Shakeb Jalali]], [[Nasir Kazmi]], [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], [[Hasrat Mohani]], [[Makhdoom Mohiuddin]], [[Jigar Moradabadi]], [[Khumar Barabankvi]] [[Saghar Siddiqui]], [[Munir Niazi]], [[Mirza Rafi Sauda]], [[Qateel Shifai]], [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]], [[Dushyant Kumar]], [[Syed Waheed Ashraf]], [[Mohammad Ibrahim Zauq]], Madan Pal,<ref>https://www.rekhta.org/poets/madan-pal</ref>, Ghulam Abbas Saghar and [[Kashmiri Lal Zakir]], [[Khumar Barabankvi]].\n<!-- Don't add anyone who has no article. -->\n\n== Translations and performance of classical ghazal ==\nEnormous collections of ghazal have been created by hundreds of well-known poets over the past thousand years in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu as well as in the Central Asian Turkic languages. Ghazal poems are performed in Uzbek-Tajik [[Shashmakom]], Turkish [[Makam]], Persian [[Dastgah]] and Uyghur [[Muqam]]. There are many published translations from Persian and Turkish by [[Annemarie Schimmel]], [[Arthur John Arberry]] and many others.\n\nGhazal \"Gayaki\", the art of singing or performing the ghazal in the Indian classical tradition, is very old. Singers like Ustad Barkat Ali and many other singers in the past used to practice it, but the lack of historical records make many names anonymous. It was with [[Begum Akhtar]] and later on Ustad [[Mehdi Hassan]] that classical rendering of ghazals became popular in the masses. The categorization of ghazal singing as a form of \"light classical\" music is a misconception.\n\nClassical ghazals are difficult to render because of the varying moods of the \"shers\" or couplets in the ghazal. [[Amanat Ali Khan]], Begum Akhtar, [[Talat Mahmood]], Mehdi Hassan, [[Abida Parveen]], [[Jagjit Singh]], [[Farida Khanum]] and Ustad [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ghulam Ali]], Moinuddin Ahamed, are popular classical ghazal singers.\n\n== Popularity ==\nThe ghazal is one of the most popular poetic forms across the Middle East and South Asia. Readings or musical renditions of ghazals, such as at ''[[Mehfil|mehfils]]'' and [[Mushaira]]s, are well attended in these countries, even by the laity. Ghazals are popular in [[Music of Bollywood|South Asian film music]]. The ragas to which ghazals are sung are usually chosen to be in consonance with their lyrical content.\n\nUnderstanding the complex lyrics of traditional ghazals required education typically available only to the upper classes. The traditional classical ''[[raga|r\u0101gas]]'' in which the lyrics were rendered were also difficult to understand. The ghazal has undergone some simplification in recent years, in terms of words and phrasings, which helps it to reach a larger audience around the world. Modern [[Shayar (poet)|shayar]]s (poets) are also moving towards a less strict adherence to form and rules, using simpler language and words (sometimes even incorporating words from other languages, such as English - see [[Parveen Shakir]]), and moving away from a strictly male narrator.\n\nMost of the ghazals are now sung in styles that are not limited to ''[[khyal|khay\u0101l]], [[thumri]], [[raga|r\u0101ga]], [[Tala (music)|t\u0101la]]'' and other classical and light classical genres. However, those forms of the ghazal are looked down on by purists of the Indian classical tradition. \n\nIn Pakistan, [[Noor Jehan]], [[Iqbal Bano]], [[Abida Parveen]], [[Farida Khanum]], [[Ghulam Ali (singer)|Ghulam Ali]], [[Ahmed Rushdi]], [[Ustad Amanat Ali Khan]], [[Parvez Mehdi]] and [[Mehdi Hassan]] are known for ghazal renditions. Indian Singers like [[Jagjit Singh (singer)|Jagjit Singh]] (who first used a [[guitar]] in ghazals), [[Ahmed and Mohammed Hussain]], [[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]], [[Adithya Srinivasan (Singer)|Adithya Srinivasan]], [[Mohammad Rafi]], [[Pankaj Udhas]], [[Satyam Anandjee]], [[Umbayee]], [[Rajendra Mehta]], [[Nina Mehta]] and many others have been able to give a new shape to the ghazal by incorporating elements of Western music.\n\n=== Ghazals in local languages ===\nIn North India, in addition to [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], ghazals have been very popular in the [[Gujarati language]]. For around a century, starting with [[Balashankar Kantharia]], there have been many notable Gujarati ghazal writers like [[Kalapi]], [[Barkat Virani]] 'Befaam', Aasim Randeri, Shunya Palanpuri, [[Amrut Ghayal]], Khalil Dhantejvi and many more. Some notable ghazals of those prominent writers have been sung by Bollywood playback singer [[Manhar Udhas]].\n\nRenowned ghazal singer, and pioneer of Telugu ghazals, [[Ghazal Srinivas]] popularized the ghazal in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. Srinivas also introduced ghazal singing in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], and Ghazals in Kannada were written by Markandapuram Srinivas. Legendary musician [[Umbayee]] composed ghazals in Malayalam and popularised this form of music across Kerala.\n\n[[Suresh Bhat]] popularize gazhals in [[Marathi language]], Some of his amazing gazhals sung by famous artist like [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Asha Bhosale]]. He was known as ''Ghazal Samrat'' ([[Emperor]] of ghazals) for his exposition of the ghazal form of poetry and its adaptation to the [[Marathi language]].\n\n== In English ==\nAfter nearly a century of \"false starts\", the early experiments of [[James Clarence Mangan]], [[James Elroy Flecker]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Phyllis Webb]], etc., many of whom did not adhere wholly or in part to the traditional principles of the form, experiments dubbed as \"the bastard Ghazal\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordsters.net/poetics/poetics01/01weaverprint.html |title=wordsters.net |accessdate=18 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112215734/http://wordsters.net/poetics/poetics01/01weaverprint.html |archivedate=12 January 2015}}</ref> the ghazal finally began to be recognized as a viable closed form in poetry of the [[English language]] some time in the early to mid-1990s. It came about largely as a result of serious, true-to-form examples being published by noted American poets [[John Hollander]], [[W. S. Merwin]] and [[Elise Paschen]] as well as by Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali, who had been teaching and spreading word of the Ghazal at American universities over the previous two decades. [[Jim Harrison]] created his own free-form Ghazal true to his poetic vision in ''Outlyer and Ghazals'' (1971).<ref>{{ISBN|0671208527}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Ali compiled and edited the world's first anthology of English-language Ghazals, published by [[Wesleyan University Press]] in 2000, as ''Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English''. (Fewer than one in ten of the ghazals collected in ''Real Ghazals in English'' observe the constraints of the form.) Devi Panthi of Nepal started composing ghazals claiming himself the pioneer of English ghazals since 2006.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA ghazal is composed of couplets, five or more. The couplets may have nothing to do with one another except for the formal unity derived from a strict rhyme and rhythm pattern.\n\nA ghazal in English observes the traditional restrictions of the form:\n<blockquote>\nWhere are you now?

The ghazal spread into [[South Asia]]  in the 12th century due to the influence of [[Sufi]] mystics and the courts of the new [[Islamic Empire|Islamic Sultanate]], and is now most prominently a form of poetry of many languages of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Turkey]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghazalpage.net/prose/notes/short_history_of_the_ghazal.html|title=A Short History of the Ghazal|last=Jalajel|first=David|website=The Ghazal Page Journal|access-date=26 March 2019}}</ref> \n\nA ghazal commonly consists of between five and fifteen couplets, which are independent, but are linked \u2013 abstractly, in their theme; and more strictly in their poetic form. The structural requirements of the ghazal are similar in stringency to those of the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].<ref>[https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/types-of-music-compositions-ghazal-1344415056-1.html \"Types of Music Compositions: Ghazal\"],\"Jagran Josh\",August 8, 2012</ref> In style and content, due to its highly allusive nature, the ghazal has proved capable of an extraordinary variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation.\n\n== Etymology and Pronunciation ==\n\nThe word ''ghazal'' originates from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{lang|ar|\u063a\u0632\u0644}} (''\u0121azal''). The root syllables Gh-Z-L have three possible meanings in Arabic:<ref>http://quranicnames.com/ghazal/</ref> \n\n# {{lang|ar|\u063a\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0644}} (\u1e21azal) or {{lang|ar|\u063a\u064e\u0632\u0650\u0644\u064e\u200e}} (\u1e21azila) - To sweet-talk, to flirt, to display amorous gestures.<ref name=\"Wiktionary Arabic\">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%BA%D8%B2%D9%84</ref>\n# {{lang|ar|\u063a\u0632\u0627\u0644}} (\u1e21azaal) - A young, graceful doe<ref>http://quranicnames.com/ghazaal/</ref> (this is the root of the english word [[gazelle]]).\n# {{lang|ar|\u063a\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0644\u064e}} (\u1e21azala) - to spin (thread or yarn).<ref name=\"Wiktionary Arabic\" />\n\nThe poetic form derives its name from the first and the second etymological roots, One particular translation posits a meaning of ''ghazal'' as ''{{'}}the wail of a wounded deer{{'}}'',<ref name=\"Kanda\" /> which potentially provides context to the theme of unrequited love common to many ghazals.\n\nThe [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{lang|ar|\u063a\u0632\u0644}} ''\u0121azal'' is pronounced {{IPA-ar|\u02c8\u0263azal|}}, roughly like the English word ''guzzle'', but with the ''\u0121'' pronounced without a complete closure between the tongue and the [[soft palate]]{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}.  In English, the word is pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|\u028c|z|\u0259l}}<ref>Oxford BBC Guide to Pronunciation</ref> or {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|\u00e6|z|\u00e6|l}}.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>\n\n== Poetic form ==\n[[File:Asad_ghalib.jpeg|thumb|Mirza Asadullah Khan Baig, better known by his ''[[Takhallus]]'' - ''{{'}}[[Ghalib]]{{'}}'', is considered the greatest and most influential poet of Urdu and Persian ghazals]]\n\nThe ghazal is a short poem consisting of rhyming couplets, called ''Sher'' or ''Bayt''. Most ghazals have between seven and twelve ''shers''. For a poem to be considered a true ghazal, it must have no fewer than five couplets. Almost all ghazals confine themselves to less than fifteen couplets (poems that exceed this length are more accurately considered as ''qasidas''). Ghazal couplets end with the same rhyming pattern and are expected to have the same meter. The ghazal's uniqueness arises from its rhyme and refrain rules, referred to as the {{'}}''[[qaafiyaa]]''{{'}} and {{'}}''[[radif]]''{{'}} respectively. A ghazal's rhyming pattern may be described as AA, BA, CA, DA, ... and so on.<ref name=\"Kanda\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUKKvNDYyUEC&pg=PA2|title=Masterpieces of Urdu Ghazal from the 17th to the 20th Century|last=Kanda|first=K.C.|publisher=Sterling Publishing|year=1992|isbn=978-81-207-1195-2|pages=2}}</ref>\n\nIn its strictest form, a ghazal must follow five rules:\n\n# '''''[[Matla|Matlaa]]''''': The first ''sher'' in a ghazal is called the {{'}}''matlaa''{{'}}. Both lines of the ''matla'' must contain the ''qaafiyaa'' and ''radif''. The ''matlaa'' sets the tone of the ghazal, as well as its rhyming and refrain pattern. .\n# '''''[[Radif]]/Radeef''''': The refrain word or phrase. Both lines of the ''matlaa'' and the second lines of all subsequent ''shers'' must end in the same refrain word called the ''radif''. \n# '''''[[Qaafiyaa]]''''': The rhyming pattern. The ''radif'' is immediately preceded by words or phrases with the same end rhyme pattern, called the ''qaafiyaa''. \n# '''''[[Maqta|Maqtaa]]/Maktaa''''': The last couplet of the ghazal is called the ''maqtaa''.  It is common in ghazals for the poet's ''nom de plume'',  known as ''[[takhallus]]'' to be featured in the ''maqtaa''. The ''maqtaa'' is typically more personal than the other couplets in a ghazal. The creativity with which a poet incorporates homonymous meanings of their ''takhallus'' to offer additional layers of meaning to the couplet is an indicator of their skill.\n# '''''Bah{{'}}r/[[Beher (poetry)|Beher]]''''': Each line of a ghazal must follow the same metrical pattern and syllabic (or [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]]) count. \n\nUnlike in a ''[[nazm]]'', a ghazal's couplets do not need a common theme or continuity. Each sher is self-contained and independent from the others, containing the complete expression of an idea. However, the ''shers'' all contain a thematic or tonal connection to each other, which may be highly allusive.<ref name=\"Kanda\" /> A near-universal convention (although not a hard rule) that traces its history to the origins of the ghazal form is that the poem is addressed to a female beloved by a male narrator.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins in Arabia ===\nThe ghazal originated in Arabia in the 7th century,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ghazal|title=Ghazal \u2013 Islamic literature|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref> evolving from the ''[[qasida]]'', a much older pre-Islamic Arabic poetic form.<ref name=\"Kanda\" /> ''Qa\u1e63\u012bdas'' were typically much longer poems, with up to 100 couplets. Thematically, ''qa\u1e63\u012bdas'' did not include love, and were usually [[panegyric]]s for a tribe or ruler, lampoons, or moral maxims. However, the ''qa\u1e63\u012bda's'' opening prelude, called the ''[[Nas\u012bb (poetry)|nas\u012bb]],'' was typically nostalgic and/or romantic in theme, and highly ornamented and stylized in form. In time, the ''nas\u012bb'' began to be written as standalone, shorter poems, which became the ghazal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe ghazal came into its own as a poetic genre during the Umayyad Era (661\u2013750) and continued to flower and develop in the early Abbasid Era. The Arabic ghazal inherited the formal verse structure of the ''qa\u1e63\u012bda'', specifically, a strict adherence to meter and the use of the [[Qaafiyaa]], a common end rhyme on each couplet (called a ''bayt'' in Arabic and a ''sher'' in Persian).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe nature of the ghazals also changed to meet the demands of musical presentation, becoming briefer in length. Lighter poetic meters, such as ''khaf\u00eef'', ''ramal'', and ''muqtarab'' were preferred, instead of longer, more ponderous meters favored for ''[[Qasida|qa\u1e63\u012bdas]]'' (such as ''k\u00e2mil'', ''bas\u00eet'', and ''rajaz''). Topically, the ghazal focus also changed from nostalgic reminisces of the homeland and loved-ones, towards romantic or erotic themes \u2013 These included sub-genres with themes of courtly love (''udhar\u00ee''), eroticism (''hiss\u00ee''), homoeroticism (''mudhakkar''''')''', and as a highly stylized introduction to a larger poem (''tamh\u00eed\u00ee'').<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Dayf, Shawq\u00ee.

(pp. 347\u2013348)</ref>\n\n==== Spread of the Arabian ghazal ====\nWith the spread of Islam, the Arabian ghazal spread both westwards, into Africa and Spain, as well as eastwards, into Persia. The popularity of ghazals in a particular region was usually preceded by a spread of the Arabic language in that country. In medieval Spain, ghazals written in Hebrew as well as Arabic have been found as far back the 11th century. It is possible that ghazals were also written in the [[Mozarabic language]]. Ghazals in the Arabic form have also been written in a number of major West African literary languages like [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Fula language|Fulfulde]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Dispersion into Persia ===\n\n==== Early Arabo-Persian ghazals (10th to 11th century) ====\nHowever, the most significant changes to the ghazal occurred in its introduction into Iran in the 10th century.<ref name=\"Kanda\" /> The early Persian ghazals largely imitated the themes and form of the Arabian ghazal. These \"Arabo-Persian\" ghazals introduced two differences compared to their Arabian poetic roots. Firstly, the Persian ghazals did not employ radical enjambment between the two halves of the couplet, and secondly, the Persian ghazals formalized the use of the common rhyme in both lines of the opening couplet (''\"'''matla'''\"'').<ref name=\":1\" /> The imitation of Arabian forms in Persia extended to the ''qa\u1e63\u012bda'', which was also popular in Persia.\n\nBecause of its comparative brevity, thematic variety and suggestive richness, the ghazal soon eclipsed the ''qa\u1e63\u012bda'', and became the most popular poetry form in Persia.<ref name=\"Kanda\" /> Much like Arabian ghazals, early Persian ghazals typically employed more musical meters compared to other Persian poetry forms.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Rudaki]] (858\u2013941 CE) is considered the most important Persian ghazal poet of this period, and the founder of classical Persian literature.\n\n==== Early Persian ghazal poetry (12th to early 13th century) ====\nThe Persian ghazal evolved into its own distinctive form between the 12th and 13th centuries. Many of those innovations created what we now recognize as the archetypical ghazal form. These changes occurred in two periods, separated by the Mongol Invasion of Persia from 1219\u20131221 AD.\n\nThe 'Early Persian poetry' period spanned approximately one century, from the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid era]] (which lasted until 1187) till a little after the Mongol Invasion. Apart from the movement towards brevity, this period also saw two significant and lasting changes to the ghazal form.\n\nThe first change was the adoption of the ''[[Takhallus]]'', the practice of mentioning the poet's pen-name in the final couplet (called the {{'}}'''''maqta'''''{{'}}). The adoption of the ''takhallus'' became a gradually accepted part of the ghazal form, and by the time of [[Saadi Shirazi]] (1210\u20131291 AD), the most important ghazal poet of this period, it had become ''de rigueur.''<ref name=\":1\" /> The second marked change from Arabian ghazal form in Persian ghazals was a movement towards far greater autonomy between the couplets.\n\n==== Late Persian poetry in the Early Mongol Period (1221\u2013) ====\nThe ghazal later spread throughout the Middle East and South Asia. It was famous all around the Indian subcontinent in the 18th and 19th centuries {{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Introduction into South Asia ===\n[[File:Amir Khusro.jpg|thumb|Amir Khusrow teaching his disciples in a miniature from a manuscript of ''Majlis al-Ushshaq'' by [[Husayn Bayqarah]].

Love is always viewed as something that will complete a human being, and if attained will lift him or her into the ranks of the wise, or will bring satisfaction to the soul of the poet. Traditional ghazal law may or may not have an explicit element of sexual desire in it, and the love may be spiritual. The love may be directed to either a man or a woman.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shayari Network|url=https://www.shayaribox.com/}}</ref>\n\nThe ghazal is always written from the point of view of the unrequited lover whose beloved is portrayed as unattainable{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}. Most often, either the beloved has not returned the poet's love or returns it without sincerity or else the societal circumstances do not allow it. The lover is aware and resigned to this fate but continues loving nonetheless; the lyrical impetus of the poem derives from this tension. Representations of the lover's powerlessness to resist his feelings often include lyrically exaggerated violence. The beloved's power to captivate the speaker may be represented in extended metaphors about the \"arrows of his eyes\", or by referring to the beloved as an assassin or a killer. Take, for example, the following couplets from [[Amir Khusro]]'s Persian ghazal ''Nemidanam che manzel b\u016bd shab'':\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|fa-Latn|nemidanam che manzel b\u016bd shab jayi ke man b\u016bdam;\nbe har s\u016b raghse besmel b\u016bd shab jayi ke man b\u016bdam.\npari peykar negari sarv ghadi laleh rokhsari;\nsarapa afat-e del b\u016bd shab jayi ke man b\u016bdam.}}\n|\nI wonder what was the place where I was last night,\nAll around me were half-slaughtered victims of love, tossing about in agony.\nThere was a nymph-like beloved with cypress-like form and tulip-like face,\nRuthlessly playing havoc with the hearts of the lovers.}}\n\n=== Sufism ===\nMany of the major historical ghazal poets were either avowed Sufis themselves (like [[Rumi]] or [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]]), or were sympathizers with Sufi ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Most ghazals can be viewed in a spiritual context, with the Beloved being a metaphor for God or the poet's spiritual master. It is the intense Divine Love of Sufism that serves as a model for all the forms of love found in ghazal poetry.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nMost ghazal scholars today recognize that some ghazal couplets are exclusively about Divine Love (ishq-e-haqiqi). Others are about \"earthly love\" (ishq-e-majazi), but many of them can be interpreted in either context.\n\nTraditionally invoking melancholy, love, longing, and metaphysical questions, ghazals are often sung by Afghan, Pakistani, and Indian musicians. The form has roots in seventh-century Arabia{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}},{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and gained prominence in the thirteenth- and fourteenth centuries, thanks to such Persian poets as Rumi and Hafiz, and later to Indian poets such as [[Mirza Ghalib]]. In the eighteenth-century, the ghazal was used by poets writing in Urdu. Among these poets, [[Ghalib]] is the recognized master{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}.\n\n== Important ghazal poets ==\n<!-- Don't add anyone who has no article. -->\nGhazals were written by [[Rumi]], [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] and [[Saadi Shirazi]] of [[Persia]]; the [[Turkic peoples|Azerbaijani Turkish]] poet [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]; [[Mirza Ghalib]] and [[Muhammad Iqbal]] of [[North India]]; and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] of [[Bengal]]. Through the influence of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] (1749\u20131832), the ghazal became very popular in [[Germany]] during the 19th century; the form was used extensively by [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert]] (1788\u20131866) and [[August von Platen]] (1796\u20131835). The [[Kashmir]]i poet [[Agha Shahid Ali]] was a proponent of the form, both in English and in other languages; he edited a volume of \"real Ghazals in English\". Ghazals were also written by [[Motiram Bhatta|Moti Ram Bhatta]] (1866\u20131896), the pioneer of Nepali ghazal writing in [[Nepali language|Nepali]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weallnepali.com/sahitya-sumana/motiram-bhatta|title=Hamza Sinwari Bhatta \u2013 We All Nepali|website=www.weallnepali.com|access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref> Ghazals were also written by [[Hamza Shinwari]], He is known as the father of [[Pashto]] Ghazals.\n\n=== Important poets of Persian ghazal ===\nIn [[Persian language|Persian]], prominent and acclaimed ghazal poets include [[Hafez|Hafiz]], [[Rumi]], [[Saadi Shirazi]], [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi]], [[Khwaju Kermani]], [[Saib Tabrizi]], [[Hossein Monzavi]], [[Maryam Jafari Azarmani]], [[Wali Mohammed Wali]], [[Mirza Ghalib]], [[Mir Taqi Mir]], [[Momin Khan Momin]], [[Daagh Dehlvi]], [[Khwaja Haidar Ali Aatish]], [[Jan Nisar Akhtar]], [[Khwaja Mir Dard]], [[Jaun Elia]], [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]], [[Ahmad Faraz]], [[Firaq Gorakhpuri]], [[Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Syed Amin Ashraf]], [[Qamar Jalalabadi]], [[Shakeb Jalali]], [[Nasir Kazmi]], [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], [[Hasrat Mohani]], [[Makhdoom Mohiuddin]], [[Jigar Moradabadi]], [[Khumar Barabankvi]] [[Saghar Siddiqui]], [[Munir Niazi]], [[Mirza Rafi Sauda]], [[Qateel Shifai]], [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]], [[Dushyant Kumar]], [[Syed Waheed Ashraf]], [[Mohammad Ibrahim Zauq]], Madan Pal,<ref>https://www.rekhta.org/poets/madan-pal</ref>, Ghulam Abbas Saghar and [[Kashmiri Lal Zakir]], [[Khumar Barabankvi]].\n<!-- Don't add anyone who has no article. -->\n\n== Translations and performance of classical ghazal ==\nEnormous collections of ghazal have been created by hundreds of well-known poets over the past thousand years in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu as well as in the Central Asian Turkic languages. Ghazal poems are performed in Uzbek-Tajik [[Shashmakom]], Turkish [[Makam]], Persian [[Dastgah]] and Uyghur [[Muqam]]. There are many published translations from Persian and Turkish by [[Annemarie Schimmel]], [[Arthur John Arberry]] and many others.\n\nGhazal \"Gayaki\", the art of singing or performing the ghazal in the Indian classical tradition, is very old. Singers like Ustad Barkat Ali and many other singers in the past used to practice it, but the lack of historical records make many names anonymous. It was with [[Begum Akhtar]] and later on Ustad [[Mehdi Hassan]] that classical rendering of ghazals became popular in the masses. The categorization of ghazal singing as a form of \"light classical\" music is a misconception.\n\nClassical ghazals are difficult to render because of the varying moods of the \"shers\" or couplets in the ghazal. [[Amanat Ali Khan]], Begum Akhtar, [[Talat Mahmood]], Mehdi Hassan, [[Abida Parveen]], [[Jagjit Singh]], [[Farida Khanum]] and Ustad [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ghulam Ali]], Moinuddin Ahamed, are popular classical ghazal singers.\n\n== Popularity ==\nThe ghazal is one of the most popular poetic forms across the Middle East and South Asia. Readings or musical renditions of ghazals, such as at ''[[Mehfil|mehfils]]'' and [[Mushaira]]s, are well attended in these countries, even by the laity. Ghazals are popular in [[Music of Bollywood|South Asian film music]]. The ragas to which ghazals are sung are usually chosen to be in consonance with their lyrical content.\n\nUnderstanding the complex lyrics of traditional ghazals required education typically available only to the upper classes. The traditional classical ''[[raga|r\u0101gas]]'' in which the lyrics were rendered were also difficult to understand. The ghazal has undergone some simplification in recent years, in terms of words and phrasings, which helps it to reach a larger audience around the world. Modern [[Shayar (poet)|shayar]]s (poets) are also moving towards a less strict adherence to form and rules, using simpler language and words (sometimes even incorporating words from other languages, such as English - see [[Parveen Shakir]]), and moving away from a strictly male narrator.\n\nMost of the ghazals are now sung in styles that are not limited to ''[[khyal|khay\u0101l]], [[thumri]], [[raga|r\u0101ga]], [[Tala (music)|t\u0101la]]'' and other classical and light classical genres. However, those forms of the ghazal are looked down on by purists of the Indian classical tradition. \n\nIn Pakistan, [[Noor Jehan]], [[Iqbal Bano]], [[Abida Parveen]], [[Farida Khanum]], [[Ghulam Ali (singer)|Ghulam Ali]], [[Ahmed Rushdi]], [[Ustad Amanat Ali Khan]], [[Parvez Mehdi]] and [[Mehdi Hassan]] are known for ghazal renditions. Indian Singers like [[Jagjit Singh (singer)|Jagjit Singh]] (who first used a [[guitar]] in ghazals), [[Ahmed and Mohammed Hussain]], [[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]], [[Adithya Srinivasan (Singer)|Adithya Srinivasan]], [[Mohammad Rafi]], [[Pankaj Udhas]], [[Satyam Anandjee]], [[Umbayee]], [[Rajendra Mehta]], [[Nina Mehta]] and many others have been able to give a new shape to the ghazal by incorporating elements of Western music.\n\n=== Ghazals in local languages ===\nIn North India, in addition to [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], ghazals have been very popular in the [[Gujarati language]]. For around a century, starting with [[Balashankar Kantharia]], there have been many notable Gujarati ghazal writers like [[Kalapi]], [[Barkat Virani]] 'Befaam', Aasim Randeri, Shunya Palanpuri, [[Amrut Ghayal]], Khalil Dhantejvi and many more. Some notable ghazals of those prominent writers have been sung by Bollywood playback singer [[Manhar Udhas]].\n\nRenowned ghazal singer, and pioneer of Telugu ghazals, [[Ghazal Srinivas]] popularized the ghazal in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. Srinivas also introduced ghazal singing in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], and Ghazals in Kannada were written by Markandapuram Srinivas. Legendary musician [[Umbayee]] composed ghazals in Malayalam and popularised this form of music across Kerala.\n\n[[Suresh Bhat]] popularize gazhals in [[Marathi language]], Some of his amazing gazhals sung by famous artist like [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Asha Bhosale]]. He was known as ''Ghazal Samrat'' ([[Emperor]] of ghazals) for his exposition of the ghazal form of poetry and its adaptation to the [[Marathi language]].\n\n== In English ==\nAfter nearly a century of \"false starts\", the early experiments of [[James Clarence Mangan]], [[James Elroy Flecker]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Phyllis Webb]], etc., many of whom did not adhere wholly or in part to the traditional principles of the form, experiments dubbed as \"the bastard Ghazal\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordsters.net/poetics/poetics01/01weaverprint.html |title=wordsters.net |accessdate=18 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112215734/http://wordsters.net/poetics/poetics01/01weaverprint.html |archivedate=12 January 2015}}</ref> the ghazal finally began to be recognized as a viable closed form in poetry of the [[English language]] some time in the early to mid-1990s. It came about largely as a result of serious, true-to-form examples being published by noted American poets [[John Hollander]], [[W. S. Merwin]] and [[Elise Paschen]] as well as by Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali, who had been teaching and spreading word of the Ghazal at American universities over the previous two decades. [[Jim Harrison]] created his own free-form Ghazal true to his poetic vision in ''Outlyer and Ghazals'' (1971).<ref>{{ISBN|0671208527}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Ali compiled and edited the world's first anthology of English-language Ghazals, published by [[Wesleyan University Press]] in 2000, as ''Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English''. (Fewer than one in ten of the ghazals collected in ''Real Ghazals in English'' observe the constraints of the form.) Devi Panthi of Nepal started composing ghazals claiming himself the pioneer of English ghazals since 2006.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA ghazal is composed of couplets, five or more. The couplets may have nothing to do with one another except for the formal unity derived from a strict rhyme and rhythm pattern.\n\nA ghazal in English observes the traditional restrictions of the form:\n<blockquote>\nWhere are you now?

After she returns from abroad, she is told that she must now prepare to marry her betrothed, Ratan, who is the son of a close friend of Suresh.\n\nEverything changes suddenly when Roopa meets a handsome young man, Raj, and they fall in love with each other. Raj then breaks her heart when he tells her that his mother, Malti, who works as a maidservant in Suresh's household, has always favored Ratan over him and has made him promise to step out of Ratan's way. Before she could find out why Malti prefers Ratan over Raj, a bandit, Kala Ghoda, who has been terrorizing the region, asks Suresh to pay Rs.50,000. The police lay a trap for this extortionist and capture him red-handed. He turns out to be none other than Suresh's Munim. Surprises are in store for everyone when they find out that Munim is Raj, who has been masquerading as the Munim for many years and may have embezzled another Rs.50,000.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dev Anand]] as Amar / Raj\n* [[Nalini Jaywant]] as Roopa\n* [[Ameeta]] as Bela\n* [[Pran (actor)|Pran]] as Ratan / Kala Ghoda\n* [[Nirupa Roy]] as Malti\n* Kanu Roy\n* Prabhu Dayal\n* S.L.

A. Abdul Gafoor and Justice R. Basant, overturned the lower court's verdict and acquitted 35 of the 36 accused due to lack of evidence. Dharmarajan's sentence was reduced from life imprisonment to 5 years. The court decided that her statements cannot be taken as the truth in absence of collaborating evidence, as she had been deemed untrustworthy.<ref name=Fl-rehearing/><ref name=Joseph2005/><ref name=ITog-Overturned>{{cite news|title=Suryanelli verdict : justice overturned?|url=http://indiatogether.org/surynelli-women|accessdate=15 October 2015|work=India Together|date=14 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n=====Defence's arguments=====\nThe defence had pointed out as girl had squandered her hostel fees on other purposes and had admitted to [[pawnbroker|pawning]] her jewellery on 1 January 1996, weeks before eloping. The defence said that there was lack of evidence that she had resisted, or indicted to the accused persons that she was an unwilling participant. Thus, rape could not proved. The only other notable witness, apart from the victim, was accused #42 who had been remanded. She had turned into a prosecution witness. The defence called the victim to be deemed untrustworthy citing past cases.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\nThe defence claimed that the prosecution had also tried to withhold certain evidences and witnesses. One investigating officer initially a prosecution witness, was not called during the second case. He had to be presented by the defence. The prosecution also had tried to suppress evidence that proved that the girl had given her hostel fees to one of the accused. The evidence, regarding a letter left by the girl on the day she vanished, was also suppressed. The initial statements given to various officers after her reappearance were presented a very late date, as a result the defence couldn't make a good case or cross examine the victim properly. They called these unfair towards the accused. The defence also pointed to an early statement made by the father which proved that, he was aware that the girl had run away, not kidnapped.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\n=====Prosecution's arguments=====\nThe [[public prosecutor]] said that accused #1 had first blackmailed the girl with a photo album and later asked her to leave with him. The girl had given the album to a friend Fatima. Fatima had entrusted the album to accused #1 who had promised to give to the girl. The girl had allegedly collected the money to pay off accused #1. An auto-rickshaw driver had overheard him talking to accused #2 about the girl. The prosecution also provided evidence that the prime accused, Dharmarajan, was residing in the lodge where she was first raped, since 2 January 1996. The prosecution said that this proved that there was conspiracy to abduct the girl. As both her parents were working, the prosecution said that the girl no lack of money and had no need to sort such means. The prosecution also replied to the other contentions raised by the defence.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\n=====Other evidences and witnesses=====\n{{Location map+ | India Kerala\n| caption =\n\n'''<span style=\"color: #3232ff\">Blue</span>: Places where the girl was taken'''<br>\n[[Ernakulam]]: She taken there on 17 January and kept at a lodge.<br>[[Vanimel]]: The girl was at the house of an accused from 22 to 25 January.<br>[[Kumili]]: The girl was at a rest house from 15 to 21 February.

The content was only known to a witness who had read it before giving it to the police, and the receiving officer recorded this. The witness had said that letter said that she was going on a trip with accused #1, but later it was claimed the she was lured with the promise of marriage. The auto-rickshaw driver was found an investigator much late into the case on 23 July 1996. Even though by then the case had become infamous, the driver had not approached the police. The investigating officers before him were aware of the letter and thus did not suspect a conspiracy. The appearance of the driver changed the course of the case. Another public witness, used to prove conspiracy, had changed his statement later, claimed that he being harassed by the police and had to move away. The girl had not searched for accused #1 when he allegedly disappeared before Kothamangalam. The court observed that the girl refused to talked about accused #1. The court noted that all these raised doubts on whether there was a conspiracy between accused #1, #2 and Dharmarajan. The court said the letter proved that there was no kidnapping.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\nThe court accepted the evidence proving the girl had stayed at the various places she mentioned, but said that these did not prove non-consent. The girl then just passed the [[age of consent]] (then 16 years), so the cases could not be treated as [[statutory rape]]. The court noted she had given away her hostel fees to someone and pawned her jewellery. She had given a false name while pawning it. She had been questioned in the [[Sister Abhaya murder case]] but she said she couldn't remember it. The court noted that she was expelled from the Mount Carmel School, Kottayam, in Class 8, was home-tutored for a year, before joining Little Flower Girls High School, Nallathanni. When asked for  the reason of expulsion, she said that she used to wet her bed and her older sister used to cleaned it up. But, after her sister graduated, she could no longer clean up. But, her tutor, presented as a witness, said that she was expelled for bad conduct. There was also evidence that the father kept close tabs on her movements and frequently called the nuns of the convent school. On 16 January, the school had called the father to inform him that the girl had sought permission to go and give her clothes to the laundry.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\nThe court said that the girl had admitted that she was kept at lodges and hotels wherever she was taken. She was also taken to hospitals twice during the ordeal.  But, she did not try to alert anyone about her plight or tried to escape. On the morning of 17 January, she was taken by Dharmarajan to the [[Kottayam]] bus stand. Even though the place was familiar to her from the previous day and she had studied for some years in Kottayam while commuting from [[Mundakkayam]] to Kottayam, she did not run. Instead, she was taken to [[Ernakulam]]. Dharmarajan took a room in Ernakulam at 6:45pm. In a statement, she had said that she went to see a film with him later, this was retracted and the statement was called fabricated. But it was found, the police could not have guessed the film's name. The court said that it implied she was outdoor during daylight in a busy city for hours. In one case, she had been left alone for half-a-day by an accused in a room and she had made no attempt to escape. In another incident on 4 February, one Jacob Sait walked into her room but she did not inform him of her ordeal, and Sait had gone away. In another incident, a room boy had walked in and found her with two men. From 22 January to 25 January, the girl was at the house of an accused in Vanimmel, [[Kozhikode]]. A neighbour had seen her on veranda and in the courtyard, but she did not try to escape. She had made a call to her uncle during her captivity, but it was not certain whether her captors forced her to call him. But her uncle did not notify the police, raising doubts on whether it was an abduction.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\nOn 21 February, she was taken to the Periyar Hospital in [[Kumili]]. The girl said that she had been taken there because of pain in her private parts and [[pus]] was coming out of her vagina. However, the doctor at the Periyar hospital said she looked normal and had a normal gait. The [[out-patient]] card showed that she complained only of a sore throat and had a false name. Even though she was alone with the doctor, she did not tell him about her plight or her real name. She told him that she was visiting [[Thekkady]] and will return to [[Ponkunnam]]. On 25 February, she was staying overnight with an accused at his house, when she complained of stomach pain. She had not revealed her plight to the women family members of the accused. She was taken to Appu Hospital in [[Elappara]]. She was diagonsed of constipation and undressed by a nurse for an [[enema]] but the nurse did not notice any injuries. The prescription card showed a false name. The robbery charge was against Dharmarajan dropped  as the police could not find the ornaments. The girl had said he had forcibly taken her to the jewelers and sold them. The court said that all these raised doubt on the truth of her statements. There was also an evidence Dharmarajan had taken money from other accused, in exchange for supplying the girl.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\n=====Verdict=====\nThe court held Dharmarajan guilty of Sections 366 (A) (kidnapping with intention of rape) and 372 (selling a minor for sex) of the [[Indian Penal Code]]. He was fined with {{currency|25,000|INR}} for each offence and given a sentence of 5 years. Failure to pay, on each count carried a year of additional jail. Before the trial was complete, the media had begun reporting misleadingly on the judgement. This was noted in the final verdict. The court asked the media to report \"only after ascertaining the truth and not from any truncated or partial version.\" It said that the reports should be based on the complete contents of the judgement. The verdict also recommended raising the age of consent to 18.<ref name=Joseph2005/> In November 2005, the [[Supreme Court of India]] accepted an appeal against the verdict.<ref name=hind-2005appeal>{{cite news|title=Supreme Court admits appeal in Suryanelli case|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/11/12/stories/2005111204300700.htm|accessdate=16 October 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=12 November 2005}}</ref>\n\n=====Evidences and witnesses=====\n{{Location map+ | India Kerala\n| caption =\n\nThe girl and 3 witnesses put Kurien in [[Kumili]] at 7:00pm on 19 February.<br> The 4 witnesses and telephone records put Kurien in [[Tiruvalla]] and [[Perunnai]] between 3:22pm and 10:22pm on 19 February.\n\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | India Kerala\n    | label = Kumili\n    | position = left\n    | mark = Black pog.svg\n    | marksize = 6\n    | lat_deg = 9.6167\n    | lon_deg = 77.1500\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | India Kerala\n    | label = Tiruvalla\n    | position = bottom\n    | mark = Green pog.svg\n    | marksize = 6\n    | lat_deg = 9.3850\n    | lon_deg = 76.5750\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | India Kerala\n    | label = Perunnai\n    | position = left\n    | mark = Green pog.svg\n    | marksize = 6\n    | lat_deg = 9.4333\n    | lon_deg = 76.5333\n  }}\n}}\n\n=====Verdict=====\nThe court noted that the family could have known that Kurien was not named as an accused from media sources. Thus, there was no cause for the delay in filing the complaint. The court also question why Poulose, Rajappan and Kunjukutty were not given to the police as witnesses by the family for one year. The court noted that two of the witnesses who placed Kurien on the crime scene, were chance witnesses and not locals. The court found that prior acquaintance of Poulose with the father suspicious. The court that the lower court had erred by letting case go so far. The court, presided by Justice K. R. Udayabhanu, used the power vested in it under the Section 482 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973]], to correct errors of lower court, and discharged the Kurien under Section 227 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973]] ([[insufficient evidence]]).<ref name=KurienVsState>{{cite court |litigants=P.

The defence said that there was lack of evidence that she had resisted, or indicted to the accused persons that she was an unwilling participant. Thus, rape could not proved. The only other notable witness, apart from the victim, was accused #42 who had been remanded. She had turned into a prosecution witness. The defence called the victim to be deemed untrustworthy citing past cases.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\nThe defence claimed that the prosecution had also tried to withhold certain evidences and witnesses. One investigating officer initially a prosecution witness, was not called during the second case. He had to be presented by the defence. The prosecution also had tried to suppress evidence that proved that the girl had given her hostel fees to one of the accused. The evidence, regarding a letter left by the girl on the day she vanished, was also suppressed. The initial statements given to various officers after her reappearance were presented a very late date, as a result the defence couldn't make a good case or cross examine the victim properly. They called these unfair towards the accused. The defence also pointed to an early statement made by the father which proved that, he was aware that the girl had run away, not kidnapped.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\n=====Prosecution's arguments=====\nThe [[public prosecutor]] said that accused #1 had first blackmailed the girl with a photo album and later asked her to leave with him. The girl had given the album to a friend Fatima. Fatima had entrusted the album to accused #1 who had promised to give to the girl. The girl had allegedly collected the money to pay off accused #1. An auto-rickshaw driver had overheard him talking to accused #2 about the girl. The prosecution also provided evidence that the prime accused, Dharmarajan, was residing in the lodge where she was first raped, since 2 January 1996. The prosecution said that this proved that there was conspiracy to abduct the girl. As both her parents were working, the prosecution said that the girl no lack of money and had no need to sort such means.

The content was only known to a witness who had read it before giving it to the police, and the receiving officer recorded this. The witness had said that letter said that she was going on a trip with accused #1, but later it was claimed the she was lured with the promise of marriage. The auto-rickshaw driver was found an investigator much late into the case on 23 July 1996. Even though by then the case had become infamous, the driver had not approached the police. The investigating officers before him were aware of the letter and thus did not suspect a conspiracy. The appearance of the driver changed the course of the case. Another public witness, used to prove conspiracy, had changed his statement later, claimed that he being harassed by the police and had to move away. The girl had not searched for accused #1 when he allegedly disappeared before Kothamangalam. The court observed that the girl refused to talked about accused #1. The court noted that all these raised doubts on whether there was a conspiracy between accused #1, #2 and Dharmarajan. The court said the letter proved that there was no kidnapping.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\nThe court accepted the evidence proving the girl had stayed at the various places she mentioned, but said that these did not prove non-consent. The girl then just passed the [[age of consent]] (then 16 years), so the cases could not be treated as [[statutory rape]]. The court noted she had given away her hostel fees to someone and pawned her jewellery. She had given a false name while pawning it. She had been questioned in the [[Sister Abhaya murder case]] but she said she couldn't remember it. The court noted that she was expelled from the Mount Carmel School, Kottayam, in Class 8, was home-tutored for a year, before joining Little Flower Girls High School, Nallathanni. When asked for  the reason of expulsion, she said that she used to wet her bed and her older sister used to cleaned it up. But, after her sister graduated, she could no longer clean up. But, her tutor, presented as a witness, said that she was expelled for bad conduct. There was also evidence that the father kept close tabs on her movements and frequently called the nuns of the convent school. On 16 January, the school had called the father to inform him that the girl had sought permission to go and give her clothes to the laundry.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\nThe court said that the girl had admitted that she was kept at lodges and hotels wherever she was taken. She was also taken to hospitals twice during the ordeal.  But, she did not try to alert anyone about her plight or tried to escape. On the morning of 17 January, she was taken by Dharmarajan to the [[Kottayam]] bus stand. Even though the place was familiar to her from the previous day and she had studied for some years in Kottayam while commuting from [[Mundakkayam]] to Kottayam, she did not run. Instead, she was taken to [[Ernakulam]]. Dharmarajan took a room in Ernakulam at 6:45pm. In a statement, she had said that she went to see a film with him later, this was retracted and the statement was called fabricated. But it was found, the police could not have guessed the film's name. The court said that it implied she was outdoor during daylight in a busy city for hours. In one case, she had been left alone for half-a-day by an accused in a room and she had made no attempt to escape. In another incident on 4 February, one Jacob Sait walked into her room but she did not inform him of her ordeal, and Sait had gone away. In another incident, a room boy had walked in and found her with two men. From 22 January to 25 January, the girl was at the house of an accused in Vanimmel, [[Kozhikode]]. A neighbour had seen her on veranda and in the courtyard, but she did not try to escape. She had made a call to her uncle during her captivity, but it was not certain whether her captors forced her to call him. But her uncle did not notify the police, raising doubts on whether it was an abduction.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\nOn 21 February, she was taken to the Periyar Hospital in [[Kumili]]. The girl said that she had been taken there because of pain in her private parts and [[pus]] was coming out of her vagina. However, the doctor at the Periyar hospital said she looked normal and had a normal gait. The [[out-patient]] card showed that she complained only of a sore throat and had a false name. Even though she was alone with the doctor, she did not tell him about her plight or her real name. She told him that she was visiting [[Thekkady]] and will return to [[Ponkunnam]]. On 25 February, she was staying overnight with an accused at his house, when she complained of stomach pain. She had not revealed her plight to the women family members of the accused. She was taken to Appu Hospital in [[Elappara]]. She was diagonsed of constipation and undressed by a nurse for an [[enema]] but the nurse did not notice any injuries. The prescription card showed a false name. The robbery charge was against Dharmarajan dropped  as the police could not find the ornaments. The girl had said he had forcibly taken her to the jewelers and sold them. The court said that all these raised doubt on the truth of her statements. There was also an evidence Dharmarajan had taken money from other accused, in exchange for supplying the girl.<ref name=Joseph2005/>\n\n=====Verdict=====\nThe court held Dharmarajan guilty of Sections 366 (A) (kidnapping with intention of rape) and 372 (selling a minor for sex) of the [[Indian Penal Code]]. He was fined with {{currency|25,000|INR}} for each offence and given a sentence of 5 years. Failure to pay, on each count carried a year of additional jail. Before the trial was complete, the media had begun reporting misleadingly on the judgement. This was noted in the final verdict. The court asked the media to report \"only after ascertaining the truth and not from any truncated or partial version.\" It said that the reports should be based on the complete contents of the judgement. The verdict also recommended raising the age of consent to 18.<ref name=Joseph2005/> In November 2005, the [[Supreme Court of India]] accepted an appeal against the verdict.<ref name=hind-2005appeal>{{cite news|title=Supreme Court admits appeal in Suryanelli case|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/11/12/stories/2005111204300700.htm|accessdate=16 October 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=12 November 2005}}</ref>\n\n=====Evidences and witnesses=====\n{{Location map+ | India Kerala\n| caption =\n\nThe girl and 3 witnesses put Kurien in [[Kumili]] at 7:00pm on 19 February.<br> The 4 witnesses and telephone records put Kurien in [[Tiruvalla]] and [[Perunnai]] between 3:22pm and 10:22pm on 19 February.\n\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | India Kerala\n    | label = Kumili\n    | position = left\n    | mark = Black pog.svg\n    | marksize = 6\n    | lat_deg = 9.6167\n    | lon_deg = 77.1500\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | India Kerala\n    | label = Tiruvalla\n    | position = bottom\n    | mark = Green pog.svg\n    | marksize = 6\n    | lat_deg = 9.3850\n    | lon_deg = 76.5750\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | India Kerala\n    | label = Perunnai\n    | position = left\n    | mark = Green pog.svg\n    | marksize = 6\n    | lat_deg = 9.4333\n    | lon_deg = 76.5333\n  }}\n}}\n\n=====Verdict=====\nThe court noted that the family could have known that Kurien was not named as an accused from media sources. Thus, there was no cause for the delay in filing the complaint. The court also question why Poulose, Rajappan and Kunjukutty were not given to the police as witnesses by the family for one year. The court noted that two of the witnesses who placed Kurien on the crime scene, were chance witnesses and not locals. The court found that prior acquaintance of Poulose with the father suspicious. The court that the lower court had erred by letting case go so far. The court, presided by Justice K. R. Udayabhanu, used the power vested in it under the Section 482 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973]], to correct errors of lower court, and discharged the Kurien under Section 227 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973]] ([[insufficient evidence]]).<ref name=KurienVsState>{{cite court |litigants=P.

The two men first met while working together on a television comedy show. Together, they wrote the song \"Fill Your Heart\" which was recorded by Rose on his first album, ''The Thorn in Mrs. Roses Side''. Soon thereafter [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] covered it as the B-side of his hit \"[[Tiptoe Through the Tulips]]\" (1968). [[David Bowie]] also recorded a faithful version of the song on his  album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971). Rose and Williams also wrote \"I'll Walk Away\" (recorded by Rose on his third, eponymous album). Rose was instrumental in getting Williams his break with [[A&M Records]] which resulted in Williams working with songwriter [[Roger Nichols (songwriter)|Roger Nichols]]. Williams and Nichols were responsible for a number of successful pop hits from the 1970s, including several hits for [[Three Dog Night]] (the aforementioned \"[[An Old Fashioned Love Song]]\", as well as \"[[The Family of Man (Three Dog Night song)|The Family of Man]]\" and \"[[Out in the Country]]\"), [[Helen Reddy]] (\"[[You and Me Against the World (song)|You and Me Against the World]]\"), and [[the Carpenters]], most notably \"[[Rainy Days and Mondays]]\", \"[[I Won't Last a Day Without You]]\", and \"[[We've Only Just Begun]]\", originally a song for a [[Crocker National Bank]] television commercial featuring newlyweds, and which has since become a cover-band standard and ''de rigueur'' for weddings throughout North America.\n\nAn early collaboration with Roger Nichols, \"Someday Man\", was covered by [[the Monkees]] (a group for which he auditioned but was not chosen<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200851|work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|title=The Monkees|first=Karen|last=Lurie|year=2002}}</ref>) on a 1969 single, and was the first Monkees' release not published by [[Screen Gems]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nA frequent cowriter of Williams' was musician [[Kenneth Ascher]]. Their songs together included the popular children's favorite \"[[Rainbow Connection]]\", sung by [[Jim Henson]] (as [[Kermit the Frog]]) in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979). They also wrote \"[[You And Me Against The World]]\", which became a Top 10 hit on ''Billboard'' for [[Helen Reddy]] in 1974.\n\nWilliams has worked on the music of a number of films, including writing and singing on ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'' (1974) in which he also starred and earned an Oscar nomination for the music, and ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'' (1976). Williams also wrote and sang the song \"Where Do I Go From Here,\" which was used in the end credits of the [[Michael Cimino]]-directed film ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'', which starred [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Jeff Bridges]]. He contributed lyrics to the ''[[Cinderella Liberty]]'' song \"You're So Nice to Be Around\" with music by [[John Williams]], and it earned them an [[46th Academy Awards|Oscar nomination]].

The two men first met while working together on a television comedy show.

Soon thereafter [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] covered it as the B-side of his hit \"[[Tiptoe Through the Tulips]]\" (1968). [[David Bowie]] also recorded a faithful version of the song on his  album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971). Rose and Williams also wrote \"I'll Walk Away\" (recorded by Rose on his third, eponymous album). Rose was instrumental in getting Williams his break with [[A&M Records]] which resulted in Williams working with songwriter [[Roger Nichols (songwriter)|Roger Nichols]]. Williams and Nichols were responsible for a number of successful pop hits from the 1970s, including several hits for [[Three Dog Night]] (the aforementioned \"[[An Old Fashioned Love Song]]\", as well as \"[[The Family of Man (Three Dog Night song)|The Family of Man]]\" and \"[[Out in the Country]]\"), [[Helen Reddy]] (\"[[You and Me Against the World (song)|You and Me Against the World]]\"), and [[the Carpenters]], most notably \"[[Rainy Days and Mondays]]\", \"[[I Won't Last a Day Without You]]\", and \"[[We've Only Just Begun]]\", originally a song for a [[Crocker National Bank]] television commercial featuring newlyweds, and which has since become a cover-band standard and ''de rigueur'' for weddings throughout North America.\n\nAn early collaboration with Roger Nichols, \"Someday Man\", was covered by [[the Monkees]] (a group for which he auditioned but was not chosen<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200851|work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|title=The Monkees|first=Karen|last=Lurie|year=2002}}</ref>) on a 1969 single, and was the first Monkees' release not published by [[Screen Gems]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nA frequent cowriter of Williams' was musician [[Kenneth Ascher]]. Their songs together included the popular children's favorite \"[[Rainbow Connection]]\", sung by [[Jim Henson]] (as [[Kermit the Frog]]) in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979). They also wrote \"[[You And Me Against The World]]\", which became a Top 10 hit on ''Billboard'' for [[Helen Reddy]] in 1974.\n\nWilliams has worked on the music of a number of films, including writing and singing on ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'' (1974) in which he also starred and earned an Oscar nomination for the music, and ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'' (1976). Williams also wrote and sang the song \"Where Do I Go From Here,\" which was used in the end credits of the [[Michael Cimino]]-directed film ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'', which starred [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Jeff Bridges]]. He contributed lyrics to the ''[[Cinderella Liberty]]'' song \"You're So Nice to Be Around\" with music by [[John Williams]], and it earned them an [[46th Academy Awards|Oscar nomination]]. Along with Ascher and [[Rupert Holmes]], he wrote the music and lyrics to ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (also 1976), with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]].

Consumers could vote by calling 1-800-FUN-COLOR. Ads for the new blue colors featured a plain and an almond blue M&M character as Red and Yellow take notice of trying to do takes in the commercial by painting themselves blue where they appear on stage with [[B.B. King]] singing the blues, but the filmmakers had to cut the scene as they were not the real blue M&M's; another featured Red and Yellow holding their breath to look like the new blue M&M's, where [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] sees the three M&M's, Red, Yellow, and Blue; and one more featuring Weber talking to the blue M&M if he had dived into the chocolate pool, but did not.\n\nIn 2002, Mars solicited votes in their first ever \"M&M's Global Color Vote\" to add a new color from three choices: [[aqua (color)|aqua]] ([[turquoise (color)|turquoise]]), [[pink]], and [[purple]]. Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car). Specially marked packages of M&M's were released in Japan. Finding a bag of all purple M&M's entitled the customer to a prize of 100 million [[Japanese Yen|yen]] (equivalent to approximately USD $852,000).\n\nOn January 1, 2004, at the stroke of midnight, Mars removed all of the colors of M&M's and made them black-and-white on both their candies and the packaging. It coincided with a commercial parodying ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' where [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] is home in bed and looks out of the window and sees what the colors of the four M&M's were. The goal was to help the M&M's find their colors in black-and-white packages of M&M's, in this order: brown, orange, red, green, yellow, and blue. After all of the colors have been found, the colored packaging returned, and began carrying the theme \"Chocolate is better in color\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nSince 2004, M&M's have been available online in 17 colors, with personalized phrases on each candy on the opposite side from the \"m\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mymms.com/|title=Custom Printed MY M&M'S|work=mms.com|publisher=[[Mars, Incorporated]]|accessdate=February 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211174015/http://www.mymms.com/|archive-date=February 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Released around Christmas, these custom-printed M&M's were originally intended for [[holiday greetings]], but are now available all year round.\n\nFor the 2008 [[Valentine's Day]] season, Mars introduced all-green bags of M&M's.

They can choose features such as the color, shape, hair, and accessories.\n\nIn 2008, two limited-edition varieties of the candy were introduced \u2013 \"Wildly Cherry\" M&M's, and, as a marketing tie-in with the film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', \"Mint Crisp\" M&M's.\n\nM&M's also introduced another new product called \"M&M's Premiums\" in 2008. They come in five flavors \u2013 chocolate almond, mint chocolate, mocha, raspberry almond, and triple chocolate (milk, dark, and white chocolate), which are sold in small upright cartons with a plastic bag inside. M&M's Premiums do not have a candy shell, but are coated with [[carnauba wax]] and color. Dark chocolate was added in 2009, replacing mocha.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, My M&M's launched 'Faces,' which allows consumers to print the faces of loved ones on M&M's chocolate candies at mymms.com.\n\nIn February 2009, M&M's launched the \"M&M's Colour Break-Up\" promotion in Australia, where M&M's were sold in separate packs (one for each color): the packs included a code to win prizes.<ref>{{cite news|title=M&M'S Color Break Up|url=http://www.colourbreakup.com.au/html/default.aspx|publisher=Mars|date=February 18, 2009|accessdate=February 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228205617/http://www.colourbreakup.com.au/html/default.aspx|archive-date=February 28, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn Summer 2009, M&M's launched a limited-edition \"Strawberried Peanut Butter\" variant to tie in with the release of ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.

Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car). Specially marked packages of M&M's were released in Japan.
