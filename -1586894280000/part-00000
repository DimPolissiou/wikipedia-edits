His story was echoed by his friend [[Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert]], who started a printing business in Haarlem in 1560. Later [[Samuel Ampzing]] (with the help of [[Petrus Scriverius]]) repeated the story in ''Lavre-Kranz Voor Lavrens Koster Van Haerlem, Eerste Vinder vande Boek-Druckerye'' (1628) with illustrations of the invention. According to Junius, sometime in the 1420s, Coster was in the [[Haarlemmerhout]] carving letters from bark for the amusement of his grandchildren, and observed that the letters left impressions on the sand. He proceeded to invent a new type of ink that didn't run, and he began a printing company based on his invention with a primitive typesetting arrangement using moveable type. Since the Haarlemmerhout was burned during a siege by the [[Kennemerland|Kennemers]] in 1426 during the [[Hook and Cod wars]], this must have been early in the 1420s. Using wooden letters at first, he later used lead and tin movable type. His company prospered and grew. He is said to have printed several books including ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' with several assistants including the letter cutter [[Johann Fust]], and it was this letter cutter Fust (often spelled ''[[Faust]]'') who, when Laurens was nearing death, broke his promise of secrecy and stole his presses and type and took them to [[Mainz]] where he started his own printing company.\n\n==Story by Ulrich Zell==\nThere is support for the claim that Coster might be the inventor. In the anonymous ''K\u00f6lner Chronik'' of 1499, [[Ulrich Zell]], a printing assistant from [[Cologne]], who was then between the age of 60 and 69 years old, claimed that printing had started in [[Mainz]]. He based this statement on knowledge that Holland used to print Latin grammar texts (''Donatus'').<ref>[http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_07.html Costeriana]</ref> Neither Coster nor Haarlem are mentioned in that chronicle. If true, this points to [[Johann Gutenberg]] about a decade after Coster's death. However, the first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471, long after Gutenberg.<ref>{{harvnb|Juchhoff|1950|pp=131f.}}</ref> Either way, Coster is somewhat of a Haarlem local \"hero\", and apart from a statue on the ''Grote Markt'' his name can be found in many places in the city.\n\n==Earliest known Haarlem printer==\nBetween 1483 and 1486, [[Jacob Bellaert]] worked in Haarlem. His books were known for their artistic woodcuts. Haarlem, Gouda, and Delft were all cities with early printing presses. This was because these cities did not have powerful religious institutions or universities, where competing copyist production (''scriptoria'') took place. Bellart did not enjoy much success, however, because there were few buyers for his books in the ''Nederduits'' language. Most people who could afford a book wanted it to be in French, since that was the common language of the ruling classes. Perhaps the strongest evidence in favor of Gutenberg is therefore that Mainz has in its possession today a first-edition of [[Erasmus]]' '' Lof der Zotheid'' (English translation: ''[[The Praise of Folly]]''), which was written in Gouda, but printed in Mainz in 1511. The earliest printed book from the Netherlands that has been dated with any certainty is from 1473. It is in the possession of the [[Museum Meermanno-Westreenianum]] and was printed in Utrecht, not Haarlem.\n\n==300th anniversary==\n[[File:Martinus Holtzhey - Laurens Jansz Coster 300 jaar.jpg|thumb|Laurens Jansz Coster 300 years of Typographia]]\nIn 1740 [[Martin Holtzhey]] produced a medal to commemorate 300 years of printing and Coster's invention.

It is best known for its [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Umayyad]] [[mosaics]], especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of the Holy Land. Madaba is located {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}} south-west of the capital [[Amman]].\n\n== History ==\nMadaba dates from the Middle [[Bronze Age]].\n\nThe town of Madaba was once a [[Moab]]ite border city, mentioned in the [[Bible]] in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 21:30 and [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 13:9.\n\nDuring its rule by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires from the 2nd to the 7th centuries, the city formed part of the [[Arabia Petraea|Provincia Arabia]] set up by the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] to replace the [[Nabataean]] kingdom of [[Petra]].\n\nThe first evidence for a [[Christians|Christian]] community in the city, with its own [[bishop]], is found in the Acts of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, where Constantine, Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Bostra]] (the provincial capital) signed on behalf of Gaiano, \"Bishop of the Medabeni.\"\n\nDuring the rule of the [[Islamic]] [[Umayyad Caliphate]], it was part of the southern district of [[Jund Filastin]] within the [[Bilad al-Sham]] province.\n\n===Modern settlement===\n[[File:Madaba08(js).jpg|thumb|left|Greek Orthodox Basilica of Saint George, Madaba]]\nThe resettlement of the city ruins by 90 [[Arab Christian]]-convert families from [[Al Karak]], in the south, led by two [[Italy|Italian]] priests from the Latin Patriarchate of [[Jerusalem]] in 1880.<ref>[[PEF Survey of Palestine]], [https://archive.org/details/surveyofeasternp00conduoft Survey of Eastern Palestine] (1889), page 291: \"In the midst of these tribes a colony of native Christians is established at Madeba.

This in turn substantially supplemented the scant documentation available.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s uses the spelling \"Medaba\", traditional in reference to the ancient bishopric centred on this city, while at the same time referring to the modern city as 'Madaba\".<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 926</ref>\n\nIn his memoirs, the German Count von Rantzau reports about his friend Sultan Gin-Achmed, Royal Prince of Madaba <ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gZcAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=Helmstadt+Sultan+Gin+Achmet+Prince+Royal+Madaba+Universit%C3%A9#v=onepage&q=Helmstadt%20Sultan%20Gin%20Achmet%20Prince%20Royal%20Madaba%20Universit%C3%A9&f=false |author=Rantzow, George Louis Albert|title=M\u00e9moires du comte de Rantzow|pages=28\u201329|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1741}}</ref> both studying at Helmstedt University, Germany in 1729 and meeting again in Paris ten years later.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gZcAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA279&lpg=PA279&dq=sensible+plaisir+rue+St.+Andr%C3%A9++Arts++Sultan-Gin+Achmet#v=onepage&q=sensible%20plaisir%20rue%20St.%20Andr%C3%A9%20%20Arts%20%20Sultan-Gin%20Achmet&f=false  |author=Rantzow, George Louis Albert|title=M\u00e9moires du comte de Rantzow|pages=279\u2013283|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1741}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nMadaba has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'').

The city was conquered by Israelite King [[Omri]], as discussed in the [[Mesha stele]], Book of Numbers 32, and 2nd [[Books of Kings]] 3:4-27. The oldest inscription in the [[Moabite language]] script, dated to the  late 9th or early 8th century BCE, was found at Khirbat Ataruz.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bean |first1=Adam |last2=Rollston |first2=Christopher |title=Moabite language |journal=Levant -- The Journal of the Council for British Research in the Levant |date=2018 |volume=50 |issue=2 |page=2011}}</ref>\n\n== Archaeological finds in Madaba city ==\n[[File:Hippolytus Hall.jpg|thumb|Hippolytus Hall in the Archaeological Park of Madaba]]\nThe first mosaics were discovered during the building of new houses using [[ashlar|bricks]] from [[spolia|older buildings]]. The new inhabitants of Madaba, made conscious of the importance of the mosaics by their priests, made sure that they took care of and preserved all the mosaics that came to light.\n\nThe northern part of the city turned out to be the area containing the greatest concentration of mosaics. During the Byzantine-Umayyad period, this northern area, crossed by a colonnaded [[Roman road]], saw the building of the Church of the Map, the Hippolytus Mansion, the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of Prophet Elijah with its crypt, the Church of the Holy Martyrs (Al-Khadir), the Burnt Palace, the Church of the Sunna' family, and the church of the salaita family.\n\n[[File:Madaba Jerusalem Mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|A 6th-century mosaic map of Jerusalem in the [[Madaba Map]]]]\nThe [[Map of Madaba]] mosaic was discovered in 1896 and the findings were published a year later. This discovery drew the attention of scholars worldwide. It also positively influenced the inhabitants, who shared the contagious passion of [[F. Giuseppe Manfredi]], to whom the rediscovery of most of the city's mosaics are owed. Madaba became known as the \"City of Mosaics\" in Jordan.\n\nThe Madaba Mosaic Map is a map of the region dating from the 6th century and preserved in the floor of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[Basilica]] of [[Saint George]], sometimes called the \"Church of the Map\". With two million pieces of colored stone, the map depicts hills and valleys, villages and towns in Palestine and the Nile Delta. The mosaic contains the earliest extant representation of Byzantine [[Jerusalem]], labeled the \"Holy City.\" The map provides important details about its 6th-century landmarks, with the [[cardo]], or central colonnaded street, and the church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] clearly visible. This map is one key in developing scholarly knowledge about the physical layout of Jerusalem after its destruction and rebuilding in 70 AD.\n\nOther mosaic masterpieces found in the Church of the Virgin and the Apostles and the Archaeological Museum, depict a profusion of flowers and plants, birds and fish, animals and exotic beasts, as well as scenes from mythology and everyday pursuits of hunting, fishing and farming. Hundreds of other mosaics from the 5th through the 7th centuries are scattered throughout Madaba.\n\nThe [[University of Toronto]] has been excavating in Madaba from 1996 until the present. Their efforts have focused primarily on the west acropolis where an open field has allowed access to uncover the entire sequence of occupation at Madaba from the modern period down to the Early Bronze Age levels. The most visible feature of this area is a {{convert|7.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide|sp=us}} fortification wall built sometime in the 9th century BC, with subsequent rebuilds throughout its history.  There is also the remains of a well-preserved Byzantine-era house at the base of the fortification wall.<ref>[https://www.utoronto.ca/tmap ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527202854/http://www.utoronto.ca/tmap |date=May 27, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a 3,000-year-old Iron Age temple containing several figurines of ancient deities and circular clay vessels used in [[Moab]]ite religious rituals was discovered at Khirbat 'Ataroz near Mabada.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/38952079\n | title = 3,000-year-old Iron Age temple unearthed in Jordan\n | author = Dale Gavlak\n | publisher = NBC News\n | date = 1 September 2010\n | accessdate = 2010-09-04\n}}</ref>\n\n===Mosaic school===\nThe Institute of Mosaic Art and Restoration was founded in 1992 as the Madaba Mosaic School, and funded by the Italian Government. It was a high school which offered the Tawjihi, the Jordanian equivalent of a high school diploma. In 2007, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, under the Department of Antiquities partnered with USAID's [[Jordan Tourism Development Project (Siyaha)|Siyaha]] tourism development project, and a rejuvenated Italian commitment to launch the institute as a 2-year, post-Tawjihi program.  \nThe aim of the Institute is to be a center of excellence in the region, and to train locals on a scientific level to conserve and restore the many ancient mosaics found in Jordan. Students are also taught traditional and modern methods of mosaic production, Computer Aided Design (CAD), Arabic, English, geology, and chemistry.  Soon, students will also be able to transfer their credits to [[Yarmouk University]] to complete a BA in Archaeology with a further two years of study.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siyaha.org/nl/newsletterissue/articles.php?issue=62&id=279 |title=Periodic Newsletter/ Siyaha - Jordan Tourism Development Project |publisher=Siyaha.org |accessdate=2015-09-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928211145/http://www.siyaha.org/nl/newsletterissue/articles.php?issue=62&id=279 |archivedate=2015-09-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe institute is located between the Madaba Visitors Center and the Madaba Archaeological Park.\n\n== Hammamat Ma'in ==\n{{main|Ma'in Hot Springs}}\nSouthwest of Madaba is Hammamat Ma'in or Zarqa Ma'in, the thermal mineral springs that for centuries have attracted people to come and immerse themselves in the sites' warm therapeutic waters.\n\n== Bani Hamida ==\n[[File:Bani Hamida Weavings.jpg|thumb|Bani Hamida Weavings]] \nA weaving project was started by twelve women of the tribe in 1985 and since then [[Bani Hamida]] has become famed for producing woven items in traditionally bright colors. Traditional ground looms, assembled using stones and sticks, are used for the weaving, and the products can be found at numerous outlets in Jordan and abroad. Visitors can stop by the weaving rooms, located in the village of Mukawir, to see how rugs are made. The women also make decorative candles.\n\n== New developments ==\nMadaba has been chosen to house new universities ([[American University of Madaba]]) and a new settlement operation not far from the historic city will house over 600 villas. Kuwaiti corporations are now funding the construction of new office buildings to be built in Madaba.\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n[[File:20100924 madaba34.JPG|thumb|The Madaba visitors center]]\nMadaba's main attraction is its Byzantine mosaics, drawing many visitors, especially since the creation of an archaeological park. They cover the floors of houses and churches dating from the site's earliest period of habitation.\n\nThe nearby site of [[Umm ar-Rasas]], south-east of Madaba on the edge of the semi-arid steppe, started as a Roman military camp and grew to become a town from the 5th century. It also has very large and well-preserved mosaics.\n\nAt the southern entrance to Madaba, near the King's Highway, is the Church of the Apostles. The ruins of this Byzantine church date to 578 CE, and are currently being restored. It includes a mosaic known as the \"Personification of the Sea\", depicting a woman emerging from the sea, surrounded by mythical aquatic creatures and a hodgepodge of rams, bulls, parrots and exotic vegetation.

It is best known for its [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Umayyad]] [[mosaics]], especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of the Holy Land. Madaba is located {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}} south-west of the capital [[Amman]].\n\n== History ==\nMadaba dates from the Middle [[Bronze Age]].\n\nThe town of Madaba was once a [[Moab]]ite border city, mentioned in the [[Bible]] in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 21:30 and [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 13:9.\n\nDuring its rule by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires from the 2nd to the 7th centuries, the city formed part of the [[Arabia Petraea|Provincia Arabia]] set up by the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] to replace the [[Nabataean]] kingdom of [[Petra]].\n\nThe first evidence for a [[Christians|Christian]] community in the city, with its own [[bishop]], is found in the Acts of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, where Constantine, Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Bostra]] (the provincial capital) signed on behalf of Gaiano, \"Bishop of the Medabeni.\"\n\nDuring the rule of the [[Islamic]] [[Umayyad Caliphate]], it was part of the southern district of [[Jund Filastin]] within the [[Bilad al-Sham]] province.\n\n===Modern settlement===\n[[File:Madaba08(js).jpg|thumb|left|Greek Orthodox Basilica of Saint George, Madaba]]\nThe resettlement of the city ruins by 90 [[Arab Christian]]-convert families from [[Al Karak]], in the south, led by two [[Italy|Italian]] priests from the Latin Patriarchate of [[Jerusalem]] in 1880.<ref>[[PEF Survey of Palestine]], [https://archive.org/details/surveyofeasternp00conduoft Survey of Eastern Palestine] (1889), page 291: \"In the midst of these tribes a colony of native Christians is established at Madeba.

This in turn substantially supplemented the scant documentation available.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s uses the spelling \"Medaba\", traditional in reference to the ancient bishopric centred on this city, while at the same time referring to the modern city as 'Madaba\".<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 926</ref>\n\nIn his memoirs, the German Count von Rantzau reports about his friend Sultan Gin-Achmed, Royal Prince of Madaba <ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gZcAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=Helmstadt+Sultan+Gin+Achmet+Prince+Royal+Madaba+Universit%C3%A9#v=onepage&q=Helmstadt%20Sultan%20Gin%20Achmet%20Prince%20Royal%20Madaba%20Universit%C3%A9&f=false |author=Rantzow, George Louis Albert|title=M\u00e9moires du comte de Rantzow|pages=28\u201329|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1741}}</ref> both studying at Helmstedt University, Germany in 1729 and meeting again in Paris ten years later.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gZcAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA279&lpg=PA279&dq=sensible+plaisir+rue+St.+Andr%C3%A9++Arts++Sultan-Gin+Achmet#v=onepage&q=sensible%20plaisir%20rue%20St.%20Andr%C3%A9%20%20Arts%20%20Sultan-Gin%20Achmet&f=false  |author=Rantzow, George Louis Albert|title=M\u00e9moires du comte de Rantzow|pages=279\u2013283|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1741}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nMadaba has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'').

The oldest inscription in the [[Moabite language]] script, dated to the  late 9th or early 8th century BCE, was found at Khirbat Ataruz.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bean |first1=Adam |last2=Rollston |first2=Christopher |title=Moabite language |journal=Levant -- The Journal of the Council for British Research in the Levant |date=2018 |volume=50 |issue=2 |page=2011}}</ref>\n\n== Archaeological finds in Madaba city ==\n[[File:Hippolytus Hall.jpg|thumb|Hippolytus Hall in the Archaeological Park of Madaba]]\nThe first mosaics were discovered during the building of new houses using [[ashlar|bricks]] from [[spolia|older buildings]]. The new inhabitants of Madaba, made conscious of the importance of the mosaics by their priests, made sure that they took care of and preserved all the mosaics that came to light.\n\nThe northern part of the city turned out to be the area containing the greatest concentration of mosaics. During the Byzantine-Umayyad period, this northern area, crossed by a colonnaded [[Roman road]], saw the building of the Church of the Map, the Hippolytus Mansion, the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of Prophet Elijah with its crypt, the Church of the Holy Martyrs (Al-Khadir), the Burnt Palace, the Church of the Sunna' family, and the church of the salaita family.\n\n[[File:Madaba Jerusalem Mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|A 6th-century mosaic map of Jerusalem in the [[Madaba Map]]]]\nThe [[Map of Madaba]] mosaic was discovered in 1896 and the findings were published a year later. This discovery drew the attention of scholars worldwide. It also positively influenced the inhabitants, who shared the contagious passion of [[F. Giuseppe Manfredi]], to whom the rediscovery of most of the city's mosaics are owed. Madaba became known as the \"City of Mosaics\" in Jordan.\n\nThe Madaba Mosaic Map is a map of the region dating from the 6th century and preserved in the floor of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[Basilica]] of [[Saint George]], sometimes called the \"Church of the Map\". With two million pieces of colored stone, the map depicts hills and valleys, villages and towns in Palestine and the Nile Delta. The mosaic contains the earliest extant representation of Byzantine [[Jerusalem]], labeled the \"Holy City.\" The map provides important details about its 6th-century landmarks, with the [[cardo]], or central colonnaded street, and the church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] clearly visible. This map is one key in developing scholarly knowledge about the physical layout of Jerusalem after its destruction and rebuilding in 70 AD.\n\nOther mosaic masterpieces found in the Church of the Virgin and the Apostles and the Archaeological Museum, depict a profusion of flowers and plants, birds and fish, animals and exotic beasts, as well as scenes from mythology and everyday pursuits of hunting, fishing and farming. Hundreds of other mosaics from the 5th through the 7th centuries are scattered throughout Madaba.\n\nThe [[University of Toronto]] has been excavating in Madaba from 1996 until the present. Their efforts have focused primarily on the west acropolis where an open field has allowed access to uncover the entire sequence of occupation at Madaba from the modern period down to the Early Bronze Age levels. The most visible feature of this area is a {{convert|7.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide|sp=us}} fortification wall built sometime in the 9th century BC, with subsequent rebuilds throughout its history.  There is also the remains of a well-preserved Byzantine-era house at the base of the fortification wall.<ref>[https://www.utoronto.ca/tmap ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527202854/http://www.utoronto.ca/tmap |date=May 27, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a 3,000-year-old Iron Age temple containing several figurines of ancient deities and circular clay vessels used in [[Moab]]ite religious rituals was discovered at Khirbat 'Ataroz near Mabada.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/38952079\n | title = 3,000-year-old Iron Age temple unearthed in Jordan\n | author = Dale Gavlak\n | publisher = NBC News\n | date = 1 September 2010\n | accessdate = 2010-09-04\n}}</ref>\n\n===Mosaic school===\nThe Institute of Mosaic Art and Restoration was founded in 1992 as the Madaba Mosaic School, and funded by the Italian Government. It was a high school which offered the Tawjihi, the Jordanian equivalent of a high school diploma. In 2007, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, under the Department of Antiquities partnered with USAID's [[Jordan Tourism Development Project (Siyaha)|Siyaha]] tourism development project, and a rejuvenated Italian commitment to launch the institute as a 2-year, post-Tawjihi program.  \nThe aim of the Institute is to be a center of excellence in the region, and to train locals on a scientific level to conserve and restore the many ancient mosaics found in Jordan. Students are also taught traditional and modern methods of mosaic production, Computer Aided Design (CAD), Arabic, English, geology, and chemistry.  Soon, students will also be able to transfer their credits to [[Yarmouk University]] to complete a BA in Archaeology with a further two years of study.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siyaha.org/nl/newsletterissue/articles.php?issue=62&id=279 |title=Periodic Newsletter/ Siyaha - Jordan Tourism Development Project |publisher=Siyaha.org |accessdate=2015-09-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928211145/http://www.siyaha.org/nl/newsletterissue/articles.php?issue=62&id=279 |archivedate=2015-09-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe institute is located between the Madaba Visitors Center and the Madaba Archaeological Park.\n\n== Hammamat Ma'in ==\n{{main|Ma'in Hot Springs}}\nSouthwest of Madaba is Hammamat Ma'in or Zarqa Ma'in, the thermal mineral springs that for centuries have attracted people to come and immerse themselves in the sites' warm therapeutic waters.\n\n== Bani Hamida ==\n[[File:Bani Hamida Weavings.jpg|thumb|Bani Hamida Weavings]] \nA weaving project was started by twelve women of the tribe in 1985 and since then [[Bani Hamida]] has become famed for producing woven items in traditionally bright colors. Traditional ground looms, assembled using stones and sticks, are used for the weaving, and the products can be found at numerous outlets in Jordan and abroad. Visitors can stop by the weaving rooms, located in the village of Mukawir, to see how rugs are made. The women also make decorative candles.\n\n== New developments ==\nMadaba has been chosen to house new universities ([[American University of Madaba]]) and a new settlement operation not far from the historic city will house over 600 villas. Kuwaiti corporations are now funding the construction of new office buildings to be built in Madaba.\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n[[File:20100924 madaba34.JPG|thumb|The Madaba visitors center]]\nMadaba's main attraction is its Byzantine mosaics, drawing many visitors, especially since the creation of an archaeological park. They cover the floors of houses and churches dating from the site\u2019s earliest period of habitation.\n\nThe nearby site of [[Umm ar-Rasas]], south-east of Madaba on the edge of the semi-arid steppe, started as a Roman military camp and grew to become a town from the 5th century. It also has very large and well-preserved mosaics.\n\nAt the southern entrance to Madaba, near the King's Highway, is the Church of the Apostles. The ruins of this Byzantine church date to 578 CE, and are currently being restored. It includes a mosaic known as the \"Personification of the Sea\", depicting a woman emerging from the sea, surrounded by mythical aquatic creatures and a hodgepodge of rams, bulls, parrots and exotic vegetation. The mosaic was signed by a mosaicist named Salamanios.\n\n==International relations==\n{{main|List of twin towns and sister cities in Jordan}}\n\n===Twin towns - sister cities===\nMadaba is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|PLE}} [[Bethlehem]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] <ref name=\"BethlehemTwinning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/Twining.php |title=::Bethlehem Municipality:: |publisher=Bethlehem-city.org |accessdate=2009-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724140854/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/Twining.php |archivedate=2010-07-24 }}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|USA}} [[Denton, Texas]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Isaiah 15]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Rantzow, George Louis Albert, de (German name ''Georg Ludwig Albrecht von Rantzau'', often named J\u00f8rgen Ludvig Albert de Rantzow).

One philosophical school places MMST in a geographical region based on the identification of three other regions surrounding [[Hebron]], [[Sokho]], and [[Ziph_(Judean_Mountains)|Ziph]] (the other words on the [[LMLK seal]]s). The chief problem is that the majority of the seal impressions were not found in any particular region associated with one of the four inscriptions. For example, the majority of HBRN stamps were found at [[Lachish]] significantly to the west. An alternative strategy identifies MMST in the vicinity of [[Jerusalem]] (which includes [[Ramat Rachel]]) based upon the datum that the majority of MMST stamps were excavated in and around there. The chief problem is that there were more HBRN stamps than MMST found at [[Jerusalem]] and more Z(Y)F stamps than MMST found at [[Ramat Rachel]] (Grena, 2004, pp.&nbsp;354\u2013360).\n\nIn further support of a place name interpretation is the notion that MMST was lost from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic]] text, but preserved via a corrupt [[Greek language|Greek]] transliteration in the [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Book of Joshua]] ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 15:59\u201360}}; Rainey, 1982, p.&nbsp;59):\n* Theco\n* [[Ephrath|Ephratha]] ([[Bethlehem|Baethleem]])\n* Phagor\n* Aetan\n* Culon\n* Tatam\n* Thobes\n* [[Carem]]\n* [[List_of_minor_biblical_places#Gallim|Galem]]\n* Thether\n* Manocho\n\n==A person?==\nIn 1905 [[Robert Alexander Stewart Macalister]] suggested that MMST meant [[Mareshah]], but instead of identifying it with the town, he proposed that the seal referred to a potter (or family of potters).\n\n==A proclamation?==\nIf the [[LMLK seal]] inscriptions were votive slogans or mottoes instead of geographical places, MMST may share the same etymological root as MMSLTW ([[Strong's Concordance]] #4475), a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word used in the [[Bible]] translated alternately as ''domain'', ''dominion'', ''force'', ''government'', ''power'', ''realm'', ''responsibility'', ''rule''. (See {{Bibleref2|Genesis 1:16}}, {{Bibleref2|1 Kings 9:1}}, {{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 8:6}}, {{Bibleref2|Psalms 103:22, 114:2, 136:8\u20139, 145:13}}, {{Bibleref2|Isaiah 22:21}}, {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah 34:1, 51:28}}, {{Bibleref2|Daniel 11:5}}, {{Bibleref2|Micah 4:8}}.) The parallel passage found in {{Bibleref2|2 Kings 20:13}} and {{Bibleref2|Isaiah 39:2}} deserves special attention for its association of the word in the same chronological context as the [[LMLK seal]]s:\n\n:And [[Hezekiah]] was attentive to them, and showed them all the house of his treasures--the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armory--all that was found among his treasures.

He later became a pupil of [[Isaac Aboab of Castile|Isaac Aboab]]. After the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion of Jews from Spain]], he fled to [[Fes|Fez]].<ref>Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard, ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah'', Jerusalem 1962, p. 145 (Hebrew)</ref> The Fez Jewish community, consisting of 5,000 families, chose him for their rabbi, though he was but a youth of eighteen.<ref name=haviv/>{{rp|298b}} From there he went to [[Tlem\u00e7en]], then the chief town of the [[Barbary states]].

It was there that Berab conceived the bold idea which made him famous, that of establishing a central spiritual Jewish power.\n\n==Plan for ordination==\nBerab had a plan for the reintroduction of the old \"[[Semichah]]\" (rabbinic ordination). It is likely that his further plans included the reestablishment of the [[sanhedrin]]. Berab's model was the sanhedrin of [[tannaim|tannaitic]] times which consisted of men who could trace their ordination back to [[Moses]]; yet for more than a thousand years no such men had existed, and the rabbinic ordination ([[Semichah]]) was lost.\n\nAccording to [[Louis Ginzberg]], Berab's undertaking was part of a larger Messianic vision. In this period, Ginsburg says, \"...the imaginative and sentimental persons thought that the promised Messianic time was approaching; they regarded their great sufferings as the process of purgation, as the \u05d7\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7, the eschatologic \"birth-throes,\" of the Messianic era\". These hopes \"afforded the right person an excellent opportunity to create for the Jews a recognized central authority, spiritual\u2014and perhaps, in time, political\u2014in character. There is no doubt that the man for the purpose was Berab; he was the most important and honored Talmudist in the Orient, and was endowed with perseverance amounting to obstinacy.\"<ref>{{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3023-berab-jacob-b-moses|article=BERAB, JACOB [B. MOSES?]}}</ref>\n\nAccording to others, the purpose of Berab's plan was a resolution of certain [[halachic]] difficulties. In particular, there was a problem of [[Marranos]] returning to the Jewish faith, and in order to free them from divine punishment some Rabbis of the Land of Israel considered applying to them the punishment of ''[[makkot]]'', which can only be assigned by Sanhedrin. Jacob Berab writes about this problem in his [[Responsa]].\n\n[[Maimonides]] taught that if the sages in Eretz Israel would agree to ordain one of themselves, they could do so, and that the man of their choice could then ordain others. Although Maimonides' opinion had been opposed by [[Nahmanides]] and others, the scholars at Safed had confidence in Berab, and had no doubt that, from a rabbinical standpoint, no objection to his plan could be raised.\n\n==Ordination of 1538==\nIn 1538, twenty-five rabbis met in assembly at Safed and ordained Berab, giving him the right to ordain any number of others, who would then form a Sanhedrin. In a discourse in the synagogue at Safed, Berab defended the legality of his ordination from a [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Talmudic standpoint]], and showed the nature of the rights conferred upon him. On hearing of this event most of the other Jewish scholars expressed their agreement, and the few who discountenanced the innovation lacked the courage to oppose Berab and his following.\n\nBerab then ordained a few other rabbis, including the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem [[Levi ibn Habib]], rabbi [[Yosef Karo|Joseph Caro]], rabbi [[Moses ben Joseph di Trani (the Elder)|Moses of Trani]], and rabbi Yosef Sagis. Joseph Caro later ordained rabbi [[Moshe Alshich]], and Alshich ordained rabbi [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Hayim Vital]] around 1590.\n\n==Dispute with Ibn Haviv==\nTo obtain the good-will of the Jews of the [[Jerusalem|Holy City]], the first use that Berab made of his new dignity was to ordain the [[chief rabbi]] at Jerusalem, Levi ibn Habib. Since the latter had for many years been a personal opponent of Berab, and the two had had many disputes in regard to rabbinical decisions and approbations, Berab's ordination of Ibn Habib shows that he placed general above personal interests. Moreover, the terms in which Berab officially announced Ibn Habib's ordination were kindly ones. Berab, therefore, expected no opposition from that quarter; but he was mistaken. Ibn Habib's personal animus was not appeased, but rather stimulated, by his ordination. He considered it an insult to his dignity and to the dignity of Jerusalem that so important a change should be effected without consultation of the Jerusalem scholars. He did not content himself with an oral protest, but sent a communication to the scholars of Safed, in which he set forth the illegality of their proceeding and declared that the innovation involved a risk to rabbinical Judaism, since the Sanhedrin might use its sovereign authority to tamper with the calendar.\n\nAlthough Levi ibn Habib's tone was moderate, every one could read between the lines that he opposed the man Berab as well as his work. An illustration of this is afforded by the remarks made by Ibn Habib when he maintained at length that the scholars of Safed were not qualified to ordain, since they were not unprejudiced in the matter, and when he hinted that Berab was not worthy to transmit ordination. Berab was surprised by the peril in which his undertaking was now placed; and, embittered by Ibn Habib's personal attacks, he could not adhere to a merely objective refutation, but indulged in personalities. In answer to Ibn Habib's observation, that a sacred ordination must not proceed from learning alone, but from holiness also, Berab replied: \"I never changed my name: in the midst of want and despair I went in God's way\";<ref name=haviv/>{{rp|298b}} thereby alluding to the fact that, when a youth, Ibn Habib had lived for a year in Portugal as a Christian under an assumed name.\n\nThe strife between Berab and Ibn Habib now became wholly personal, and this had a bad effect on the plan; for Berab had many admirers but few friends. Moreover, Berab's life was endangered. The ordination had been represented to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] authorities as the first step toward the restoration of the Jewish state, and, since Berab was rich, the Turkish officials would have showed him scant mercy in order to lay hands on his wealth. Berab was forced to go to Egypt for a while, but though each moment's delay might have cost him his life, he tarried long enough to ordain four rabbis, so that during his absence they might continue to exercise the function of ordination. In the meantime Ibn Habib's following increased; and when Berab returned, he found his plan to be hopeless. His death some years later put an end to the dispute which had gradually arrayed most of the Jewish scholars in hostile lines on the question of ordination.\n\nIt is known positively that [[Yosef Karo|Joseph Caro]] and [[Moses ben Joseph di Trani (the Elder)|Moses of Trani]] were two of the four men ordained by Berab. If the other two were [[Abraham Shalom]] and [[Israel ben Meir di Curiel]], then Caro was the only one who used his privilege to ordain another, [[Moses Alshich]], who, in turn, ordained [[Chaim Vital|Hayim Vital]]. Thus ordination might be traced for four generations.\n\nWith the exception of some short contributions to the works of others, the only one of Berab's numerous works ever published was his ''She\u00eblot u-Teshubot'' (Questions and Answers), responsa, Venice, 1663; but the [[Amsterdam]] edition of the rabbinical [[Tanakh]] (1724\u201328) contains notes by Berab on [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3023-berab-jacob-b-moses|article=BERAB, JACOB [B.

{"title_page": "Payment card", "text_new": "{{Banking|accs/cards}}'''Payment cards''' are part of a payment system issued by financial institutions, such as a bank, to a customer that enables its owner (the cardholder) to access the funds in the customer's designated bank accounts, or through a credit account and make payments by electronic funds transfer and access automated teller machines (ATMs). Such cards are known by a variety of names including '''bank cards, ATM cards, MAC (money access cards), client cards, key cards or cash cards'''.\n\nThere are a number of types of payment cards, the most common being credit cards and debit cards. Most commonly, a payment card is electronically linked to an account or accounts belonging to the cardholder. These accounts may be deposit accounts or loan or credit accounts, and the card is a means of authenticating the cardholder. However, stored-value cards store money on the card itself and are not necessarily linked to an account at a financial institution.\n\nIt can also be a smart card that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiration date or CVVC (CVV) or with a magnetic strip on the back enabling various machines to read and access information. Depending on the issuing bank and the preferences of the client, this may allow the card to be used as an ATM card, enabling transactions at automatic teller machines; or as a debit card, linked to the client's bank account and able to be used for making purchases at the point of sale; or as a credit card attached to a revolving credit line supplied by the bank.\n\nMost payment cards, such as debit and credit cards can also function as ATM cards, although ATM-only cards are also available. Charge and proprietary cards cannot be used as ATM cards. The use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to a POS transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. Interbank networks allow the use of ATM cards at ATMs of private operators and financial institutions other than those of the institution that issued the cards.\n\nAll ATM machines, at a minimum, will permit cash withdrawals of customers of the machine's owner (if a bank-operated machine) and for cards that are affiliated with any ATM network the machine is also affiliated. They will report the amount of the withdrawal and any fees charged by the machine on the receipt. Most banks and credit unions will permit routine account-related banking transactions at the bank's own ATM, including deposits, checking the balance of an account, and transferring money between accounts. Some may provide additional services, such as selling postage stamps.\n\nFor other types of transactions through telephone or online banking, this may be performed with an ATM card without in-person authentication. This includes account balance inquiries, electronic bill payments, or in some cases, online purchases (see Interac Online).\n\nATM cards can also be used on improvised ATMs such as \"mini ATMs\", merchants' card terminals that deliver ATM features without any cash drawer. These terminals can also be used as cashless scrip ATMs by cashing the receipts they issue at the merchant's point of sale.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Smart card|EMV}}\n\nHistorically, bank cards have also served the purpose of a [[cheque guarantee card]], a now almost defunct system to guarantee cheques at point of sale.\n\nThe first bank cards were [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) cards issued by [[Barclays]] in [[London]] in 1967,<ref name=\"JW\">Jarunee Wonglimpiyara, ''Strategies of Competition in the Bank Card Business'' (2005), p. 1-3.</ref> and by [[Chemical Bank]] in [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1969.{{sfn|Wonglimpiyara|2007|p=1-3}} In 1972, [[Lloyds Bank]] issued the first bank card to feature an information-encoding magnetic strip, using a [[personal identification number]] (PIN) for security.{{sfn|Wonglimpiyara|2007|p=5}}\n\n[[Atalla Technovation]] (now [[Utimaco Atalla]]) was founded by [[Mohamed M.

These are able to perform banking tasks at ATMs and also make point-of-sale transactions, with both features using a PIN.\n\nCanada's [[Interac]] and Europe's [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] are examples of networks that link bank accounts with point-of-sale equipment.\n\nSome debit card networks also started their lives as ATM card networks before evolving into full-fledged debit card networks, example of these networks are: [[Development Bank of Singapore]] (DBS)'s [[Network for Electronic Transfers]] (NETS) and [[Bank Central Asia]] (BCA)'s [[Bank Central Asia|Debit BCA]], both of them were later on adopted by other banks (with [[PRIMA (Indonesia)|Prima Debit]] being the [[PRIMA (Indonesia)|Prima]] interbank network version of Debit BCA).\n\n== Technical features ==\nPayment cards are usually plastic cards, {{convert|85.60|x|53.98|mm|abbr=on|in}} and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88\u20133.48&nbsp;mm, in accordance with [[ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1]] standard. \n\nThey usually also have a unique embossed [[bank card number|card number]] conforming with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard, the cardholder\u2019s name and the card expiry date, in addition to other security features.\n\n==Types==\nPayment cards have features in common, as well as distinguish features. Types of payment cards can be distinguished on the basis of the features of each type of card, including:\n\n===Credit card===\n{{Main article|Credit card}}\nA credit card is linked to a [[line of credit]] (usually called a [[credit limit]]) created by the issuer of the credit card for the cardholder on which the cardholder can draw (i.e. borrow), either for payment to a [[merchant]] for a purchase or as a [[cash advance]] to the cardholder. Most credit cards are issued by or through local [[bank]]s or [[credit union]]s, but some non-bank financial institutions also offer cards directly to the public.\n\nThe cardholder can either repay the full outstanding balance or a lesser amount by the payment due date. The amount paid cannot be less than the \u201dminimum payment,\u201d either a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of the outstanding balance. [[Credit card interest|Interest]] is charged on the portion of the balance not paid off by the due date. The rate of interest and method of calculating the charge vary between credit cards, even for different types of card issued by the same company. Many credit cards can also be used to take cash advances through [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]], which also attract interest charges, usually calculated from the date of cash withdrawal. Some merchants charge a fee for purchases by credit card, as they will be charged a fee by the card issuer.\n\n===Debit card===\n{{Main article|Debit card}}\n[[File:I'm loving it -- debit card at the Guantanamo McDonalds.jpg|thumb|Purchasing by debit card]]\nWith a debit card (also known as a ''bank card'', ''check card'' or some other description) when a cardholder makes a purchase, funds are withdrawn directly either from the cardholder's [[bank account]], or from the remaining balance on the card, instead of the holder repaying the money at a later date. In some cases, the \"cards\" are designed exclusively for use on the Internet, and so there is no physical card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nordea.se/Privat/Kort+och+betalningar/Kort/S%C3%A4kra+kortbetalningar+p%C3%A5+Internet/205784.html|title=Kortl\u00e4sare|website=www.nordea.se|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedbank.se/sst/inf/kort-och-betalningar/0,,135189,00.html|title=e-kort \u2013 betala med bankkortet p\u00e5 n\u00e4tet utan att visa ditt vanliga kortnummer \u2013 Swedbank|website=www.swedbank.se|accessdate=20 June 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413220423/http://www.swedbank.se/sst/inf/kort-och-betalningar/0,,135189,00.html|archivedate=13 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe use of debit cards has become widespread in many countries and has overtaken use of cheques, and in some instances cash transactions, by volume. Like credit cards, debit cards are used widely for telephone and internet purchases.\n\nDebit cards can also allow instant withdrawal of cash, acting as the [[ATM card]], and as a [[cheque guarantee card]]. Merchants can also offer \"cashback\"/\"cashout\" facilities to customers, where a customer can withdraw cash along with their purchase. Merchants usually do not charge a fee for purchases by debit card.\n\n===Charge card===\n{{Main article|Charge card}}\nWith charge cards, the cardholder is required to pay the full balance shown on the statement, which is usually issued monthly, by the payment due date. It is a form of short-term loan to cover the cardholder's purchases, from the date of the purchase and the payment due date, which may typically be up to 55 days. Interest is usually not charged on charge cards and there is usually no limit on the total amount that may be charged.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} If payment is not made in full, this may result in a late payment fee, the possible restriction of future transactions, and perhaps the cancellation of the card.\n\n===ATM card===\nAn ATM card (known under a number of names) is any card that can be used in [[Security of automated teller machines|automated teller machines]] (ATMs) for transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals, obtaining account information, and other types of transactions, often through [[interbank network]]s. Cards may be issued solely to access ATMs, and most debit or credit cards may also be used at ATMs, but charge and proprietary cards cannot.\n\nThe use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to an POS transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. The use of a debit card usually does not attract interest. Third party ATM owners may charge a fee for the use of their ATM.\n\n===Stored-value card===\n{{Main article|Stored-value card}}\nWith a stored-value card, a monetary value is stored on the card, and not in an externally recorded account. This differs from prepaid cards where money is on deposit with the [[Issuer Identification Number|issuer]] similar to a debit card. One major difference between stored value cards and prepaid debit cards is that prepaid debit cards are usually issued in the name of individual account holders, while stored-value cards are usually anonymous.\n\nThe term ''stored-value card'' means that the funds and or data are physically stored on the card. With prepaid cards the data is maintained on computers controlled by the card issuer. The value stored on the card can be accessed using a [[magnetism|magnetic]] stripe embedded in the card, on which the card number is encoded; using radio-frequency identification ([[RFID]]); or by entering a code number, printed on the card, into a telephone or other numeric [[keypad]].\n\n===Fleet card===\n{{Main article|Fleet card}}\nA fleet card is used as a payment card, most commonly for gasoline, diesel and other fuels at gas stations. Fleet cards can also be used to pay for vehicle maintenance and expenses, at the discretion of the fleet owner or manager. The use of a fleet card reduces the need to carry cash, thus increasing the security for fleet drivers. The elimination of cash also helps to prevent fraudulent transactions at the fleet owner's or manager's expense.\n\nFleet cards provide convenient and comprehensive reporting, enabling fleet owners/managers to receive real time reports and set purchase controls with their cards, helping to keep them informed of all business related expenses. They may also reduce administrative work or otherwise be essential in arranging fuel taxation refunds.\n\n===Other===\nOther types of payment cards include:\n* [[Gift card]]\n* [[Digital currency]]\n* Store card\n\n==Technologies==\nA number of [[International Organization for Standardization/Countries|International Organization for Standardization]] standards, [[ISO/IEC 7810]], [[ISO/IEC 7811]], [[ISO/IEC 7812]], [[ISO/IEC 7813]], [[ISO 8583]], and [[ISO/IEC 4909]], define the physical properties of payment cards, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial cards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing institutions.\n\n===Embossing===\n[[File:Credit card imprinter.JPG|thumb|right|Israeli manual card imprinter]]\nOriginally charge account identification was paper-based. In 1959 [[American Express]] was the first charge card operator to issue embossed plastic cards which enabled cards to be manually [[:wikt:imprint|imprint]]ed for processing, making processing faster and reducing transcription errors. Other credit card issuers followed suit. The information typically embossed are the [[bank card number]], card expiry date and cardholder's name. Though the imprinting method has been predominantly superseded by the magnetic stripe and then by the integrated chip, cards continue to be embossed in case a transaction needs to be processed manually. Under manual processing, cardholder verification was by the cardholder signing the payment voucher after which the merchant would check the signature against the cardholder's signature on the back of the card. Cards conform to the [[ISO/IEC 7810]] ID-1 standard, [[ISO/IEC 7811]] on embossing, and the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] card numbering standard.\n\n===Magnetic stripe===\n{{Main article|Magnetic stripe card}}\n[[File:CCardBack.svg|thumb|right|225px|An example of the reverse side of a typical [[debit card]]:\n{{Ordered list\n|[[Magnetic stripe#Financial cards|Magnetic stripe]]\n|[[Signature]] strip\n|[[Card Security Code]]\n}}]]\nMagnetic stripes started to be rolled out on debit cards in the 1970s with the introduction of [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]]. The magnetic stripe stores card [[data]] which can be read by physical contact and swiping past a reading head. The magnetic stripe contains all the information appearing on the card face, but allows for faster processing at point-of-sale than the then manual alternative as well as subsequently by the transaction processing company. When the magnetic stripe is being used, the cardholder will have been issued with a PIN, which is used for cardholder identification at the point-of-sale, and a signature is no longer required. The magnetic stripe is in the process of being augmented by the integrated chip.\n\n===Smart card===\n{{Main article|Smart card}}\n{{See|EMV}}\n\nA smart card, chip card, or [[integrated circuit]] card (ICC), is any pocket-sized card with embedded integrated circuits which can process data. This implies that it can receive input which is processed \u2014 by way of the ICC applications \u2014 and delivered as an output. There are two broad categories of ICCs. [[Memory card]]s contain only non-volatile memory storage components, and perhaps some specific security logic. [[Microprocessor card]]s contain volatile memory and microprocessor components. The card is made of plastic, generally [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], but sometimes [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]]. The card may embed a [[Holography|hologram]] to avoid [[counterfeit]]ing. Using smart cards is also a form of strong security authentication for [[single sign-on]] within large companies and organizations.\n\n[[EMV]] is the standard adopted by all major issuers of smart payment cards.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Proximity card===\n{{Main article|Proximity card}}\n[[Image:Proximity badge.km.jpg|thumb|A proximity card]]\nProximity card (or prox card) is a generic name for contactless integrated circuit devices used for [[Access control|security access]] or payment systems. It can refer to the older 125&nbsp;kHz devices or the newer 13.56&nbsp;MHz contactless [[RFID]] cards, most commonly known as [[contactless smartcard]]s.\n\nModern proximity cards are covered by the [[ISO/IEC 14443]] (proximity card) standard. There is also a related [[ISO/IEC 15693]] (vicinity card) standard. Proximity cards are powered by [[resonant inductive coupling|resonant energy transfer]] and have a range of 0\u20133&nbsp;inches in most instances. The user will usually be able to leave the card inside a wallet or purse. The price of the cards is also low, usually US$2\u2013$5, allowing them to be used in applications such as identification cards, [[keycard]]s, payment cards and [[public transit]] fare cards.\n\n===Re-programmable magnetic stripe card===\n\nRe-programmable/dynamic magnetic stripe cards are standard sized transaction cards that include a battery, a processor, and a means (inductive coupling or otherwise) of sending a variable signal to a magnetic stripe reader. Re-programmable stripe cards are often more secure than standard magnetic stripe cards and can transmit information for multiple cardholder accounts.<ref name=\"putting money into the mobile wallet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.admonsters.com/blog/putting-money-mobile-wallet |title=Putting Money into the Mobile Wallet |publisher=AdMonsters |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}</ref>\n\n== Misuse ==\nDue to increased illegal copies of cards with a magnetic stripe, the [[European Payments Council]] established a Card Fraud Prevention Task Force in 2003 that spawned a commitment to migrate all ATMs and POS applications to use a [[EMV|chip-and-PIN]] solution until the end of 2010.<ref>[http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/article.cfm?articles_uuid=CB4280BD-9A46-F734-D0FB30E04CFF5C57 \"EPC Card Fraud Prevention Forum \u2013 Agreement on new measures to fight card fraud\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722105654/http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/article.cfm?articles_uuid=CB4280BD-9A46-F734-D0FB30E04CFF5C57 |date=2011-07-22 }}, 19.

These are able to perform banking tasks at ATMs and also make point-of-sale transactions, with both features using a PIN.\n\nCanada's [[Interac]] and Europe's [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] are examples of networks that link bank accounts with point-of-sale equipment.\n\nSome debit card networks also started their lives as ATM card networks before evolving into full-fledged debit card networks, example of these networks are: [[Development Bank of Singapore]] (DBS)'s [[Network for Electronic Transfers]] (NETS) and [[Bank Central Asia]] (BCA)'s [[Bank Central Asia|Debit BCA]], both of them were later on adopted by other banks (with [[PRIMA (Indonesia)|Prima Debit]] being the [[PRIMA (Indonesia)|Prima]] interbank network version of Debit BCA).\n\n== Technical features ==\nPayment cards are usually plastic cards, {{convert|85.60|x|53.98|mm|abbr=on|in}} and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88\u20133.48&nbsp;mm, in accordance with [[ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1]] standard. \n\nThey usually also have a unique embossed [[bank card number|card number]] conforming with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard, the cardholder\u2019s name and the card expiry date, in addition to other security features.\n\n==Types==\nPayment cards have features in common, as well as distinguish features. Types of payment cards can be distinguished on the basis of the features of each type of card, including:\n\n===Credit card===\n{{Main article|Credit card}}\nA credit card is linked to a [[line of credit]] (usually called a [[credit limit]]) created by the issuer of the credit card for the cardholder on which the cardholder can draw (i.e. borrow), either for payment to a [[merchant]] for a purchase or as a [[cash advance]] to the cardholder. Most credit cards are issued by or through local [[bank]]s or [[credit union]]s, but some non-bank financial institutions also offer cards directly to the public.\n\nThe cardholder can either repay the full outstanding balance or a lesser amount by the payment due date. The amount paid cannot be less than the \u201dminimum payment,\u201d either a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of the outstanding balance. [[Credit card interest|Interest]] is charged on the portion of the balance not paid off by the due date. The rate of interest and method of calculating the charge vary between credit cards, even for different types of card issued by the same company. Many credit cards can also be used to take cash advances through [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]], which also attract interest charges, usually calculated from the date of cash withdrawal. Some merchants charge a fee for purchases by credit card, as they will be charged a fee by the card issuer.\n\n===Debit card===\n{{Main article|Debit card}}\n[[File:I'm loving it -- debit card at the Guantanamo McDonalds.jpg|thumb|Purchasing by debit card]]\nWith a debit card (also known as a ''bank card'', ''check card'' or some other description) when a cardholder makes a purchase, funds are withdrawn directly either from the cardholder's [[bank account]], or from the remaining balance on the card, instead of the holder repaying the money at a later date. In some cases, the \"cards\" are designed exclusively for use on the Internet, and so there is no physical card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nordea.se/Privat/Kort+och+betalningar/Kort/S%C3%A4kra+kortbetalningar+p%C3%A5+Internet/205784.html|title=Kortl\u00e4sare|website=www.nordea.se|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedbank.se/sst/inf/kort-och-betalningar/0,,135189,00.html|title=e-kort \u2013 betala med bankkortet p\u00e5 n\u00e4tet utan att visa ditt vanliga kortnummer \u2013 Swedbank|website=www.swedbank.se|accessdate=20 June 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413220423/http://www.swedbank.se/sst/inf/kort-och-betalningar/0,,135189,00.html|archivedate=13 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe use of debit cards has become widespread in many countries and has overtaken use of cheques, and in some instances cash transactions, by volume. Like credit cards, debit cards are used widely for telephone and internet purchases.\n\nDebit cards can also allow instant withdrawal of cash, acting as the [[ATM card]], and as a [[cheque guarantee card]]. Merchants can also offer \"cashback\"/\"cashout\" facilities to customers, where a customer can withdraw cash along with their purchase. Merchants usually do not charge a fee for purchases by debit card.\n\n===Charge card===\n{{Main article|Charge card}}\nWith charge cards, the cardholder is required to pay the full balance shown on the statement, which is usually issued monthly, by the payment due date. It is a form of short-term loan to cover the cardholder's purchases, from the date of the purchase and the payment due date, which may typically be up to 55 days. Interest is usually not charged on charge cards and there is usually no limit on the total amount that may be charged.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} If payment is not made in full, this may result in a late payment fee, the possible restriction of future transactions, and perhaps the cancellation of the card.\n\n===ATM card===\nAn ATM card (known under a number of names) is any card that can be used in [[Security of automated teller machines|automated teller machines]] (ATMs) for transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals, obtaining account information, and other types of transactions, often through [[interbank network]]s. Cards may be issued solely to access ATMs, and most debit or credit cards may also be used at ATMs, but charge and proprietary cards cannot.\n\nThe use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to an POS transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. The use of a debit card usually does not attract interest. Third party ATM owners may charge a fee for the use of their ATM.\n\n===Stored-value card===\n{{Main article|Stored-value card}}\nWith a stored-value card, a monetary value is stored on the card, and not in an externally recorded account. This differs from prepaid cards where money is on deposit with the [[Issuer Identification Number|issuer]] similar to a debit card. One major difference between stored value cards and prepaid debit cards is that prepaid debit cards are usually issued in the name of individual account holders, while stored-value cards are usually anonymous.\n\nThe term ''stored-value card'' means that the funds and or data are physically stored on the card. With prepaid cards the data is maintained on computers controlled by the card issuer. The value stored on the card can be accessed using a [[magnetism|magnetic]] stripe embedded in the card, on which the card number is encoded; using radio-frequency identification ([[RFID]]); or by entering a code number, printed on the card, into a telephone or other numeric [[keypad]].\n\n===Fleet card===\n{{Main article|Fleet card}}\nA fleet card is used as a payment card, most commonly for gasoline, diesel and other fuels at gas stations. Fleet cards can also be used to pay for vehicle maintenance and expenses, at the discretion of the fleet owner or manager. The use of a fleet card reduces the need to carry cash, thus increasing the security for fleet drivers. The elimination of cash also helps to prevent fraudulent transactions at the fleet owner's or manager's expense.\n\nFleet cards provide convenient and comprehensive reporting, enabling fleet owners/managers to receive real time reports and set purchase controls with their cards, helping to keep them informed of all business related expenses. They may also reduce administrative work or otherwise be essential in arranging fuel taxation refunds.\n\n===Other===\nOther types of payment cards include:\n* [[Gift card]]\n* [[Digital currency]]\n* Store card\n\n==Technologies==\nA number of [[International Organization for Standardization/Countries|International Organization for Standardization]] standards, [[ISO/IEC 7810]], [[ISO/IEC 7811]], [[ISO/IEC 7812]], [[ISO/IEC 7813]], [[ISO 8583]], and [[ISO/IEC 4909]], define the physical properties of payment cards, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial cards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing institutions.\n\n===Embossing===\n[[File:Credit card imprinter.JPG|thumb|right|Israeli manual card imprinter]]\nOriginally charge account identification was paper-based. In 1959 [[American Express]] was the first charge card operator to issue embossed plastic cards which enabled cards to be manually [[:wikt:imprint|imprint]]ed for processing, making processing faster and reducing transcription errors. Other credit card issuers followed suit. The information typically embossed are the [[bank card number]], card expiry date and cardholder's name. Though the imprinting method has been predominantly superseded by the magnetic stripe and then by the integrated chip, cards continue to be embossed in case a transaction needs to be processed manually. Under manual processing, cardholder verification was by the cardholder signing the payment voucher after which the merchant would check the signature against the cardholder's signature on the back of the card. Cards conform to the [[ISO/IEC 7810]] ID-1 standard, [[ISO/IEC 7811]] on embossing, and the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] card numbering standard.\n\n===Magnetic stripe===\n{{Main article|Magnetic stripe card}}\n[[File:CCardBack.svg|thumb|right|225px|An example of the reverse side of a typical [[debit card]]:\n{{Ordered list\n|[[Magnetic stripe#Financial cards|Magnetic stripe]]\n|[[Signature]] strip\n|[[Card Security Code]]\n}}]]\nMagnetic stripes started to be rolled out on debit cards in the 1970s with the introduction of [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]]. The magnetic stripe stores card [[data]] which can be read by physical contact and swiping past a reading head. The magnetic stripe contains all the information appearing on the card face, but allows for faster processing at point-of-sale than the then manual alternative as well as subsequently by the transaction processing company. When the magnetic stripe is being used, the cardholder will have been issued with a PIN, which is used for cardholder identification at the point-of-sale, and a signature is no longer required. The magnetic stripe is in the process of being augmented by the integrated chip.\n\n===Smart card===\n{{Main article|Smart card}}\n{{See|EMV}}\n\nA smart card, chip card, or [[integrated circuit]] card (ICC), is any pocket-sized card with embedded integrated circuits which can process data. This implies that it can receive input which is processed \u2014 by way of the ICC applications \u2014 and delivered as an output. There are two broad categories of ICCs. [[Memory card]]s contain only non-volatile memory storage components, and perhaps some specific security logic. [[Microprocessor card]]s contain volatile memory and microprocessor components. The card is made of plastic, generally [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], but sometimes [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]]. The card may embed a [[Holography|hologram]] to avoid [[counterfeit]]ing. Using smart cards is also a form of strong security authentication for [[single sign-on]] within large companies and organizations.\n\n[[EMV]] is the standard adopted by all major issuers of smart payment cards.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Proximity card===\n{{Main article|Proximity card}}\n[[Image:Proximity badge.km.jpg|thumb|A proximity card]]\nProximity card (or prox card) is a generic name for contactless integrated circuit devices used for [[Access control|security access]] or payment systems. It can refer to the older 125&nbsp;kHz devices or the newer 13.56&nbsp;MHz contactless [[RFID]] cards, most commonly known as [[contactless smartcard]]s.\n\nModern proximity cards are covered by the [[ISO/IEC 14443]] (proximity card) standard. There is also a related [[ISO/IEC 15693]] (vicinity card) standard. Proximity cards are powered by [[resonant inductive coupling|resonant energy transfer]] and have a range of 0\u20133&nbsp;inches in most instances. The user will usually be able to leave the card inside a wallet or purse. The price of the cards is also low, usually US$2\u2013$5, allowing them to be used in applications such as identification cards, [[keycard]]s, payment cards and [[public transit]] fare cards.\n\n===Re-programmable magnetic stripe card===\n\nRe-programmable/dynamic magnetic stripe cards are standard sized transaction cards that include a battery, a processor, and a means (inductive coupling or otherwise) of sending a variable signal to a magnetic stripe reader. Re-programmable stripe cards are often more secure than standard magnetic stripe cards and can transmit information for multiple cardholder accounts.<ref name=\"putting money into the mobile wallet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.admonsters.com/blog/putting-money-mobile-wallet |title=Putting Money into the Mobile Wallet |publisher=AdMonsters |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}</ref>\n\n== Misuse ==\nDue to increased illegal copies of cards with a magnetic stripe, the [[European Payments Council]] established a Card Fraud Prevention Task Force in 2003 that spawned a commitment to migrate all ATMs and POS applications to use a [[EMV|chip-and-PIN]] solution until the end of 2010.<ref>[http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/article.cfm?articles_uuid=CB4280BD-9A46-F734-D0FB30E04CFF5C57 \"EPC Card Fraud Prevention Forum \u2013 Agreement on new measures to fight card fraud\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722105654/http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/article.cfm?articles_uuid=CB4280BD-9A46-F734-D0FB30E04CFF5C57 |date=2011-07-22 }}, 19.
