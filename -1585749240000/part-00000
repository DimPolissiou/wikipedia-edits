When he was six, his father died in the disastrous [[Neuruppin]] fire of 1787. He became a student of architect [[Friedrich Gilly]] (1772\u20131800) (the two became close friends) and his father, David Gilly, in [[Berlin]]. After returning to Berlin from his first trip to Italy in 1805, he started to earn his living as a painter. When he saw [[Caspar David Friedrich]]'s painting ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog]]'' at the 1810 Berlin art exhibition he decided that he would never reach such mastery of painting and turned to architecture. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Working for the stage, in 1816 he created a star-spangled backdrop for the appearance of the \"K\u00f6nigin der Nacht\" in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', which is even quoted in modern productions of this perennial piece. After Napoleon's defeat, Schinkel oversaw the Prussian Building Commission. In this position, he was not only responsible for reshaping the still relatively unspectacular city of Berlin into a representative capital for Prussia, but also oversaw projects in the expanded Prussian territories from the Rhineland in the west to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in the east, such as [[New Altstadt Church]].\n\nFrom 1808 to 1817 Schinkel renovated and reconstructed [[Schloss Rosenau, Coburg]], in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style.<ref>Charles Quest-Ritson, '[https://books.google.com/books?id=gIYghIYipC8C&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q=&f=false Coburg: Schlo\u00df Rosenau]', in ''G\u00e4rten in Deutschland'', p. 64 online (in German)</ref> He also rebuilt the ruins of [[Chorin Abbey]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel Moskowitischer Entwurf Grundriss.tif|thumb|left| Floorplan]]\n[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel - Schlo\u00df am Strom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Castle by the River'' (''Schlo\u00df am Strom'')]]\n[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel - Gotische Kirche auf einem Felsen am Meer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Gotische Kirche auf einem Felsen am Meer'']]\n\nSchinkel's style, in his most productive period, is defined by a turn to Greek rather than Imperial Roman architecture, an attempt to turn away from the style that was linked to the recent French occupiers.

He also carried out improvements to the [[Kronprinzenpalais|Crown Prince's Palace]] and to [[Schloss Charlottenburg]]. Schinkel was also responsible for the interior decoration of a number of private Berlin residences.

The [[Elections in the United Kingdom|election]] took place in [[United Kingdom constituencies|650 constituencies]]<ref name=\"thirsk\" group=\"note\" /> across the United Kingdom under the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system. None of the parties achieved the 326 seats needed for an overall majority. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[David Cameron]], won the largest number of votes and seats, but still fell 20 seats short. This resulted in a [[hung parliament]] where no party was able to command a majority in the House of Commons. This was only the second general election since the [[World War II|Second World War]] to return a hung parliament, the first being the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]]. Unlike in 1974, the potential for a hung parliament had this time been widely considered and predicted, and both the country and politicians were better prepared for the constitutional process that would follow such a result.<ref name=\"timesonline1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7119226.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=797084|title=Britain wakes up to a hung Parliament|date=7 May 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=7 May 2010|first1=Philippe|last1=Naughton|first2=Roland|last2=Watson | location=London}}</ref> The [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition government]] that was subsequently formed was the first coalition in British history to eventuate directly from an election outcome. The hung parliament came about in spite of the Conservatives managing both a higher vote total and higher share of the vote than the previous [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government had done in [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], when it secured a comfortable majority.\n\n[[Coalition government|Coalition talks]] began immediately between the Conservatives and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and [[2010 United Kingdom government formation|lasted for five days]]. There was an aborted attempt to put together a Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition (although other smaller parties would have been required to make up the ten seats they lacked for a majority). To facilitate this, [[Gordon Brown]] announced on the evening of Monday 10 May that he would resign as Leader of the Labour Party. Realising that a deal between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats was imminent, the next day on Tuesday 11 May Brown announced his resignation<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8675913.stm |title=Gordon Brown resigns as UK prime minister |publisher=BBC News |date=11 May 2010}}</ref> as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], marking the end of 13 years of Labour government.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/> This was accepted by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], who then invited [[David Cameron]] to form a government in her name and become Prime Minister.

During the campaign, the three main party leaders engaged in a series of [[2010 United Kingdom general election debates|televised debates]], the first such debates in a UK general election campaign. The Liberal Democrats achieved a breakthrough in opinion polls after the first debate, in which their leader [[Nick Clegg]] was widely seen as the strongest performer. Nonetheless, on polling day their share of the vote increased by only 1% over the previous general election, and they suffered a net loss of five seats. This was still the Liberal Democrats' largest popular vote since the party's creation in 1988, and they found themselves in a pivotal role in the formation of the new government. The share of votes for parties other than Labour or the Conservatives was 35%, the largest since the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. In terms of votes it was the most \"three-cornered\" election since [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]], and in terms of seats since [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]].

Not only can individual constituencies vary markedly from overall voting trends, but individual countries and regions within the UK may have a very different electoral contest that is not properly reflected in overall share of the vote figures.\n\nImmediately following the previous general election, Labour held a double-digit lead in opinion polls. However, over the course of 2005, this lead was eroded somewhat. By December 2005, the Conservative party showed its first small leads in opinion polls following the controversial [[Terrorism Act 2006#Extending the period of detention without charge|90 days' detention]] proposals and the election of [[David Cameron]] to the leadership of the Conservative party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/104 |title=Tories take the Lead |date=10 December 2005 |author=Wells, Anthony |publisher=UKPollingReport |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006, opinion polls were increasingly mixed with small leads given alternately to Labour and Conservative. From the May 2006 local elections, in which Labour suffered significant losses, the Conservatives took a small single-digit lead in opinion polls. Labour regained the lead in June 2007 following the resignation of [[Tony Blair]] and the appointment of [[Gordon Brown]] as prime minister. From November 2007, the Conservatives again took the lead and, from then, extended their lead into double digits, particularly in response to the MPs' expenses scandal, although there was some evidence that the lead narrowed slightly towards the end of 2009. By the end of February 2010, [[Ipsos MORI]], [[ICM Research|ICM]], [[YouGov]] and [[ComRes]] polls had all found a sufficient narrowing of the Conservative lead for media speculation about a hung parliament to return.<ref>[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/2436 YouGov show Tory lead cut to 7 points] UK Polling Report, 29 January 2010</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"185\">\nFile:UK election opinion 2005-2010.png|{{legend2|#0087DC|Conservative|border=1px #aaa solid}}; {{legend2|#DC241f|Labour|border=1px #aaa solid}}; {{legend2|#FDBB30|Liberal Democrats|border=1px #aaa solid}}; {{legend2|#888|Other|border=1px #aaa solid}}<br />Graph of poll results since 2005\nFile:UK General Election 2010 YouGov Polls Graph.png|Graph of [[YouGov]] poll results from 6 April 2010\n</gallery>\nFrom 15 April 2010, following the first televised debate of the party leaders, polling data changed dramatically, with the Lib Dem vote proportion rising to 28\u201333%, and the Conservative vote proportion falling. In some polls, the Liberal Democrats took the lead from the Conservatives. Under UNS projections, this made a hung parliament highly probable, if Lib Dem performance had persisted.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/20/general-election-2010-poll-editorial General election 2010: All change for new politics] ''The Guardian'', 20 April 2010</ref>\n\nThe following graph shows ComRes poll results recorded over the period 11 April \u2013 6 May 2010, including annotations of the three TV debates:\n\n[[File:ComRes Graph Election 2010.JPG]]\n\nAfter the second debate on 22 April the polls, on average, placed the Conservatives in the lead on 33%, the Liberal Democrats in second on 30% and Labour in third on 28%. If these polls had reflected the election day results on a uniform swing nationwide, Labour would have had the most seats in a hung Parliament.\n\n=== Exit poll ===\nAt 22:00 on election day, coinciding with the closure of the polls, the results of an [[exit poll]] completed by GfK NOP and Ipsos MORI on behalf of the [[BBC News|BBC]], [[Sky News|Sky]] and [[ITV News|ITV]] news services was announced.

To facilitate this, [[Gordon Brown]] announced on the evening of Monday 10 May that he would resign as Leader of the Labour Party. Realising that a deal between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats was imminent, the next day on Tuesday 11 May Brown announced his resignation<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8675913.stm |title=Gordon Brown resigns as UK prime minister |publisher=BBC News |date=11 May 2010}}</ref> as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], marking the end of 13 years of Labour government.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/> This was accepted by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], who then invited [[David Cameron]] to form a government in her name and become Prime Minister.

During the campaign, the three main party leaders engaged in a series of [[2010 United Kingdom general election debates|televised debates]], the first such debates in a UK general election campaign. The Liberal Democrats achieved a breakthrough in opinion polls after the first debate, in which their leader [[Nick Clegg]] was widely seen as the strongest performer. Nonetheless, on polling day their share of the vote increased by only 1% over the previous general election, and they suffered a net loss of five seats. This was still the Liberal Democrats' largest popular vote since the party's creation in 1988, and they found themselves in a pivotal role in the formation of the new government. The share of votes for parties other than Labour or the Conservatives was 35%, the largest since the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. In terms of votes it was the most \"three-cornered\" election since [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]], and in terms of seats since [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]].

Not only can individual constituencies vary markedly from overall voting trends, but individual countries and regions within the UK may have a very different electoral contest that is not properly reflected in overall share of the vote figures.\n\nImmediately following the previous general election, Labour held a double-digit lead in opinion polls. However, over the course of 2005, this lead was eroded somewhat. By December 2005, the Conservative party showed its first small leads in opinion polls following the controversial [[Terrorism Act 2006#Extending the period of detention without charge|90 days' detention]] proposals and the election of [[David Cameron]] to the leadership of the Conservative party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/104 |title=Tories take the Lead |date=10 December 2005 |author=Wells, Anthony |publisher=UKPollingReport |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006, opinion polls were increasingly mixed with small leads given alternately to Labour and Conservative. From the May 2006 local elections, in which Labour suffered significant losses, the Conservatives took a small single-digit lead in opinion polls. Labour regained the lead in June 2007 following the resignation of [[Tony Blair]] and the appointment of [[Gordon Brown]] as prime minister. From November 2007, the Conservatives again took the lead and, from then, extended their lead into double digits, particularly in response to the MPs' expenses scandal, although there was some evidence that the lead narrowed slightly towards the end of 2009. By the end of February 2010, [[Ipsos MORI]], [[ICM Research|ICM]], [[YouGov]] and [[ComRes]] polls had all found a sufficient narrowing of the Conservative lead for media speculation about a hung parliament to return.<ref>[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/2436 YouGov show Tory lead cut to 7 points] UK Polling Report, 29 January 2010</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"185\">\nFile:UK election opinion 2005-2010.png|{{legend2|#0087DC|Conservative|border=1px #aaa solid}}; {{legend2|#DC241f|Labour|border=1px #aaa solid}}; {{legend2|#FDBB30|Liberal Democrats|border=1px #aaa solid}}; {{legend2|#888|Other|border=1px #aaa solid}}<br />Graph of poll results since 2005\nFile:UK General Election 2010 YouGov Polls Graph.png|Graph of [[YouGov]] poll results from 6 April 2010\n</gallery>\nFrom 15 April 2010, following the first televised debate of the party leaders, polling data changed dramatically, with the Lib Dem vote proportion rising to 28\u201333%, and the Conservative vote proportion falling. In some polls, the Liberal Democrats took the lead from the Conservatives. Under UNS projections, this made a hung parliament highly probable, if Lib Dem performance had persisted.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/20/general-election-2010-poll-editorial General election 2010: All change for new politics] ''The Guardian'', 20 April 2010</ref>\n\nThe following graph shows ComRes poll results recorded over the period 11 April \u2013 6 May 2010, including annotations of the three TV debates:\n\n[[File:ComRes Graph Election 2010.JPG]]\n\nAfter the second debate on 22 April the polls, on average, placed the Conservatives in the lead on 33%, the Liberal Democrats in second on 30% and Labour in third on 28%.

According to the author, body-trace and environment-trace have been retroacting in a systemic dynamic since the beginning of humanity, which explains the co-evolution of species and the environment<ref>Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec B\u00e9atrice,, \u00ab Pour une ichnologie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019heure du num\u00e9rique \u00bb, 2020. \u00bb, Communication et traces num\u00e9riques, n\u00b01,Presses universitaires du Havre et de Rouen, 2020</ref>\nThe interpretation that the Ichnos-Anthropos makes of the real comes from anthropo-semiotics, where signs appear as the result of an interaction between the body-trace of Ichnos-Anthropos and the reality-trace of the world. With the anthropological Human-Trace paradigm, B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec sets the figurative stage of homo (sapiens or otherwise) from any era whose body carries traces (ichnos) of the past (his or those of humans who have preceded him) and whose present relationship with the world participates permanently in the production of a future integrating the \"consequence-traces\" of his present actions<ref>GALINON-MELENEC B\u00e9atrice,  \u00ab The future of the \"Homme-trace\", A substantial societal challenge \u00bb, ''NETCOM'', 28-1/2 (2014), pp. 107-130,  (publication en anglais),   http://netcom.revues.org/1554.</ref>.

(ISBN 978-2-9539459-7-3)</ref>. \n\nThe interactions of a body with its surroundings being specific to each individual, the resulting body-trace is recorded in a difference, which modulates the reception of what is perceptible. To signify that the perception and interpretation of the sign are the consequences, the author suggests the term \"sign-trace\"<ref>B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p.

According to the author, body-trace and environment-trace have been retroacting in a systemic dynamic since the beginning of humanity, which explains the co-evolution of species and the environment<ref>Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec B\u00e9atrice,, \u00ab Pour une ichnologie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019heure du num\u00e9rique \u00bb, 2020. \u00bb, Communication et traces num\u00e9riques, n\u00b01,Presses universitaires du Havre et de Rouen, 2020</ref>\nThe interpretation that the Ichnos-Anthropos makes of the real comes from anthropo-semiotics, where signs appear as the result of an interaction between the body-trace of Ichnos-Anthropos and the reality-trace of the world. With the anthropological Human-Trace paradigm, B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec sets the figurative stage of homo (sapiens or otherwise) from any era whose body carries traces (ichnos) of the past (his or those of humans who have preceded him) and whose present relationship with the world participates permanently in the production of a future integrating the \"consequence-traces\" of his present actions<ref>GALINON-MELENEC B\u00e9atrice,  \u00ab The future of the \"Homme-trace\", A substantial societal challenge \u00bb, ''NETCOM'', 28-1/2 (2014), pp. 107-130,  (publication en anglais),   http://netcom.revues.org/1554.</ref>. As they were spread and appropriated by others, the term \"Human-Trace\" lost the paradigmatic dimension initially sought by the author. The effect of this being a preference for the Greek translation of \"Ichnos-Anthropos\" for the instances when referring to it in the strict sense of the paradigm.\n\n=== Influence ===\n\nThere has been a growing interest in the terms \"human trace\", \"body-trace\" and \"sign-trace\"<ref>Pequinot Julien, \u00ab Entretien avec B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec \u00bb, ''Communiquer'', \"revue de communication sociale et publique\",\u200e 2020, pp. 91-115 (ISSN 2368-9587)</ref>. Nevertheless, if reference is made to certain indexing tools [[Google Scholar]], the citations lead us to conclude that their uses in French articles in the humanities between 2008-2018 are more often linked to the evocative power of the words that form them than the systemic, dynamic and multi-scale perspective that they encompass for their author. \n\nThe traces of digital consultations of the works and publications reveal a 60% readership belonging to academia and from various geographical horizons <ref> Academia.edu </ref> (The United States, Canada, Brazil, The United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, India, The Philippines, Turkey, Mauritius, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Niger, Swiss).\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, observations of the consequence-traces of human confinement on the decrease in pollution <ref> (en) Nasa, \u00ab How the coronavirus is and is not affecting the environment\u00bbhttps://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2020/03/05/how-the-coronavirus-is-and-is-not-affecting-the-environment/ [archive]</ref>, extends the author\u2019s influence which had repeatedly warned about the pragmatic interest of the [[ecosystem]] present in the Human-Trace paradigm. The modelling of the semiotic emergence of the  \"sign-trace\" via the \"body-trace\" \u2013 which highlights the specific relationship between a human-trace in constant evolution and a reality-trace constantly evolutionary \u2013 acts as a support to psychological, sociological, cognitive and ecological analysis of the observations<ref>Pequinot Julien, \u00ab Entretien avec B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec \u00bb, Communiquer, \"revue de communication sociale et publique\",\u200b 2020, pp. 91-115 (ISSN 2368-9587 (http://worldcat.org/issn/2368-9587&lang=fr)) </ref>.\n\n== Main publications ==\n\n=== In French ===\n* ''L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace,'' Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p.

His son [[Mario Van Peebles]] also appears in a small role, playing the title character as a young boy. It tells the [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] story of the flight of a poor black man from the [[White American|white]] police authorities.\n\nVan Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three-picture contract for [[Columbia Pictures]]. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded it himself, shooting it independently over 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, some reportedly [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=J.|title=Videodrome: Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)|url=http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2014/01/29/videodrome-sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971/|website=Aquarium Drunkard|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> He received a $50,000 loan from [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on African-American cinema.\n\nThe musical score of ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' was performed by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Van Peebles did not have money for traditional advertising methods, so released the [[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] prior to the film's release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened in only two theaters in the United States. It went on to gross $15.2 million at the box office. [[Huey P. Newton]] celebrated and welcomed the film's revolutionary implications, and ''Sweetback'' became required viewing for members of the [[Black Panther Party]]. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', it demonstrated to [[Hollywood film industry|Hollywood]] that films which portrayed \"militant\" blacks could be highly profitable, leading to the creation of the [[blaxploitation]] genre,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jutton |first1=Lee |title=SWEET SWEETBACK\u2019S BAADASSSSS SONG: A Blaxploitation Classic That Remains All Too Relevant Today |url=https://www.filminquiry.com/sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971-review/ |website=www.filminquiry.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> although critic [[Roger Ebert]], commenting on a review of the 2004 film about the making of this movie, did not consider this example of Van Peebles' work to be an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040611/REVIEWS/406110302 |title=Review of ''Baadasssss!'' |accessdate=2007-01-04 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=June 11, 2004 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA young African-American orphan is sheltered by a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] brothel in the 1940s. Working as a towel boy, he is raped by one of the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]. The women name him \"Sweet Sweetback\" in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis. As an adult, Sweetback performs in the whorehouse [[sex show]].\n\nOne night, two white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers come in to speak to Sweetback's boss, Beetle. A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police suggest arresting Sweetback to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and they arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] named Mu-Mu after some trouble. They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into [[brass knuckles]] and beats the officers, putting them into comas.\n\nSweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by order of the police chief, seeking information about Mu-Mu's whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a [[molotov cocktail]] at the police car transporting him to the station for more severe interrogation. He next visits an old girlfriend, who similarly refuses him aid but cuts his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks his [[priest]] for help, but he refuses for fear of the police shutting down the church's [[drug rehab]] center.\n\nPolice officers interrogate Beetle, seeking to discover Sweetback's whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun against each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through [[South Central Los Angeles]] to the outskirts. Stopping overnight at a seemingly abandoned building, they discover it is a [[safe house]] for the [[Hells Angels]]. Their helmetted president challenges Sweetback to a duel: asked to decide the weapon and discovering she is a woman, he chooses sex and is judged to win. The bikers leave the men in their club to await a member of the all black [[East Bay Dragons MC|East Bay Dragons]] who will get them to Mexico. During the night, the club is raided by two policemen with drawn guns. Sweetback resists arrest and kills both officers in self-defense, but Mu-Mu is badly wounded. The next morning, the Dragon arrives, but his motorcycle can only carry one; Sweetback asks him to take Mu-Mu, as the activist is their future.\n\nAs Sweetback and Mu-Mu continue to evade arrest, pressure mounts on the police; the police chief warns his staff that the fugitives' example could prompt a black uprising. The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be probably one of the fugitives, and that he deserves a beating in any case. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair following the police brutality, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback and smiles when he sees it is somone else. As the police trawl black areas for him, they find Sweetback's biological and rather confused mother, who reveals that his birth name is Leroy.\n\nSweetback pays a [[hippie]] to switch clothes with him, deceiving a police helicopter which sends a patrol car in pursuit. Sweetback was also wounded in the shootout and both stows away and hitches rides on trucks and a train heading south. Running through arid country, he survives by drinking from a puddle and eating a frog. Whe police hear he might be at a rural hippie musical event, he successfully disguises himself by simulating sex in the bushes. He is later spotted and police borrow a farmer's hunting dogs to track him. Realising he will cross the border before they reach him, a policeman releases the dogs, expecting them to catch and kill him. However, at the [[Tijuana River]], Sweetback stabs the dogs and escapes into Mexico, swearing to return to \"collect some dues\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Sweetback\n* Hubert Scales as Mu-Mu\n* Simon Chuckster as Beetle\n* John Dullaghan as Commissioner\n* West Gale\n* Niva Rochelle\n* [[Rhetta Hughes]] as Old Girl Friend\n* Nick Ferrari\n* Ed Rue\n* [[John Amos]] as Biker (as Johnny Amos)\n* Lavelle Roby\n* Ted Hayden\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Young Sweetback / Kid (as Mario Peebles)\n{{Colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nDuring production on ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]], Van Peebles attempted to rewrite the script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun of white liberals into the first [[black power]] film. The writer, [[Herman Raucher]], who had based the script on friends of his who expressed liberal sentiments while still holding onto bigoted beliefs, objected to Van Peebles' efforts because he felt that the movie should be a parody of liberal culture.<ref>[http://www.cinedump.com/interviews/2016/9/13/hermanraucher Fassel, Preston. ''Rediscovering Herman Raucher.'' Retrieved 10 February 2017]</ref> Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.\n\nAfter ''Watermelon Man'' proved to be a financial success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song''. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the [[Mojave desert]], turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun.  He decided that the film was going to be \"about a brother getting [[the Man]]'s foot out of his ass.\"<ref name=\"DariusJames\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink=Darius James |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-312-13192-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">Van Peebles, Melvin.

Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the film. \"Cosby didn't want an equity part,\" according to Van Peebles. \"He just wanted his money back.\" Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nAccording to Van Peebles, during the first day of shooting, director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the [[Dailies|rushes]], Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a relatively short period of 19 days in order to reduce the possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as \"globs,\" where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a [[Stunt performer|stunt man]], he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, \"Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again.\" Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted [[gonorrhea]] when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] in order to get [[workers' compensation]] because he was \"hurt on the job.\" Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=2 What Culture#17]; Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</ref>\n\nVan Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to stay until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crew members were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nVan Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Directing===\nVan Peebles stated that he approached directing the film \"like you do the cupboard when you're broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope to come out on top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" /> Van Peebles stated that \"story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. ... To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\">{{cite book |last=Van Peebles |first=Melvin |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Kaufman, Alan |editor2=Ortenberg, Neil |editor3=Rosset, Barney |others= |title=The Outlaw Bible of American Literature |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-56025-550-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 286\u2013289] |chapter=''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles wanted \"a victorious film ... where [[nigger]]s could walk out standing tall instead of avoiding each other's eyes, looking once again like they'd had it.\" Van Peebles was aware of the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low-budget independently made features, and was determined to make a film that \"[looked] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles knew that in order to spread his message, the film \"simply couldn't be a didactic discourse which would end up playing ... to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat me on the back and say it tells it like it is\" and that \"to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains\". Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would \"be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product ... [The Man] ain't about to go carrying no messages for you, especially a relevant one, for free.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles wanted half of his shooting crew \"to be third world people. ... So at best a staggering amount of my crew would be relatively inexperienced. ... Any type of film requiring an enormous technical sophistication at the shooting stage should not be attempted.\" Van Peebles knew that gaining financing for the film would not be easy and expected \"a great deal of animosity from the film media (white in the first place and right wing in the second) at all levels of filmmaking\", thus he had to \"write a flexible script where emphasis could be shifted. In short, stay loose.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThe film's fast-paced [[Montage sequence|montage]]s and [[jump cut]]s were novel features for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the film's editing had \"a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|title=FILM VIEW; Sweet Sweetback's World Revisited\n|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=July 2, 1995|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/movies/film-view-sweet-sweetback-s-world-revisited.html|accessdate=January 11, 2012|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref> In ''The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity'', author S.

Because he did not know how to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Van Peebles stated that \"Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations. Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension. So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nThe film's music was performed by the then-unknown group [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], who were living in a single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> By alternating [[hymn]]-based vocalization and [[jazz]] rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in [[hip hop music]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Kermit Ernest |title=Gettin' our groove on: rhetoric, language, and literacy for the hip hop generation |year=2005 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2925-2 |page=43 |chapter=Professing the Power of the Rap }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles recalls that \"music was not used as a selling tool in movies at the time. Even musicals, it would take three months after the release of the movie before they would bring out an album.\" Because Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods, he decided that by releasing a [[soundtrack album]] in anticipation of the film's release, he could help build awareness for the film with its music.<ref name=\"Funk\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Funk |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2001 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-87930-629-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 207\u2013208] |chapter=Blaxploitation: Funk Goes to the Movies |chapterurl= |quote= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==Release and alterations==\nThe film was released on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that \"at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in [[Detroit]], and one in [[Atlanta]]. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater's records, and that was only on the strength of the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet.

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] cited the ending as a reason for the film not to be labeled as an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\"/>\n\nThe ''New York Times'' critic Clayton Riley viewed the film favorably, commenting on its aesthetic innovation, but stated of the character of Sweetback that he \"is the ultimate sexualist in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic [[colonialism]].\" In another review, Riley explained that \"Sweetback, the profane sexual athlete and fugitive, is based on a reality that is Black. We may not want him to exist but he does.\" Critic [[Donald Bogle]] states in a ''New York Times'' interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, [[Sidney Poitier]]-type characters and that they wanted a \"viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero.\"<ref name=\"FramingBlackness\" /> In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: \"Not since [[Oscar Micheaux]] had an African-American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment...[it] depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other.\"<ref name=\"moma\">Higgins, Steven.

Warts and all, the film is perhaps the closest analogy to the progressive aims of the then-flourishing Black Arts movement. Indeed, it can be argued that because it was written, produced and directed by an American-born African outside of Hollywood, the film is not truly part of the blaxploitation genre, yet it cannot be denied that it shares certain thematic similarities. The film works best when it follows Sweetback's odyssey from stud boy to proto-nationalist consciousness. Unlike the Horatio Alger-style integrationism propagated in past films about blacks, here we see an outlaw among outlaws, nourished by a community segregated from the mainstream. It is in this disenfranchised community--and not the sterile offices of the NAACP--that he seeks and finds refuge. The sordid sexual trysts, the faux fantasies in the desert are, finally, less interesting than Sweetback's quest for self-realization.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=Nicky |title=In the early '70s, blaxploitation upended Hollywood stereotypes |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/blax-9545.html |website=www.metroactive.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Notable reactions===\n[[Huey P.

Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that \"some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes.\" Bennett concluded that the film is \"neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation.\" Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the \"rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute.\" Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as \"emancipation orgasms\" and stated that \"it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that they are going to be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set you free.

His son [[Mario Van Peebles]] also appears in a small role, playing the title character as a young boy. It tells the [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] story of the flight of a poor black man from the [[White American|white]] police authorities.\n\nVan Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three-picture contract for [[Columbia Pictures]]. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded it himself, shooting it independently over 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, some reportedly [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=J.|title=Videodrome: Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)|url=http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2014/01/29/videodrome-sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971/|website=Aquarium Drunkard|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> He received a $50,000 loan from [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on African-American cinema.\n\nThe musical score of ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' was performed by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Van Peebles did not have money for traditional advertising methods, so released the [[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] prior to the film's release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened in only two theaters in the United States. It went on to gross $15.2 million at the box office. [[Huey P. Newton]] celebrated and welcomed the film's revolutionary implications, and ''Sweetback'' became required viewing for members of the [[Black Panther Party]]. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', it demonstrated to [[Hollywood film industry|Hollywood]] that films which portrayed \"militant\" blacks could be highly profitable, leading to the creation of the [[blaxploitation]] genre,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jutton |first1=Lee |title=SWEET SWEETBACK\u2019S BAADASSSSS SONG: A Blaxploitation Classic That Remains All Too Relevant Today |url=https://www.filminquiry.com/sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971-review/ |website=www.filminquiry.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> although critic [[Roger Ebert]], commenting on a review of the 2004 film about the making of this movie, did not consider this example of Van Peebles' work to be an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040611/REVIEWS/406110302 |title=Review of ''Baadasssss!'' |accessdate=2007-01-04 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=June 11, 2004 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA young African-American orphan is sheltered by a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] brothel in the 1940s. Working as a towel boy, he is raped by one of the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]. The women name him \"Sweet Sweetback\" in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis. As an adult, Sweetback performs in the whorehouse [[sex show]].\n\nOne night, two white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers come in to speak to Sweetback's boss, Beetle. A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police suggest arresting Sweetback to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and they arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] named Mu-Mu after some trouble. They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into [[brass knuckles]] and beats the officers, putting them into comas.\n\nSweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by order of the police chief, seeking information about Mu-Mu's whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a [[molotov cocktail]] at the police car transporting him to the station for more severe interrogation. He next visits an old girlfriend, who similarly refuses him aid but cuts his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks his [[priest]] for help, but he refuses for fear of the police shutting down the church's [[drug rehab]] center.\n\nPolice officers interrogate Beetle, seeking to discover Sweetback's whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun against each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through [[South Central Los Angeles]] to the outskirts. Stopping overnight at a seemingly abandoned building, they discover it is a [[safe house]] for the [[Hells Angels]]. Their helmetted president challenges Sweetback to a duel: asked to decide the weapon and discovering she is a woman, he chooses sex and is judged to win. The bikers leave the men in their club to await a member of the all black [[East Bay Dragons MC|East Bay Dragons]] who will get them to Mexico. During the night, the club is raided by two policemen with drawn guns. Sweetback resists arrest and kills both officers in self-defense, but Mu-Mu is badly wounded. The next morning, the Dragon arrives, but his motorcycle can only carry one; Sweetback asks him to take Mu-Mu, as the activist is their future.\n\nAs Sweetback and Mu-Mu continue to evade arrest, pressure mounts on the police; the police chief warns his staff that the fugitives example could prompt a black uprising. The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be probably one of the fugitives, and that he deserves a beating in any case. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair following the police brutality, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback and smiles when he sees it is somone else. As the police trawl black areas for him, they find Sweetback's biological and rather confused mother, who reveals that his birth name is Leroy.\n\nSweetback pays a [[hippie]] to switch clothes with him, deceiving a police helicopter which sends a patrol car in pursuit. Sweetback was also wounded in the shootout and both stows away and hitches rides on trucks and a train heading south. Running through arid country, he survives by drinking from a puddle and eating a frog. Whe police hear he might be at a rural hippie musical event, he successfully disguises himself by simulating sex in the bushes. He is later spotted and police borrow a farmer's hunting dogs to track him. Realising he will cross the border before they reach him, a policeman releases the dogs, expecting them to catch and kill him. However, at the [[Tijuana River]], Sweetback stabs the dogs and escapes into Mexico, swearing to return to \"collect some dues\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Sweetback\n* Hubert Scales as Mu-Mu\n* Simon Chuckster as Beetle\n* John Dullaghan as Commissioner\n* West Gale\n* Niva Rochelle\n* [[Rhetta Hughes]] as Old Girl Friend\n* Nick Ferrari\n* Ed Rue\n* [[John Amos]] as Biker (as Johnny Amos)\n* Lavelle Roby\n* Ted Hayden\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Young Sweetback / Kid (as Mario Peebles)\n{{Colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nDuring production on ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]], Van Peebles attempted to rewrite the script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun of white liberals into the first [[black power]] film. The writer, [[Herman Raucher]], who had based the script on friends of his who expressed liberal sentiments while still holding onto bigoted beliefs, objected to Van Peebles' efforts because he felt that the movie should be a parody of liberal culture.<ref>[http://www.cinedump.com/interviews/2016/9/13/hermanraucher Fassel, Preston. ''Rediscovering Herman Raucher.'' Retrieved 10 February 2017]</ref> Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.\n\nAfter ''Watermelon Man'' proved to be a financial success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song''. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the [[Mojave desert]], turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun.  He decided that the film was going to be \"about a brother getting [[the Man]]'s foot out of his ass.\"<ref name=\"DariusJames\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink=Darius James |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-312-13192-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">Van Peebles, Melvin.

Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the film. \"Cosby didn't want an equity part,\" according to Van Peebles. \"He just wanted his money back.\" Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nAccording to Van Peebles, during the first day of shooting, director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the [[Dailies|rushes]], Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a relatively short period of 19 days in order to reduce the possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as \"globs,\" where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a [[Stunt performer|stunt man]], he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, \"Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again.\" Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted [[gonorrhea]] when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] in order to get [[workers' compensation]] because he was \"hurt on the job.\" Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=2 What Culture#17]; Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</ref>\n\nVan Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to stay until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crew members were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nVan Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Directing===\nVan Peebles stated that he approached directing the film \"like you do the cupboard when you're broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope to come out on top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" /> Van Peebles stated that \"story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. ... To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\">{{cite book |last=Van Peebles |first=Melvin |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Kaufman, Alan |editor2=Ortenberg, Neil |editor3=Rosset, Barney |others= |title=The Outlaw Bible of American Literature |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-56025-550-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 286\u2013289] |chapter=''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles wanted \"a victorious film ... where [[nigger]]s could walk out standing tall instead of avoiding each other's eyes, looking once again like they'd had it.\" Van Peebles was aware of the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low-budget independently made features, and was determined to make a film that \"[looked] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles knew that in order to spread his message, the film \"simply couldn't be a didactic discourse which would end up playing ... to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat me on the back and say it tells it like it is\" and that \"to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains\". Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would \"be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product ... [The Man] ain't about to go carrying no messages for you, especially a relevant one, for free.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles wanted half of his shooting crew \"to be third world people. ... So at best a staggering amount of my crew would be relatively inexperienced. ... Any type of film requiring an enormous technical sophistication at the shooting stage should not be attempted.\" Van Peebles knew that gaining financing for the film would not be easy and expected \"a great deal of animosity from the film media (white in the first place and right wing in the second) at all levels of filmmaking\", thus he had to \"write a flexible script where emphasis could be shifted. In short, stay loose.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThe film's fast-paced [[Montage sequence|montage]]s and [[jump cut]]s were novel features for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the film's editing had \"a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|title=FILM VIEW; Sweet Sweetback's World Revisited\n|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=July 2, 1995|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/movies/film-view-sweet-sweetback-s-world-revisited.html|accessdate=January 11, 2012|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref> In ''The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity'', author S.

Because he did not know how to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Van Peebles stated that \"Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations. Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension. So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nThe film's music was performed by the then-unknown group [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], who were living in a single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> By alternating [[hymn]]-based vocalization and [[jazz]] rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in [[hip hop music]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Kermit Ernest |title=Gettin' our groove on: rhetoric, language, and literacy for the hip hop generation |year=2005 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2925-2 |page=43 |chapter=Professing the Power of the Rap }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles recalls that \"music was not used as a selling tool in movies at the time. Even musicals, it would take three months after the release of the movie before they would bring out an album.\" Because Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods, he decided that by releasing a [[soundtrack album]] in anticipation of the film's release, he could help build awareness for the film with its music.<ref name=\"Funk\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Funk |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2001 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-87930-629-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 207\u2013208] |chapter=Blaxploitation: Funk Goes to the Movies |chapterurl= |quote= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==Release and alterations==\nThe film was released on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that \"at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in [[Detroit]], and one in [[Atlanta]]. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater's records, and that was only on the strength of the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet.

We may not want him to exist but he does.\" Critic [[Donald Bogle]] states in a ''New York Times'' interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, [[Sidney Poitier]]-type characters and that they wanted a \"viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero.\"<ref name=\"FramingBlackness\" /> In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: \"Not since [[Oscar Micheaux]] had an African-American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment...[it] depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other.\"<ref name=\"moma\">Higgins, Steven.

Print. p. 254</ref>\n\nNicky Baxter of Metroactive response is mixed: ''Sweet Sweetback'' introduced the biggest and baddest buck of the [blaxploitation era]. Warts and all, the film is perhaps the closest analogy to the progressive aims of the then-flourishing Black Arts movement. Indeed, it can be argued that because it was written, produced and directed by an American-born African outside of Hollywood, the film is not truly part of the blaxploitation genre, yet it cannot be denied that it shares certain thematic similarities. The film works best when it follows Sweetback's odyssey from stud boy to proto-nationalist consciousness. Unlike the Horatio Alger-style integrationism propagated in past films about blacks, here we see an outlaw among outlaws, nourished by a community segregated from the mainstream. It is in this disenfranchised community--and not the sterile offices of the NAACP--that he seeks and finds refuge. The sordid sexual trysts, the faux fantasies in the desert are, finally, less interesting than Sweetback's quest for self-realization.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=Nicky |title=In the early '70s, blaxploitation upended Hollywood stereotypes |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/blax-9545.html |website=www.metroactive.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Notable reactions===\n[[Huey P.

Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that \"some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes.\" Bennett concluded that the film is \"neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation.\" Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the \"rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute.\" Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as \"emancipation orgasms\" and stated that \"it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that they are going to be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set you free.
