It may also be known as '''ship dismantling''', '''ship cracking''', or '''ship recycling'''. Modern ships have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years before [[corrosion]], [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]] and a lack of parts render them uneconomical to operate.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Life Cycle of a Ship {{!}} shippipedia|url = http://www.shippipedia.com/life-cycle-of-a-ship/|website = www.shippipedia.com|accessdate = 2 August 2015}}</ref> Ship-breaking allows the materials from the ship, especially steel, to be [[recycling|recycled]] and made into new products. This lowers the demand for mined [[iron ore]] and reduces energy use in the [[steelmaking]] process. Fixtures and other equipment on board the vessels can also be reused. While ship-breaking is sustainable, there are concerns about the use by poorer countries without stringent environmental legislation. It is also labour-intensive, and considered one of the world's most dangerous industries.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ship breaking: Newfoundland\u2019s legacy with one of the most hazardous jobs|url = http://globalnews.ca/news/837009/ship-breaking-newfoundlands-legacy-with-one-of-the-most-hazardous-jobs/|accessdate = 4 August 2015|first = Ross|last = Lord|date = 12 September 2013|website = globalnews.ca|publisher = Shaw Media Inc.|last2 = Logan|first2 = Nick}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, roughly 1,250 ocean ships were broken down, and their average age was 26 years.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = NGO Shipbreaking Platform \u00bb Problems and Solutions|url = http://www.shipbreakingplatform.org/problems-and-solutions/|website = www.shipbreakingplatform.org|accessdate = 2 August 2015|publisher = NGO Shipbreaking Platform}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|title = Technical guidelines for the environmentally sound management of the full and partial dismantling of ships|url = http://www.basel.int/Portals/4/Basel%20Convention/docs/meetings/sbc/workdoc/techgships-e.pdf|journal = Basel Convention series/SBC.|issn = 1020-8364|access-date = 3 August 2015}}</ref> In 2013, the world total of demolished ships amounted to 29,052,000 tonnes, 92% of which were demolished in Asia.

Storage is a viable temporary option, whether on land or afloat, though all ships will be eventually scrapped, sunk, or preserved for museums.\n\n==History==\nWooden-hulled ships were simply set on fire or 'conveniently sunk'. In Tudor times, ships were also dismantled and the timber re-used. This procedure was no longer applicable with the advent of metal-hulled boats.<ref name=\"Bowen-1936\">{{Cite magazine |title = The Shipbreaking Industry |url = http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyBritish-Shipbreak.htm |magazine=Shipping Wonders of the World |publisher= www.naval-history.net|accessdate = 3 August 2015|first = Frank C|last = Bowen|date =10 November 1936}} [https://www.shippingwondersoftheworld.com/shipbreaking.html alternate URL]</ref>\n[[File:The Queen heeled over on the shore off the shipbreaker's yard.png|thumb|{{HMS|Queen|1839|6}} [[Heeling (sailing)|heeled over]] on the [[River Thames|Thames]] [[Intertidal zone|foreshore]] off [[Rotherhithe]].]]\n\nIn 1880, Denny Brothers of Dumbarton used forgings made from scrap maritime steel in their shipbuilding. Many other nations began to purchase British ships for scrap by the late 19th century, including [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the Netherlands and Japan. The Italian industry started in 1892, and the Japanese after an 1896 law had been passed to subsidise native shipbuilding.<ref name=Bowen-1936/>\n\nAfter being damaged or involved in a disaster, liner operators did not want the name of the broken ship to tarnish the brand of their passenger services. The final voyage of many Victorian ships was with the final letter of their name chipped off.<ref name=Bowen-1936/> \n\nIn the 1930s, it became cheaper to 'beach' a boat and run her ashore as opposed to using a dry dock. The ship would have to weigh as little as possible and run ashore at full speed. Dismantling operations required a {{convert|10|ft}} rise of [[tide]] and close proximity to a steel-works. Electric [[Shear (sheet metal)|shears]], a [[wrecking ball]] and [[oxy-acetylene]] torches were used. The technique of the time is almost identical to that of developing countries today. Similarly, [[Thos W Ward]] Ltd., one of the largest breakers in the United Kingdom in the 1930s, would recondition and sell all furniture and machinery. Many historical artifacts were sold at public auctions: the Cunarder {{ship|RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}}, sold as scrap for {{GBP|78000}}, received high bids for her fittings worldwide. However, even with obsolete technology, any weapons and military information were carefully removed.<ref name=Bowen-1936/>\n[[File:Redoutable in Toulon-Agence Rol-1.jpeg|thumb|Dismantling of {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}} in Toulon, 1912]]\n\n===Shifting to Asia===\nUntil the late 20th century, the majority of ship-breaking activity took place in the port cities of [[industrialized countries]] such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Those dismantlers that still remain in the United States work primarily on government surplus vessels.\n\nStarting in the mid-20th century, East Asian countries with lower labor costs began to dominate ship-breaking, moving as labor costs rose, initially from countries such as Japan and Hong Kong, to Korea and Taiwan and then to China. For example, the southern port city of [[Kaohsiung]] in Taiwan was the world's leading dismantling site in the late 1960s and 1970s, breaking up 220 ships totaling 1.6&nbsp;million tons in 1972 alone;<ref name=\"TR-1973\">{{cite news |url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&post=13609 |title=Shipbreaker to the world |date=March 1, 1973 |work=Taiwan Review |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref> in 1977, Taiwan continued to dominate the industry with more than half the market share, followed by Spain and Pakistan.

It could not be re-floated and so remained there for several years. In 1965, the then in [[East Pakistan]], [[Chittagong]] Steel House bought the ship and had it scrapped. It took years to scrap the vessel, but the work gave birth to the industry in [[Bangladesh]].\nUntil 1980 the [[Gadani ship-breaking yard]] of [[Pakistan]] was the largest ship-breaking yard in the world.\n\nTightening environmental regulations resulted in increased costs of hazardous waste disposal in industrialised countries in the 1980s, causing ships to be exported to lower income nations, chiefly South Asia. This, in turn, created a far worse environmental problem, subsequently leading to the Basel Convention. In 2004 a Basel Convention decision officially classified old ships as \u201ctoxic waste\u201d, preventing them from leaving a country without the permission of the importing state.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.grida.no/files/publications/vital-waste2/VWG2_p3to46.pdf|title = Vital Waste Graphics 2|date = November 2006|accessdate = 1 August 2015|website = www.grida.no|publisher = The Basel Convention Secretariat|last = Heberlein|first = Claudia|page = 31}}</ref> This has led to a resurgence of recycling in environmentally-compliant locations in developed countries, especially in former ship building yards.<ref>{{Cite web|title = AMERICAN SHIP BREAKING IT ALL COMES APART AT THE BOTTOM OF AMERICA|url = http://www.clui.org/newsletter/spring-2010/american-ship-breaking|website = www.clui.org|accessdate = 3 August 2015|date = Spring 2010|publisher = The Center for Land Use Interpretation}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 December 2005, the French Navy's {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Clemenceau|R98|2}} left [[Toulon]] to be dismantled in [[Alang]], [[India]] despite protests over improper disposal capabilities and facilities for the toxic wastes.

The Basel Convention demands that all yards separate hazardous and non-hazardous waste and have appropriate storage units, and this must be done before the hull is cut up. [[Asbestos]], found in the engine room, is isolated and stored in custom-made plastic wrapping prior to being placed in secure steel containers, which are then landfilled.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nMany hazardous wastes can be recycled into new products. Examples include lead-acid batteries or electronic circuit boards. Another commonly used treatment is [[cement]]-based [[solidification and stabilization]]. [[Cement kiln]]s are used because they can treat a range of hazardous wastes by improving physical characteristics and decreasing the toxicity and transmission of contaminants. A hazardous waste may also be \"destroyed\" by [[incinerating]] it at a high temperature; flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. Some hazardous waste types may be eliminated using [[pyrolysis]] in a high temperature electrical arc, in inert conditions to avoid combustion. This treatment method may be preferable to high temperature incineration in some circumstances such as in the destruction of concentrated organic waste types, including PCBs, pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants. Dangerous chemicals can also be permanently stored in landfills as long as leaching is prevented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fedcenter.gov/assistance/facilitytour/landfills/hazwaste/|title=FedCenter \u2013 Hazardous Waste Landfills|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/td/ldu/index.htm Land Disposal Units]</ref>\n\nValuable metals, such as copper in electric cable, that are mixed with other materials may be recovered by the use of shredders and separators in the same fashion as [[Computer recycling|e-waste recycling.]] The shredders cut the electronics into metallic and non-metallic pieces.

A typical 5,000-ton ship could be broken up in 25 to 30 days.<ref name=TR-1973/>\n\nThe process began with \"cleaning\", a process in which subcontractors would come on board the ship to strip it of loose and flammable items, which were often resold in second-hand shops. After that, the cutting crews would start to dismantle the hull, stern-first; large sections were cut off the ship and moved via cranes and rigging taken from previously-scrapped ships. Because the scrapping at Kaohsiung was done at the docks, scrap metal was placed on trucks waiting to transport it to Kaohsiung's mills.<ref name=PacMar/>\n\n==Risks==\n===Health risks===\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:Bluelady07.jpg|thumb|left|''[[SS France (1961)|Blue Lady]]'' at [[Alang, India]] for dismantling, September 2007.]] -->\n70% of ships are simply run ashore in developing countries for disassembly, where (particularly in older vessels) potentially toxic materials such as [[asbestos]], [[lead]], [[polychlorinated biphenyls|<nowiki/>]] [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s and [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]] along with lax [[industrial safety]] standards pose a danger for the workers.  Burns from explosions and fire, suffocation, mutilation from falling metal, cancer, and disease from toxins are regular occurrences in the industry. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid-1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas are commonplace.<ref name=\"amrc\">[http://www.amrc.org.hk/alu_article/occupational_safety_and_health_in_asia/asbestos_in_the_ship_breaking_industry_of_banglad AMRC: Asbestos in the Ship-breaking industry of Bangladesh: Action for Ban]</ref>\n\nRemoving the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the value of the scrap metal itself. In the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of [[Personal injury|personal injury lawsuits]] or [[Workers' compensation|workers' health claims]], meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. The sandy beaches cannot sufficiently support the heavy equipment, which is thus prone to collapse. Many are injured from explosions when flammable gas is not removed from fuel tanks. In Bangladesh, a local watchdog group claims that one worker dies a week and one is injured per a day on average.<ref>Vidal, John (5 May 2012).

Many other nations began to purchase British ships for scrap by the late 19th century, including [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the Netherlands and Japan. The Italian industry started in 1892, and the Japanese after an 1896 law had been passed to subsidise native shipbuilding.<ref name=Bowen-1936/>\n\nAfter being damaged or involved in a disaster, liner operators did not want the name of the broken ship to tarnish the brand of their passenger services.

The ship would have to weigh as little as possible and run ashore at full speed. Dismantling operations required a {{convert|10|ft}} rise of [[tide]] and close proximity to a steel-works. Electric [[Shear (sheet metal)|shears]], a [[wrecking ball]] and [[oxy-acetylene]] torches were used. The technique of the time is almost identical to that of developing countries today. Similarly, [[Thos W Ward]] Ltd., one of the largest breakers in the United Kingdom in the 1930s, would recondition and sell all furniture and machinery. Many historical artifacts were sold at public auctions: the Cunarder {{ship|RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}}, sold as scrap for {{GBP|78000}}, received high bids for her fittings worldwide. However, even with obsolete technology, any weapons and military information were carefully removed.<ref name=Bowen-1936/>\n[[File:Redoutable in Toulon-Agence Rol-1.jpeg|thumb|Dismantling of {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}} in Toulon, 1912]]\n\n===Shifting to Asia===\nUntil the late 20th century, the majority of ship-breaking activity took place in the port cities of [[industrialized countries]] such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Those dismantlers that still remain in the United States work primarily on government surplus vessels.\n\nStarting in the mid-20th century, East Asian countries with lower labor costs began to dominate ship-breaking, moving as labor costs rose, initially from countries such as Japan and Hong Kong, to Korea and Taiwan and then to China. For example, the southern port city of [[Kaohsiung]] in Taiwan was the world's leading dismantling site in the late 1960s and 1970s, breaking up 220 ships totaling 1.6&nbsp;million tons in 1972 alone;<ref name=\"TR-1973\">{{cite news |url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&post=13609 |title=Shipbreaker to the world |date=March 1, 1973 |work=Taiwan Review |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref> in 1977, Taiwan continued to dominate the industry with more than half the market share, followed by Spain and Pakistan.

It could not be re-floated and so remained there for several years. In 1965, the then in [[East Pakistan]], [[Chittagong]] Steel House bought the ship and had it scrapped. It took years to scrap the vessel, but the work gave birth to the industry in [[Bangladesh]].\nUntil 1980 the [[Gadani ship-breaking yard]] of [[Pakistan]] was the largest ship-breaking yard in the world.\n\nTightening environmental regulations resulted in increased costs of hazardous waste disposal in industrialised countries in the 1980s, causing ships to be exported to lower income nations, chiefly South Asia. This, in turn, created a far worse environmental problem, subsequently leading to the Basel Convention.

Examples include lead-acid batteries or electronic circuit boards. Another commonly used treatment is [[cement]]-based [[solidification and stabilization]]. [[Cement kiln]]s are used because they can treat a range of hazardous wastes by improving physical characteristics and decreasing the toxicity and transmission of contaminants. A hazardous waste may also be \"destroyed\" by [[incinerating]] it at a high temperature; flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. Some hazardous waste types may be eliminated using [[pyrolysis]] in a high temperature electrical arc, in inert conditions to avoid combustion. This treatment method may be preferable to high temperature incineration in some circumstances such as in the destruction of concentrated organic waste types, including PCBs, pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants.

After that, the cutting crews would start to dismantle the hull, stern-first; large sections were cut off the ship and moved via cranes and rigging taken from previously-scrapped ships.

However, Greenpeace reports that neither vessel exporter nor breaking countries are adhering to its policies. The organisation recommends that all parties enforce the Basel Convention in full, and hold those who break it liable.<ref name=\":3\" /> Furthermore, the decision to scrap a ship is often made in international waters, where the convention has no jurisdiction.\n\nThe Hong Kong Convention is a compromise. It allows ships to be exported for recycling, as long as various stipulations are met: All water-craft must have an inventory and every shipyard needs to publish a recycling plan to protect the environment. The Hong Kong Convention was adopted in 2009 but with few countries signing the agreement.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nIn March 2012 the [[European Commission]] proposed tougher regulations to ensure all parties take responsibility. Under these rules, if a vessel has a European flag, it must be disposed of in a shipyard on an EU \"green list.\"  The facilities would have to show that they are compliant, and it would be regulated internationally in order to bypass corrupt local authorities.

The [[duel]] was fought on February 24, 1852, and ended with Collins receiving a wound to his right arm.<ref name=\"davis\"/> Both men were arrested and charged with assault with intent to murder. In the two months that he was in jail, Bean received many gifts of flowers, food, wine and cigars from women in San Diego. Hidden in the final gifts he received while incarcerated were knives that were encased in [[tamale]]s. Bean used the knives to dig through the cell wall and escaped on April 17, 1852. He then fled to [[San Gabriel, California]], where he became a bartender in his brother Joshua's \"Headquarters Saloon\". After Joshua was murdered in November 1852, Bean inherited the saloon.<ref name=\"davis\"/> In 1854 Bean courted a young woman who was subsequently kidnapped and forced to marry a Mexican officer. Bean challenged the groom to a duel and killed him. Six of the dead man's friends put Bean on a horse and tied a [[Hangman's knot|noose]] around his neck, leaving him to hang when the horse moved. When he was hanged, the rope stretched and Bean was able to stay alive.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|title=Judge Roy Bean dies - Mar 16, 1903 - HISTORY.com|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/judge-roy-bean-dies|website=HISTORY.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref> The bride, who had been hiding behind a tree, cut the rope, freeing him and saving his life.

They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the [[Renaissance]] and in the nineteenth century. Such books are essentially [[Scrapbooking|scrapbook]]s filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts. Each one is unique to its creator's particular interests but they almost always include passages found in other texts, sometimes accompanied by the compiler's responses. They became significant in [[Early Modern Europe]].\n\n\"Commonplace\" is a [[Calque|translation]] of the [[Latin]] term ''locus communis'' (from Greek ''t\u00f3pos koin\u00f3s'', see [[literary topos]]) which means \"a general or common topic\", such as a statement of proverbial wisdom. In this original sense, commonplace books were collections of such sayings, such as [[John Milton]]'s example. Scholars now understand them to include manuscripts in which an individual collects material which have a common theme, such as ethics, or exploring several themes in one volume. Commonplace books are private collections of information, but they are not [[Diary|diaries]] or\n[[Travel journal#Travelogues|travelogues]].\n\nIn 1685 the \nEnglish Enlightenment philosopher [[John Locke]] wrote a treatise in French on commonplace books, translated into English in 1706 as ''A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books'', \"in which techniques for entering proverbs, quotations, ideas, speeches were formulated. Locke gave specific advice on how to arrange material by subject and category, using such key topics as love, politics, or religion. Commonplace books, it must be stressed, are not journals, which are chronological and introspective.\"<ref>[[Nicholas A.

Commonplace books were used by scientists and other thinkers in the same way that a database might now be used: [[Carl Linnaeus]], for instance, used commonplacing techniques to invent and arrange the nomenclature of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (which is the basis for the system used by scientists today).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=M.

The practice of keeping a journal such as this was particularly recommended by Stoics such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], whose own work [[Meditations]] (2nd century AD) was originally a private record of thoughts and quotations. The [[The Pillow Book|Pillow Book]] of [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon|Sei Shonagon]], a courtier in tenth and eleventh century Japan is likewise a private book of anecdote and poetry, daily thoughts and lists. However, none of these includes the wider range of sources usually associated with commonplace books. A number of renaissance scholars kept something resembling a commonplace book - for example [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who described his notebook exactly as a commonplace book is structured: \"A collection without order, drawn from many papers, which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they treat.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/turning-the-pages/?id=cb4c06b9-02f4-49af-80ce-540836464a46&type=book|title=Turning the Pages\u2122 - British Library|website=bl.uk|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n\n===Zibaldone===\n[[File:Zibaldone di pensieri VI.djvu|thumb|right|''Zibaldone di pensieri'', written by the Italian [[poet]] [[Giacomo Leopardi]]]]\nDuring the course of the fifteenth century, the Italian peninsula was the site of a development of two new forms of book production: the deluxe registry book and the [[zibaldone]] (or hodgepodge book). What differentiated these two forms was their language of composition: a vernacular.<ref>Armando Petrucci, ''Writers and Readers in Medieval Italy'', trans. Charles M. Radding (New Haven: Yale UP: 1995), 185.</ref> [[Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai|Giovanni Rucellai]], the compiler of one of the most sophisticated examples of the genre, defined it as a \"salad of many herbs.\"<ref>Dale V. Kent, ''Cosimo de' Medici and the Florentine Renaissance: The Patron's Oeuvre'' (New Haven and London: Yale UP, 2000), p. 69</ref>\n\nZibaldone were always paper [[Codex|codices]] of small or medium format \u2013 never the large desk copies of registry books or other display texts. They also lacked the lining and extensive ornamentation of other deluxe copies. Rather than miniatures, zibaldone often incorporate the author's sketches. Zibaldone were in cursive scripts (first [[chancery minuscule]] and later [[mercantile minuscule]]) and contained what [[palaeographer]] [[Armando Petrucci]] describes as \"an astonishing variety of poetic and prose texts.\"<ref>Petrucci, 187.</ref> Devotional, technical, documentary and literary texts appear side-by-side in no discernible order. The juxtaposition of taxes paid, currency exchange rates, medicinal remedies, recipes and favourite quotations from [[Augustine]] and [[Virgil]] portrays a developing secular, literate culture.<ref>An example is the [http://www.metafilter.com/46800/Commonplace-books Zibaldone da Canal] merchant's manual held at the Beinecke Library, which dates from 1312 and contains hand-drawn diagrams of Venetian ships and descriptions of Venice's merchant culture.</ref> By far the most popular of literary selections were the works of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]: the \"Three Crowns\" of the Florentine vernacular traditions.<ref>Kent, pg. 81.</ref> These collections have been used by modern scholars as a source for interpreting how merchants and artisans interacted with the literature and visual arts of the Florentine Renaissance.\n\nThe best-known zibaldone is [[Giacomo Leopardi]]'s nineteenth-century ''[[Zibaldone di pensieri]]'', however it significantly departs from the early modern genre of commonplace books and is rather comparable to the intellectual diary which was practiced, for example, by Lichtenberg, Joubert, Coleridge, Valery, among others.\n\n===English===\n\nBy the seventeenth century, commonplacing had become a recognized practice that was formally taught to college students in such institutions as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Victoria|title=Recent Studies in Commonplace Books.|journal=English Literary Renaissance|date=2013|volume=43|issue=1|page=154|doi=10.1111/1475-6757.12005}}</ref> [[John Locke]] appended his indexing scheme for commonplace books to a printing of his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.<ref>[http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/04/the-glass-box-and-the-commonplace-book.html \"The Glass Box And The Commonplace Book\"]</ref>  The commonplace tradition in which [[Francis Bacon]] and [[John Milton]] were educated had its roots in the pedagogy of classical [[rhetoric]], and \u201ccommonplacing\u201d persisted as a popular study technique until the early twentieth century. Commonplace books were used by many key thinkers of [[the Enlightenment]], with authors like the philosopher and theologian [[William Paley]] using them to write books.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=M.

Some, such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Mark Twain]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] kept messy reading notes that were intermixed with other quite various material; others, such as [[Thomas Hardy]], followed a more formal reading-notes method that mirrored the original [[Renaissance]] practice more closely.  The older, \"clearinghouse\" function of the commonplace book, to condense and centralize useful and even \"model\" ideas and expressions, became less popular over time.\n\n=== Examples in manuscript ===\n\n*[[Zibaldone da Canal]] merchant's commonplace book (New Haven, CT, Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, MS 327)\n*[[Robert Reynes of Acle]], Norfolk (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Tanner 407).\n*Richard Hill, a London grocer (Oxford, Balliol College, MS 354).\n*Glastonbury Miscellany.

The practice of keeping a journal such as this was particularly recommended by Stoics such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], whose own work [[Meditations]] (2nd century AD) was originally a private record of thoughts and quotations. The [[The Pillow Book|Pillow Book]] of [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon|Sei Shonagon]], a courtier in tenth and eleventh century Japan is likewise a private book of anecdote and poetry, daily thoughts and lists. However, none of these includes the wider range of sources usually associated with commonplace books. A number of renaissance scholars kept something resembling a commonplace book - for example [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who described his notebook exactly as a commonplace book is structured: \"A collection without order, drawn from many papers, which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they treat.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/turning-the-pages/?id=cb4c06b9-02f4-49af-80ce-540836464a46&type=book|title=Turning the Pages\u2122 - British Library|website=www.bl.uk|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n\n===Zibaldone===\n[[File:Zibaldone di pensieri VI.djvu|thumb|right|''Zibaldone di pensieri'', written by the Italian [[poet]] [[Giacomo Leopardi]]]]\nDuring the course of the fifteenth century, the Italian peninsula was the site of a development of two new forms of book production: the deluxe registry book and the [[zibaldone]] (or hodgepodge book). What differentiated these two forms was their language of composition: a vernacular.<ref>Armando Petrucci, ''Writers and Readers in Medieval Italy'', trans. Charles M.

Kent, ''Cosimo de' Medici and the Florentine Renaissance: The Patron's Oeuvre'' (New Haven and London: Yale UP, 2000), p. 69</ref>\n\nZibaldone were always paper [[ Codex |codices]] of small or medium format \u2013 never the large desk copies of registry books or other display texts. They also lacked the lining and extensive ornamentation of other deluxe copies. Rather than miniatures, zibaldone often incorporate the author's sketches. Zibaldone were in cursive scripts (first [[chancery minuscule]] and later [[mercantile minuscule]]) and contained what [[palaeographer]] [[Armando Petrucci]] describes as \"an astonishing variety of poetic and prose texts.\"<ref>Petrucci, 187.</ref> Devotional, technical, documentary and literary texts appear side-by-side in no discernible order. The juxtaposition of taxes paid, currency exchange rates, medicinal remedies, recipes and favourite quotations from [[Augustine]] and [[Virgil]] portrays a developing secular, literate culture.<ref>An example is the [http://www.metafilter.com/46800/Commonplace-books Zibaldone da Canal] merchant's manual held at the Beinecke Library, which dates from 1312 and contains hand-drawn diagrams of Venetian ships and descriptions of Venice's merchant culture.</ref> By far the most popular of literary selections were the works of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]: the \"Three Crowns\" of the Florentine vernacular traditions.<ref>Kent, pg. 81.</ref> These collections have been used by modern scholars as a source for interpreting how merchants and artisans interacted with the literature and visual arts of the Florentine Renaissance.\n\nThe best-known zibaldone is [[Giacomo Leopardi]]'s nineteenth-century ''[[Zibaldone di pensieri]]'', however it significantly departs from the early modern genre of commonplace books and is rather comparable to the intellectual diary which was practiced, for example, by Lichtenberg, Joubert, Coleridge, Valery, among others.\n\n===English===\n\nBy the seventeenth century, commonplacing had become a recognized practice that was formally taught to college students in such institutions as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Victoria|title=Recent Studies in Commonplace Books.|journal=English Literary Renaissance|date=2013|volume=43|issue=1|page=154|doi=10.1111/1475-6757.12005}}</ref> [[John Locke]] appended his indexing scheme for commonplace books to a printing of his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.<ref>[http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/04/the-glass-box-and-the-commonplace-book.html \"The Glass Box And The Commonplace Book\"]</ref>  The commonplace tradition in which [[Francis Bacon]] and [[John Milton]] were educated had its roots in the pedagogy of classical [[rhetoric]], and \u201ccommonplacing\u201d persisted as a popular study technique until the early twentieth century.

Some, such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Mark Twain]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] kept messy reading notes that were intermixed with other quite various material; others, such as [[Thomas Hardy]], followed a more formal reading-notes method that mirrored the original [[Renaissance]] practice more closely.  The older, \"clearinghouse\" function of the commonplace book, to condense and centralize useful and even \"model\" ideas and expressions, became less popular over time.\n\n=== Examples in manuscript ===\n\n*[[Zibaldone da Canal]] merchant's commonplace book (New Haven, CT, Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, MS 327)\n*[[Robert Reynes of Acle]], Norfolk (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Tanner 407)].\n*Richard Hill, a London grocer (Oxford, Balliol College, MS 354).\n*Glastonbury Miscellany.

The term ''[[Shaitan]]'' is more prevalent, although Iblis is sometimes referred to as Shaitan; the terms are not interchangeable.

All the angels bowed down, but Iblis refused to do so. He argued that since he himself was created from fire, he is superior to humans, made from Clay-mud, and that he should not prostrate himself before Adam.<ref>{{cite quran|7|12|s=ns}}</ref> As punishment for his haughtiness, God banished Iblis from heaven and condemned him to hell. Later, Iblis made a request for the ability to try to mislead Adam and his descendants. God granted his request but also warned him that he will have no power over God's servants.<ref>{{cite quran|17|65|s=ns|q=\"As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:\" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs.}}</ref>\n\n===Sufism===\n[[Sufism]] developed another perspective of Iblis' refusal by regarding [[Muhammed in Islam|Muhammed]] and Iblis as the two true [[monotheism|monotheists]]. Therefore, some Sufis hold, Iblis refused to bow to Adam because he was devoted to God alone and refused to bow to anyone else. By weakening the evil in the Satanic figure, [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] is also degraded, that corresponds with the [[Sufi cosmology]] of [[Sufi metaphysics#Wa\u1e25dat al-Wuj\u016bd (Unity of Existence)|unity of existence]] rejecting dualistic tendencies. The belief in dualism or that ''evil'' is caused by something else than God, even if only by one's own will, is regarded as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' by some Sufis.<ref name=\"Awn, page 104\">Awn, page 104</ref> For Iblis' preference to be damned to hell, than prostrating himself before someone else other than the \"Beloved\" (here referring to God), Iblis also became an example for [[unrequited love]].\n\nA famous narration about an encounter between [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and Iblis  on the slopes of [[Mount Sinai|Sinai]], told by [[Mansur al-Hallaj]], [[Ruzbihan Baqli]]<ref name=\"Awn, page 104\"/> and [[Ghazzali]], emphasizes the nobility of Iblis. Accordingly, Moses asks Iblis why he refused God's order. Iblis replied that the command was actually a test.

Tabari argued for an angelic origin of Iblis in his  [[Tafsir al-Tabari|tafsir]]: <blockquote>\"The reason people held this opinion [that Iblis was not an angel] is that God stated in His Book that He created Iblis from the fire of the Samum (15:27) and from smokeless fire (55:15), but did not state  that He created the angels from any like of that. And God states he was of the jinn, so they said that it is not possible that he should be related to that which God does not relate him to; they said that Iblis had progeny and offspring, but the angels do not procreate or have children.\n\n(. .)\n\nBut these reasons only bespeak the weakness of these people's knowledge, for there is nothing objectionable in that God should have created the categories of His angels from all kinds of things that He had created: He created some of them from light, some of them from fire, and some of them from what He willed apart from that. There is thus nothing in God's omitting to state what He created His angels from, and in His stating what He created Iblis from, which necessarily implies that Iblis is outside of the meaning of [angel], for it is possible that He created a category of His angels, among whom was Iblis, from fire, and even that Iblis was unique in that He created him, and no other angels of His, from the fire of the Samum.\nLikewise, he cannot be excluded from being an angel by fact that he had progeny or offspring, because passion and lust, from which the other angels were free, was compounded in him when God willed disobedience in him. As for God's statement that he was &lt;one of the jinn>, it is not to be rejected that everything which hides itself (ijtanna) from the sight is a 'jinn', . . . and Iblis and the angels should then be among them, because they hide themselves from the eyes of mankind.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, the Quranic exegete [[Ibn Kathir]], preferred to regard Iblis as a genie, an opinion shared by scholars such as Hasan of Basra, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Mahmoud M.|last=Ayoub|title=The Qur'an and Its Interpreters, Volume 1, Band 1|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|location=Albany, New York|date=1984|ISBN=978-0-791-49546-9|page=86}}</ref> [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> [[Ibn Taimiyya]] and [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Al-Munajjid]], stating in his tafsir:\n<blockquote>\n\"When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying- and pretending - to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command, (. . .)\n\n(So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn;) meaning, his original nature betrayed him. He had been created from smokeless fire, whereas the angels had been created from light, (. . .)\n\nWhen matters crucial every vessel leaks that which to contains and is betrayed by its true nature. Iblis used to do, what the angels did and resembled them in their devotion and worship, so he was included when they were addressed, but he disobeyed and went what he was told to do.

At the same time, he was the closest to the [[Throne of God]]. God gave him authority over the lower heavens and the earth. Iblis is also considered as the leader of those angels who battled the earthly jinn. Therefore, Iblis and his army drove the jinn to the edge of the world, [[Mount Qaf]]. Knowing about the corruption of the former earthen inhabitants, Iblis protested, when he was instructed to prostrate himself before the new earthen inhabitant, that is Adam.

Both Western academics and Islamic scholars debated the essence of Iblis.\n\n=== In academic discourse ===\nIn most Surahs, it seems to be implied that Iblis is one of the angels. The motif of prostrating angels with one exception among them, already appeared in early Christian writings and apocalyptic literature.

Accordingly, Muhammad would have demonized the jinn in later Surahs, making Iblis a jinni, whereas he had been an angel before.<ref>Jacques Waardenburg Islam: Historical, Social, and Political Perspectives Walter de Gruyter, 2008 {{ISBN|978-3-110-20094-2}} p. 40</ref> Otherwise, the theory that the essence of angels differs from that of Satan and his hosts, might originated in the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]] and be introduced by an Christian informant to the early Muslims, and not introduced by Muhammad.<ref>Jung, L.

Further, Iblis is not described as created from fire, when the Quran identifies Iblis with the jinn.<ref name=\"Eichler, Paul Arno p. 60\"/> Since the Quran itself does not speak of angels as created from another sources than fire, Iblis might also have represented an angel in the sense of [[Ancient Near East]]ern traditions, such as a [[Seraph]].<ref name=\"Dammen McAuliffe 2003 46\"/> Some scholars objected that the term ''jinni'' does not necessarily exclude Iblis from the angels, since it has been sugggsted that in [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]], the term denoted any type of invisible creature.<ref>{{cite book|first=Amira|last=El-Zein|title=Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|location=Syracuse, New York|date=2009|ISBN=978-0815635147|page=34}}</ref>\n\nBut other scholars argue, that Islam nevertheless distinguishes between angels and other kinds of supernatural creatures. Angels would lack the ability to disobey, and taking their constant loyalty as characteristical for the Islamic angels. Further, since the Quran refers to Iblis' progeny, [[List of Islamic studies scholars|Islamic study scholar]] [[Fritz Meier]] also insists, that the Islamic Iblis can not be held as an angel, since angels have no progeny by definition.<ref>N\u00fcnlist, page 54</ref> Otherwise [[Walther Eickmann]] argued that the ''progeny of Iblis'' does not correspond with \"progeny\" in a literal sense, but just refers to the cohorts of Iblis.<ref>{{cite book|first=Walther|last=Eickmann|title=Die Angelologie und D\u00e4monologie des Korans im Vergleich zu der Engel- und Geisterlehre der Heiligen Schrift|publisher=Eger|location=New York City|date=1908|page=27|language=German}}</ref> On another place in the Quran, the progeny of Iblis are said to be created, therefore they can not be literal progeny.<ref>Eichler, Paul Arno, 1889- ''Die Dschinn, Teufel und Engel in Koran'' p. 59</ref> Regarding the doctrine of infallible angels, one might argue that the motif of fallen angels is nevertheless not absent within Islamic traditions and are therefore, angels are not necessarily always obedient. Although Iblis is described as an infidel ([[kafir]]) in the Quran, he did not necessary [[Sin in Islam|sin]], since in early Islamic period, supernatural creatures were not expected to understand sin or expiate it. Therefore, Iblis would have been created as a rebellious angel.<ref>Basharin, pages 119\u2013138</ref>\n\n=== Among Muslim scholars ===\nAlthough the Quran seems to be clear about Iblis' identification with the jinn in the Quran, scholars in favor for Iblis' angelic origin argue, that the term ''jinni'' with the [[suffix]] ''i'' refers to guardians of ''[[jannah]]'', a sub-category of \"fiery angels\". Although angels in Islam are commonly thought to be created from light, angels, or at least the fiercer among them, are also identified as created from fire. Reason for that might be the phonetical similarity between fire (''nar'') and light (nur) in Islam. Sometimes the term ''nar'' is better understood as ''hot light of the sun'' instead of fire, contrasted by ''nur'' referring to ''cold light of the moon''.<ref>Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02be\u0101n'' Volume 5 Georgetown University, Washington DC p. 118</ref> On the other hand, scholars arguing that the term refers to jinn, and not a category of angels,  tried to explain his stay among the angels. According to a narrative provided by [[Ibn Kathir]], Iblis was once an ordinary jinn on earth, but, due to his piety and constant worship, elevated among the angels. He lived there for thousands of years, until his non-angelic origin was forgotten and only God remembered Iblis' true identity. When God commanded the angels, Iblis, due to his rank among the angels included, to prostrate himself before Adam, Iblis revealed his true nature. By his refusal his true nature betrayed him, leading to his downfall.<ref>{{cite book|first=Muhammad|last=Saed Abdul-Rahman|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 1 (Part 1): Al-Fatihah 1 to Al-Baqarah 141 2nd Edition|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|location=London, England|date=2013|ISBN=978-1-861-79826-8|page=136}}</ref> Other scholars, such as [[Hasan of Basra]] and  [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], do not provide an explanation for his abode among the angels, by extension of a special narrative. Instead they argue, Iblis', depicted as the first of jinn, and not as one of many jinn, stay in heaven is self-explanatory, because every creature is created in heaven first. Here, although created in heaven, Iblis is not regarded as an angel, but the equivalent father of the jinn, compared to what Adam is to humanity. Iblis, as the father of the jinn, was cast out of heaven due to his own sin, just as Adam was banished after his corresponding transgression of God's order not to eat from the [[Forbidden fruit|Forbidden Tree]].\n\nThose scholars, who argue against Iblis' angelic origin also refer to his progeny, since angels do not procreate in Islam. [[Tabari]] who defended Iblis' angelic depiction, argues that Iblis did not procreated until he lost his angelic state and became a devil. Therefore, as an angel, Iblis did not procreated. According to some Islamic traditions, Iblis is an asexual entity, just like other angels or a hermaphrodite creature, whose children split from himself, as devils (''[[Shayatin|\u0161ay\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn]]'') do, but not the jinn. Another central argument to determine Iblis essence discusses Iblis' ability to disobey. As angels are seen as servants of God, Iblis' should not be able to disobey. This argument had been essential for the advocates who reject the identification with Iblis with one of the angels. As a jinni however, Iblis could be given the ability to choose to obey or disobey.<ref>El-Zein, page 46</ref> Scholars who regard Iblis as an angel, do not see Iblis' refusal as an act of sin, to which angels are incappable of, but as a sign of predestination. Therefore, Iblis has been created, differing from his fellow angels, from fire, thus God installed a rebellious nature in him, to endow him with the task to seduce humans, comparable as other angels are endowed with tasks corresponding to their own nature<ref name=\"Awn, page 97\">Awn, page 97</ref> and created for this purpose from fire differing from the other angels.<ref name=\"Awn, page 97\"/> Thus, Iblis is seen as an instrument of God, not as an entity who freely choose to disobey.<ref>Schimmel, page 212</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Ludo|last=Abicht|title=Islam & Europe: Challenges and Opportunities|publisher=[[Leuven University Press]]|location=Leuven, Belgium|date=2008|ISBN=978-9-058-67672-6|page=128}}</ref><ref>Awn, page 86</ref> Other scholars gave explanations why an angel should choose to disobey and explain that Iblis was, as the teacher of angels, more knowledgeable than the others.<ref>Awn, page 50</ref><ref>Abicht, page 128</ref> Angels might be distinguished by their degree of obedience.

The term ''[[Shaitan]]'' is more prevalent, although Iblis is sometimes referred to as Shaitan; the terms are not interchangeable. The different fragments of Iblis' story are scattered across the Quran. In the aggregate, the story can be summarized as follows:<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter J.|last=Awn|title=Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Ibl\u012bs in Sufi Psychology|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=[[Leiden]]|date=1983|ISBN=978-9004069060|page=18}}</ref>\n\nWhen God created Adam, He ordered all the [[angels in Islam|angels]] to bow before the new creation. All the angels bowed down, but Iblis refused to do so. He argued that since he himself was created from fire, he is superior to humans, made from Clay-mud, and that he should not prostrate himself before Adam.<ref>{{cite quran|7|12|s=ns}}</ref> As punishment for his haughtiness, God banished Iblis from heaven and condemned him to hell. Later, Iblis made a request for the ability to try to mislead Adam and his descendants.

Therefore, some Sufis hold, Iblis refused to bow to Adam because he was devoted to God alone and refused to bow to anyone else. By weakening the evil in the Satanic figure, [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] is also degraded, that corresponds with the [[Sufi cosmology]] of [[Sufi metaphysics#Wa\u1e25dat al-Wuj\u016bd (Unity of Existence)|unity of existence]] rejecting dualistic tendencies. The belief in dualism or that ''evil'' is caused by something else than God, even if only by one's own will, is regarded as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' by some Sufis.<ref name=\"Awn, page 104\">Awn, page 104</ref> For Iblis' preference to be damned to hell, than prostrating himself before someone else other than the \"Beloved\" (here referring to God), Iblis also became an example for [[unrequited love]].\n\nA famous narration about an encounter between [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and Iblis  on the slopes of [[Mount Sinai|Sinai]], told by [[Mansur al-Hallaj]], [[Ruzbihan Baqli]]<ref name=\"Awn, page 104\"/> and [[Ghazzali]], emphasizes the nobility of Iblis. Accordingly, Moses asks Iblis why he refused God's order. Iblis replied that the command was actually a test. Then Moses replied, obviously Iblis was punished by being turned from an angel to a [[shaitan|devil]]. Iblis responds, his form is just temporary and his love towards God remains the same.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Gramlich|title=Der eine Gott: Grundz\u00fcge der Mystik des islamischen Monotheismus|publisher=[[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]]|location=Weisbaden, Germany|date=1998|ISBN=978-3-447-04025-9|page=44|language=German}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first1=Joseph E.

Edmund Teuma ''THE NATURE OF \"IBLI$H IN THE QUR'AN AS INTERPRETED BY THE COMMENTATORS'' 1980 University of Malta. Faculty of Theology</ref> regard him as an angel. Tabari argued for an angelic origin of Iblis in his  [[Tafsir al-Tabari|tafsir]]: <blockquote>\"The reason people held this opinion [that Iblis was not an angel] is that God stated in His Book that He created Iblis from the fire of the Samum (15:27) and from smokeless fire (55:15), but did not state  that He created the angels from any like of that.

There is thus nothing in God's omitting to state what He created His angels from, and in His stating what He created Iblis from, which necessarily implies that Iblis is outside of the meaning of [angel], for it is possible that He created a category of His angels, among whom was Iblis, from fire, and even that Iblis was unique in that He created him, and no other angels of His, from the fire of the Samum.\nLikewise, he cannot be excluded from being an angel by fact that he had progeny or offspring, because passion and lust, from which the other angels were free, was compounded in him when God willed disobedience in him. As for God's statement that he was &lt;one of the jinn>, it is not to be rejected that everything which hides itself (ijtanna) from the sight is a 'jinn', . . . and Iblis and the angels should then be among them, because they hide themselves from the eyes of mankind.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, the Quranic exegete [[Ibn Kathir]], preferred to regard Iblis as a genie, an opinion shared by scholars such as Hasan of Basra, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Mahmoud M.|last=Ayoub|title=The Qur'an and Its Interpreters, Volume 1, Band 1|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|location=Albany, New York|date=1984|ISBN=978-0-791-49546-9|page=86}}</ref> [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> [[Ibn Taimiyya]] and [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Al-Munajjid]], stating in his tafsir:\n<blockquote>\n\"When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command.

Knowing about the corruption of the former earthen inhabitants, Iblis protested, when he was instructed to prostrate himself before the new earthen inhabitant, that is Adam.

Both Western academics and Islamic scholars debated the essence of Iblis.\n\n=== In academic discourse ===\nIn most Surahs, it seems to be implied that Iblis is one of the angels. The motif of prostrating angels with one exception among them, already appeared in early Christian writings and apocalyptic literature.

Angels would lack the ability to disobey, and taking their constant loyalty as characteristical for the Islamic angels. Further, since the Quran refers to Iblis' progeny, [[List of Islamic studies scholars|Islamic study scholar]] [[Fritz Meier]] also insists, that the Islamic Iblis can not be held as an angel, since angels have no progeny by definition.<ref>N\u00fcnlist, page 54</ref> Otherwise [[Walther Eickmann]] argued that the ''progeny of Iblis'' does not correspond with \"progeny\" in a literal sense, but just refers to the cohorts of Iblis.<ref>{{cite book|first=Walther|last=Eickmann|title=Die Angelologie und D\u00e4monologie des Korans im Vergleich zu der Engel- und Geisterlehre der Heiligen Schrift|publisher=Eger|location=New York City|date=1908|page=27|language=German}}</ref> On another place in the Quran, the progeny of Iblis are said to be created, therefore they can not be literal progeny.<ref>Eichler, Paul Arno, 1889- ''Die Dschinn, Teufel und Engel in Koran'' p. 59</ref> Regarding the doctrine of infallable angels, one might argue that the motif of fallen angels is nevertheless not absent within Islamic traditions and are therefore, angels are not necessarily always obedient. Although Iblis is described as an infidel ([[kafir]]) in the Quran, he did not necessary [[Sin in Islam|sin]], since in early Islamic period, supernatural creatures were not expected to understand sin or expiate it. Therefore, Iblis would have been created as a rebellious angel.<ref>Basharin, pages 119\u2013138</ref>\n\n=== Among Muslim scholars ===\nAlthough the Quran seems to be clear about Iblis' identification with the jinn in the Quran, scholars in favor for Iblis' angelic origin argue, that the term ''jinni'' with the [[suffix]] ''i'' refers to guardians of ''[[jannah]]'', a sub-category of \"fiery angels\". Although angels in Islam are commonly thought to be created from light, angels, or at least the fiercer among them, are also identified as created from fire. Reason for that might be the phonetical similarity between fire (''nar'') and light (nur) in Islam. Sometimes the term ''nar'' is better understood as ''hot light of the sun'' instead of fire, contrasted by ''nur'' referring to ''cold light of the moon''.<ref>Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02be\u0101n'' Volume 5 Georgetown University, Washington DC p. 118</ref> On the other hand, scholars arguing that the term refers to jinn, and not a category of angels,  tried to explain his stay among the angels. According to a narrative provided by [[Ibn Kathir]], Iblis was once an ordinary jinn on earth, but, due to his piety and constant worship, elevated among the angels. He lived there for thousands of years, until his non-angelic origin was forgotten and only God remembered Iblis' true identity. When God commanded the angels, Iblis, due to his rank among the angels included, to prostrate himself before Adam, Iblis revealed his true nature. By his refusal his true nature betrayed him, leading to his downfall.<ref>{{cite book|first=Muhammad|last=Saed Abdul-Rahman|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 1 (Part 1): Al-Fatihah 1 to Al-Baqarah 141 2nd Edition|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|location=London, England|date=2013|ISBN=978-1-861-79826-8|page=136}}</ref> Other scholars, such as [[Hasan of Basra]] and  [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], do not provide an explanation for his abode among the angels, by extension of a special narrative. Instead they argue, Iblis', depicted as the first of jinn, and not as one of many jinn, stay in heaven is self-explanatory, because every creature is created in heaven first. Here, although created in heaven, Iblis is not regarded as an angel, but the equivalent father of the jinn, compared to what Adam is to humanity. Iblis, as the father of the jinn, was cast out of heaven due to his own sin, just as Adam was banished after his corresponding transgression of God's order not to eat from the [[Forbidden fruit|Forbidden Tree]].\n\nThose scholars, who argue against Iblis' angelic origin also refer to his progeny, since angels do not procreate in Islam. [[Tabari]] who defended Iblis' angelic depiction, argues that Iblis did not procreated until he lost his angelic state and became a devil. Therefore, as an angel, Iblis did not procreated. According to some Islamic traditions, Iblis is an asexual entity, just like other angels or a hermaphrodite creature, whose children split from himself, as devils (''[[Shayatin|\u0161ay\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn]]'') do, but not the jinn. Another central argument to determine Iblis essence discusses Iblis' ability to disobey. As angels are seen as servants of God, Iblis' should not be able to disobey. This arguement had been essential for the advocates who reject the identification with Iblis with one of the angels. As a jinni however, Iblis could be given the ability to choose to obey or disobey.<ref>El-Zein, page 46</ref> Scholars who regard Iblis as an angel, do not see Iblis' refusal as an act of sin, to which angels are incappable of, but as a sign of predestination. Therefore, Iblis has been created, differing from his fellow angels, from fire, thus God installed a rebellious nature in him, to endow him with the task to seduce humans, comparable as other angels are endowed with tasks corresponding to their own nature<ref name=\"Awn, page 97\">Awn, page 97</ref> and created for this purpose from fire differing from the other angels.<ref name=\"Awn, page 97\"/> Thus, Iblis is seen as an instrument of God, not as an entity who freely choose to disobey.<ref>Schimmel, page 212</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Ludo|last=Abicht|title=Islam & Europe: Challenges and Opportunities|publisher=[[Leuven University Press]]|location=Leuven, Belgium|date=2008|ISBN=978-9-058-67672-6|page=128}}</ref><ref>Awn, page 86</ref> Other scholars gave explanations why an angel should choose to disobey and explain that Iblis was, as the teacher of angels, more knowledgeable than the others.<ref>Awn, page 50</ref><ref>Abicht, page 128</ref> Angels might be distinguished by their degree of obedience.

Mobile social media are a useful application of [[mobile marketing]] because the creation, exchange, and circulation of user-generated content can assist companies with marketing research, communication, and relationship development.<ref name='mobileKaplan'>{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=Andreas M. |title=If you love something, let it go mobile: Mobile marketing and mobile social media 4x4 |journal=Business Horizons |date=March\u2013April 2012 |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=129\u2013139 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2011.10.009}}</ref> Mobile social media differ from others because they incorporate the current location of the user (location-sensitivity) or the time delay between sending and receiving messages (time-sensitivity). According to [[Andreas Kaplan]], mobile social media applications can be differentiated among four types:<ref name='mobileKaplan' />\n\n# ''Space-timers'' (location and time sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance mostly for one specific location at one specific point in time (e.g. [[Facebook Places]] [[WhatsApp]]; [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]])\n# ''Space-locators'' (only location sensitive): Exchange of messages, with relevance for one specific location, which is tagged to a certain place and read later by others (e.g. [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]]; [[Qype]], [[Tumblr]], [[Fishbrain]])\n# ''Quick-timers'' (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media [[mobile apps]] to increase immediacy (e.g. posting [[Twitter]] messages or [[Facebook]] status updates)\n# ''Slow-timers'' (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to [[mobile devices]] (e.g. watching a [[YouTube]] video or reading/editing a [[Wikipedia]] article)\n\n==Elements and function==\n\n===Viral content===\nSome social media sites have potential for content posted there to spread ''[[Viral phenomenon|virally]]'' over social networks. The term is an analogy to the concept of [[viral infections]], which can spread rapidly from person to person. In a social media context, content or websites that are \"viral\" (or which \"go viral\") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, [[magazine]]s, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}</ref> When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[retweet]]ed over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.\n\n=== Bots ===\nSocial media can enable companies to get in the form of greater market share and increased audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Castronovo|first=Cristina|date=2012|title=Social Media in Alternative Marketing Communication Model|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Development & Competitivness|volume=6|pages=117\u2013136}}</ref> [[Internet bot]]s have been developed which facilitate social media marketing.

In many ways, mainstream [[journalist]]s have maintained an authoritative voice as the storytellers of the American past. Their documentary style narratives, detailed exposes, and their positions in the present make them prime sources for public memory. Specifically, news media journalists have shaped collective memory on nearly every major national event \u2013 from the deaths of social and political figures to the progression of political hopefuls. Journalists provide elaborate descriptions of commemorative events in U.S. history and contemporary popular cultural sensations. Many Americans learn the significance of historical events and political issues through news media, as they are presented on popular news stations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pajala |first1=Mary |year=2012 |title=Television as an Archive of Memory? |journal=Critical Studies in Television |volume=5 |issue=2|pages=133\u2013145 |doi=10.7227/cst.5.2.16}}</ref> However, journalistic influence is growing less important, whereas social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Twitter]], provide a constant supply of alternative news sources for users.\n\nAs [[social networking]] becomes more popular among older and younger generations, sites such as Facebook and YouTube, gradually undermine the traditionally authoritative voices of news media. For example, American citizens contest media coverage of various social and political events as they see fit, inserting their voices into the narratives about America's past and present and shaping their own collective memories.<ref>Motti Neiger, Oren Meyers and Eyal Zandberg.

News media coverage of the incident was minimal until social media users made the story recognizable through their constant discussion of the case. Approximately one month after the fatal shooting of [[Trayvon Martin]], its online coverage by everyday Americans garnered national attention from mainstream media journalists, in turn exemplifying [[media activism]]. In some ways, the spread of this tragic event through alternative news sources parallels that of [[Emmitt Till]] \u2013 whose murder by lynching in 1955 became a national story after it was circulated in African-American and Communist newspapers.\n\n===Interpersonal relationships===\n[[File:Social media team.jpeg|thumb|Modern day teenagers interacting]]\nSocial media is used to fulfill perceived social needs, but not all needs can be fulfilled by social media.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Z. |last2=Tchernev |first2=J.

The authors sampled over 632 girls and boys from the ages of 12\u201316 from Spain in an effort to confirm their beliefs.

The authors described how neither stereotype was entirely positive, but most people viewed masculine values as more positive.\n\n===Cognition and memory===\nAccording to writer Christine Rosen in \"Virtual Friendship, and the New Narcissism,\" many social media sites encourage status-seeking.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/virtual-friendship-and-the-new-narcissism |title=Virtual Friendship and the New Narcissism |work=The New Atlantis |accessdate=2016-02-29 |author=Rosen, Christine}}</ref> According to Rosen, the practice and definition of \"friendship\" changes in virtuality. Friendship in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron.\" Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who \"recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'\"\nCritic Nicholas G.

This finding was consistent with other studies that found people with high social comparison orientation make more social comparisons once on social media.\n\nPeople compare their own lives to the lives of their friends through their friends' posts. People are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interest. Often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling.

Ambivalence refers to a user's confusion about the benefits she can get from using a social media site. Emotional exhaustion refers to the stress a user has when using a social media site. Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance.

Abbreviations have been introduced to cut down on the time it takes to respond online. The commonly known \"[[LOL]]\" has become globally recognized as the abbreviation for \"laugh out loud\" thanks to social media.\n\nAnother trend that influences the way youth communicates is (through) the use of hashtags. With the introduction of social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information. Hashtags can be used when people want to advocate for a movement, store content or tweets from a movement for future use, and allow other social media users to contribute to a discussion about a certain movement by using existing hashtags. Using hashtags as a way to advocate for something online makes it easier and more accessible for more people to acknowledge it around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saxton|first=Gregory D.|last2=Niyirora|first2=Jerome N.|last3=Guo|first3=Chao|last4=Waters|first4=Richard D.|date=Spring 2015|title=#AdvocatingForChange: The Strategic Use of Hashtags in Social Media Advocacy|journal=Advances in Social Work|volume=16|pages=154\u2013169|doi=10.18060/17952}}</ref> As hashtags such as #tbt (\"[[throwback Thursday]]\") become a part of online communication, it influenced the way in which youth share and communicate in their daily lives.

Activism and especially high-risk activism involves strong-tie relationships, hierarchies, coordination, motivation, exposing oneself to high risks, making sacrifices.<ref name=\"Gladwell 2010-10-04\"/> Gladwell discusses that social media are built around weak ties and he argues that \"social networks are effective at increasing participation \u2014 by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires\".<ref name=\"Gladwell 2010-10-04\"/> According to him \"Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice, but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice\".<ref name=\"Gladwell 2010-10-04\"/>\n\nDisputing Gladwell's theory, in the study \"Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis,\" Kwak and colleagues conducted a survey which found that people who are politically expressive on social media are also more likely to participate in offline political activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kwak|first=Nojin|last2=Lane|first2=Daniel S|last3=Weeks|first3=Brian E|last4=Kim|first4=Dam Hee|last5=Lee|first5=Slgi S|last6=Bachleda|first6=Sarah|date=April 1, 2018|title=Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=44|issue=2|pages=197\u2013221|doi=10.1093/hcr/hqx008|issn=0360-3989}}</ref>\n\n===Ownership of content===\nSocial media content is generated through social media interactions done by the users through the site. There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=Jos\u00e9 Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |accessdate=2018-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Privacy===\n[[Privacy concerns with social networking services|Privacy]] rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,<ref name=Auer2001/> by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.<ref name=Jones/> Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share, and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=May 21, 2013 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}</ref> Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.\n\nThere are arguments that \"privacy is dead\" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.\n\nAccording to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, \"1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]\" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily, and has been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media is a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=October 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref> The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it.

One German study, published in 2017, investigated a correlation between extensive use of the social networking site and narcissism; the results were published in the journal PLoS One.

As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. Many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. Some schools permit students to use [[smartphone]]s or [[tablet computer]]s in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research. Using Facebook in class allows for integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal \"[[back channel]]\"), and extend discussion outside of class time.\n\n===Censorship by governments===\n{{Main|Internet censorship}}\n[[File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg|thumb|Banner in [[Bangkok]], observed on June 30, 2014, informing the Thai public that 'like' or 'share' activity on social media may land them in jail]]\n\nSocial media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity.

How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook,\u201d the media plays a large role in shaping people's perceptions of specific social networking sites. When looking at the site [[Myspace|MySpace]], after adults started to realize how popular the sight was becoming with teens, news media became heavily concerned with teen participation and the potential dangers they faced using the site. As a result, teens avoided joining the site because of the associated risks (e.g. child predators and lack of control) and parents began to publicly denounce the site. Ultimately, the site was labeled as dangerous, and many were detracted from interacting with the site. As boyd also describes, when [[Facebook]] initially launched in 2004, it solely targeted college students and access was intentionally limited. Facebook started as a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-only social networking site before expanding to all other [[Ivy League]] schools. It then made its way to other top universities and ultimately to a wider range of schools. Because of its origins, some saw Facebook as an \u201celite\u201d social networking site. While it was very open and accepting to some, it seemed to outlaw and shun out most others who didn't fit that \u201celite\u201d categorization.

True electronic bulletin board systems arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which first came online on February 16, 1978.  Before long, most major cities had more than one BBS running on [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari Corporation|Atari]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]], and similar [[personal computer]]s. The IBM PC was introduced in 1981, and subsequent models of both Mac computers and PCs were used throughout the 1980s.  Multiple modems, followed by specialized telecommunication hardware, allowed many users to be online simultaneously. [[Compuserve]], [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] and [[AOL]] were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s.  Between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone.<ref>{{cite web\n| author       = Benj Edwards\n| title        = The Lost Civilization of Dial-Up Bulletin Board Systems\n| url          = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/\n| work         = The Atlantic\n| location     = online\n| date         = November 4, 2016\n| access-date=2018-02-05\n}}\n</ref> Message forums (a specific structure of social media) arose with the BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

Mobile social media are a useful application of [[mobile marketing]] because the creation, exchange, and circulation of user-generated content can assist companies with marketing research, communication, and relationship development.<ref name='mobileKaplan'>{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=Andreas M. |title=If you love something, let it go mobile: Mobile marketing and mobile social media 4x4 |journal=Business Horizons |date=March\u2013April 2012 |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=129\u2013139 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2011.10.009}}</ref> Mobile social media differ from others because they incorporate the current location of the user (location-sensitivity) or the time delay between sending and receiving messages (time-sensitivity). According to [[Andreas Kaplan]], mobile social media applications can be differentiated among four types:<ref name='mobileKaplan' />\n\n# ''Space-timers'' (location and time sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance mostly for one specific location at one specific point in time (e.g. [[Facebook Places]] [[WhatsApp]]; [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]])\n# ''Space-locators'' (only location sensitive): Exchange of messages, with relevance for one specific location, which is tagged to a certain place and read later by others (e.g. [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]]; [[Qype]], [[Tumblr]], [[Fishbrain]])\n# ''Quick-timers'' (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media [[mobile apps]] to increase immediacy (e.g. posting [[Twitter]] messages or [[Facebook]] status updates)\n# ''Slow-timers'' (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to [[mobile devices]] (e.g. watching a [[YouTube]] video or reading/editing a [[Wikipedia]] article)\n\n==Elements and function==\n\n===Viral content===\nSome social media sites have potential for content posted there to spread ''[[Viral phenomenon|virally]]'' over social networks. The term is an analogy to the concept of [[viral infections]], which can spread rapidly from person to person. In a social media context, content or websites that are \"viral\" (or which \"go viral\") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, [[magazine]]s, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}</ref> When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[retweet]]ed over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.\n\n=== Bots ===\nSocial media can enable companies to get in the form of greater market share and increased audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Castronovo|first=Cristina|date=2012|title=Social Media in Alternative Marketing Communication Model|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Development & Competitivness|volume=6|pages=117\u2013136}}</ref> [[Internet bot]]s have been developed which facilitate social media marketing.

At the same time, younger Americans (especially those ages 18 to 24) stand out for embracing a variety of platforms and using them frequently. Some 78% of 18 - 24-year-old youngsters use Snapchat, and a sizeable majority of these users (71%) visit the platform multiple times per day.

In many ways, mainstream [[journalist]]s have maintained an authoritative voice as the storytellers of the American past. Their documentary style narratives, detailed exposes, and their positions in the present make them prime sources for public memory. Specifically, news media journalists have shaped collective memory on nearly every major national event \u2013 from the deaths of social and political figures to the progression of political hopefuls. Journalists provide elaborate descriptions of commemorative events in U.S. history and contemporary popular cultural sensations. Many Americans learn the significance of historical events and political issues through news media, as they are presented on popular news stations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pajala |first1=Mary |year=2012 |title=Television as an Archive of Memory? |journal=Critical Studies in Television |volume=5 |issue=2|pages=133\u2013145 |doi=10.7227/cst.5.2.16}}</ref> However, journalistic influence is growing less important, whereas social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Twitter]], provide a constant supply of alternative news sources for users.\n\nAs [[social networking]] becomes more popular among older and younger generations, sites such as Facebook and YouTube, gradually undermine the traditionally authoritative voices of news media.

Approximately one month after the fatal shooting of [[Trayvon Martin]], its online coverage by everyday Americans garnered national attention from mainstream media journalists, in turn exemplifying [[media activism]].

Friendship in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron.\" Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who \"recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'\"\nCritic Nicholas G.

People are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interest. Often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling.

Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance.

The commonly known \"[[LOL]]\" has become globally recognized as the abbreviation for \"laugh out loud\" thanks to social media.\n\nAnother trend that influences the way youth communicates is (through) the use of hashtags. With the introduction of social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information. Hashtags can be used when people want to advocate for a movement, store content or tweets from a movement for future use, and allow other social media users to contribute to a discussion about a certain movement by using existing hashtags.

Activism and especially high-risk activism involves strong-tie relationships, hierarchies, coordination, motivation, exposing oneself to high risks, making sacrifices.<ref name=\"Gladwell 2010-10-04\"/> Gladwell discusses that social media are built around weak ties and he argues that \"social networks are effective at increasing participation \u2014 by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires\".<ref name=\"Gladwell 2010-10-04\"/> According to him \"Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice, but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice\".<ref name=\"Gladwell 2010-10-04\"/>\n\nDisputing Gladwell's theory, in the study \"Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis,\" Kwak and colleagues conducted a survey which found that people who are politically expressive on social media are also more likely to participate in offline political activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kwak|first=Nojin|last2=Lane|first2=Daniel S|last3=Weeks|first3=Brian E|last4=Kim|first4=Dam Hee|last5=Lee|first5=Slgi S|last6=Bachleda|first6=Sarah|date=April 1, 2018|title=Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=44|issue=2|pages=197\u2013221|doi=10.1093/hcr/hqx008|issn=0360-3989}}</ref>\n\n===Ownership of content===\nSocial media content is generated through social media interactions done by the users through the site. There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=Jos\u00e9 Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |accessdate=2018-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Privacy===\n[[Privacy concerns with social networking services|Privacy]] rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,<ref name=Auer2001/> by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.<ref name=Jones/> Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share, and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=May 21, 2013 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}</ref> Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.\n\nThere are arguments that \"privacy is dead\" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.\n\nAccording to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, \"1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]\" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily, and has been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media is a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=October 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref> The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it.

One German study, published in 2017, investigated a correlation between extensive use of the social networking site and narcissism; the results were published in the journal PLoS One.

As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. Many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. Some schools permit students to use [[smartphone]]s or [[tablet computer]]s in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research. Using Facebook in class allows for integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal \"[[back channel]]\"), and extend discussion outside of class time.\n\n===Censorship by governments===\n{{Main|Internet censorship}}\n[[File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg|thumb|Banner in [[Bangkok]], observed on June 30, 2014, informing the Thai public that 'like' or 'share' activity on social media may land them in jail]]\n\nSocial media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity.

How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook,\u201d the media plays a large role in shaping people's perceptions of specific social networking sites. When looking at the site [[Myspace|MySpace]], after adults started to realize how popular the sight was becoming with teens, news media became heavily concerned with teen participation and the potential dangers they faced using the site. As a result, teens avoided joining the site because of the associated risks (e.g. child predators and lack of control) and parents began to publicly denounce the site. Ultimately, the site was labeled as dangerous, and many were detracted from interacting with the site. As boyd also describes, when [[Facebook]] initially launched in 2004, it solely targeted college students and access was intentionally limited. Facebook started as a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-only social networking site before expanding to all other [[Ivy League]] schools. It then made its way to other top universities and ultimately to a wider range of schools. Because of its origins, some saw Facebook as an \u201celite\u201d social networking site. While it was very open and accepting to some, it seemed to outlaw and shun out most others who didn't fit that \u201celite\u201d categorization.

{"title_page": "Jewish deicide", "text_new": "{{short description|Belief that Jews bear collective guilt for the crucifixion of Jesus}}\n \n{{Antisemitism}}\n'''Jewish deicide''' is the historical fact held by [[Christians]] that the [[Jewish people]] were responsible for the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death of Jesus]]. The Romans executed Jesus, however, many Jewish Priests and Pharisees who represented the Jews as a whole demanded it, for the following reasons:\n\n1. Jesus called God \u2018his father\u2019. The Jews could never accept it. In the Old Testament we see God himself reveal Him as \u201cYahweh\u201d. But the Jews never pronounced this word due to respect and fear. Instead they used words equivalent to \u2018the creator\u2019, \u2018the one who live in heaven\u2019 etc. And now here is Jesus who call God as \u2018my father\u2019. Jews saw it as a heresy deserving death.\n\n2. Jesus claimed he is God and one with Father. The Jewish priests could never digest this as they always believed in \u2018One God\u2019. This claim was sufficient for them to kill Jesus.\n\n3. The priests and Pharisees at the time of Jesus was searching for their own comfort and treated normal citizens with contempt. Jesus criticized their stand. (Mark 12: 28\u201340) [And in his teaching he said, \u201cBeware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, who devour widows\u2019 houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u201d]\n\n4. Jesus reacted to injustice and systems set to loot the believers. (Mark 11: 15\u201319) [And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And he was teaching them and saying to them, \u201cIs it not written, \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u2019? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching. And when evening came they went out of the city. ]\n\n5. Many a times the Pharisees tried to trap Jesus and charge him for being not loyal to the Roman Empire. But Jesus did not fall into those traps. (Mark 12: 13\u201317) [And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to trap him in his talk. And they came and said to him, \u201cTeacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone\u2019s opinion. For you are not swayed by appearances,c (http://biblehub.com/esv/mark/12.htm#footnotes) but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?\u201d But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, \u201cWhy put me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.\u201d And they brought one. And he said to them, \u201cWhose likeness and inscription is this?\u201d They said to him, \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they marveled at him.]\n\n6. Then they directly challenged the authority of Jesus. ((Mark 11: 27\u201333) [And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him, and they said to him, \u201cBy what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cI will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me.\u201d And they discussed it with one another, saying, \u201cIf we say, \u2018From heaven,\u2019 he will say, \u2018Why then did you not believe him?\u2019 But shall we say, \u2018From man\u2019?\u201d\u2014they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a prophet. So they answered Jesus, \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus said to them, \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d]\n\n7. See how they were disturbed by Jesus. (John 12: 9\u201311) \u201cWhen the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.\u201d\n\n8. The Jewish priests and pharisees were planning to kill Jesus all along. (Mark 3: 1\u20136) \u201cAgain he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand. And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him. And he said to the man with the withered hand, \u201cCome here.\u201d And he said to them, \u201cIs it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?\u201d But they were silent. And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.\u201d\n\n9. Here is another background and see how they plot to kill Jesus. (John 11: 45\u201353) [Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him, but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council and said, \u201cWhat are we to do? For this man performs many signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.\u201d But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, \u201cYou know nothing at all. Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.\u201d He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.]\nSo Jesus was killed by executing the plan of the Jewish Priests and Pharisees. Involvement of general public or common Jews were almost nil as they were mostly benefited by the work of Jesus. They accepted him as a prophet and believed in him.\n\n==Source of deicide charge==\n===New Testament===\nJustification of the charge of Jewish deicide has been sought in {{bibleref2|Matthew|27:24\u201325|RSV}}:\n{{quote|So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, \"I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.\" And all the people answered, \"His blood be on us and on our children!\"}}\n\nThe verse that reads: \"And all the people answered, 'His blood be on us and on our children!{{'\"}} is also referred to as the [[blood curse]]. In an essay regarding antisemitism, biblical scholar [[Amy-Jill Levine]] argues that this passage has caused more Jewish suffering throughout history than any other in the New Testament.<ref name=\"FredriksenReinhartz2002\">{{cite book|author1=Fredriksen, Paula|author2=Reinhartz, Adele|title=Jesus, Judaism, and Christian Anti-Judaism: Reading the New Testament After the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6glHmK_rZYUC&pg=PA91|year=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22328-1|page=91}}</ref>\n\nMany also point to the Gospel of John as evidence of Christian charges of deicide. As Samuel Sandmel writes, \"John is widely regarded as either the most anti-Semitic or at least the most overtly anti-Semitic of the gospels.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=William O.|date=1979|title=Anti-Semitism in the New Testament?

In his defense Jesus said to them, \"My father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.\" For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</blockquote>Some scholars describe this passage as irrefutably referencing and implicating the Jews in deicide, although many such as scholar Robert Kysar also argue that part of the severity of this charge comes more from those who read and understand the text than the text itself. For instance, John renders the character of the ''Ioudaioi'', the Jew, as a clear antagonist and Christ-killer, although the notion that the Jew is meant to in fact represent all Jews is often disputed.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kysar, Robert.|title=Voyages with John : charting the Fourth Gospel|date=2005|publisher=Baylor University Press|isbn=1-932792-43-0|oclc=62324647}}</ref> While the New Testament is often more subtle or leveled in accusations of deicide, many scholars hold that these works cannot be held in isolation, and must be considered in the context of their interpretation by later Christian communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Louis H.|last2=Evans|first2=Craig A.|last3=Hagner|first3=Donald A.|date=January 1995|title=Anti-Semitism and Early Christianity: Issues of Polemic and Faith|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=115|issue=1|pages=115|doi=10.2307/605317|jstor=605317|issn=0003-0279}}</ref> \n\nAccording to Jeremy Cohen:\n{{quote|Even before the Gospels appeared, the apostle Paul (or, more probably, one of his disciples) portrayed the Jews as Christ's killers ...

This region is historically called [[Mountainous Shoria]]. The Shors also live in [[Khakassia]] and [[Altai Republic]]. According to 2002 [[census]], there were 13,975 Shors in Russia (12,601 in 1926, 16,042 in 1939, 14,938 in 1959, 15,950 in 1970, 15,182 in 1979 and 15,745 in 1989). The Shors speak their own [[Shor language]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Shors as a people formed as a result of a long process of intermixing between the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Ugrian]], [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyedic]] and [[Ket language|Ket]]-speaking tribes.<ref name=\":0\">Akiner (1986), p. 417</ref> Their culture and origins are similar to those of the northern [[Altay people]] and some of the ethnic groups of the [[Khakas people|Khakas]]. The region where the Shors currently reside was Turkicized under the influence of the [[Yenisei Kyrgyz|Yenisei Kirghiz]] during the medieval period. The Shors resulted from this ethnic mixing and adopted Turkic speech (the [[Shor language]]) as a result.<ref name=\":3\">Forsyth (1992), p. 23-24</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Shor tribes began to become a distinct people around the 8th and 9th centuries CE.<ref name=\":5\" /> The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] conquest of the Altai-Sayan region in the 13th century added another layer of cultural influence over the local population and their languages. The region subsequently fell under the influence of the [[Oirats]] from the late 14th century to the early 17th century. Although Mongol control of the area was nominal, many of the languages (including Shor) contains significant amounts of Mongol loanwords.<ref name=\":3\" /> The Shors were a valuable asset to the Yenisei Kirghiz and Oirats as suppliers of ironware. Their ability to smelt iron from ore was a feat that only one other indigenous Siberian people (the [[Yakuts]]) were able to do before the Russian advance to the area.<ref>Forsyth (1992), p. 56, 183</ref>\n\n=== Early modern history ===\nIn the early 17th century, the Shors and their territory were conquered by the Russians. In the 18th century, Russian settlers began to move in to the area. The Shors' niche as producers of ironware for the Oirats, [[Altai people|Altaians]], and Kirghiz was soon eroded by the Russian traders. The Russians had more advanced products to offer and this ended Shor blacksmithing.<ref name=\":5\" /> Atop of this, Russian officials subjected the Shors to pay ''[[yasak]]'' in the form of furs. This resulted in most Shors abandoning their old occupations and villages to move to nearby towns so they can make a better living as hunters. However, they lived in squalid conditions. The use of nettle-fibre or wild hemp for clothing, primitive implements, and techniques continued on towards the 20th century.<ref name=\":4\">Forsyth (1992), p. 183</ref>\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe Shors were little affected by the Russian Revolution and its civil war until the Bolsheviks took the region in 1920. In 1929, the Shor National Region was formed but was quickly dissolved in 1939.<ref>Mote (1998), p. 138. \"In the decade between 1929 and 1939, the neighboring Shors had their own national okrug...\"</ref><ref>Akiner (1986), p. 417. \"The Shor National Region was formed in 1929, but disbanded in 1939.\"</ref> The okrug (district) was disbanded because the Soviet authorities believed its existence might hinder the development of the iron and coal industries in the region.<ref>Mote (1998), p. 138</ref> These minerals became important to the state after deposits were discovered in the [[Kuznetsk Basin]] in the 1930s. This discovery led to a new wave of Russian settlers and workers to the region and began displacing the Shors.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>Forsyth (1992), p. 300-301</ref> The authorities considered the Shors to be numerically insignificant and that disenfranchising them would not be consequential to the state. The Shors greatly suffered as a result. They were driven out of their farms and villages and forced to work in the coal mines. The population of the Shors declined and the urban Shors struggled with alcoholism, drug addiction, suicide, and high lethal accident rates.<ref>Mote (1998), p. 151</ref> Traditional Shor culture began to wane . The liberalization of Soviet rule beginning in the 1980s led to a Shor cultural revival and the establishment of many cultural and linguistic institutions (like the creation of The Association of Shor People in the 1990s).<ref name=\":7\">K. David Harrison. [http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/dharris2/Harrison-Shor-2002.pdf Shors].  (PDF). Swarthmore College. 2002.</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> The current situation of the Shors is not free of issues however. Many Shors do not know their native language and show indifference to their traditional culture. Illness, discrimination, environmental racism, high death rates but low birth rates, drug and alcohol addiction, and the possibility of the Shors being swallowed up by the dominant Russian culture in the near future are other issues the modern Shors face.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-siberia-turkic-shor-cling-to-way-of-life-language/28974851.html|title=Shor Cling to Way of Life, Language in Siberia|last=Wesolowsky|first=Tony|date=14 January 2018|work=[[RadioFreeEurope]]|access-date=5 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe Shors were originally practitioners of shamanism and animism but were converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity during Russian rule since the early 17th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> Conversions occurred rapidly after the establishment of the Altai Spiritual Mission in the 1830s.<ref name=\":1\">Arbachakov (2008), p. 8</ref> Most present Shors are Russian Orthodox Christians.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-shors/siberias-first-metallurgists-sing-to-spirit-world-idUSTRE50D09D20090114|title=Siberia's first metallurgists sing to spirit world|last=Paxton|first=Robin|date=13 January 2009|work=[[Reuters]]|access-date=5 January 2020|url-status=live|last2=Petrova|first2=Olga}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Ethnic Groups of North, East, and Central Asia: An Encyclopedia|last=Minahan|first=James B.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2014|isbn=9781610690188|location=|pages=246\u2013248}}</ref>\n\n=== Shamanism ===\nDespite the conversion of Christianity among the Shors, shamanism has had and still is very important and influential to modern Shor spirituality. Shor Shamanism and its ''kam'' (shamans) have suffered persecution since Russian colonization of the region especially from the 17th to 20th centuries. The establishment of the Altai Spiritual Mission in the region resulted in the severe persecution of shamanism and the kam. Christian missionaries routinely lambasted Shor shamanism as being a dark cult and the kam as servants of the devil. There was many forced conversions to Christianity as well.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/fight-preserve-shor-culture|title=The Fight to Preserve Shor Culture|last=Arbachakov|first=Alexander|date=September 2001|website=culturalsurvival.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> During the soviet era, the authorities frequently designated the kam and others as enemies of the state and sentenced them to camps or even death. Graves, drums, ritual clothing, and more were burned or desecrated during this period.<ref name=\":1\" /> Shor shamanism saw a revival starting in the late 1980s and is considered a vital part of modern Shor identity.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Economy ===\nThe Shors were mainly engaged in [[hunting]], [[fishing]], some primitive [[farming]], and [[pine nut]] picking. [[Blacksmithing]] and [[iron ore]] [[mining]] and [[melting]] were also important (hence, the name \"Blacksmithing Tatars\"). The lifestyle of the Shors changed significantly following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Most became skillful farmers, cattle-breeders, or industrial workers.\n\n=== Family and clan structure ===\nThe Shors were able to retain much of their ancient clan structure over the years. Each clan was traditionally led by a chief. Chiefs were elected in large clan gatherings. These gatherings was where important decisions, conflicts, and other issues were settled.<ref name=\":5\" /> Features of their society included matrilocal marriages, exogamy, a classisfactory system of kinship terms, and the belief in certain taboos that revolve around the former.

He placed his son Paktan in the lowest sky. He then placed a spirit called Keikush in the middle sky while he and his wife Chaasin lived in the upper sky. Ul'gen's younger brother, Erlik, decided to create things himself. Erlik created the mountains, birds, and other animals. Meanwhile, Ul'gen created man but didn't know to make human souls and as a result the man he created was nothing more than a lifeless husk. He then set out on a journey in search of a soul and left a hairless dog to protect man in his absence. Erlik saw his chance and made his way to the man. The dog refused to let him pass but Erlik made a deal with the dog. If the dog lets him pass, he'll give him fur. Erlik passed and the dog's body grew fur. Erlik proceeded towards the lifeless man, spat on him, rubbed dirt on him, and left.<ref name=\":22\">Arbachkov (2008), p. 14-15</ref>\n\nUl'gen returned with his aim failed and saw the condition of the man and dog. The dog revealed what happened and Ul'gen wondered whether Erlik knew how to create souls. He summoned Erlik and he replied that he knew how to create souls. With no other options, Ul'gen agreed that Erlik would create the soul of man if he can have their souls. However, the body of man would belong to Ul'gen. Erlik used a tube made out of a hollow angelica stem and placed the tube in man's mouth. Erlik blew the soul through the tube and into man's body. Ul'gen soon wanted to banish Erlik from Earth but Erlik pleaded to Ul'gen to give him a corner of land for him to live in. Ul'gen raised his staff and a hole opened up where it was resting. Snakes, insects, and other creatures crawled out onto the Earth and Erlik climbed down the hole to the underworld.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== The worldview of the Shors ===\nThe Shors traditionally believed that the universe was divided into three levels which were:<ref>Arbachakov (2008), p. 12</ref>\n\n* The Heavenly Realm (Ul'gen Cheri): Realm of the god Ul'gen. This world is further divided into nine \"skies\" (see below for more information).\n* The Middle Earth (Ortinda or Pistin Cheri): Our physical world. Said to be flat with the Pistag (or Mustag) Mountain lying at its center.\n* The Underworld (Aina Cheri): Realm of the god Erlik and his minions.\n\nAll these realms were said to be populated by spirits, humans, animals, and other creatures. The three worlds were linked via the axis of the World Tree or Mountain. The top of the World Tree housed the Heavenly Realm whilst its trunk passed through the Middle Earth and its roots reached down to the Underworld.

It's also described as a place where the bodies of the dead never decay.\n\n=== Spirits and deities ===\nTraditional Shor religion is rich with deities and spirits. Some of the most revered or feared include:\n\n*[[\u00dclgen|Ul'gen]]: The god of the Heavenly Realm.

Lightning is said to be the whip of Ul'gen as he rides ak pozat.\n* Che ezi (master spirit of the place): Spirits that dwell in our world in specific locales like mountains, rivers or forests. They are protective spirits that must be respected when entering their domain.There are many elemental forms of che ezi depending on their dwelling place.<ref>Arbachakov (2008), p. 19-20</ref> Some types also reside in the Heavenly Realm.\n* Samchi: A che ezi that lives in the Yellow Sky.

Shor clan elders led the Prayer to the Sky while the shamans rarely did.\n* Cher-Sug (Earth-Water): Deity that rules over the earth spirits and guardians of the mountains, forests, rocks, and rivers.\n* [[Umay]]: Goddess of fertility and birth.

Their self designation is ''\u0428\u043e\u0440'', or ''Shor''. They were also called '''Kuznetskie [[Tatars]]''' (\u043a\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b), '''Kondoma Tatars''' (\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b), '''Mras-Su Tatars''' (\u043c\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b) in some of the documents of the 17th and 18th centuries. \n\nMost Shors live in the [[Tom River|Tom]] [[drainage basin|basin]] along the [[Kondoma River|Kondoma]] and [[Mras-Su River]]s. This region is historically called [[Mountainous Shoria]]. The Shors also live in [[Khakassia]] and [[Altai Republic]]. According to 2002 [[census]], there were 13,975 Shors in Russia (12,601 in 1926, 16,042 in 1939, 14,938 in 1959, 15,950 in 1970, 15,182 in 1979 and 15,745 in 1989). The Shors speak their own [[Shor language]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Shors as a people formed as a result of a long process of intermixing between the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Ugrian]], [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyedic]] and [[Ket language|Ket]]-speaking tribes.<ref name=\":0\">Akiner (1986), p. 417</ref> Their culture and origins are similar to those of the northern [[Altay people]] and some of the ethnic groups of the [[Khakas people|Khakas]]. The region where the Shors currently reside was Turkicized under the influence of the [[Yenisei Kyrgyz|Yenisei Kirghiz]] during the medieval period. The Shors resulted from this ethnic mixing and adopted Turkic speech (the [[Shor language]]) as a result.<ref name=\":3\">Forsyth (1992), p. 23-24</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Shor tribes began to become a distinct people around the 8th and 9th centuries CE.<ref name=\":5\" /> The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] conquest of the Altai-Sayan region in the 13th century added another layer of cultural influence over the local population and their languages. The region subsequently fell under the influence of the [[Oirats]] from the late 14th century to the early 17th century. Although Mongol control of the area was nominal, many of the languages (including Shor) contains significant amounts of Mongol loanwords.<ref name=\":3\" /> The Shors were a valuable asset to the Yenisei Kirghiz and Oirats as suppliers of ironware. Their ability to smelt iron from ore was a feat that only one other indigenous Siberian people (the [[Yakuts]]) were able to do before the Russian advance to the area.<ref>Forsyth (1992), p. 56, 183</ref> \n\n=== Early modern history ===\nIn the early 17th century, the Shors and their territory were conquered by the Russians. In the 18th century, Russian settlers began to move in to the area. The Shors' niche as producers of ironware for the Oirats, [[Altai people|Altaians]], and Kirghiz was soon eroded by the Russian traders. The Russians had more advanced products to offer and this ended Shor blacksmithing.<ref name=\":5\" /> Atop of this, Russian officials subjected the Shors to pay ''[[yasak]]'' in the form of furs. This resulted in most Shors abandoning their old occupations and villages to move to nearby towns so they can make a better living as hunters. However, they lived in squalid conditions. The use of nettle-fibre or wild hemp for clothing, primitive implements, and techniques continued on towards the 20th century.<ref name=\":4\">Forsyth (1992), p. 183</ref> \n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe Shors were little affected by the Russian Revolution and its civil war until the Bolsheviks took the region in 1920. In 1929, the Shor National Region was formed but was quickly dissolved in 1939.<ref>Mote (1998), p. 138. \"In the decade between 1929 and 1939, the neighboring Shors had their own national okrug...\"</ref><ref>Akiner (1986), p. 417. \"The Shor National Region was formed in 1929, but disbanded in 1939.\"</ref> The okrug (district) was disbanded because the Soviet authorities believed its existence might hinder the development of the iron and coal industries in the region.<ref>Mote (1998), p. 138</ref> These minerals became important to the state after deposits were discovered in the [[Kuznetsk Basin]] in the 1930s. This discovery led to a new wave of Russian settlers and workers to the region and began displacing the Shors.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>Forsyth (1992), p. 300-301</ref> The authorities considered the Shors to be numerically insignificant and that disenfranchising them would not be consequential to the state. The Shors greatly suffered as a result. They were driven out of their farms and villages and forced to work in the coal mines. The population of the Shors declined and the urban Shors struggled with alcoholism, drug addiction, suicide, and high lethal accident rates.<ref>Mote (1998), p. 151</ref> Traditional Shor culture began to wane . The liberalization of Soviet rule beginning in the 1980s led to a Shor cultural revival and the establishment of many cultural and linguistic institutions (like the creation of The Association of Shor People in the 1990s).<ref name=\":7\">K.

Many Shors do not know their native language and show indifference to their traditional culture. Illness, discrimination, environmental racism, high death rates but low birth rates, drug and alcohol addiction, and the possibility of the Shors being swallowed up by the dominant Russian culture in the near future are other issues the modern Shors face.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-siberia-turkic-shor-cling-to-way-of-life-language/28974851.html|title=Shor Cling to Way of Life, Language in Siberia|last=Wesolowsky|first=Tony|date=14 January 2018|work=[[RadioFreeEurope]]|access-date=5 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>  \n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe Shors were originally practitioners of shamanism and animism but were converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity during Russian rule since the early 17th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> Conversions occurred rapidly after the establishment of the Altai Spiritual Mission in the 1830s.<ref name=\":1\">Arbachakov (2008), p. 8</ref> Most present Shors are Russian Orthodox Christians.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-shors/siberias-first-metallurgists-sing-to-spirit-world-idUSTRE50D09D20090114|title=Siberia's first metallurgists sing to spirit world|last=Paxton|first=Robin|date=13 January 2009|work=[[Reuters]]|access-date=5 January 2020|url-status=live|last2=Petrova|first2=Olga}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Ethnic Groups of North, East, and Central Asia: An Encyclopedia|last=Minahan|first=James B.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2014|isbn=9781610690188|location=|pages=246-248}}</ref> \n\n=== Shamanism ===\nDespite the conversion of Christianity among the Shors, shamanism has had and still is very important and influential to modern Shor spirituality. Shor Shamanism and its ''kam'' (shamans) have suffered persecution since Russian colonization of the region especially from the 17th to 20th centuries. The establishment of the Altai Spiritual Mission in the region resulted in the severe persecution of shamanism and the kam. Christian missionaries routinely lambasted Shor shamanism as being a dark cult and the kam as servants of the devil. There was many forced conversions to Christianity as well.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/fight-preserve-shor-culture|title=The Fight to Preserve Shor Culture|last=Arbachakov|first=Alexander|date=September 2001|website=culturalsurvival.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> During the soviet era, the authorities frequently designated the kam and others as enemies of the state and sentenced them to camps or even death.

[[Blacksmithing]] and [[iron ore]] [[mining]] and [[melting]] were also important (hence, the name \"Blacksmithing Tatars\"). The lifestyle of the Shors changed significantly following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Most became skillful farmers, cattle-breeders, or industrial workers.\n\n=== Family and clan structure ===\nThe Shors were able to retain much of their ancient clan structure over the years. Each clan was traditionally led by a chief. Chiefs were elected in large clan gatherings. These gatherings was where important decisions, conflicts, and other issues were settled.<ref name=\":5\" /> Features of their society included matrilocal marriages, exogamy, a classisfactory system of kinship terms, and the belief in certain taboos that revolve around the former. Clans routinely organized communal hunts and shared the spoils equally among themselves. However, this clan system eroded beginning in the mid-nineteenth century under the Russian influence of separating families into individual units.

After the war of Independence, Rahman became a brigade commander in Bangladesh Army, later the deputy chief of staff and Chief of staff of [[Bangladesh Army]].<ref name=\":1\" /> His ascent to leadership of the country resulted from a conspiracy that had begun with the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding president of Bangladesh, in a military coup d'\u00e9tat followed by a coups and counter-revolt within the military to gain control at the helm.\nZiaur Rahman gained ''de facto'' power as head of the government already under [[martial law]] imposed by the Mushtaq government. He took over the presidency in 1977.\n\nAs President in 1978, Rahman founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (popularly known by its abbreviation BNP). He reinstated multi-party politics, freedom of the press, free speech and free markets and accountability. Rahman inspired the nation to work hard and [[Bangladeshi nationalism|love the land]]. He initiated mass irrigation and food production programmes, including social programmes to uplift the lives of the people. He initiated and founded the first Asian regional group known as [[SAARC]]. Through his hard work and dedication the current Parliament House and Dhaka's international airport (now [[Shahjalal International Airport|HSIA]]) was materialized. Rahman became a popular world leader for his efforts to stabilize Bangladesh and championing issues affecting decolonised nations. He improved Bangladesh's relations with the West and China, and departed from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's close alignment with India and the Soviet Union. Domestically, Rahman faced as many as twenty-one coup attempts for which trails were setup and many soldiers and officers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces were executed which were mostly claimed to be biased and false trails. He was criticised for passing the [[Indemnity Act, Bangladesh|Indemnity Act]] and removing the ban on religion-based political parties.\n\nRahman was awarded two  gallantry awards for two wars fought in South Asia. [[Hilal-i-Jurat]] for the Indo-Pak War in 1965, and Bir Uttom in 1972 for the Bangladesh Independence war 1971 for his wartime valor.

On 15 August 1975 President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were assassinated in a gun fight with army personnel. One of Mujibur Rahman's cabinet ministers and a leading conspirator [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]] gained the presidency and dismissed Major General [[K M Shafiullah]], appointed Major General Ziaur Rahman (then deputy chief of army staff) as army chief of staff. However, the coup of 15 August caused a period of instability and unrest in Bangladesh and amongst the rank and file of the armed forces. Brigadier [[Khaled Mosharraf]] and the 46th Brigade of [[Dhaka Cantonment]] under Colonel [[Shafat Jamil]] revolted against [[Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed]]'s administration on 3 November 1975, and Ziaur Rahman was forced to relinquish his post and put under house arrest.

A group of [[Japanese Red Army]] terrorists hijacked [[Japan Airlines Flight 472 (1977)|Japan Airlines Flight 472]] from [[India]] armed with weapons and ammunition and forced it to land in [[Dhaka International Airport|Tejgaon International Airport]]. On 30 September, while the attention of the government was riveted on this crisis situation, due to spreading of panic and disinformation actions went under way in Bogra Cantonment where a revolt broke out. Although the revolt was quickly quelled on the night of 2 October, another revolt started in Dhaka cantonment, led by misinformed airmen of [[Bangladesh Air Force]] (BAF). Armed group among this group of army and air force personnel unsuccessfully attacked Zia's residence, captured Dhaka Radio for a short time and killed eleven(11) air force officers and 30 airmen at Tejgaon International Airport, where they were gathered for negotiations with the hijackers. Wing Commander [[M. Hamidullah Khan]] BP (BDF Commander Bangladesh Forces Sector 11), then BAF Ground Defence Commander, quickly put down the rebellion within the Air Force, while the government was severely shaken. Chief of Air Staff [[Air vice-marshal|AVM]] AG Mahmud reappointed Wing Commander Hamidullah Khan as [[Provost Marshal]] of BAF. President Zia immediately appointed Wing Commander Hamidullah Khan as [[ZMLA]] (Dhaka) and Director of Martial Law Communications and Control at Tejgaon (present day PM's Office). Government intelligence had failed and President Rahman promptly dismissed the DG-NSI and the DFI chief, [[Air Commodore|Air Cdre]] Aminul Islam Khan BAF, of 9th GD(P) formerly of [[Pakistan Air Force]], and also the . Hamidullah initiated the transfer of DFI under the ministry of defence from old Bailey Road office to Dhaka Cantonment under direct control of the president.

Rahman moved to normalise relations with Pakistan. While distancing Bangladesh from India, Rahman sought to improve ties with other Islamic nations. Zia's move towards Islamic state policies improved the nation's standing in the Middle East.<ref name=\"pedia\"/> According to historian Tazeen M.

After the war of Independence, Rahman became a brigade commander in Bangladesh Army, later the deputy chief of staff and Chief of staff of [[Bangladesh Army]].<ref name=\":1\" /> His ascent to leadership of the country resulted from a conspiracy that had begun with the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding president of Bangladesh, in a military coup d'\u00e9tat followed by a coups and counter-revolt within the military to gain control at the helm.\nZiaur Rahman gained ''de facto'' power as head of the government already under [[martial law]] imposed by the Mushtaq government. He took over the presidency in 1977.\n\nAs President in 1978, Rahman founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (popularly known by its abbreviation BNP). He reinstated multi-party politics, freedom of the press, free speech and free markets and accountability. Rahman inspired the nation to work hard and [[Bangladeshi nationalism|love the land]]. He initiated mass irrigation and food production programmes, including social programmes to uplift the lives of the people. He initiated and founded the first Asian regional group known as [[SAARC]]. Through his hard work and dedication the current Parliament House and Dhaka's international airport (now [[Shahjalal International Airport|HSIA]]) was materialized. Rahman became a popular world leader for his efforts to stabilize Bangladesh and championing issues affecting decolonised nations. He improved Bangladesh's relations with the West and China, and departed from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's close alignment with India and the Soviet Union. Domestically, Rahman faced as many as twenty-one coup attempts for which trails were setup and many soldiers and officers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces were executed which were mostly claimed to be biased and false trails. He was criticised for passing the [[Indemnity Act, Bangladesh|Indemnity Act]] and removing the ban on religion-based political parties.\n\nRahman was awarded two  gallantry awards for two wars fought in South Asia. [[Hilal-i-Jurat]] for the Indo-Pak War in 1965, and Bir Uttom in 1972 for the Bangladesh Independence war 1971 for his wartime valor.

A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells and their [[extracellular matrix]] from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues.\n\nThe English word \"tissue\" is derived from the French word \"tissu\", meaning that something that is \"woven\", from the verb ''tisser'', \"to weave\".\n\nThe study of human and animal tissues is known as [[histology]] or, in connection with disease, [[histopathology]] also not forgetting to add, archeology. For plants, the discipline is called [[plant anatomy]]. The classical tools for studying tissues are the [[Microtome#Applications|paraffin block]] in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the [[staining|histological stain]], and the [[Microscope|optical microscope]]. Developments in [[electron microscopy]], [[immunofluorescence]], and the use of [[microtome|frozen tissue sections]] have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and [[disease]], enabling considerable refinement of [[medical diagnosis]] and [[prognosis]].\n\n== Animals ==\n\n[[File:Histoplasma pas-d small.jpg|thumb|right|[[PAS diastase]] showing the fungus ''[[Histoplasma]]'']]\nAnimal tissues are grouped into four basic types: [[connective tissue|connective]], [[muscle tissue|muscle]], [[nervous tissue|nervous]], and [[epithelium|epithelial]].<ref name=\"Ross and Pawlina, 2016\">{{cite book |last1=Ross |first1=Michael H. |last2=Pawlina |first2=Wojciech |title=Histology : a text and atlas : with correlated cell and molecular biology |date=2016 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |isbn=978-1451187427|pages=984p |edition=7th}} </ref> Collections of tissues joined in units to serve a common function compose organs. While all animals can generally be considered to contain the four tissue types, the manifestation of these tissues can differ depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals.\n\nThe epithelium in all animals is derived from the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]], with a small contribution from the [[mesoderm]], forming the [[endothelium]], a specialized type of epithelium that composes the [[blood vessels|vasculature]]. By contrast, a true [[epithelial tissue]] is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called [[tight junctions]], to create a selectively permeable barrier. This tissue covers all organismal surfaces that come in contact with the external environment such as the [[skin]], the airways, and the digestive tract. It serves functions of protection, [[secretion]], and absorption, and is separated from other tissues below by a [[basal lamina]].\n\n=== Epithelial tissue ===\n{{main|Epithelium}}\n\nThe epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces, such as the surface of  [[skin]], the [[airway]]s, surfaces of soft organs,the [[reproductive tract]], and the inner lining of the [[digestive tract]]. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, [[tight junctions]]; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. In addition to this protective function, epithelial tissue may also be specialized to function in [[secretion]], [[excretion]] and [[Digestion|absorption]]. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss.\n\nFunctions of epithelial tissue:\n*The principle function of epithelial tissues are covering and lining of free surface\n* The cells of the body's surface form the outer layer of skin.\n* Inside the body, epithelial cells form the lining of the mouth and alimentary canal and protect these organs.\n* Epithelial tissues help in absorption of water and nutrients.\n* Epithelial tissues help in the elimination of waste.\n* Epithelial tissues secrete enzymes and/or hormones in the form of [[gland]]s.\n* Some epithelial tissue perform secretory functions. They secrete a variety of substances including sweat, saliva, mucus, enzymes.\n\nThere are many kinds of epithelium, and nomenclature is somewhat variable. Most classification schemes combine a description of the cell-shape in the upper layer of the epithelium with a word denoting the number of layers: either simple (one layer of cells) or stratified (multiple layers of cells). However, other cellular features such as cilia may also be described in the classification system. Some common kinds of epithelium are listed below:\n\n* Simple squamous epithelium\n* Stratified squamous epithelium\n* Simple cuboidal epithelium\n* Transitional epithelium\n* Pseudostratified columnar epithelium (also known as ciliated columnar epithelium)\n* Columnar epithelium\n* Glandular epithelium\n\n=== Connective tissue ===\n{{Main|Connective tissue}}\n\nConnective tissues are fibrous tissues made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an [[extracellular matrix]]. This matrix can be liquid or rigid. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose, and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue.\n\n=== Muscular tissue ===\n{{Main|Muscle tissue}}\n\n[[Muscle cell]]s form the active contractile tissue of the [[Human body|body]] known as [[muscle tissue]] or muscular tissue. Muscle tissue functions to produce [[force]] and cause [[Motion (physics)|motion]], either [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] or movement within internal organs. Muscle tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or [[smooth muscle]], found in the inner linings of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]; [[skeletal muscle]], typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and [[cardiac muscle]], found in the [[heart]], where it contracts to pump blood throughout an organism.\n\n=== Nervous tissue ===\n{{Main|Nervous tissue}}\n\nCells comprising the [[central nervous system]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] are classified as nervous (or neural) tissue. In the central nervous system, neural tissues form the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. In the peripheral nervous system, neural tissues form the [[cranial nerves]] and [[spinal nerve]]s, inclusive of the [[motor neuron]]s.\n\n== Plants ==\n[[File:Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg|thumb|right|Cross-section of a [[flax]] plant stem with several layers of different tissue types:<br>\n1.  [[Pith]]<br>\n2.  [[Protoxylem]]<br>\n3.  [[Xylem]] I<br>\n4.  [[Phloem]] I<br>\n5.  [[Sclerenchyma]] ([[bast fibre]])<br>\n6.  [[cortex (botany)|Cortex]]<br>\n7.  [[epidermis (botany)|Epidermis]]]]\n\nIn [[plant anatomy]], tissues are categorized broadly into three tissue systems: the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]], the [[ground tissue]], and the [[vascular tissue]].\n\n* '''[[epidermis (botany)|Epidermis]]''' - Cells forming the outer surface of the [[leaf|leaves]] and of the young plant body.\n* '''[[Vascular tissue]]''' - The primary components of vascular tissue are the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]].  These transport fluids and nutrients internally.\n* '''[[Ground tissue]]''' - Ground tissue is less [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] than other tissues.  Ground tissue manufactures nutrients by [[photosynthesis]] and stores reserve nutrients.\n\nPlant tissues can also be divided differently into two types:\n\n# Meristematic tissues\n# Permanent tissues.\n\n=== Meristematic tissues ===\n[[Meristem|Meristematic tissue]] consists of  actively dividing cells, and leads to increase in length and thickness of the plant.  The primary growth of a plant occurs only in certain, specific regions, such as in the tips of stems or roots. It is in these regions that meristematic tissues are present.  Cells in these tissues are roughly spherical or polyhedral, to rectangular in shape, and have thin cell walls. New cells produced by meristem are initially those of meristem itself, but as the new cells grow and mature, their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of the region of occurrence of meristematic tissues, being classified as:\n* '''Apical meristem ''' - It is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the stem and root. They form growing parts at the apices of roots and stems and are responsible for the increase in length, also called primary growth. This meristem is responsible for the linear growth of an organ.\n* ''' Lateral meristem''' - This meristem consists of cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ to increase in diameter and growth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree in the form of Cork Cambium and in vascular bundles of dicots in the form of [[vascular cambium]]. The activity of this cambium results in the formation of secondary growth.\n* '''Intercalary meristem''' - This meristem is located in between permanent tissues. It is usually present at the base of the node, internode and on leaf base. They are responsible for growth in length of the plant and increasing the size of the internode. They result in branch formation and growth.\n\nThe cells of meristematic tissues are similar in structure and have thin and elastic primary cell wall made up of [[cellulose]]. They are compactly arranged without inter-cellular spaces between them. Each cell contains a dense [[cytoplasm]] and a prominent [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. The dense [[protoplasm]] of meristematic cells contains very few vacuoles. Normally the meristematic cells are oval, [[polygonal]] or rectangular in shape.\n\nMeristematic tissue cells have a large nucleus with small or no vacuoles as they have no need to store anything, opposed to their function of multiplying and increasing the girth and length of the plant, and no intercellular spaces.\n\n=== Permanent tissues ===\nPermanent tissues may be defined as a group of living or dead cells formed by meristematic tissue and have lost their ability to divide and have permanently placed at fixed positions in the plant body. Meristematic tissues that take up a specific role lose the ability to divide. This process of taking up a permanent shape, size and a function is called [[cellular differentiation]]. Cells of meristematic tissue differentiate to form different types of permanent tissues. There are 3 types of permanent tissues:\n# simple permanent tissues\n# complex permanent tissues\n# special or secretory tissues (glandular).\n\n==== Simple tissues ====\nA group of cells which are similar in origin; similar in structure and similar in function are called simple permanent tissue. They are of three types:\n# [[Parenchyma]]\n# [[Collenchyma]]\n# [[Sclerenchyma]]\n#[[Epidermis]]\n\n===== Parenchyma =====\n[[Parenchyma]] (''para'' - 'beside'; ''infusion'' - 'tissue') is the bulk of a substance. In plants, it consists of relatively unspecialized living cells with thin cell walls that are usually loosely packed so that intercellular spaces are found between cells of this tissue. These are generally isodiametric, in shape. This tissue provides support to plants and also stores food.  In some situations, parenchyma contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis, in which case it is called a chlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to give support to them to float on water. Such a parenchyma type is called [[aerenchyma]]. Some of the parenchyma cells have metabolic waste and is known as idioblast. Spindle shape fiber also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma, succulent parenchyma also noted.In [[xerophytes]], parenchyma tissues store water.\n\n===== Collenchyma =====\n[[File:Plant cell type collenchyma.png|thumb|Cross section of collenchyma cells]]\n\n[[Collenchyma]] is Greek word where \"Colla\" means gum and \"enchyma\" means infusion. It is a living tissue of primary body like [[Parenchyma]]. Cells are thin-walled but possess thickening of [[cellulose]], water and [[pectin]] substances ([[pectocellulose]]) at the corners where a number of cells join together. This tissue gives tensile strength to the plant and the cells are compactly arranged and have very little inter-cellular spaces. It occurs chiefly in [[hypodermis]] of stems and leaves. It is absent in [[monocots]] and in roots. Sometimes it contains chlorophyll which can help them photosynthesize.\n\nCollenchymatous tissue acts as a supporting tissue in stems of young plants. It provides mechanical support, elasticity, and tensile strength to the plant body. It helps in manufacturing sugar and storing it as starch. It is present in the margin of leaves and resists tearing effect of the wind.\n\n===== Sclerenchyma =====\n[[Ground tissue#Sclerenchyma|Sclerenchyma]] is Greek word where \"Sclero-\" means hard and \"enchyma\" means infusion. This tissue consists of thick-walled, dead cells and protoplasm is negligible. These cells have hard and extremely thick secondary walls due to uniform distribution and high secretion of [[lignin]]. They do not have inter-molecular space between them. Lignin deposition is so thick that the cell walls become strong, rigid and impermeable to water which is also known as a stone cell or sclereids. These tissues are mainly of two types: sclerenchyma fiber and sclereids. Sclerenchyma cells have a narrow lumen and are long, narrow and unicellular.\n\n===== Epidermis =====\nThe entire surface of the plant consists of a single layer of cells called epidermis or surface tissue. The entire surface of the plant has this outer layer of the epidermis. Hence it is also called  surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. The cells form a continuous sheet without intercellular spaces. It protects all parts of the plant. The outer epidermis is coated with a waxy thick layer called cuticle which prevents loss of water. The epidermis also consists of [[stomata]](singular:stoma) which helps in [[transpiration]].\n\n==== Complex permanent tissue ====\nThe complex tissue consists of more than one type of cells which work together as a unit. Complex tissues help in the transportation of organic material, water, and minerals up and down the plants. That is why it is also known as conducting and vascular tissue. The common types of complex permanent tissue are:\n* Xylem or wood\n* Phloem or bast.\n\nXylem and phloem together form vascular bundles.\n\n===== Xylem =====\nXylem consists of:\n* Xylem tracheids\n* Xylem vessel \n* Xylem fibres or Xylem sclerenchyma\n* Xylem parenchyma\n\n[[File:Xylem rays (Tilia Americana).jpg|thumb|right|Cross section of 2-year-old Tilia Americana, highlighting xylem ray shape and orientation.]][[Xylem]] serves as a chief conducting tissue of [[vascular plants]]. \n\nIt is responsible for the conduction of water and mineral ions/salt. \nXylem tissue is organised in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels tracheids, while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The tracheids end overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. The pit pairs allow water to pass from cell to cell.\n\nThough most conduction in xylem tissue is vertical, lateral conduction along the diameter of a stem is facilitated via rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7409/Wood.html|title=Wood|website=science.jrank.org}}</ref> Rays are horizontal rows of long-living parenchyma cells that arise out of the vascular cambium. In trees and other woody plants, rays radiate out from the center of stems and roots and appear like spokes on a wheel in cross section. Rays, unlike vessel members and tracheids, are alive at functional maturity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/botany_130/anatomy/secondary_growth/|title=Secondary Growth|website=botit.botany.wisc.edu}}</ref>\n\n===== Phloem =====\nPhloem consists of:\n* [[Sieve tube]]\n* [[Companion cell]]\n* Phloem fibre\n* Phloem parenchyma.\n\nPhloem is an equally important plant tissue as it also is part of the 'plumbing system' of a plant. Primarily, phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the plant. This conduction system is composed of sieve-tube member and companion cells, that are without secondary walls. The parent cells of the vascular cambium produce both xylem and phloem. This usually also includes fibers, parenchyma and ray cells. Sieve tubes are formed from sieve-tube members laid end to end. The end walls, unlike vessel members in xylem, do not have openings. The end walls, however, are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell. These porous connections are called sieve plates. In spite of the fact that their cytoplasm is actively involved in the conduction of food materials, sieve-tube members do not have nuclei at maturity. It is the companion cells that are nestled between sieve-tube members that function in some manner bringing about the conduction of food. Sieve-tube members that are alive contain a polymer called callose, a carbohydrate polymer, forming the callus pad/callus, the colourless substance that covers the sieve plate. Callose stays in solution as long as the cell contents are under pressure. Phloem transports food and materials in plants upwards and downwards as required.\n\n== Mineralized tissues ==\n{{main|Mineralized tissues}}\n\nMineralized tissues are biological tissues that incorporate minerals into soft matrices. Such tissues may be found in both plants and animals, as well as algae. Typically these tissues form a protective shield against predation or provide structural support.\n\n==History of the concept==\n[[File:Pierre-Maximilien Delafontaine - Portrait of Marie Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Bichat.jpg|thumb|[[Xavier Bichat]] (1771\u20131802)]]\nThe term was introduced in anatomy by [[Xavier Bichat]] in 1801.<ref>\n{{cite journal \n|last1= Bock\n|first1= Ortwin\n|date= 2015-01-02\n|title= A history of the development of histology up to the end of the nineteenth century \n|url= https://www.labome.org/research/A-history-of-the-development-of-histology-up-to-the-end-of-the-nineteenth-century.html\n|journal= Research\n|volume= 2015;2:1283\n|issue= \n|pages= \n|doi= 10.13070/rs.en.2.1283\n|doi-broken-date= 2020-01-22\n}}\n</ref> He was \"the first to propose that tissue is a central element in [[human anatomy]], and he considered [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves\".<ref name=\"Lindahall\">{{cite web|title=Xavier Bichat|website=LindaHall.org|url=https://www.lindahall.org/xavier-bichat/}}</ref>\nAlthough he worked without a [[microscope]], Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed,<ref name=\"Roeckelein1998\">{{harvnb|Roeckelein|1998|p=78}}</ref> a number later reduced by other authors.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{annotated link|Cell (biology)|Cells}}\n* {{annotated link|Cellular differentiation}}\n* {{annotated link|Dorothea Pertz}}\n* {{annotated link|Generative tissue}}\n* {{annotated link|Laser capture microdissection}}\n* {{annotated link|Plant stem cell}}\n* {{annotated link|Tissue microarray}}\n* {{annotated link|Tissue stress}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Raven, Peter H., Evert, Ray F., & Eichhorn, Susan E.

A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells and their [[extracellular matrix]] from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues.\n\nThe English word \"tissue\" is derived from the French word \"tissu\", meaning that something that is \"woven\", from the verb ''tisser'', \"to weave\".\n\nThe study of human and animal tissues is known as [[histology]] or, in connection with disease, [[histopathology]] also not forgetting to add, archeology. For plants, the discipline is called [[plant anatomy]]. The classical tools for studying tissues are the [[Microtome#Applications|paraffin block]] in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the [[staining|histological stain]], and the [[Microscope|optical microscope]]. Developments in [[electron microscopy]], [[immunofluorescence]], and the use of [[microtome|frozen tissue sections]] have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and [[disease]], enabling considerable refinement of [[medical diagnosis]] and [[prognosis]].\n\n== Animals ==\n\n[[File:Histoplasma pas-d small.jpg|thumb|right|[[PAS diastase]] showing the fungus ''[[Histoplasma]]'']]\nAnimal tissues are grouped into four basic types: [[connective tissue|connective]], [[muscle tissue|muscle]], [[nervous tissue|nervous]], and [[epithelium|epithelial]].<ref name=\"Ross and Pawlina, 2016\">{{cite book |last1=Ross |first1=Michael H. |last2=Pawlina |first2=Wojciech |title=Histology : a text and atlas : with correlated cell and molecular biology |date=2016 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |isbn=978-1451187427|pages=984p |edition=7th}} </ref> Collections of tissues joined in units to serve a common function compose organs. While all animals can generally be considered to contain the four tissue types, the manifestation of these tissues can differ depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals.\n\nThe epithelium in all animals is derived from the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]], with a small contribution from the [[mesoderm]], forming the [[endothelium]], a specialized type of epithelium that composes the [[blood vessels|vasculature]]. By contrast, a true [[epithelial tissue]] is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called [[tight junctions]], to create a selectively permeable barrier. This tissue covers all organismal surfaces that come in contact with the external environment such as the [[skin]], the airways, and the digestive tract. It serves functions of protection, [[secretion]], and absorption, and is separated from other tissues below by a [[basal lamina]].\n\n=== Epithelial tissue ===\n{{main|Epithelium}}\n\nThe epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces, such as the surface of  [[skin]], the [[airway]]s, surfaces of soft organs,the [[reproductive tract]], and the inner lining of the [[digestive tract]]. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, [[tight junctions]]; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. In addition to this protective function, epithelial tissue may also be specialized to function in [[secretion]], [[excretion]] and [[Digestion|absorption]]. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss.\n\nFunctions of epithelial tissue:\n*The principle function of epithelial tissues are covering and lining of free surface\n* The cells of the body's surface form the outer layer of skin.\n* Inside the body, epithelial cells form the lining of the mouth and alimentary canal and protect these organs.\n* Epithelial tissues help in absorption of water and nutrients.\n* Epithelial tissues help in the elimination of waste.\n* Epithelial tissues secrete enzymes and/or hormones in the form of [[gland]]s.\n* Some epithelial tissue perform secretory functions. They secrete a variety of substances including sweat, saliva, mucus, enzymes.\n\nThere are many kinds of epithelium, and nomenclature is somewhat variable. Most classification schemes combine a description of the cell-shape in the upper layer of the epithelium with a word denoting the number of layers: either simple (one layer of cells) or stratified (multiple layers of cells). However, other cellular features such as cilia may also be described in the classification system. Some common kinds of epithelium are listed below:\n\n* Simple squamous epithelium\n* Stratified squamous epithelium\n* Simple cuboidal epithelium\n* Transitional epithelium\n* Pseudostratified columnar epithelium (also known as ciliated columnar epithelium)\n* Columnar epithelium\n* Glandular epithelium\n\n=== Connective tissue ===\n{{Main|Connective tissue}}\n\nConnective tissues are fibrous tissues made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an [[extracellular matrix]]. This matrix can be liquid or rigid. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose, and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue.\n\n=== Muscular tissue ===\n{{Main|Muscle tissue}}\n\n[[Muscle cell]]s form the active contractile tissue of the [[Human body|body]] known as [[muscle tissue]] or muscular tissue. Muscle tissue functions to produce [[force]] and cause [[Motion (physics)|motion]], either [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] or movement within internal organs. Muscle tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or [[smooth muscle]], found in the inner linings of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]; [[skeletal muscle]], typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and [[cardiac muscle]], found in the [[heart]], where it contracts to pump blood throughout an organism.\n\n=== Nervous tissue ===\n{{Main|Nervous tissue}}\n\nCells comprising the [[central nervous system]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] are classified as nervous (or neural) tissue. In the central nervous system, neural tissues form the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. In the peripheral nervous system, neural tissues form the [[cranial nerves]] and [[spinal nerve]]s, inclusive of the [[motor neuron]]s.\n\n== Plants ==\n[[File:Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg|thumb|right|Cross-section of a [[flax]] plant stem with several layers of different tissue types:<br>\n1.  [[Pith]]<br>\n2.  [[Protoxylem]]<br>\n3.  [[Xylem]] I<br>\n4.  [[Phloem]] I<br>\n5.  [[Sclerenchyma]] ([[bast fibre]])<br>\n6.  [[cortex (botany)|Cortex]]<br>\n7.  [[epidermis (botany)|Epidermis]]]]\n\nIn [[plant anatomy]], tissues are categorized broadly into three tissue systems: the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]], the [[ground tissue]], and the [[vascular tissue]].\n\n* '''[[epidermis (botany)|Epidermis]]''' - Cells forming the outer surface of the [[leaf|leaves]] and of the young plant body.\n* '''[[Vascular tissue]]''' - The primary components of vascular tissue are the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]].  These transport fluids and nutrients internally.\n* '''[[Ground tissue]]''' - Ground tissue is less [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] than other tissues.  Ground tissue manufactures nutrients by [[photosynthesis]] and stores reserve nutrients.\n\nPlant tissues can also be divided differently into two types:\n\n# Meristematic tissues\n# Permanent tissues.\n\n=== Meristematic tissues ===\n[[Meristem|Meristematic tissue]] consists of  actively dividing cells, and leads to increase in length and thickness of the plant.  The primary growth of a plant occurs only in certain, specific regions, such as in the tips of stems or roots. It is in these regions that meristematic tissues are present.  Cells in these tissues are roughly spherical or polyhedral, to rectangular in shape, and have thin cell walls.

Following his first commercial video game release, ''[[ZZT]]'' (1991), the company became '''Epic MegaGames, Inc.''' in early 1992 and brought on [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who is the company's [[vice president]] to date. Moving their headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio's name was simplified to Epic Games.\n\nEpic Games develops the [[Unreal Engine]], a commercially available [[game engine]] which also powers their internally developed video games, such as ''[[Fortnite]]'' and the ''[[Unreal (video game series)|Unreal]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'' and ''[[Infinity Blade]]'' series. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the \"most successful videogame engine\" by [[Guinness World Records]].<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |title=Most successful videogame engine |website=[[Guinness World Records]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151655/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEpic Games owns video game developers [[Chair Entertainment]] and [[Psyonix]], as well as cloud-based software developer [[Cloudgine]], and operates eponymous sub-studios in [[Seattle]], [[England]], [[Berlin]], [[Yokohama]] and [[Seoul]]. While Sweeney remains the majority shareholder, [[Tencent]] acquired a 48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic towards a [[games as a service]] model. Following the release of the popular ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in 2017, the company gained additional investments that enabled to expand its Unreal Engine offerings, establish [[esport]] events around ''Fortnite'', and launch the [[Epic Games Store]].
