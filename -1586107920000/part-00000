''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright.

In 1999, British anthropologist [[Richard Wrangham]] proposed the \"cooking hypothesis\" which states that ''H. erectus'' speciated from their predecessor ''H. habilis'' because of fire usage and cooking 2 mya to explain the rapid doubling of brain size between these two species in only a 500,000 year timespan and the sudden appearance of the typical human body plan. Cooking would have been especially helpful in digestion of calorie-rich tubers which were common in their savanna environment, allowing group size to expand, causing selective pressure for sociality, requiring greater brain function. Artificial lighting also allowed for increased waking hours\u2014modern humans have about a 16 hour waking period, whereas other apes are generally awake from only sunup to sundown\u2014and these additional hours were probably used for socializing. Because of this, fire usage is probably also linked to the [[origin of language]].<ref name=Gowlett2016/><ref name=Gowlett2013/> Artificial lighting may have also made sleeping on the ground instead of the trees possible by keeping terrestrial predators at bay.<ref name=Gowlett2013/>\n\nMigration into the frigid climate of Ice Age Europe may have only been possible because of fire, but evidence of fire usage in Europe from 1 million to about 400\u2013300,000 years ago is notably absent.<ref name=Roebroeks2011/> If these early European ''H. erectus'' did not have fire, it is largely unclear how they stayed warm, avoided predators, and prepared animal fat and meat for consumption; and lightning is less common farther north equating to a reduced availability of naturally occurring fires. It is possible that they only knew how to maintain fires in certain settings in the landscapes and prepared food some distance away from home, meaning evidence of fire and evidence of hominin activity are spaced far apart.<ref name=Gowlett2013>{{cite journal|first=J.

''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright.

In 1999, British anthropologist [[Richard Wrangham]] proposed the \"cooking hypothesis\" which states that ''H. erectus'' speciated from their predecessor ''H. habilis'' because of fire usage and cooking 2 mya to explain the rapid doubling of brain size between these two species in only a 500,000 year timespan and the sudden appearance of the typical human body plan. Cooking would have been especially helpful in digestion of calorie-rich tubers which were common in their savanna environment, allowing group size to expand, causing selective pressure for sociality, requiring greater brain function. Artificial lighting also allowed for increased waking hours\u2014modern humans have about a 16 hour waking period, whereas other apes are generally awake from only sunup to sundown\u2014and these additional hours were probably used for socializing. Because of this, fire usage is probably also linked to the [[origin of language]].<ref name=Gowlett2016/><ref name=Gowlett2013/> Artificial lighting may have also made sleeping on the ground instead of the trees possible by keeping terrestrial predators at bay.<ref name=Gowlett2013/>\n\nMigration into the frigid climate of Ice Age Europe may have only been possible because of fire, but evidence of fire usage in Europe from 1 million to about 400\u2013300,000 years ago is notably absent.<ref name=Roebroeks2011/> If these early European ''H. erectus'' did not have fire, it is largely unclear how they stayed warm, avoided predators, and prepared animal fat and meat for consumption; and lightning is less common farther north equating to a reduced availability of naturally occurring fires. It is possible that they only knew how to maintain fires in certain settings in the landscapes and prepared food some distance away from home, meaning evidence of fire and evidence of hominin activity are spaced far apart.<ref name=Gowlett2013>{{cite journal|first=J.

Goldwater alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch [[Fiscal conservatives|fiscal conservatism]] and militant [[anti-communism]]. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on the right wing of the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, moderate Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Pennsylvania]] Governor [[William Scranton]], to challenge him. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination. He also had a solid backing from Southern Republicans. A young [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] lawyer, [[John Grenier]], secured commitments from 271 of 279 Southern convention delegates to back Goldwater. Grenier would serve as executive director of the national GOP during the Goldwater campaign, the number 2 position to party chairman [[Dean Burch]] of Arizona.\n\nJournalist John Adams says, \"his acceptance speech was bold, reflecting his conservative views, but not irrational.  Rather than shrinking from those critics who accuse him of extremism, Goldwater challenged them head-on\" in his acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican Convention.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, John |title=In the Trenches: Adventures in Journalism and Public Affairs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsALOP-k6-gC&pg=PA73|year=2012|pages=73\u2013|isbn=9781462067831}}</ref> In his own words:\n{{quote|I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.

Jaffa]], though the speech was primarily written by [[Karl Hess]]. Because of President Johnson's popularity, Goldwater refrained from attacking the president directly. He did not mention Johnson by name at all in his convention speech.\n\n[[File:Goldwater-Reagan in 1964.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ronald Reagan]] speaks for presidential candidate Goldwater in Los Angeles, 1964]]\nFormer U.S. Senator [[Prescott Bush]], a [[moderate Republican]] from [[Connecticut]], was a friend of Goldwater and supported him in the general election campaign. Bush's son, [[George H. W. Bush]] (then running for the Senate from Texas against Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough]]), was also a strong Goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns.\n\nFuture Chief Justice of the United States and fellow Arizonan [[William H. Rehnquist]] also first came to the attention of national Republicans through his work as a legal adviser to Goldwater's presidential campaign. Rehnquist had begun his law practice in 1953 in the firm of [[Denison Kitchel]] of Phoenix, Goldwater's national campaign manager and friend of nearly three decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/24/local/me-kitchel24|title=Denison Kitchel, 94; Ran Goldwater's Presidential Bid|date=October 24, 2002|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 2, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106065221/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/24/local/me-kitchel24|archivedate=November 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nGoldwater was painted as a dangerous figure by the Johnson campaign, which countered Goldwater's slogan \"In your heart, you know he's right\" with the lines \"In your guts, you know he's nuts,\" and \"In your heart, you know he might\" (that is, he might actually use nuclear weapons as opposed to using only [[deterrence theory|deterrence]]). Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]].\n\nGoldwater's provocative advocacy of aggressive tactics to prevent the spread of communism in Asia led to effective counterattacks from [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his supporters, who claimed that Goldwater's militancy would have dire consequences, possibly even nuclear war. In a May 1964 speech, Goldwater suggested that nuclear weapons should be treated more like conventional weapons and used in Vietnam, specifically that they should have been used at [[Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954 to defoliate trees.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nuclear Weapons and the Vietnam War |url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf |last=Tannenwald |first=Nina |journal=The Journal of Strategic Studies |volume=29 |issue=4 |year=2006 |pages=675\u2013722 |doi=10.1080/01402390600766148 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101174405/http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf |archivedate=November 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Regarding Vietnam, Goldwater charged that Johnson's policy was devoid of \"goal, course, or purpose,\" leaving \"only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom\".<ref>Matthews 2002</ref> Goldwater's rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising, a view buttressed by off-hand comments such as, \"Let's lob one into the men's room at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].\"<ref>{{cite journal |work=Harper's Magazine |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091012003831/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|title=Tentacles of Rage: The Republican propaganda mill, a brief history|author=Lapham, Lewis H. |volume=309|issue=1852|date= September 2004 |archivedate=October 12, 2009}}</ref> He also advocated that field commanders in Vietnam and Europe should be given the authority to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s (which he called \"small conventional nuclear weapons\") without presidential confirmation.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=rUwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11-IA1&dq=goldwater+1964+%22small+conventional+nuclear+weapons%22)+intitle:life |title=Our Defense: a Crucial Issue for Candidates |work=Life |date=September 25, 1964 |page=11 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1964 Barry Goldwater bumper sticker.jpg|thumb|1964 presidential campaign bumper sticker representing the Goldwater surname as Au = gold and H<sub>2</sub>O = water]]\nGoldwater countered the Johnson attacks by criticizing the administration for its perceived ethical lapses, and stating in a commercial that \"we, as a nation, are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people....

''Fact'' had mailed questionnaires to 12,356 psychiatrists, receiving responses from 2,417, of whom 1,189 said Goldwater was mentally incapable of holding the office of president.

The Southern states, traditionally Democratic up to that time, voted Republican primarily as a statement of opposition to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], which had been passed by Johnson and the Northern Democrats, as well as the majority of Republicans in Congress, earlier that year.<ref name=\"Bernard Cosman 1966\" /><ref>Charles S Bullock III, and Mark J. Rozell, ''The Oxford Handbook of Southern Politics'' (2012) p. 303</ref>\n\nIn the end, Goldwater received 38% of the popular vote, and carried just six states: Arizona (with 51% of the popular vote) and the core states of the [[Deep South]]: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In carrying Georgia by a margin of 54\u201345%, Goldwater became the first Republican nominee to win the state. However, the overall result was the worst showing in terms of popular vote and electoral college vote for any post-World War II Republican.  Indeed, he wouldn't have even carried his own state if not for a 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.\n\nIn all, Johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes, to Goldwater's 52. Goldwater, with his customary bluntness, remarked, \"We would have lost even if [[Abraham Lincoln]] had come back and campaigned with us.\" He maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief following the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], and that it was simply not ready for a third president in just 14 months.\n\nGoldwater's poor showing pulled down many supporters. Of the 57 Republican Congressmen who endorsed Goldwater before the convention, 20 were defeated for reelection, along with many promising young Republicans. On the other hand, the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives to move up the ladder. While the loss of moderate Republicans was temporary\u2014they were back by 1966\u2014Goldwater also permanently pulled many conservative Southerners and white ethnics out of the [[New Deal Coalition]].<ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' pp. 232\u201337</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Steve Kornacki]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', \"Goldwater broke through and won five [Southern] states\u2014the best showing in the region for a GOP candidate since Reconstruction.

He was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980. The [[United States Senate elections, 1974|1974]] election saw Goldwater easily reelected over his Democratic opponent, Jonathan Marshall, the publisher of ''The Scottsdale Progress''.\n\nWith his fourth Senate term due to end in January 1981, Goldwater seriously considered retiring from the Senate in 1980 before deciding to run for one final term. It was a surprisingly tough [[1980 United States Senate election in Arizona|battle for re-election]]. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons. Chief among them was that Goldwater, because he had planned to retire in 1981, had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. Additionally, his challenger, [[Bill Schulz (politician)|Bill Schulz]], proved to be a formidable opponent. A former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy real estate developer, his campaign slogan was \"Energy for the Eighties.\" In the general election, Goldwater won by a very narrow margin, receiving 49.5% of the vote to Schulz's 48.4%.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Schulz, William| url=http://www.ahfweb.org/download/Schulz_MSS_125.pdf| website=ahfweb.org| publisher=Arizona Historical Foundation| location=Tempe, Arizona| accessdate=November 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArizona's changing population also hurt Goldwater. The state's population had soared, and a huge portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; hence, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater's actual beliefs, and he was on the defensive for much of the campaign. Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to [[absentee ballot]]s, which were among the last to be counted.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | loc = chapter 12}} Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over [[Jimmy Carter]] in Arizona. Republicans regained control of the Senate, putting Goldwater in the most powerful position he ever had in the Senate.\n\n=== Retirement ===\n\nGoldwater said later that the close result in 1980 convinced him not to run again.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I | title = YouTube | publisher = Google| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101104112917/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I| archivedate = November 4, 2010}}</ref> He retired in 1987, serving as chair of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees in his final term. Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s, by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the Senate, one of the most respected members of either major party. Although Goldwater remained staunchly anti-communist and \"hawkish\" on military issues, he was a key supporter of the fight for ratification of the [[Panama Canal Treaty]] in the 1970s, which would give control of the canal zone to the Republic of [[Panama]]. His most important legislative achievement may have been the [[Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act]], which reorganized the U.S. military's senior-command structure.\n\n== Policies ==\nGoldwater became most associated with labor-union reform and anti-communism; he was a supporter of the [[conservative coalition]] in Congress. His work on labor issues led to Congress passing major anti-corruption reforms in 1957, and an all-out campaign by the [[AFL-CIO]] to defeat his 1958 reelection bid. He voted against the censure of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, but he never actually charged any individual with being a communist/Soviet agent. Goldwater emphasized his strong opposition to the worldwide spread of communism in his 1960 book ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]''. The book became an important reference text in conservative political circles.\n\n[[File:Informal press conference following a meeting between Congressmen and the President to discuss Watergate matters. - NARA - 194590.jpg|thumb|Informal press conference August 7, 1974 (one day before Nixon announced his resignation) following a meeting between Goldwater, [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Hugh Scott|Scott]], [[House Minority Leader]] [[John Jacob Rhodes|Rhodes]] and the President to discuss the [[Watergate scandal]] and [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment process]]]]\nIn 1964, Goldwater ran a conservative campaign that emphasized states' rights.{{Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | p = 20}}  Goldwater's 1964 campaign was a magnet for conservatives since he opposed interference by the federal government in state affairs. Although he had supported all previous federal civil rights legislation including the 1957 Civil Rights Act H.R. 6127 and the 1960 Civil Rights Act H.R. 8601{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and had supported the original Senate version of the bill, Goldwater made the decision to oppose the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. His stance was based on his view that Article II and Article VII of the Act interfered with the rights of private persons to do or not to do business with whomever they chose, and believed that the private employment provisions of the Act would lead to racial quotas.{{Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | pp = 152\u201379}} In the segregated city of Phoenix in the 1950s, he had quietly supported civil rights for blacks, but would not let his name be used.<ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' (1995) pp. 88\u201390</ref>\n\nAll this [[Southern strategy|appealed to white Southern Democrats]], and Goldwater was the first Republican to win the electoral votes of all of the Deep South states ([[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]) since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]<ref name=\"Bernard Cosman 1966\">{{Citation | first = Bernard | last = Cosman | title = Five States for Goldwater: Continuity and change in Southern presidential voting patterns | year = 1966}}</ref> (although Dwight Eisenhower did carry Louisiana in 1956). However, Goldwater's vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign everywhere outside the South (besides Dixie, Goldwater won only in Arizona, his home state), contributing to his landslide defeat in 1964.\n\nWhile Goldwater had been depicted by his opponents in the Republican primaries as a representative of a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] philosophy that was extreme and alien, his voting records show that his positions were in harmony with those of his fellow Republicans in the Congress. According to [[Hans J.

Kennedy]], as president, was known to invite former congressional colleagues to the White House for a drink. On one occasion, Goldwater brought his camera and photographed President Kennedy. When Kennedy received the photo, he returned it to Goldwater, with the inscription, \"For Barry Goldwater\u2014Whom I urge to follow the career for which he has shown such talent\u2014photography!\u2014from his friend \u2013 John Kennedy.\" This quip became a classic of American political humor after it was made famous by humorist [[Bennett Cerf]]. The photo itself was prized by Goldwater for the rest of his life, and recently sold for $17,925 in a [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |title=Heritage Auctions description of signed Kennedy photo |publisher=Historical.ha.com |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221045509/http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |archivedate=February 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSon Michael Prescott Goldwater formed the Goldwater Family Foundation with the goal of making his father's photography available via the internet.

According to Goldwater, an angry LeMay gave him \"holy hell\" and said, \"Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever mention it to me again.\"<ref>{{cite news| first = Burton | last = Bernstein | title = AuH2O | newspaper = The New Yorker | date = April 25, 1988 | pages = 43, 71 |nopp=y}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1988 interview on [[Larry King]]'s radio show, Goldwater was asked if he thought the U.S. Government was withholding UFO evidence; he replied \"Yes, I do.\" He added:\n{{quote | I certainly believe in aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities...

Despite his loss of the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]] in a landslide, Goldwater is the politician most often credited with having sparked the resurgence of the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] political movement in the 1960s.

A significant accomplishment of his career was the passage of the [[Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act]] of 1986. He was succeeded by [[John McCain]], who praised his predecessor as the man who \"transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan.\" Goldwater strongly supported the [[Ronald Reagan 1980 presidential campaign|1980 presidential campaign of Reagan]], who had become the standard-bearer of the conservative movement after his \"[[A Time for Choosing]]\" speech. Reagan reflected many of the principles of Goldwater's earlier run in his campaign. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist [[George Will]] took note of this, writing: \"We [...] who voted for him in 1964 believe he won, it just took 16 years to count the votes.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Senate, Goldwater's views cemented as libertarian. He criticized the \"moneymaking ventures by fellows like [[Pat Robertson]] and others [in the Republican Party] who are trying to...make a religious organization out of it.\" He lobbied for homosexuals to be able to serve openly in the military, opposed the [[Clinton administration]]'s plan for health care reform, and supported abortion rights and the legalization of medicinal marijuana.

The visitor center at the Academy is now named in his honor.

He was outspoken against [[Modern liberalism in the United States|New Deal liberalism]], especially its close ties to labor unions. A pilot, amateur radio operator, outdoorsman and photographer, he criss-crossed Arizona and developed a deep interest in both the natural and the human history of the state.\n\nHe entered Phoenix politics in 1949, when he was elected to the City Council as part of a nonpartisan team of candidates pledged to clean up widespread prostitution and gambling. The team won every mayoral and council election for the next two decades.

He won largely by defeating McFarland in his native [[Maricopa County]] by 12,600 votes, almost double the overall margin of 6,725 votes. As a measure of how Democratic Arizona had been since joining the Union 40 years earlier, Goldwater was only the second Republican ever to represent Arizona in the Senate.  In his first year in the Senate he desegregated the Senate cafeteria, insisting that his black legislative assistant, Kathrine Maxwell, be served along with every other Senate employee.<ref>Edwards, Lee (1995) Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution p.231</ref> He defeated McFarland again in [[United States Senate elections, 1958|1958]], with a strong showing in his first reelection; he was the first Arizona Republican to win a second term in the Senate.

Goldwater alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch [[Fiscal conservatives|fiscal conservatism]] and militant [[anti-communism]]. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on the right wing of the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, moderate Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Pennsylvania]] Governor [[William Scranton]], to challenge him. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination. He also had a solid backing from Southern Republicans. A young [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] lawyer, [[John Grenier]], secured commitments from 271 of 279 Southern convention delegates to back Goldwater. Grenier would serve as executive director of the national GOP during the Goldwater campaign, the number 2 position to party chairman [[Dean Burch]] of Arizona.\n\nJournalist John Adams says, \"his acceptance speech was bold, reflecting his conservative views, but not irrational.

In a May 1964 speech, Goldwater suggested that nuclear weapons should be treated more like conventional weapons and used in Vietnam, specifically that they should have been used at [[Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954 to defoliate trees.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nuclear Weapons and the Vietnam War |url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf |last=Tannenwald |first=Nina |journal=The Journal of Strategic Studies |volume=29 |issue=4 |year=2006 |pages=675\u2013722 |doi=10.1080/01402390600766148 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101174405/http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf |archivedate=November 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Regarding Vietnam, Goldwater charged that Johnson's policy was devoid of \"goal, course, or purpose,\" leaving \"only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom\".<ref>Matthews 2002</ref> Goldwater's rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising, a view buttressed by off-hand comments such as, \"Let's lob one into the men's room at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].\"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Harper's Magazine |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091012003831/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|title=Tentacles of Rage: The Republican propaganda mill, a brief history|author=Lapham, Lewis H. |volume=309|issue=1852|date= September 2004 |archivedate=October 12, 2009}}</ref> He also advocated that field commanders in Vietnam and Europe should be given the authority to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s (which he called \"small conventional nuclear weapons\") without presidential confirmation.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=rUwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11-IA1&dq=goldwater+1964+%22small+conventional+nuclear+weapons%22)+intitle:life |title=Our Defense: a Crucial Issue for Candidates |work=Life |date=September 25, 1964 |page=11 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1964 Barry Goldwater bumper sticker.jpg|thumb|1964 presidential campaign bumper sticker representing the Goldwater surname as Au = gold and H<sub>2</sub>O = water]]\nGoldwater countered the Johnson attacks by criticizing the administration for its perceived ethical lapses, and stating in a commercial that \"we, as a nation, are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people....

The Southern states, traditionally Democratic up to that time, voted Republican primarily as a statement of opposition to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], which had been passed by Johnson and the Northern Democrats, as well as the majority of Republicans in Congress, earlier that year.<ref name=\"Bernard Cosman 1966\" /><ref>Charles S Bullock III, and Mark J. Rozell, ''The Oxford Handbook of Southern Politics'' (2012) p. 303</ref>\n\nIn the end, Goldwater received 38% of the popular vote, and carried just six states: Arizona (with 51% of the popular vote) and the core states of the [[Deep South]]: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In carrying Georgia by a margin of 54\u201345%, Goldwater became the first Republican nominee to win the state. However, the overall result was the worst showing in terms of popular vote and electoral college vote for any post-World War II Republican.  Indeed, he wouldn't have even carried his own state if not for a 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.\n\nIn all, Johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes, to Goldwater's 52. Goldwater, with his customary bluntness, remarked, \"We would have lost even if [[Abraham Lincoln]] had come back and campaigned with us.\" He maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief following the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], and that it was simply not ready for a third president in just 14 months.\n\nGoldwater's poor showing pulled down many supporters. Of the 57 Republican Congressmen who endorsed Goldwater before the convention, 20 were defeated for reelection, along with many promising young Republicans. On the other hand, the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives to move up the ladder. While the loss of moderate Republicans was temporary\u2014they were back by 1966\u2014Goldwater also permanently pulled many conservative Southerners and white ethnics out of the [[New Deal Coalition]].<ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' pp. 232\u201337</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Steve Kornacki]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', \"Goldwater broke through and won five [Southern] states\u2014the best showing in the region for a GOP candidate since Reconstruction.

He was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980. The [[United States Senate elections, 1974|1974]] election saw Goldwater easily reelected over his Democratic opponent, Jonathan Marshall, the publisher of ''The Scottsdale Progress''.\n\nWith his fourth Senate term due to end in January 1981, Goldwater seriously considered retiring from the Senate in 1980 before deciding to run for one final term. It was a surprisingly tough [[1980 United States Senate election in Arizona|battle for re-election]]. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons. Chief among them was that Goldwater, because he had planned to retire in 1981, had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. Additionally, his challenger, [[Bill Schulz (politician)|Bill Schulz]], proved to be a formidable opponent. A former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy real estate developer, his campaign slogan was \"Energy for the Eighties.\" In the general election, Goldwater won by a very narrow margin, receiving 49.5% of the vote to Schulz's 48.4%.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Schulz, William| url=http://www.ahfweb.org/download/Schulz_MSS_125.pdf| website=ahfweb.org| publisher=Arizona Historical Foundation| location=Tempe, Arizona| accessdate=November 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArizona's changing population also hurt Goldwater. The state's population had soared, and a huge portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; hence, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater's actual beliefs, and he was on the defensive for much of the campaign. Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to [[absentee ballot]]s, which were among the last to be counted.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | loc = chapter 12}} Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over [[Jimmy Carter]] in Arizona.

Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s, by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the Senate, one of the most respected members of either major party. Although Goldwater remained staunchly anti-communist and \"hawkish\" on military issues, he was a key supporter of the fight for ratification of the [[Panama Canal Treaty]] in the 1970s, which would give control of the canal zone to the Republic of [[Panama]]. His most important legislative achievement may have been the [[Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act]], which reorganized the U.S. military's senior-command structure.\n\n== Policies ==\nGoldwater became most associated with labor-union reform and anti-communism; he was a supporter of the [[conservative coalition]] in Congress. His work on labor issues led to Congress passing major anti-corruption reforms in 1957, and an all-out campaign by the [[AFL-CIO]] to defeat his 1958 reelection bid. He voted against the censure of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, but he never actually charged any individual with being a communist/Soviet agent. Goldwater emphasized his strong opposition to the worldwide spread of communism in his 1960 book ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]''. The book became an important reference text in conservative political circles.\n\n[[File:Informal press conference following a meeting between Congressmen and the President to discuss Watergate matters. - NARA - 194590.jpg|thumb|Informal press conference August 7, 1974 (one day before Nixon announced his resignation) following a meeting between Goldwater, [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Hugh Scott|Scott]], [[House Minority Leader]] [[John Jacob Rhodes|Rhodes]] and the President to discuss the [[Watergate scandal]] and [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment process]]]]\nIn 1964, Goldwater ran a conservative campaign that emphasized states' rights.{{Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | p = 20}}  Goldwater's 1964 campaign was a magnet for conservatives since he opposed interference by the federal government in state affairs.

His stance was based on his view that Article II and Article VII of the Act interfered with the rights of private persons to do or not to do business with whomever they chose, and believed that the private employment provisions of the Act would lead to racial quotas.{{Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | pp = 152\u201379}} In the segregated city of Phoenix in the 1950s, he had quietly supported civil rights for blacks, but would not let his name be used.<ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' (1995) pp. 88\u201390</ref>\n\nAll this [[Southern strategy|appealed to white Southern Democrats]], and Goldwater was the first Republican to win the electoral votes of all of the Deep South states ([[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]) since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]<ref name=\"Bernard Cosman 1966\">{{Citation | first = Bernard | last = Cosman | title = Five States for Goldwater: Continuity and change in Southern presidential voting patterns | year = 1966}}</ref> (although Dwight Eisenhower did carry Louisiana in 1956). However, Goldwater's vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign everywhere outside the South (besides Dixie, Goldwater won only in Arizona, his home state), contributing to his landslide defeat in 1964.\n\nWhile Goldwater had been depicted by his opponents in the Republican primaries as a representative of a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] philosophy that was extreme and alien, his voting records show that his positions were in harmony with those of his fellow Republicans in the Congress. According to [[Hans J. Morgenthau]], what distinguished him from his predecessors was his firmness of principle and determination, which did not allow him to be content with mere rhetoric.<ref>{{Citation | first = Hans J | last = Morgenthau | title = Goldwater \u2013 The Romantic Regression | newspaper = Commentary |date=September 1964}}</ref>\n\nGoldwater fought in 1971 to stop U.S. funding of the United Nations after the People's Republic of China was admitted to the organization.

The building complex had been heavily fortified by [[Khalistan movement|Khalistani militants]] and its gate was barricaded. Joshi's platoon was bogged down by heavy volume of fire as soon as the gate was breached. Joshi volunteered along with several other members of his platoon at the behest of his Commanding Officer to storm positions held by the militants. Joshi led his section in this operation, killing one militant with his carbine and bayoneting another to death and clearing the way for his platoon to capture its objective despite being wounded in the attack.

However, Flamengo began to assert themselves on the counter-attack, with [[Gabriel Barbosa]] and [[\u00c9verton Ribeiro]] nearly scoring while Borr\u00e9 was down with an injury. Flamengo substitute [[Diego (footballer, born 1985)|Diego]] was brought on for [[Gerson (footballer, born 1997)|Gerson]] in the 66th minute, and he helped Flamengo turn the match around. Diego began several counter-attacks, including in the 75th minute when he linked up with [[Bruno Henrique Pinto]] and Gabriel. The score was still 1-0 in the 89th minute, with River Plate seeking to finish off the game, when Flamengo's Arrascaeta won the ball from [[Lucas Pratto]] in his own half, and started a counter-attack by passing to Bruno Henrique. Henrique dribbled the ball down the left wing and cut inside; near the opposing goal, he passed the ball to Arrascaeta, who avoided the goalkeeper's challenge to pass to an open Gabriel who scored a tap-in to tie the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/nov/23/flamengo-v-river-plate-copa-libertadores-final-live|title=Flamengo 2\u20131 River Plate: Copa Libertadores final \u2013 as it happened|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|first=Will|last=Unwin|date=23 November 2019|accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThree minutes later (in the second minute of [[injury time]]), Diego launched a deep pass from his own half that both River Plate [[centre back]]s missed. This allowed Gabriel to score again, giving Flamengo a 2-1 lead.

River Plate had numerous chances for a second goal in the first half: Borr\u00e9 missed a opportunity by inches, [[Nicol\u00e1s De La Cruz]] missed a good chance in the 21st minute, and [[Exequiel Palacios]] had two long-distance shots that nearly went in.

However, Flamengo began to assert themselves on the counter-attack, with [[Gabriel Barbosa]] and [[\u00c9verton Ribeiro]] nearly scoring while Borr\u00e9 was down with an injury. Flamengo substitute [[Diego (footballer, born 1985)|Diego]] was brought on for [[Gerson (footballer, born 1997)|Gerson]] in the 66th minute, and he helped Flamengo turn the match around. Diego began several counter-attacks, including in the 75th minute when he linked up with [[Bruno Henrique Pinto]] and Gabriel. The score was still 1-0 in the 89th minute, with River Plate seeking to finish off the game, when Flamengo's Arrascaeta won the ball from [[Lucas Pratto]] in his own half, and started a counter-attack by passing to Bruno Henrique. Henrique dribbled the ball down the left wing and cut inside; near the opposing goal, he passed the ball to Arrascaeta, who avoided the goalkeeper's challenge to pass to an open Gabriel who scored a tap-in to tie the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/nov/23/flamengo-v-river-plate-copa-libertadores-final-live|title=Flamengo 2\u20131 River Plate: Copa Libertadores final \u2013 as it happened|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|first=Will|last=Unwin|date=23 November 2019|accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThree minutes later (in the second minute of [[injury time]]), Diego launched a deep pass from his own half that both River Plate [[centre back]]s missed. This allowed Gabriel to score again, giving Flamengo a 2-1 lead. The sudden reversal of fortune caused tempers to flare: Palacios kicked Bruno Henrique in the 95th minute, for which he received a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]]. Gabriel Barbosa sarcastically applauded the referee in response; he also received a red card. The match ended shortly thereafter.

The roar of the waters, the thousands of passenger fish leaping at the falls with all their might, the fishermen coming out in boats, and taking post on all the rocks with rod and hook, hippopotami and crocodiles lying sleepily on the water, the ferry at work above the falls, and cattle driven down to drink at the margin of the lake, made in all, with the pretty nature of the country\u2014small grassy-topped hills, with trees in the intervening valleys and on the lower slopes\u2014as interesting a picture as one could wish to see.\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Great African Travellers, From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley, The Project Gutenberg EBook of Great African Travellers | accessdate=23 February 2015 | date=2007 | first=W.

The roar of the waters, the thousands of passenger fish leaping at the falls with all their might, the fishermen coming out in boats, and taking post on all the rocks with rod and hook, hippopotami and crocodiles lying sleepily on the water, the ferry at work above the falls, and cattle driven down to drink at the margin of the lake, made in all, with the pretty nature of the country\u2014small grassy-topped hills, with trees in the intervening valleys and on the lower slopes\u2014as interesting a picture as one could wish to see.\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Great African Travellers, From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley, The Project Gutenberg EBook of Great African Travellers | accessdate=23 February 2015 | date=2007 | first=W.

Further to this all marked police vehicles use LED lightbars. The older halogen light bars have been phased out.\n\nThe LED light-bars are much easier to see, due to the increased lumen output. The LED light bars contain red lights at the rear, which can be used to indicate to other road users that the vehicle is stationary. They also contain both left and right spots lights, called side alley lights, that can be used to illuminate door numbers when quickly trying to find an address.\n\nThe roads policing unit utilize a premier hazard light-bar. This offers a more customizable light bar, with the option to cycle between flash patterns. It also allows officers the choice, of illuminating only the front or rear LED\u2019s.\n\nAdditionally, the road policing unit vehicles contain a premier hazard message board. This can display a scrolling message to drivers, such as \u201cFollow Me\u201d\n\nIRT (Incident response team) vehicles benefit from a single video camera with no audio function. This is located at the front of the vehicle, near the rear-view mirror. The camera remains recording for 20 minutes after the vehicle\u2019s ignition has been turned off. IRT vehicles also contain a black box, that records a vehicles speed, acceleration, braking time, and light usage. This is automatically uploaded to a \u2018cloud\u2019 storage device via WIFI, once the vehicle returns to station.\n\nRoads Policing vehicles contain a Pro-vida recording camera. This is able to record audio, as well as display the speed of the vehicle, and its location.\n\nAdditionally, Roads Policing Vehicles contain ANPR capabilities. This automatically reads the registration plate of a vehicle, and displays information with regards to insurance details, including the holders name and d.o.b. as well as the tax and mot status of a vehicle. It further provides information to any \u2018markers\u2019 placed on a vehicle or its named driver. Humberside Police traffic officers also carry a handheld Pro Lazer 4 speed gun, drugs swipe and a Breathalyzer. IRT patrol cars do not contain a ANPR device and manually have to search a vehicles detail using their radio or handheld computer.\n\n<!--Does this need to be in here..?\n==== <u>Emergency Driving Course</u> ====\nIRT officers are placed on a 3 weeks blue light driving course. This is known as basic emergency driving. If Police officers are not trained in emergency blue light driving, they may not utilize their emergency lights and sirens, unless the vehicle is stationary. In this scenario, blue lights may be used as means of warning such as required when directing traffic.\n\nAlthough except by Section 87 of the Road Traffic Act, meaning officers cannot technically be done for speeding whilst travelling on blue lights, internal policy states an officer must only drive a maximum of 20mph over the speed limit. IRT officers cannot pursue a vehicle unless they are initial phase pursuit trained. This does not apply to traffic officers.\n\nThe use of Blue Lights is not mandatory, when an officer is appropriately trained, and responding to an emergency. The Blue lights are for the benefit of public road users to act as a warning of the vehicles speed. Officers may choose to, if they wish to drive in an emergency, without using emergency lighting equipment. An example of this may include making a \u2018silent approach\u2019 to a victim of crime, where an offender is still on scene, and subsequently the Police officer does not wish to advertise their presence.\n\nUpon qualifying as a Traffic or Firearms Police Officer, applicants are placed on an further 3.5 weeks advanced emergency driving course. Subsequently, Traffic Police Officers are no longer restricted by internal policy, as to how fast they may travel. Instead they must continually risk assess their speed, to ensure it is appropriate.\n\nTraffic Police Officers are also taught how to make tactical contact and are trained in T-Pack manoeuvres.\n\n== Vehicles in use: ==\n'''<u>IRT (Incident Response Team) Vehicles</u>'''\n\nThese are vehicles used by the IRT for the purpose of general policing. These vehicles include Peugeot 308, a Vauxhall Astra and Ford Transit Boxer vans. The Ford Transit Boxer Van contain a cell in the rear capable of housing 2 prisoners. In 2019 Humberside Police trialled a Peugeot 308, that contains a cell, capable of housing 1 prisoner. \u00a0\n\nIRT officers also use a Mercedes Sprinter van. This is primarily used for carrying a large number of officers, such as required when providing PSU officers for public order.\n\nIRT also utilize the Mercedes Sprinter for patrolling the areas surrounding pubs and clubs at night. The Mercedes Sprinters, like the Ford Transit, also contain a cell in the rear capable of housing 2 prisoners.\n\nHumberside Police had previously won the top award in the National Energy Efficiency Awards by running the vast majority of its fleet on Liquified Petroleum Gas. Most Protons where converted to run on LPG. This was reverted, and the vehicles where converted back to running on unleaded petrol, due both reliability issues and the rising cost of LPG. Humberside Police have practically phased out the aging [[Proton Waja|Proton Impian]]. Most patrol vehicles now run on diesel.\n\n'''<u>Communities Policing</u>'''\n\nThe community\u2019s team within Humberside Police use a Vauxhall Corsa as their main vehicle. This comes in two different liveries. One being a fully marked police vehicle, and the other being a marked Police Community Support Officer vehicle.\n\nThe communities policing team may also use an unmarked Peugeot 208, as well as the above-mentioned vehicle from IRT.\n\n'''<u>Detectives & Investigating officers</u>'''\n\nBoth detectives and investigating officers use unmarked Peugeot 208\u2019s to carry out enquires. These vehicles do not contain lights and sirens and are not to be utilized for front line policing.\n\n'''<u>Crime Scene Investigators</u>'''\n\nHumberside Police scenes of crime, police staff use a Vauxhall Vivaro vans as there means of transport. These vehicles are marked with police Battenberg; however they do not house LED emergency lighting. This is due to the role of a CSI officer being a civilian one.\n\n'''<u>Roads Policing Unit</u>'''\n\nHumberside Police utilize both a BMW X5\u2019s and a BMW 330D for the purpose of roads policing.\n\nThe BMW 5 series primarily belong to Humberside Polices Firearms unit, however, are utilized when necessary by traffic officers such as when poor road conditions dictate.\n\nBoth the BMW X5\u2019s and BMW 330D\u2019s come in marked and unmarked variants.\n\nThe Roads Policing Unit and Humberside Polices Firearms Unit are now based at Melton, on the North Bank of the Humber as opposed to being based in various locations around the force. This has enabled the section to respond to incidents more quickly and efficiently.\n\nHumberside Police\u2019s roads policing unit did previously use the BMW F11, 5 series 530D. However, only a few remain in use, as they where deemed too expensive.\n\nContrary to popular belief the Roads Policing Vehicles are not specially tuned. They do not benefit from a remapped engine for greater power output. The primary focus of a police pursuit is safety. This is the reason Humberside Police opt for the BMW 330d as opposed to the BMW 335d.\n\nAgain, contrary to popular belief, Humberside Police do not use Volvo\u2019s as Traffic Police cars anymore. In 2019 Humberside Police did trial the Volvo V90, however the trail showed the Volvo V90 performed poorly for pursuits in Urban areas, in comparison to the well-established BMW 330d therefore was never ordered.\n\nIn 2008, Humberside Police made a statement, to deter offending criminals from utilizing the road network. Humberside Police purchased a 5 high powered vehicles. The vehicles often patrolled in the following trio;\n\nThe first of the trio was a Lexus IS F. Under the bonnet it contained a 5.0 Litre V8, producing 417 bhp. The Lexus IS F had a 0-60 of 4.6 seconds. The registration plate of this vehicle was YX58 FLE.\n\nThe second of the trio was a Mitsubishi Lancer EVO X FQ-360. This produced 354 bhp with a 0-60 of 4.1 seconds.

Further to this all marked police vehicles use LED lightbars. The older halogen light bars have been phased out.\n\nThe LED light-bars are much easier to see, due to the increased lumen output. The LED light bars contain red lights at the rear, which can be used to indicate to other road users that the vehicle is stationary. They also contain both left and right spots lights, called side alley lights, that can be used to illuminate door numbers when quickly trying to find an address.\n\nThe roads policing unit utilize a premier hazard light-bar. This offers a more customizable light bar, with the option to cycle between flash patterns. It also allows officers the choice, of illuminating only the front or rear LED\u2019s.\n\nAdditionally, the road policing unit vehicles contain a premier hazard message board. This can display a scrolling message to drivers, such as \u201cFollow Me\u201d\n\nIRT (Incident response team) vehicles benefit from a single video camera with no audio function. This is located at the front of the vehicle, near the rear-view mirror. The camera remains recording for 20 minutes after the vehicle\u2019s ignition has been turned off. IRT vehicles also contain a black box, that records a vehicles speed, acceleration, braking time, and light usage. This is automatically uploaded to a \u2018cloud\u2019 storage device via WIFI, once the vehicle returns to station.\n\nRoads Policing vehicles contain a Pro-vida recording camera. This is able to record audio, as well as display the speed of the vehicle, and its location.\n\nAdditionally, Roads Policing Vehicles contain ANPR capabilities. This automatically reads the registration plate of a vehicle, and displays information with regards to insurance details, including the holders name and d.o.b. as well as the tax and mot status of a vehicle. It further provides information to any \u2018markers\u2019 placed on a vehicle or its named driver. Humberside Police traffic officers also carry a handheld Pro Lazer 4 speed gun, drugs swipe and a Breathalyzer. IRT patrol cars do not contain a ANPR device and manually have to search a vehicles detail using their radio or handheld computer.\n\n<!--Does this need to be in here..?\n==== <u>Emergency Driving Course</u> ====\nIRT officers are placed on a 3 weeks blue light driving course. This is known as basic emergency driving. If Police officers are not trained in emergency blue light driving, they may not utilize their emergency lights and sirens, unless the vehicle is stationary. In this scenario, blue lights may be used as means of warning such as required when directing traffic.\n\nAlthough except by Section 87 of the Road Traffic Act, meaning officers cannot technically be done for speeding whilst travelling on blue lights, internal policy states an officer must only drive a maximum of 20mph over the speed limit. IRT officers cannot pursue a vehicle unless they are initial phase pursuit trained. This does not apply to traffic officers.\n\nThe use of Blue Lights is not mandatory, when an officer is appropriately trained, and responding to an emergency. The Blue lights are for the benefit of public road users to act as a warning of the vehicles speed. Officers may choose to, if they wish to drive in an emergency, without using emergency lighting equipment. An example of this may include making a \u2018silent approach\u2019 to a victim of crime, where an offender is still on scene, and subsequently the Police officer does not wish to advertise their presence.\n\nUpon qualifying as a Traffic or Firearms Police Officer, applicants are placed on an further 3.5 weeks advanced emergency driving course. Subsequently, Traffic Police Officers are no longer restricted by internal policy, as to how fast they may travel. Instead they must continually risk asses their speed, to ensure it is appropriate.\n\nTraffic Police Officers are also taught how to make tactical contact and are trained in T-Pack manoeuvres.\n\n== Vehicles in use: ==\n'''<u>IRT (Incident Response Team) Vehicles</u>'''\n\nThese are vehicles used by the IRT for the purpose of general policing. These vehicles include Peugeot 308, a Vauxhall Astra and Ford Transit Boxer vans. The Ford Transit Boxer Van contain a cell in the rear capable of housing 2 prisoners. In 2019 Humberside Police trialled a Peugeot 308, that contains a cell, capable of housing 1 prisoner. \u00a0\n\nIRT officers also use a Mercedes Sprinter van. This is primarily used for carrying a large number of officers, such as required when providing PSU officers for public order.\n\nIRT also utilize the Mercedes Sprinter for patrolling the areas surrounding pubs and clubs at night. The Mercedes Sprinters, like the Ford Transit, also contain a cell in the rear capable of housing 2 prisoners.\n\nHumberside Police had previously won the top award in the National Energy Efficiency Awards by running the vast majority of its fleet on Liquified Petroleum Gas. Most Protons where converted to run on LPG. This was reverted, and the vehicles where converted back to running on unleaded petrol, due both reliability issues and the rising cost of LPG. Humberside Police have practically phased out the aging [[Proton Waja|Proton Impian]]. Most patrol vehicles now run on diesel.\n\n'''<u>Communities Policing</u>'''\n\nThe community\u2019s team within Humberside Police use a Vauxhall Corsa as their main vehicle. This comes in two different liveries. One being a fully marked police vehicle, and the other being a marked Police Community Support Officer vehicle.\n\nThe communities policing team may also use an unmarked Peugeot 208, as well as the above-mentioned vehicle from IRT.\n\n'''<u>Detectives & Investigating officers</u>'''\n\nBoth detectives and investigating officers use unmarked Peugeot 208\u2019s to carry out enquires. These vehicles do not contain lights and sirens and are not to be utilized for front line policing.\n\n'''<u>Crime Scene Investigators</u>'''\n\nHumberside Police scenes of crime, police staff use a Vauxhall Vivaro vans as there means of transport. These vehicles are marked with police Battenberg; however they do not house LED emergency lighting. This is due to the role of a CSI officer being a civilian one.\n\n'''<u>Roads Policing Unit</u>'''\n\nHumberside Police utilize both a BMW X5\u2019s and a BMW 330D for the purpose of roads policing.\n\nThe BMW 5 series primarily belong to Humberside Polices Firearms unit, however, are utilized when necessary by traffic officers such as when poor road conditions dictate.\n\nBoth the BMW X5\u2019s and BMW 330D\u2019s come in marked and unmarked variants.\n\nThe Roads Policing Unit and Humberside Polices Firearms Unit are now based at Melton, on the North Bank of the Humber as opposed to being based in various locations around the force. This has enabled the section to respond to incidents more quickly and efficiently.\n\nHumberside Police\u2019s roads policing unit did previously use the BMW F11, 5 series 530D. However, only a few remain in use, as they where deemed too expensive.\n\nContrary to popular belief the Roads Policing Vehicles are not specially tuned. They do not benefit from a remapped engine for greater power output. The primary focus of a police pursuit is safety. This is the reason Humberside Police opt for the BMW 330d as opposed to the BMW 335d.\n\nAgain, contrary to popular belief, Humberside Police do not use Volvo\u2019s as Traffic Police cars anymore. In 2019 Humberside Police did trial the Volvo V90, however the trail showed the Volvo V90 performed poorly for pursuits in Urban areas, in comparison to the well-established BMW 330d therefore was never ordered.\n\nIn 2008, Humberside Police made a statement, to deter offending criminals from utilizing the road network. Humberside Police purchased a 5 high powered vehicles. The vehicles often patrolled in the following trio;\n\nThe first of the trio was a Lexus IS F. Under the bonnet it contained a 5.0 Litre V8, producing 417 bhp. The Lexus IS F had a 0-60 of 4.6 seconds. The registration plate of this vehicle was YX58 FLE.\n\nThe second of the trio was a Mitsubishi Lancer EVO X FQ-360. This produced 354 bhp with a 0-60 of 4.1 seconds. The registration plates of this vehicle was YX58 FLA, and YX58 FLC.\n\nThe final vehicle in the trio was a BMW 335d Estate, producing 281 BHP with a 0-60 of 5.9 seconds. The registration plates of this vehicle was YX58 FLB and YX58 FLD. This BMW offered Humberside Police insight into the pros and cons of using a BMW 335d, as opposed to the standard BMW 330d.\n\nIn 2004 Humberside Police purchased a Subaru Impreza WRX STI, producing 261 BHP. The registration plate of this vehicle was YX54 CXC. This was a continuation of the Subaru Impreza Turbo 2000 AWD, purchased by Humberside Police in 1998. It produced 208 bhp and was notably faster than most vehicles, at the time of purchase. The registration of this vehicle was R191 PKH.\n\nThe Subaru Impreza Turbo 2000 AWD was so iconic and popular amongst citizens, it was made into a scale model toy.
