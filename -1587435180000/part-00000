He hosted ''[[Ronan Farrow Daily]]'', a television news program on [[MSNBC]], then the investigative segment \"Undercover with Ronan Farrow\" on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]''.\n\n==== Abuse allegations against Bill Cosby and Woody Allen ====\n\nIn May 2016, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' published a guest column by Farrow in which he drew comparisons between the long-term absence of journalistic inquiry into the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault cases|rape allegations leveled against Bill Cosby]] and the [[Woody Allen sexual abuse allegation|sexual abuse allegations levied against his father Woody Allen]] by Farrow's sister, [[Dylan Farrow]], who was seven at the time of the alleged abuse. Ronan detailed first-hand accounts of journalists, biographers, and major publications purposefully omitting from their work decades of rape allegations targeting Cosby. Similarly, Ronan recounts the efforts of Allen's publicist, [[Leslee Dart]]\u2014co-CEO, and co-founder of a public-relations firm\u2014to mount a media campaign focused on countering Dylan's allegations, while working at vindicating her father:<blockquote>Every day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the emails blasted out by Allen's powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a robust publicity campaign to validate my father's sexual relationship with [[Soon-Yi Previn|another one of my siblings]]. Those emails featured talking points ready-made to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer\u2014therapists, lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points\u2014a self-perpetuating spin machine.</blockquote> Ronan believed his sister Dylan and related his concerns with their father going back to when they were young children. In closing, he expressed his view that media culture actively discourages victims of abuse from coming forward. He states that victims are pressured to remain silent by threat of \"having those tough newsroom conversations, making the case for burning bridges with powerful public figures\" as well as \"going up against angry fans and angry publicists\".\n\n==== Abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein, start of #MeToo ====\nIn October 2017, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published an investigative article by Ronan detailing [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|allegations of sexual misconduct]] against film producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] five days after ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the findings of its own investigation into Weinstein. A year prior, NBC had decided against airing Ronan's initial findings. ''The New Yorker'' won the [[2018 Pulitzer Prize|2018]] [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for Ronan's reporting, sharing the award with [[Jodi Kantor]] and [[Megan Twohey|Meghan Twohey]] at ''The New York Times''. Ronan was included in the ''Time'' \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" list in 2018.\n\nThe Weinstein allegations of abuse\u2014against a rich powerful man by numerous women whose careers were in ways directed by him\u2014kickstarted an international [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]] against [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault]].<ref name=\":65\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/|title=From Politics to Policy: Turning the Corner on Sexual Harassment \u2013 Center for American Progress|date=January 31, 2018|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"time17\">{{cite news|url=http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/|title=TIME Person of the Year 2018: The Silence Breakers|last=Edwards|first=Stephanie Zacharek, Eliana Dockterman, Haley Sweetland|access-date=April 14, 2018|website=Time}}</ref><ref name=\"Strause\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/me-founder-tarana-burke-responds-asia-argento-report-1135904|title=Tarana Burke Responds to Asia Argento Report: \"There Is No Model Survivor\"|last=Strause|first=Jackie|date=August 20, 2018|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}</ref> The movement began to spread [[Viral phenomenon|virally]] in October 2017 as a [[hashtag]] on [[social media]] in an attempt to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2017/12/20/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-in-a-metoo-world/|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace in A #MeToo World|last=Smartt|first=Nicole|website=Forbes|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116193245/https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2017/12/20/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-in-a-metoo-world/#7c439e1e5a42|archivedate=January 16, 2018|access-date=January 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers-choice/|title=The Choice: ''Time''{{'s}} Editor-in-chief on Why the Silence Breakers Are the Person of the Year|last=Felsenthal|first=Edward|date=December 18, 2017|website=Time|language=en-us|url-status=live|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/23/us/metoo-replacements.html?nl=top-stories&nlid=72995439ries&ref=cta|title=#MeToo Brought Down 201 Powerful Men.

Schneiderman resigned the following day. Mayer and Farrow reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations with photographs of contusions and with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated that he resigned because they \"effectively prevent me from leading the office's work\". \n\nTwo months later, in July 2018, ''The New Yorker'' published an article by Ronan stating that six women had accused [[CBS Corporation|CBS]] CEO [[Leslie Moonves]] of harassment and intimidation, and that dozens more described abuse at his company. In September 2018, Moonves stepped down as Chairman of CBS after multiple women brought forth sexual misconduct allegations against him.

He hosted ''[[Ronan Farrow Daily]]'', a television news program on [[MSNBC]], then the investigative segment \"Undercover with Ronan Farrow\" on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]''.\n\n==== Abuse allegations against Bill Cosby and Woody Allen ====\n\nIn May 2016, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' published a guest column by Farrow in which he drew comparisons between the long-term absence of journalistic inquiry into the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault cases|rape allegations leveled against Bill Cosby]] and the [[Woody Allen sexual assault allegation|sexual assault allegations levied against his father Woody Allen]] by Farrow's sister, [[Dylan Farrow]], who was seven at the time of the alleged assault. Ronan detailed first-hand accounts of journalists, biographers, and major publications purposefully omitting from their work decades of rape allegations targeting Cosby. Similarly, Ronan recounts the efforts of Allen's publicist, [[Leslee Dart]]\u2014co-CEO, and co-founder of a public-relations firm\u2014to mount a media campaign focused on countering Dylan's allegations, while working at vindicating her father:<blockquote>Every day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the emails blasted out by Allen's powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a robust publicity campaign to validate my father's sexual relationship with [[Soon-Yi Previn|another one of my siblings]]. Those emails featured talking points ready-made to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer\u2014therapists, lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points\u2014a self-perpetuating spin machine.</blockquote> Ronan believed his sister Dylan and related his concerns with their father going back to when they were young children. In closing, he expressed his view that media culture actively discourages victims of abuse from coming forward. He states that victims are pressured to remain silent by threat of \"having those tough newsroom conversations, making the case for burning bridges with powerful public figures\" as well as \"going up against angry fans and angry publicists\".\n\n==== Abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein, start of #MeToo ====\nIn October 2017, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published an investigative article by Ronan detailing [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|allegations of sexual misconduct]] against film producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] five days after ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the findings of its own investigation into Weinstein. A year prior, NBC had decided against airing Ronan's initial findings. ''The New Yorker'' won the [[2018 Pulitzer Prize|2018]] [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for Ronan's reporting, sharing the award with [[Jodi Kantor]] and [[Megan Twohey|Meghan Twohey]] at ''The New York Times''. Ronan was included in the ''Time'' \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" list in 2018.\n\nThe Weinstein allegations of abuse\u2014against a rich powerful man by numerous women whose careers were in ways directed by him\u2014kickstarted an international [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]] against [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault]].<ref name=\":65\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/|title=From Politics to Policy: Turning the Corner on Sexual Harassment \u2013 Center for American Progress|date=January 31, 2018|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"time17\">{{cite news|url=http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/|title=TIME Person of the Year 2018: The Silence Breakers|last=Edwards|first=Stephanie Zacharek, Eliana Dockterman, Haley Sweetland|access-date=April 14, 2018|website=Time}}</ref><ref name=\"Strause\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/me-founder-tarana-burke-responds-asia-argento-report-1135904|title=Tarana Burke Responds to Asia Argento Report: \"There Is No Model Survivor\"|last=Strause|first=Jackie|date=August 20, 2018|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}</ref> The movement began to spread [[Viral phenomenon|virally]] in October 2017 as a [[hashtag]] on [[social media]] in an attempt to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2017/12/20/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-in-a-metoo-world/|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace in A #MeToo World|last=Smartt|first=Nicole|website=Forbes|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116193245/https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2017/12/20/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-in-a-metoo-world/#7c439e1e5a42|archivedate=January 16, 2018|access-date=January 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers-choice/|title=The Choice: ''Time''{{'s}} Editor-in-chief on Why the Silence Breakers Are the Person of the Year|last=Felsenthal|first=Edward|date=December 18, 2017|website=Time|language=en-us|url-status=live|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/23/us/metoo-replacements.html?nl=top-stories&nlid=72995439ries&ref=cta|title=#MeToo Brought Down 201 Powerful Men.

Schneiderman resigned the following day. Mayer and Farrow reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations with photographs of contusions and with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated that he resigned because they \"effectively prevent me from leading the office's work\". \n\nTwo months later, in July 2018, ''The New Yorker'' published an article by Ronan stating that six women had accused [[CBS Corporation|CBS]] CEO [[Leslie Moonves]] of harassment and intimidation, and that dozens more described abuse at his company. In September 2018, Moonves stepped down as Chairman of CBS after multiple women brought forth sexual misconduct allegations against him. Moonves allegedly destroyed evidence of his sexual misconduct.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/12/05/les-moonves-allegedly-destroyed-evidence-sexual-misconduct-inquiry/2210456002/|title=Les Moonves: New allegation follows report saying ex-CBS boss destroyed evidence|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=January 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Further developments ====\nOn August 23, 2018, ''The New Yorker'' published an article by Adam Entous and Ronan stating that top aides of the Trump White House circulated a conspiracy memo entitled \"The Echo Chamber\" about Obama aides.\n\nOn September 14, 2018, Ronan and Jane Mayer published information pertaining to an allegation of sexual assault by [[United States Supreme Court]] nominee, [[Brett Kavanaugh]].The woman making the allegation was revealed to be professor [[Christine Blasey Ford]], who would go on to testify against Kavanaugh, before his successful confirmation.\n\nIn early 2019, Ronan said he and another journalist received demands from [[American Media, Inc.]] (AMI) that sought to extort or blackmail him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/02/08/ronan-farrow-ami-blackmail-jeff-bezos-amazon-threats/2810712002/|title=Ronan Farrow: I received 'blackmail' threat similar to Amazon's Jeff Bezos|website=USA Today|first=Anika|last=Reed|date=February 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reviews ==\nThe book has received generally positive reviews.

Mitch and Cam name their son Rexford, after the street the house is on. Cam receives the job offer that he wanted in Missouri. He sees how Mitch has been enjoying the new house and the baby, which means it would be harder to tell him. Cam eventually tells him in front of his family and friends at their housewarming party. Mitch, being put on the spot, agreed to support Cam and move. Just as Phil and Claire are about to tell the kids the news, they learn that Haley, Dylan and the twins are moving into Mitch and Cam\u2019s old home, Alex\u2019s job has been relocated to Switzerland and Luke has been accepted to the [[University of Oregon]]. Gloria notices Jay in several moments of self-isolation, leading her to worry about him. It is revealed that he is trying to learn Spanish to impress her and so he would be able to go to Colombia with her and Joe over the summer. As the family gets together to say farewell to Mitch, Cam, Lily and Rexford, the flight is repeatedly delayed until 9PM. During this time, Claire and Mitch steal their figure skating trophy which Jay and DeDe donated to the figure skating association because Claire and Mitch were fighting over who should keep it. Cam gives Gloria his letter and tells her to express her feelings on a card, which she thought was directed at Manny, who is leaving to pursue a film career. Haley and Alex seek to bug Luke one last time by refilming the video that they made when they were young. Haley and Alex wanted to prove that they were able to take care of a dog, which they showed what they would do to the dog, with Luke as the dog. Before everyone parts ways, the family meets up at Phil and Claire\u2019s house and they form a big family hug.\n| LineColor       = #760922\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Special==\n\nA special entitled ''A Modern Farewell'' aired at 8:00 P.M. on Wednesday, April 8, 2020, prior to the series finale.

Gloria encourages him to literally say goodbye to the old house. Mitch and Cam's anxieties return when they learn that their new baby has been born early, before Lily helps them realise that they are ready to welcome their son. Haley, Alex and Luke frantically attempt to clean up after a party at the Dunphy house, without Claire and Phil finding out.

Mitch and Cam name their son Rexford, after the street the house is on. Cam receives the job offer that he wanted in Missouri. He sees how Mitch has been enjoying the new house and the baby, which means it would be harder to tell him. Cam eventually tells him in front of his family and friends at their housewarming party. Mitch, being put on the spot, agreed to support Cam and move. Just as Phil and Claire are about to tell the kids the news, they learn that Haley, Dylan and the twins are moving into Mitch and Cam\u2019s old home, Alex\u2019s job has been relocated to Switzerland and Luke has been accepted to the [[University of Oregon]]. Gloria notices Jay in several moments of self-isolation, leading her to worry about him. It is revealed that he is trying to learn Spanish to impress her and so he would be able to go to Colombia with her and Joe over the summer. As the family gets together to say farewell to Mitch, Cam, Lily and Rexford, the flight is repeatedly delayed until 9PM. During this time, Claire and Mitch steal their figure skating trophy which Jay and DeDe donated to the figure skating association because Claire and Mitch were fighting over who should keep it. Cam gives Gloria his letter and tells her to express her feelings on a card, which she thought was directed at Manny, who is leaving to pursue a film career. Haley and Alex seek to bug Luke one last time by refilming the video that they made when they were young. Haley and Alex wanted to prove that they were able to take care of a dog, which they showed what they would do to the dog, with Luke as the dog. Before everyone parts ways, the family meets up at Phil and Claire\u2019s house and they form a big family hug.\n| LineColor       = #760922\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Special==\n\nA special entitled ''A Modern Farewell'' aired at 8:00 P.M. on Wednesday, April 8, 2020, prior to the series finale.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&hl=en|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63125961|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GliCdk2exrgC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design&hl=en|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, the keel shifts angle to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of leeway (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of jib and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and trysail (in place of the mainsail).

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&hl=en|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63125961|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GliCdk2exrgC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design&hl=en|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, the keel shifts angle to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of leeway (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of jib and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and trysail (in place of the mainsail). Performance yachts are likely to have full-battened kevlar or carbon-fiber mainsails.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Classes ===\nWorld Sailing recognizes nine classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n#[[Class40]]\n#[[Farr 30]]\n#[[Farr 40]]\n#[[International Maxi Association]]\n#[[J/111]]\n#[[IMOCA 60]]\n#[[Soto 40]]\n#[[Swan 45]]\n#[[Swan 60]]\n#[[TP 52]]\n#[[X-35 (yacht)|X-35]]\n#[[X-41 (yacht)|X-41]]\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n*[[Dinghy sailing]]\n*[[International class]]\n*[[List of large sailing yachts]]\n*[[Skiff|Sailing skiff]]\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRacing:Remove tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_yacht"}

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=17th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1925}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Trophy Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] who defeated [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] in the final.\n\nIn the lower grades [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches. They played against the New Zealand team twice and the touring Queensland side who they drew with 18 all. The Auckland side claimed the Northern Union Challenege Cup off the holders, South Auckland and they retained it against the same opponents in a later match. In addition the Auckland Provincial team played Queensland but were soundly beaten 54-14.\n\n===Death of Bill Stormont and inauguration of the Stormont Shield===\nOn June 4 [[William Stormont]] (known better as Bill Stormont) died, succumbing to rheumatic heart disease. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths - Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1925-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.5\n| accessdate = 2019-11-10}}</ref> Stormont had played for the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] senior team from 1920 to 1924 scoring 24 tries and kicking 31 goals.

He had been ill for quite some time and had not played for Marist since the end of the 1924 season. The funeral was on the Sunday leaving his parents residence in Epsom and progressing to Purewa Cemetery where he was buried. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths-Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19037\n| date = 1925-06-06\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250606.2.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The match between Marist and [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] on Saturday was originally postponed but was never played. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.126\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The matches at [[Carlaw Park]] saw one minutes silence before kickoff.

After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: [[Craddock Dufty]], P. Gregory, [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Hec Brisbane]], [[Frank Delgrosso]], [[Jack Kirwan (rugby league)|Jack Kirwan]], [[Bert Laing]], [[Maurice Wetherill]], [[Wilson Hall]], C.

In 1935, Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, the [[Count Basie Orchestra]], and in 1936 took them to [[Chicago]] for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists [[Lester Young]] and [[Herschel Evans]], the guitarist [[Freddie Green]], trumpeters [[Buck Clayton]] and [[Harry \"Sweets\" Edison]] and singers [[Jimmy Rushing]], [[Helen Humes]], [[Thelma Carpenter]], and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nWilliam Basie was born to Lillian and Harvey Lee Basie in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]].<ref>Basie Centennial Ball</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Basie| first=Count| year=2000| title=Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie| publisher=Paladin Grafton Books| isbn=0-586-08638-2| page=[https://archive.org/details/goodmorningblues00basie/page/25 25]| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/goodmorningblues00basie/page/25}}</ref> His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a wealthy judge. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several wealthy families in the area.<ref>Count Basie (1985), ''Good Morning Blues'', p. 26</ref> Both of his parents had some type of musical background. His father played the [[mellophone]], and his mother played the piano; in fact, she gave Basie his first piano lessons. She took in laundry and baked cakes for sale for a living. She paid 25 cents a lesson for Count Basie's piano instruction.<ref name=\"Count Basie, 1985, p. 33\">Count Basie, 1985, p. 33</ref><ref>Count Basie and his Friends, myspace.com</ref>\n\nThe best student in school, Basie dreamed of a traveling life, inspired by touring carnivals which came to town. He finished junior high school<ref>Count Basie, 2001, p. 29</ref> but spent much of his time at the Palace Theater in Red Bank, where doing occasional chores gained him free admission to performances. He quickly learned to improvise music appropriate to the acts and the [[silent movie]]s.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 32</ref>\n\nThough a natural at the piano, Basie preferred drums. Discouraged by the obvious talents of [[Sonny Greer]], who also lived in Red Bank and became [[Duke Ellington]]'s drummer in 1919, Basie switched to piano exclusively at age 15.<ref name=\"Count Basie, 1985, p. 33\"/> Greer and Basie played together in venues until Greer set out on his professional career. By then, Basie was playing with pick-up groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson's \"Kings of Syncopation\".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 33\u201334, plate 3</ref> When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians, where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. He got some jobs in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]] at the [[Jersey Shore]], and played at the Hong Kong Inn until a better player took his place.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 41</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nAround 1920, Basie went to [[Harlem]], a hotbed of jazz, where he lived down the block from the [[The Harlem Alhambra|Alhambra Theater]]. Early after his arrival, he bumped into Sonny Greer, who was by then the drummer for the Washingtonians, [[Duke Ellington]]'s early band.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 51</ref> Soon, Basie met many of the Harlem musicians who were \"making the scene,\" including [[Willie \"the Lion\" Smith]] and [[James P. Johnson]].\n\nBasie toured in several acts between 1925 and 1927, including ''Katie Krippen and Her Kiddies'' (featuring singer [[Katie Crippen]]) as part of the ''Hippity Hop'' show; on the [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Keith]], the [[Columbia Burlesque]], and the [[Theater Owners Bookers Association]] (T.O.B.A.) [[vaudeville]] circuits; and as a soloist and accompanist to [[blues]] singer [[Gonzelle White]] as well as Crippen.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 55</ref><ref>Robinson, J.

Throughout his tours, Basie met many jazz musicians, including [[Louis Armstrong]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 96</ref> Before he was 20 years old, he toured extensively on the Keith and TOBA vaudeville circuits as a solo pianist, accompanist, and music director for blues singers, dancers, and comedians. This provided an early training that was to prove significant in his later career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_basie_count.htm|title=JAZZ A film by Ken Burns \u2013 PBS|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBack in Harlem in 1925, Basie gained his first steady job at Leroy's, a place known for its piano players and its \"[[cutting contests]].\" The place catered to \"uptown celebrities,\" and typically the band winged every number without sheet music using \"head arrangements.\"<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 68</ref> He met [[Fats Waller]], who was playing organ at the [[Lincoln Theatre (Harlem)|Lincoln Theater]] accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play that instrument.

It was at this time that he began to be known as \"Count\" Basie (see [[Jazz royalty]]).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 20</ref>\n\n===Kansas City years===\nThe following year, in 1929, Basie became the pianist with the [[Bennie Moten]] band based in Kansas City, inspired by Moten's ambition to raise his band to the level of Duke Ellington's or [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 116</ref> Where the [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils|Blue Devils]] were \"snappier\" and more \"bluesy,\" the Moten band was more refined and respected, playing in the \"[[Kansas City jazz|Kansas City stomp]]\" style.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 120</ref> In addition to playing piano, Basie was co-arranger with [[Eddie Durham]], who notated the music.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, plate 10</ref>\nTheir \"[[Moten Swing]]\", which Basie claimed credit for,<ref name=\"Basie2002\">{{cite book|last=Basie|first=Count|title=Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8osZnKqbRwQC&pg=PA127|year=2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81107-4|page=127}}</ref> was widely acclaimed and was an invaluable contribution to the development of swing music, and at one performance at the [[Pearl Theatre (Philadelphia)|Pearl Theatre]] in Philadelphia in December 1932, the theatre opened its door to allow anybody in who wanted to hear the band perform.<ref name=\"Daniels2006\">{{cite book|last=Daniels|first=Douglas Henry|title=One O'clock Jump: The Unforgettable History of the Oklahoma City Blue Devils|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3tmQ4w1uR8C&pg=PA144|date=January 2006|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-7136-6|page=144}}</ref> \nDuring a stay in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He occasionally played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten, who also conducted.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 122</ref> The band improved with several personnel changes, including the addition of [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Ben Webster]].\n\nWhen the band voted Moten out, Basie took over for several months, calling the group \"Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms. \"When his own band folded, he rejoined Moten with a newly re-organized band.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 146</ref> A year later, Basie joined Bennie Moten's band, and played with them until Moten's death in 1935 from a failed tonsillectomy. When Moten died, the band tried to stay together but couldn't make a go of it. Basie then formed his own nine-piece band, Barons of Rhythm, with many former Moten members including Walter Page (bass), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Lester Young (tenor saxophone) and Jimmy Rushing (vocals).\n\nThe Barons of Rhythm were regulars at the Reno Club and often performed for a live radio broadcast. During a broadcast the announcer wanted to give Basie's name some style, so he called him \"Count.\" Little did Basie know this touch of royalty would give him proper status and position him with the likes of Duke Ellington and [[Earl Hines]].\n\nBasie's new band which included many Moten alumni, with the important addition of tenor player [[Lester Young]]. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece \"[[One O'Clock Jump]].\"<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 67</ref> According to Basie, \"we hit it with the [[rhythm section]] and went into the [[riff]]s, and the riffs just stuck. We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we just went on playing in F.\" It became his signature tune.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 162</ref>\n\n===John Hammond and first recordings===\n[[Image:CountBasieEthelWatersStageDoorCanteen.jpg|right|thumb|Basie and band, with vocalist [[Ethel Waters]], from the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]\n\nAt the end of 1936, Basie and his band, now billed as \"Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm,\" moved from Kansas City to Chicago, where they honed their repertoire at a long engagement at the Grand Terrace Ballroom.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 171</ref> Right from the start, Basie's band was noted for its rhythm section. Another Basie innovation was the use of two tenor saxophone players; at the time, most bands had just one. When Young complained of [[Herschel Evans]]' vibrato, Basie placed them on either side of the [[alto]] players, and soon had the tenor players engaged in \"duels\". Many other bands later adapted the split tenor arrangement.<ref>Stanley Dance, ''The World of Count Basie'', Da Capo, New York, 1980, {{ISBN|0-306-80245-7}}, p. 68</ref>\n\nIn that city in October 1936, the band had a recording session which the producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] later described as \"the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I've ever had anything to do with\".<ref>1981 interview cited in \"The Lester Young Story\" (Properbox 16) p14\u201315</ref> Hammond had heard Basie's band by radio and went to Kansas City to check them out.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 165</ref> He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young's earliest recordings. Those four sides were released on [[Vocalion Records]] under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were \"Shoe Shine Boy\", \"Evening\", \"Boogie Woogie\", and \"Lady Be Good\". After Vocalion became a subsidiary of [[Columbia Records]] in 1938, \"Boogie Woogie\" was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled ''[[Boogie Woogie (Columbia album C44)|Boogie Woogie]]'' (Columbia album C44).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Boogie-Woogie/release/1944476 |title=Various \u2013 Boogie Woogie |publisher=Discogs |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref> When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with [[Decca Records]], but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 181</ref>\n\nBy then, Basie's sound was characterized by a \"jumping\" beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano. His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), [[Freddie Green]] (guitar), [[Jo Jones]] (drums), [[Walter Page]] (bass), [[Earle Warren]] (alto sax), [[Buck Clayton]] and [[Harry Edison]] (trumpet), [[Benny Morton]] and [[Dickie Wells]] (trombone).<ref>Leonard Feather, ''The Encyclopedia of Jazz'', Bonanza Books, 1960, p.112</ref> Lester Young, known as \"Prez\" by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. He called Basie \"Holy Man\", \"Holy Main\", and just plain \"Holy\".<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 104</ref>\n\nBasie favored [[blues]], and he would showcase some of the most notable blues singers of the era after he went to New York: [[Billie Holiday]], [[Jimmy Rushing]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Helen Humes]], and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]]. He also hired arrangers who knew how to maximize the band's abilities, such as [[Eddie Durham]] and [[Jimmy Mundy]].\n\n===New York City and the swing years===\nWhen Basie took his orchestra to New York in 1937, they made the Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement).<ref name=nicholson>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Stuart |date=2004 |title=Ella Fitzgerald: A Biography of the First Lady of Jazz, Updated Edition |url= |location=London |publisher=Routledge |pages=50\u201351 |isbn= 9781136788130 | oclc=884745086 |quote=Toward the end of 1937, Ella moved again, this time to the Woodside Hotel at 2424 Seventh Avenue at 142nd Street, to be close to Jo Jones, the drummer from the Count Basie band. The band had recently hit town and was playing the Roseland Ballroom, and most of its members were staying at the Woodside...}}</ref> Soon, they were booked at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, \"We caught the great Count Basie band which is supposed to be so hot he was going to come in here and set the Roseland on fire. Well, the Roseland is still standing\".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 184</ref> Compared to the reigning band of [[Fletcher Henderson]], Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 107</ref>\n\nThe producer John Hammond continued to advise and encourage the band, and they soon came up with some adjustments, including softer playing, more solos, and more standards. They paced themselves to save their hottest numbers for later in the show, to give the audience a chance to warm up.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 188</ref> His first official recordings for [[Decca Records|Decca]] followed, under contract to agent MCA, including \"[[Pennies from Heaven (song)|Pennies from Heaven]]\" and \"[[Honeysuckle Rose (song)|Honeysuckle Rose]]\".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 186</ref>\n\nHammond introduced Basie to [[Billie Holiday]], whom he invited to sing with the band. (Holiday did not record with Basie, as she had her own record contract and preferred working with small combos).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 200</ref> The band's first appearance at the Apollo Theater followed, with the vocalists Holiday and [[Jimmy Rushing]] getting the most attention.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 190</ref> Durham returned to help with arranging and composing, but for the most part, the orchestra worked out its numbers in rehearsal, with Basie guiding the proceedings. There were often no musical notations made. Once the musicians found what they liked, they usually were able to repeat it using their \"head arrangements\" and collective memory.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 199</ref>\n\nNext, Basie played at the [[Savoy Ballroom|Savoy]], which was noted more for [[Lindy Hop|lindy-hopping]], while the Roseland was a place for [[fox-trot]]s and [[conga]]s.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 202</ref> In early 1938, the [[Savoy Ballroom|Savoy]] was the meeting ground for a \"battle of the bands\" with [[Chick Webb]]'s group. Basie had Holiday, and Webb countered with the singer [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. As ''[[Metronome magazine|Metronome]]'' magazine proclaimed, \"Basie's Brilliant Band Conquers Chick's\"; the article described the evening:\n\n<blockquote>Throughout the fight, which never let down in its intensity during the whole fray, Chick took the aggressive, with the Count playing along easily and, on the whole, more musically scientifically. Undismayed by Chick's forceful drum beating, which sent the audience into shouts of encouragement and appreciation and casual beads of perspiration to drop from Chick's brow onto the brass cymbals, the Count maintained an attitude of poise and self-assurance. He constantly parried Chick's thundering haymakers with tantalizing runs and arpeggios which teased more and more force from his adversary.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 208</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe publicity over the big band battle, before and after, gave the Basie band a boost and wider recognition. Soon after, [[Benny Goodman]] recorded their signature \"[[One O'Clock Jump]]\" with his band.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 207</ref>\n\nA few months later, Holiday left for [[Artie Shaw]]'s band. Hammond introduced [[Helen Humes]], whom Basie hired; she stayed with Basie for four years.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 211</ref> When [[Eddie Durham]] left for [[Glenn Miller]]'s orchestra, he was replaced by [[Dicky Wells]]. Basie's 14-man band began playing at the [[Famous Door]], a mid-town nightspot with a [[CBS]] network feed and [[air conditioning]], which Hammond was said to have bought the club in return for their booking Basie steadily throughout the summer of 1938. Their fame took a huge leap.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 217\u2013218</ref> Adding to their play book, Basie received arrangements from [[Jimmy Mundy]] (who had also worked with Benny Goodman and [[Earl Hines]]), particularly for \"Cherokee\", \"Easy Does It\", and \"Super Chief\".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 229</ref> In 1939, Basie and his band made a major cross-country tour, including their first [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] dates. A few months later, Basie quit MCA and signed with the [[William Morris]] Agency, who got them better fees.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 247</ref>\n\nOn February 19, 1940, Count Basie and his Orchestra opened a four-week engagement at [[Southland (jazz venue)|Southland]] in Boston, and they broadcast over the radio on 20 February.<ref name=\"Vail2003\">{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Ken|title=Count Basie: Swingin' the Blues, 1936-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWZjiRBQJBkC&pg=PA36|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4882-5|page=36}}</ref>\nOn the West Coast, in 1942 the band did a spot in ''Reveille With Beverly'', a musical film starring [[Ann Miller]], and a \"Command Performance\" for [[Armed Forces Radio]], with Hollywood stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Carmen Miranda]], [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], and the singer [[Dinah Shore]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 260</ref> Other minor movie spots followed, including ''Choo Choo Swing'', ''Crazy House'', ''Top Man'', ''Stage Door Canteen'', and ''Hit Parade of 1943''.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 262</ref> They also continued to record for OKeh Records and Columbia Records.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 274</ref> The war years caused a lot of members turn over, and the band worked many play dates with lower pay. Dance hall bookings were down sharply as [[swing music|swing]] began to fade, the effects of the [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|musicians' strikes of 1942\u201344]] and 1948 began to be felt, and the public's taste grew for [[pop music|singers]].\n\nBasie occasionally lost some key soloists. However, throughout the 1940s, he maintained a big band that possessed an infectious rhythmic beat, an enthusiastic team spirit, and a long list of inspired and talented jazz soloists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swingmusic.net/Count_Basie.html|title=THE BIOGRAPHY OF COUNT BASIE|first=Jeff|last=Parker|website=Swingmusic.net|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Los Angeles and the Cavalcade of Jazz concerts ===\nCount Basie was the featured artist at the very first Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]] on September 23, 1945 which was produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.|Leon Hefflin Sr.]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Central Avenue--its rise and fall, 1890-c. 1955 : including the musical renaissance of Black Los Angeles|last=Cox, Bette Yarbrough.|date=1996|publisher=BEEM Publications|isbn=0965078302|location=Los Angeles|oclc=35673638}}</ref>  Al Jarvis was the Emcee and other artists to appear on stage were [[Joe Liggins]] and his Honeydrippers, [[Edith Peters|The Peters Sisters]], [[Slim Gaillard|Slim and Bam]], [[Valaida Snow]], and [[Big Joe Turner]].<ref>\"Big Name Bands, Singers in 'Cavalcade of Music' Sept. 23\" \" The California Eagle Sept. 13, 1945.\n</ref> They played to a crowd of 15,000.

For a while, he performed in combos, sometimes stretched to an orchestra. In 1950, he headlined the [[Universal-International]] short film ''[[\"Sugar Chile\" Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet]].'' He reformed his group as a 16-piece orchestra in 1952. This group was eventually called the New Testament band. Basie credited [[Billy Eckstine]], a top male vocalist of the time, for prompting his return to Big Band. He said that [[Norman Granz]] got them into the [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] club and promoted the new band through recordings on the [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], [[Clef Records|Clef]], and [[Verve Records|Verve]] labels.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 289\u2013290</ref> The [[jukebox]] era had begun, and Basie shared the exposure along with early [[rock'n'roll]] and [[rhythm and blues]] artists. Basie's new band was more of an ensemble group, with fewer solo turns, and relying less on \"head\" and more on written arrangements.\n\nBasie added touches of [[bebop]] \"so long as it made sense\", and he required that \"it all had to have feeling\". Basie's band was sharing Birdland with such bebop greats as [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Miles Davis]]. Behind the occasional bebop solos, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, \"so it doesn't matter what they do up front; the audience gets the beat\".<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 5</ref> Basie also added [[flute]] to some numbers, a novelty at the time that became widely copied.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 281, 304</ref> Soon, his band was touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, [[Tommy Turrentine]], [[Johnny Letman]], [[Idrees Sulieman]], and [[Joe Newman (trumpeter)|Joe Newman]] (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, [[Benny Powell]], [[Matthew Gee]] (trombone); [[Paul Quinichette]] and [[Floyd \"Candy\" Johnson]] (tenor sax); [[Marshal Royal]] and [[Ernie Wilkins]] (alto sax); and [[Charlie Fowlkes]] (baritone sax).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 293</ref> ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine reported, \"(Basie) has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this.\"<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 299</ref> In 1957, Basie sued the jazz venue Ball and Chain in Miami over outstanding fees, causing the closure of the venue.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnTSqVu9Zr4C&pg=PA59|title=Jade Visions: The Life and Music of Scott LaFaro|first=Helene|last=LaFaro-Fernandez|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=University of North Texas Press|accessdate=May 2, 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781574412734}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, the band made its first European tour. Jazz was especially appreciated in France, The Netherlands, and Germany in the 1950s; these countries were the stomping grounds for many [[expatriate]] American jazz stars who were either resurrecting their careers or sitting out the years of racial divide in the United States. [[Neal Hefti]] began to provide arrangements, notably \"[[Lil Darlin']]\". By the mid-1950s, Basie's band had become one of the preeminent backing big bands for some of the most prominent jazz vocalists of the time. They also toured with the \"Birdland Stars of 1955\", whose lineup included [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Erroll Garner]], [[Lester Young]], [[George Shearing]], and [[Stan Getz]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 315</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Basie released the live album ''[[Count Basie at Newport]]''. \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\" (arrangement by Wild Bill Davis) was a best-selling instrumental and the title song for the hit album.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 318</ref> The Basie band made two tours in the British Isles and on the second, they put on a command performance for [[Queen Elizabeth II]], along with [[Judy Garland]], [[Vera Lynn]], and [[Mario Lanza]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 323</ref> He was a guest on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'', a venue also opened to several other black entertainers. In 1959, Basie's band recorded a \"greatest hits\" double album ''The Count Basie Story'' ([[Frank Foster (musician)|Frank Foster]], arranger), and ''[[Basie/Eckstine Incorporated]]'', an album featuring Billy Eckstine, [[Quincy Jones]] (as arranger) and the Count Basie Orchestra. It was released by Roulette Records, then later reissued by Capitol Records.\n\nLater that year, Basie appeared on a television special with [[Fred Astaire]], featuring a dance solo to \"[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]\", followed in January 1961 by Basie performing at one of the five [[John F. Kennedy]] Inaugural Balls.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 335, 337</ref> That summer, Basie and [[Duke Ellington]] combined forces for the recording ''First Time! The Count Meets the Duke'', each providing four numbers from their play books.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 339</ref>\n\n[[Image:Countbasie.jpg|thumb|Count Basie (left) in concert (Cologne 1975)]]\nDuring the balance of the 1960s, the band kept busy with tours, recordings, television appearances, festivals, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] shows, and travel abroad, including cruises. Some time around 1964, Basie adopted his trademark yachting cap.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 353</ref>\n\nThrough steady changes in personnel, Basie led the band into the 1980s. Basie made a few more movie appearances, such as the [[Jerry Lewis]] film ''[[Cinderfella]]'' (1960) and the [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), playing a revised arrangement of \"April in Paris\".\n\nDuring its heyday, ''[[The Gong Show]]'' (1976\u201380) used Basie's \"[[Jumpin' at the Woodside]]\" during some episodes, while an NBC stagehand named Eugene Patton would dance on stage; Patton became known as \"Gene Gene, the Dancing Machine\".\n\n==Marriage, family and death==\nBasie was a member of [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity. On July 21, 1930, Basie married Vivian Lee Winn, in Kansas City, Missouri. They were divorced sometime before 1935. Some time in or before 1935, the now single Basie returned to New York City, renting a house at 111 West 138th Street, Manhattan, as evidenced by the 1940 census. He married Catherine Morgan on July 13, 1940 in the King County courthouse in Seattle, Washington. In 1942, they moved to Queens. Their only child, Diane, was born February 6 1944. She was born with [[cerebral palsy]] and the doctors claimed she would never walk. The couple kept her and cared deeply for her, and especially through her mother's tutelage Diane learned not only to walk but to swim.<ref>{{cite web |title=Count Basie: Through his own eyes |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11417720/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1 |website=IMDb |publisher=Eagle Rock Productions}}</ref> The Basies bought a home in the new whites-only neighborhood of Addisleigh Park in 1946 on Adelaide Road and 175th Street, [[St. Albans, Queens]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://prrac.org/newsletters/janfebmar2017.pdf | title=This Green and Pleasant Land | author=Greene, Bryan | newspaper=Poverty and Race | volume=26 | issue=1 | date=January\u2013March 2017 |publisher=Poverty and Race Research Action Council | p=3 }}</ref>\n\nOn April 11, 1983, Catherine Basie died of heart disease at the couple's home in Freeport, Grand Bahama Island.

Jimmy Rushing sang with Basie in the late 1930s. Joe Williams toured with the band and was featured on the 1957 album ''[[One O'Clock Jump (album)|One O'Clock Jump]]'', and 1956's ''[[Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings]]'', with \"[[Every Day I Have the Blues|Every Day (I Have the Blues)]]\" becoming a huge hit. With Billy Eckstine on the album ''[[Basie/Eckstine Incorporated]]'', in 1959. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] made some memorable recordings with Basie, including the 1963 album ''[[Ella and Basie!]]''. With the New Testament Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a youthful [[Quincy Jones]], this album proved a swinging respite from her ''Songbook'' recordings and constant touring she did during this period. She even toured with the Basie Orchestra in the mid-1970s, and Fitzgerald and Basie also met on the 1979 albums ''[[A Classy Pair]]'', ''[[Digital III at Montreux]]'', and ''[[A Perfect Match (Ella Fitzgerald album)|A Perfect Match]]'', the last two also recorded live at Montreux. In addition to [[Quincy Jones]], Basie was using arrangers such as [[Benny Carter]] ''(Kansas City Suite)'', [[Neal Hefti]] ''([[E=MC\u00b2 (Count Basie album)|The Atomic Mr Basie]])'', and [[Sammy Nestico]] ''(Basie-Straight Ahead)''.\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]] recorded for the first time with Basie on 1962's ''[[Sinatra-Basie]]'' and for a second studio album on 1964's ''[[It Might as Well Be Swing]]'', which was arranged by [[Quincy Jones]]. Jones also arranged and conducted 1966's live ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'' which featured Sinatra with Count Basie and his orchestra at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. In May 1970, Sinatra performed in London's [[Royal Festival Hall]] with the Basie orchestra, in a charity benefit for the [[NSPCC|National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]]. Sinatra later said of this concert \"I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting\".<ref name=\"CharlesPignon\">Pignon, Charles (2004). ''The Sinatra Treasures,'' Virgin Books, {{ISBN|1-85227-184-1}}</ref>\n\nBasie also recorded with [[Tony Bennett]] in the late 1950s. Their albums together included ''In Person'' and ''Strike Up the Band.'' Basie also toured with Bennett, including a date at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Other notable recordings were with [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Sarah Vaughan]]. One of Basie's biggest regrets was never recording with [[Louis Armstrong]], though they shared the same bill several times.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 362</ref> In 1968 Basie and his Band recorded an album with [[Jackie Wilson]] titled ''[[Manufacturers of Soul]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jackie-Wilson-Count-Basie-Manufacturers-Of-Soul/master/371537 |title=Jackie Wilson & Count Basie \u2013 Manufacturers Of Soul at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/jackie_wilson/manufacturers_of_soul/ |title=Manufacturers of Soul by Jackie Wilson : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n[[Image:Basie theatre.jpg|thumb|right|Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey]]\n\nCount Basie introduced several generations of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalog.

1904&nbsp;\u2013 April 26, 1984)<ref name=\"NYT1984\"/> was an American [[jazz]] pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. In 1935, Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, the [[Count Basie Orchestra]], and in 1936 took them to [[Chicago]] for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists [[Lester Young]] and [[Herschel Evans]], the guitarist [[Freddie Green]], trumpeters [[Buck Clayton]] and [[Harry \"Sweets\" Edison]] and singers [[Jimmy Rushing]], [[Helen Humes]], [[Thelma Carpenter]], and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nWilliam Basie was born to Lillian and Harvey Lee Basie in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]].<ref>Basie Centennial Ball</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Basie| first=Count| year=2000| title=Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie| publisher=Paladin Grafton Books| isbn=0-586-08638-2| page=[https://archive.org/details/goodmorningblues00basie/page/25 25]| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/goodmorningblues00basie/page/25}}</ref> His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a wealthy judge. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several wealthy families in the area.<ref>Count Basie (1985), ''Good Morning Blues'', p. 26</ref> Both of his parents had some type of musical background. His father played the [[mellophone]], and his mother played the piano; in fact, she gave Basie his first piano lessons. She took in laundry and baked cakes for sale for a living. She paid 25 cents a lesson for Count Basie's piano instruction.<ref name=\"Count Basie, 1985, p. 33\">Count Basie, 1985, p. 33</ref><ref>Count Basie and his Friends, myspace.com</ref>\n\nThe best student in school, Basie dreamed of a traveling life, inspired by touring carnivals which came to town. He finished junior high school<ref>Count Basie, 2001, p. 29</ref> but spent much of his time at the Palace Theater in Red Bank, where doing occasional chores gained him free admission to performances. He quickly learned to improvise music appropriate to the acts and the [[silent movie]]s.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 32</ref>\n\nThough a natural at the piano, Basie preferred drums. Discouraged by the obvious talents of [[Sonny Greer]], who also lived in Red Bank and became [[Duke Ellington]]'s drummer in 1919, Basie switched to piano exclusively at age 15.<ref name=\"Count Basie, 1985, p. 33\"/> Greer and Basie played together in venues until Greer set out on his professional career. By then, Basie was playing with pick-up groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson's \"Kings of Syncopation\".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 33\u201334, plate 3</ref> When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians, where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. He got some jobs in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]] at the [[Jersey Shore]], and played at the Hong Kong Inn until a better player took his place.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 41</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nAround 1920, Basie went to [[Harlem]], a hotbed of jazz, where he lived down the block from the [[The Harlem Alhambra|Alhambra Theater]]. Early after his arrival, he bumped into Sonny Greer, who was by then the drummer for the Washingtonians, [[Duke Ellington]]'s early band.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 51</ref> Soon, Basie met many of the Harlem musicians who were \"making the scene,\" including [[Willie \"the Lion\" Smith]] and [[James P. Johnson]].\n\nBasie toured in several acts between 1925 and 1927, including ''Katie Krippen and Her Kiddies'' (featuring singer [[Katie Crippen]]) as part of the ''Hippity Hop'' show; on the [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Keith]], the [[Columbia Burlesque]], and the [[Theater Owners Bookers Association]] (T.O.B.A.) [[vaudeville]] circuits; and as a soloist and accompanist to [[blues]] singer [[Gonzelle White]] as well as Crippen.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 55</ref><ref>Robinson, J.

Throughout his tours, Basie met many jazz musicians, including [[Louis Armstrong]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 96</ref> Before he was 20 years old, he toured extensively on the Keith and TOBA vaudeville circuits as a solo pianist, accompanist, and music director for blues singers, dancers, and comedians.

It was at this time that he began to be known as \"Count\" Basie (see [[Jazz royalty]]).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 20</ref>\n\n===Kansas City years===\nThe following year, in 1929, Basie became the pianist with the [[Bennie Moten]] band based in Kansas City, inspired by Moten's ambition to raise his band to the level of Duke Ellington's or [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 116</ref> Where the [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils|Blue Devils]] were \"snappier\" and more \"bluesy,\" the Moten band was more refined and respected, playing in the \"[[Kansas City jazz|Kansas City stomp]]\" style.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 120</ref> In addition to playing piano, Basie was co-arranger with [[Eddie Durham]], who notated the music.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, plate 10</ref>\nTheir \"[[Moten Swing]]\", which Basie claimed credit for,<ref name=\"Basie2002\">{{cite book|last=Basie|first=Count|title=Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8osZnKqbRwQC&pg=PA127|year=2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81107-4|page=127}}</ref> was widely acclaimed and was an invaluable contribution to the development of swing music, and at one performance at the [[Pearl Theatre (Philadelphia)|Pearl Theatre]] in Philadelphia in December 1932, the theatre opened its door to allow anybody in who wanted to hear the band perform.<ref name=\"Daniels2006\">{{cite book|last=Daniels|first=Douglas Henry|title=One O'clock Jump: The Unforgettable History of the Oklahoma City Blue Devils|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3tmQ4w1uR8C&pg=PA144|date=January 2006|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-7136-6|page=144}}</ref> \nDuring a stay in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He occasionally played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten, who also conducted.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 122</ref> The band improved with several personnel changes, including the addition of [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Ben Webster]].\n\nWhen the band voted Moten out, Basie took over for several months, calling the group \"Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms. \"When his own band folded, he rejoined Moten with a newly re-organized band.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 146</ref> A year later, Basie joined Bennie Moten's band, and played with them until Moten's death in 1935 from a failed tonsillectomy. When Moten died, the band tried to stay together but couldn't make a go of it. Basie then formed his own nine-piece band, Barons of Rhythm, with many former Moten members including Walter Page (bass), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Lester Young (tenor saxophone) and Jimmy Rushing (vocals).\n\nThe Barons of Rhythm were regulars at the Reno Club and often performed for a live radio broadcast. During a broadcast the announcer wanted to give Basie's name some style, so he called him \"Count.\" Little did Basie know this touch of royalty would give him proper status and position him with the likes of Duke Ellington and [[Earl Hines]].\n\nBasie's new band which included many Moten alumni, with the important addition of tenor player [[Lester Young]]. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece \"[[One O'Clock Jump]].\"<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 67</ref> According to Basie, \"we hit it with the [[rhythm section]] and went into the [[riff]]s, and the riffs just stuck. We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we just went on playing in F.\" It became his signature tune.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 162</ref>\n\n===John Hammond and first recordings===\n[[Image:CountBasieEthelWatersStageDoorCanteen.jpg|right|thumb|Basie and band, with vocalist [[Ethel Waters]], from the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]\n\nAt the end of 1936, Basie and his band, now billed as \"Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm,\" moved from Kansas City to Chicago, where they honed their repertoire at a long engagement at the Grand Terrace Ballroom.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 171</ref> Right from the start, Basie's band was noted for its rhythm section. Another Basie innovation was the use of two tenor saxophone players; at the time, most bands had just one. When Young complained of [[Herschel Evans]]' vibrato, Basie placed them on either side of the [[alto]] players, and soon had the tenor players engaged in \"duels\". Many other bands later adapted the split tenor arrangement.<ref>Stanley Dance, ''The World of Count Basie'', Da Capo, New York, 1980, {{ISBN|0-306-80245-7}}, p. 68</ref>\n\nIn that city in October 1936, the band had a recording session which the producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] later described as \"the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I've ever had anything to do with\".<ref>1981 interview cited in \"The Lester Young Story\" (Properbox 16) p14\u201315</ref> Hammond had heard Basie's band by radio and went to Kansas City to check them out.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 165</ref> He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young's earliest recordings. Those four sides were released on [[Vocalion Records]] under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were \"Shoe Shine Boy\", \"Evening\", \"Boogie Woogie\", and \"Lady Be Good\". After Vocalion became a subsidiary of [[Columbia Records]] in 1938, \"Boogie Woogie\" was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled ''[[Boogie Woogie (Columbia album C44)|Boogie Woogie]]'' (Columbia album C44).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Boogie-Woogie/release/1944476 |title=Various \u2013 Boogie Woogie |publisher=Discogs |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref> When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with [[Decca Records]], but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 181</ref>\n\nBy then, Basie's sound was characterized by a \"jumping\" beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano. His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), [[Freddie Green]] (guitar), [[Jo Jones]] (drums), [[Walter Page]] (bass), [[Earle Warren]] (alto sax), [[Buck Clayton]] and [[Harry Edison]] (trumpet), [[Benny Morton]] and [[Dickie Wells]] (trombone).<ref>Leonard Feather, ''The Encyclopedia of Jazz'', Bonanza Books, 1960, p.112</ref> Lester Young, known as \"Prez\" by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. He called Basie \"Holy Man\", \"Holy Main\", and just plain \"Holy\".<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 104</ref>\n\nBasie favored [[blues]], and he would showcase some of the most notable blues singers of the era after he went to New York: [[Billie Holiday]], [[Jimmy Rushing]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Helen Humes]], and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]]. He also hired arrangers who knew how to maximize the band's abilities, such as [[Eddie Durham]] and [[Jimmy Mundy]].\n\n===New York City and the swing years===\nWhen Basie took his orchestra to New York in 1937, they made the Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement).<ref name=nicholson>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Stuart |date=2004 |title=Ella Fitzgerald: A Biography of the First Lady of Jazz, Updated Edition |url= |location=London |publisher=Routledge |pages=50\u201351 |isbn= 9781136788130 | oclc=884745086 |quote=Toward the end of 1937, Ella moved again, this time to the Woodside Hotel at 2424 Seventh Avenue at 142nd Street, to be close to Jo Jones, the drummer from the Count Basie band. The band had recently hit town and was playing the Roseland Ballroom, and most of its members were staying at the Woodside...}}</ref> Soon, they were booked at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, \"We caught the great Count Basie band which is supposed to be so hot he was going to come in here and set the Roseland on fire. Well, the Roseland is still standing\".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 184</ref> Compared to the reigning band of [[Fletcher Henderson]], Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 107</ref>\n\nThe producer John Hammond continued to advise and encourage the band, and they soon came up with some adjustments, including softer playing, more solos, and more standards. They paced themselves to save their hottest numbers for later in the show, to give the audience a chance to warm up.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 188</ref> His first official recordings for [[Decca Records|Decca]] followed, under contract to agent MCA, including \"[[Pennies from Heaven (song)|Pennies from Heaven]]\" and \"[[Honeysuckle Rose (song)|Honeysuckle Rose]]\".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 186</ref>\n\nHammond introduced Basie to [[Billie Holiday]], whom he invited to sing with the band. (Holiday did not record with Basie, as she had her own record contract and preferred working with small combos).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 200</ref> The band's first appearance at the Apollo Theater followed, with the vocalists Holiday and [[Jimmy Rushing]] getting the most attention.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 190</ref> Durham returned to help with arranging and composing, but for the most part, the orchestra worked out its numbers in rehearsal, with Basie guiding the proceedings. There were often no musical notations made. Once the musicians found what they liked, they usually were able to repeat it using their \"head arrangements\" and collective memory.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 199</ref>\n\nNext, Basie played at the [[Savoy Ballroom|Savoy]], which was noted more for [[Lindy Hop|lindy-hopping]], while the Roseland was a place for [[fox-trot]]s and [[conga]]s.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 202</ref> In early 1938, the [[Savoy Ballroom|Savoy]] was the meeting ground for a \"battle of the bands\" with [[Chick Webb]]'s group. Basie had Holiday, and Webb countered with the singer [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. As ''[[Metronome magazine|Metronome]]'' magazine proclaimed, \"Basie's Brilliant Band Conquers Chick's\"; the article described the evening:\n\n<blockquote>Throughout the fight, which never let down in its intensity during the whole fray, Chick took the aggressive, with the Count playing along easily and, on the whole, more musically scientifically. Undismayed by Chick's forceful drum beating, which sent the audience into shouts of encouragement and appreciation and casual beads of perspiration to drop from Chick's brow onto the brass cymbals, the Count maintained an attitude of poise and self-assurance. He constantly parried Chick's thundering haymakers with tantalizing runs and arpeggios which teased more and more force from his adversary.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 208</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe publicity over the big band battle, before and after, gave the Basie band a boost and wider recognition. Soon after, [[Benny Goodman]] recorded their signature \"[[One O'Clock Jump]]\" with his band.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 207</ref>\n\nA few months later, Holiday left for [[Artie Shaw]]'s band. Hammond introduced [[Helen Humes]], whom Basie hired; she stayed with Basie for four years.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 211</ref> When [[Eddie Durham]] left for [[Glenn Miller]]'s orchestra, he was replaced by [[Dicky Wells]]. Basie's 14-man band began playing at the [[Famous Door]], a mid-town nightspot with a [[CBS]] network feed and [[air conditioning]], which Hammond was said to have bought the club in return for their booking Basie steadily throughout the summer of 1938. Their fame took a huge leap.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 217\u2013218</ref> Adding to their play book, Basie received arrangements from [[Jimmy Mundy]] (who had also worked with Benny Goodman and [[Earl Hines]]), particularly for \"Cherokee\", \"Easy Does It\", and \"Super Chief\".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 229</ref> In 1939, Basie and his band made a major cross-country tour, including their first [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] dates. A few months later, Basie quit MCA and signed with the [[William Morris]] Agency, who got them better fees.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 247</ref>\n\nOn February 19, 1940, Count Basie and his Orchestra opened a four-week engagement at [[Southland (jazz venue)|Southland]] in Boston, and they broadcast over the radio on 20 February.<ref name=\"Vail2003\">{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Ken|title=Count Basie: Swingin' the Blues, 1936-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWZjiRBQJBkC&pg=PA36|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4882-5|page=36}}</ref>\nOn the West Coast, in 1942 the band did a spot in ''Reveille With Beverly'', a musical film starring [[Ann Miller]], and a \"Command Performance\" for [[Armed Forces Radio]], with Hollywood stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Carmen Miranda]], [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], and the singer [[Dinah Shore]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 260</ref> Other minor movie spots followed, including ''Choo Choo Swing'', ''Crazy House'', ''Top Man'', ''Stage Door Canteen'', and ''Hit Parade of 1943''.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 262</ref> They also continued to record for OKeh Records and Columbia Records.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 274</ref> The war years caused a lot of members turn over, and the band worked many play dates with lower pay. Dance hall bookings were down sharply as [[swing music|swing]] began to fade, the effects of the [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|musicians' strikes of 1942\u201344]] and 1948 began to be felt, and the public's taste grew for [[pop music|singers]].\n\nBasie occasionally lost some key soloists. However, throughout the 1940s, he maintained a big band that possessed an infectious rhythmic beat, an enthusiastic team spirit, and a long list of inspired and talented jazz soloists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swingmusic.net/Count_Basie.html|title=THE BIOGRAPHY OF COUNT BASIE|first=Jeff|last=Parker|website=Swingmusic.net|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Los Angeles and the Cavalcade of Jazz concerts ===\nCount Basie was the featured artist at the very first Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]] on September 23, 1945 which was produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.|Leon Hefflin Sr.]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Central Avenue--its rise and fall, 1890-c. 1955 : including the musical renaissance of Black Los Angeles|last=Cox, Bette Yarbrough.|date=1996|publisher=BEEM Publications|isbn=0965078302|location=Los Angeles|oclc=35673638}}</ref>  Al Jarvis was the Emcee and other artists to appear on stage were [[Joe Liggins]] and his Honeydrippers, [[Edith Peters|The Peters Sisters]], [[Slim Gaillard|Slim and Bam]], [[Valaida Snow]], and [[Big Joe Turner]].<ref>\"Big Name Bands, Singers in 'Cavalcade of Music' Sept. 23\" \" The California Eagle Sept. 13, 1945.\n</ref> They played to a crowd of 15,000.

For a while, he performed in combos, sometimes stretched to an orchestra. In 1950, he headlined the [[Universal-International]] short film ''[[\"Sugar Chile\" Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet]].'' He reformed his group as a 16-piece orchestra in 1952. This group was eventually called the New Testament band. Basie credited [[Billy Eckstine]], a top male vocalist of the time, for prompting his return to Big Band. He said that [[Norman Granz]] got them into the [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] club and promoted the new band through recordings on the [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], [[Clef Records|Clef]], and [[Verve Records|Verve]] labels.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 289\u2013290</ref> The [[jukebox]] era had begun, and Basie shared the exposure along with early [[rock'n'roll]] and [[rhythm and blues]] artists. Basie's new band was more of an ensemble group, with fewer solo turns, and relying less on \"head\" and more on written arrangements.\n\nBasie added touches of [[bebop]] \"so long as it made sense\", and he required that \"it all had to have feeling\". Basie's band was sharing Birdland with such bebop greats as [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Miles Davis]]. Behind the occasional bebop solos, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, \"so it doesn't matter what they do up front; the audience gets the beat\".<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 5</ref> Basie also added [[flute]] to some numbers, a novelty at the time that became widely copied.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 281, 304</ref> Soon, his band was touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, [[Tommy Turrentine]], [[Johnny Letman]], [[Idrees Sulieman]], and [[Joe Newman (trumpeter)|Joe Newman]] (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, [[Benny Powell]], [[Matthew Gee]] (trombone); [[Paul Quinichette]] and [[Floyd \"Candy\" Johnson]] (tenor sax); [[Marshal Royal]] and [[Ernie Wilkins]] (alto sax); and [[Charlie Fowlkes]] (baritone sax).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 293</ref> ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine reported, \"(Basie) has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this.\"<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 299</ref> In 1957, Basie sued the jazz venue Ball and Chain in Miami over outstanding fees, causing the closure of the venue.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnTSqVu9Zr4C&pg=PA59|title=Jade Visions: The Life and Music of Scott LaFaro|first=Helene|last=LaFaro-Fernandez|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=University of North Texas Press|accessdate=May 2, 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781574412734}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, the band made its first European tour. Jazz was especially appreciated in France, The Netherlands, and Germany in the 1950s; these countries were the stomping grounds for many [[expatriate]] American jazz stars who were either resurrecting their careers or sitting out the years of racial divide in the United States. [[Neal Hefti]] began to provide arrangements, notably \"[[Lil Darlin']]\". By the mid-1950s, Basie's band had become one of the preeminent backing big bands for some of the most prominent jazz vocalists of the time. They also toured with the \"Birdland Stars of 1955\", whose lineup included [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Erroll Garner]], [[Lester Young]], [[George Shearing]], and [[Stan Getz]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 315</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Basie released the live album ''[[Count Basie at Newport]]''. \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\" (arrangement by Wild Bill Davis) was a best-selling instrumental and the title song for the hit album.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 318</ref> The Basie band made two tours in the British Isles and on the second, they put on a command performance for [[Queen Elizabeth II]], along with [[Judy Garland]], [[Vera Lynn]], and [[Mario Lanza]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 323</ref> He was a guest on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'', a venue also opened to several other black entertainers. In 1959, Basie's band recorded a \"greatest hits\" double album ''The Count Basie Story'' ([[Frank Foster (musician)|Frank Foster]], arranger), and ''[[Basie/Eckstine Incorporated]]'', an album featuring Billy Eckstine, [[Quincy Jones]] (as arranger) and the Count Basie Orchestra. It was released by Roulette Records, then later reissued by Capitol Records.\n\nLater that year, Basie appeared on a television special with [[Fred Astaire]], featuring a dance solo to \"[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]\", followed in January 1961 by Basie performing at one of the five [[John F. Kennedy]] Inaugural Balls.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 335, 337</ref> That summer, Basie and [[Duke Ellington]] combined forces for the recording ''First Time! The Count Meets the Duke'', each providing four numbers from their play books.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 339</ref>\n\n[[Image:Countbasie.jpg|thumb|Count Basie (left) in concert (Cologne 1975)]]\nDuring the balance of the 1960s, the band kept busy with tours, recordings, television appearances, festivals, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] shows, and travel abroad, including cruises. Some time around 1964, Basie adopted his trademark yachting cap.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 353</ref>\n\nThrough steady changes in personnel, Basie led the band into the 1980s. Basie made a few more movie appearances, such as the [[Jerry Lewis]] film ''[[Cinderfella]]'' (1960) and the [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), playing a revised arrangement of \"April in Paris\".\n\nDuring its heyday, ''[[The Gong Show]]'' (1976\u201380) used Basie's \"[[Jumpin' at the Woodside]]\" during some episodes, while an NBC stagehand named Eugene Patton would dance on stage; Patton became known as \"Gene Gene, the Dancing Machine\".\n\n==Marriage, family and death==\nBasie was a member of [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity. On July 21, 1930, Basie married Vivian Lee Winn, in Kansas City, Missouri. They were divorced sometime before 1935. Some time in or before 1935, the now single Basie returned to New York City, renting a house at 111 West 138th Street, Manhattan, as evidenced by the 1940 census. He married Catherine Morgan on July 13, 1940 in the King County courthouse in Seattle, Washington. In 1942, they moved to Queens. Their only child, Diane, was born February 6 1944. She was born with [[cerebral palsy]] and the doctors claimed she would never walk. The couple kept her and cared deeply for her, and especially through her mother's tutelage Diane learned not only to walk but to swim.<ref>{{cite web |title=Count Basie: Through his own eyes |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11417720/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1 |website=IMDb |publisher=Eagle Rock Productions}}</ref> The Basies bought a home in the new whites-only neighborhood of Addisleigh Park in 1946 on Adelaide Road and 175th Street, [[St. Albans, Queens]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://prrac.org/newsletters/janfebmar2017.pdf | title=This Green and Pleasant Land | author=Greene, Bryan | newspaper=Poverty and Race | volume=26 | issue=1 | date=January\u2013March 2017 |publisher=Poverty and Race Research Action Council | p=3 }}</ref>\n\nOn April 11, 1983, Catherine Basie died of heart disease at the couple's home in Freeport, Grand Bahama Island.

Jimmy Rushing sang with Basie in the late 1930s. Joe Williams toured with the band and was featured on the 1957 album ''[[One O'Clock Jump (album)|One O'Clock Jump]]'', and 1956's ''[[Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings]]'', with \"[[Every Day I Have the Blues|Every Day (I Have the Blues)]]\" becoming a huge hit. With Billy Eckstine on the album ''[[Basie/Eckstine Incorporated]]'', in 1959. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] made some memorable recordings with Basie, including the 1963 album ''[[Ella and Basie!]]''. With the New Testament Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a youthful [[Quincy Jones]], this album proved a swinging respite from her ''Songbook'' recordings and constant touring she did during this period. She even toured with the Basie Orchestra in the mid-1970s, and Fitzgerald and Basie also met on the 1979 albums ''[[A Classy Pair]]'', ''[[Digital III at Montreux]]'', and ''[[A Perfect Match (Ella Fitzgerald album)|A Perfect Match]]'', the last two also recorded live at Montreux. In addition to [[Quincy Jones]], Basie was using arrangers such as [[Benny Carter]] ''(Kansas City Suite)'', [[Neal Hefti]] ''([[E=MC\u00b2 (Count Basie album)|The Atomic Mr Basie]])'', and [[Sammy Nestico]] ''(Basie-Straight Ahead)''.\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]] recorded for the first time with Basie on 1962's ''[[Sinatra-Basie]]'' and for a second studio album on 1964's ''[[It Might as Well Be Swing]]'', which was arranged by [[Quincy Jones]]. Jones also arranged and conducted 1966's live ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'' which featured Sinatra with Count Basie and his orchestra at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. In May 1970, Sinatra performed in London's [[Royal Festival Hall]] with the Basie orchestra, in a charity benefit for the [[NSPCC|National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]]. Sinatra later said of this concert \"I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting\".<ref name=\"CharlesPignon\">Pignon, Charles (2004). ''The Sinatra Treasures,'' Virgin Books, {{ISBN|1-85227-184-1}}</ref>\n\nBasie also recorded with [[Tony Bennett]] in the late 1950s. Their albums together included ''In Person'' and ''Strike Up the Band.'' Basie also toured with Bennett, including a date at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Other notable recordings were with [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Sarah Vaughan]]. One of Basie's biggest regrets was never recording with [[Louis Armstrong]], though they shared the same bill several times.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 362</ref> In 1968 Basie and his Band recorded an album with [[Jackie Wilson]] titled ''[[Manufacturers of Soul]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jackie-Wilson-Count-Basie-Manufacturers-Of-Soul/master/371537 |title=Jackie Wilson & Count Basie \u2013 Manufacturers Of Soul at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/jackie_wilson/manufacturers_of_soul/ |title=Manufacturers of Soul by Jackie Wilson : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n[[Image:Basie theatre.jpg|thumb|right|Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey]]\n\nCount Basie introduced several generations of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalog.
