Vijay was the 12th man to reach the world No. 1-ranking and was the only new world No. 1 in the 2000s decade. Singh was the leading PGA Tour money winner in 2003, 2004 and 2008. He also captured the [[FedEx Cup]] in [[2008 FedEx Cup Playoffs|2008]].<ref name=pga>{{cite web |url=https://www.pgatour.com/players/player.06567.vijay-singh.html |title=Vijay Singh \u2013 Performance |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career history==\n===Early life and amateur career===\nSingh recollected to reporters about his childhood: \"When we were kids we couldn't afford golf balls so we had to make do with coconuts. My father used to say, 'Little Vijay, golf balls don't fall off trees you know,' so I found some that did!\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pacificislands.cc/pm112004/pmdefault.php?urlarticleid=0013 |title=Golf's Humble Fijian: Vijay Singh's Rise To Number One |first=Peter |last=Rees |magazine=Pacific Magazine |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=8 January 2007}}</ref> Growing up, he played [[snooker]], [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], and the island's most popular sport, [[Rugby football|rugby]]. He is the son of Mohan Singh, an airplane technician who also taught golf. Growing up, he admired the swing of [[Tom Weiskopf]], using it as an early model for his own.\n\n===Professional career===\n====1984\u20131988====\nTwo years after turning professional, Singh won the 1984 Malaysian PGA Championship. However, his career was plunged into crisis after he was suspended from the [[Asian Tour]] in 1985 over allegations he doctored his scorecard. It was alleged that he lowered his score from one over to one under in order to make the cut, but Singh denies this, saying that in any case, it should only have resulted in disqualification from the event rather than a ban. After investigation by the Tour of this and other alleged violations proved true, John Bender, Asian PGA Tour president, issued Singh a lifetime ban on Asian PGA Tour play.\nThis propensity for cheating would continue in his career as we was latter suspended from the PGA for using a banned substance. \nSingh felt he had been more harshly treated because the marker was \"the son of a VIP in the Indonesian PGA.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/12/31/sgspan31.xml |title=Singh hits top note but stays a man of mystery |first=Art |last=Spander |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=31 December 2004 |accessdate=8 January 2007}}</ref> He then took a job at the Keningau Club in [[Sabah]], Malaysia, before his move to the Miri Golf Club in [[Sarawak]]. In 1988 he teamed up with a sponsor, Red Baron, which funded a trip to Africa to compete on the now defunct Safari Tour where he captured his first event, the 1988 [[Nigerian Open]], locals cheered him loudly. At the end of that year he entered the [[European Tour]] [[Qualifying school]] for the second consecutive year, and was successful on this occasion.\n\n====1989\u20131997: First wins in Europe and America====\nIn 1989, Singh won his first European Tour title at the [[Volvo Open Championship]] in Italy and finished 24th on the European Tour Order of Merit, putting his early struggles firmly behind him. He won four times in 1989, at the [[Volvo Open di Firenze]], Ivory Coast Open, Nigerian Open and Zimbabwe Open. He also finished tied for 23rd at [[The Open Championship]]. He won on the European Tour again in 1990 and did so twice in 1992. He also won several tournaments in Asia and Africa in this period.\n\nSingh entered the [[PGA Tour]] in 1993, winning his first PGA Tour event, the [[Buick Classic]] in a playoff over [[Mark Wiebe]]. That victory led to his being named the 1993 [[PGA Tour Rookie of the Year]]. After being hampered with back and neck problems in 1994, he came back to win the Buick Classic again in 1995 as well as the [[Phoenix Open]]. After playing well in 1996 (but with no victories), he won both the [[Memorial Tournament]] and the [[Buick Open]] in 1997.\n\n====1998\u20132004: Major champion to world number 1====\nIn 1998, Singh was victorious at the [[PGA Championship]] at [[Sahalee Country Club]] in [[Sammamish, Washington]], playing a 70-66-67-68 over the four days (the 66 tied a course record) and earning him his first Major title. He followed this up by winning The Masters in 2000, with a three-stroke victory over [[Ernie Els]].\n\nSingh did not win on the PGA Tour in 2001, but finished the year with a Tour-best 14 top-10 finishes and was fourth on the money list with $3,440,829 for the year. In 2002, he won at the [[Shell Houston Open]] at [[TPC at The Woodlands]], setting a new tournament 72-hole scoring record with a 266, and at the [[Tour Championship]], winning by two strokes over [[Charles Howell III]].\n\n2003 proved to be a very successful year for Singh. He won four tournaments, had 18 top-10 finishes and was the PGA Tour's money leader (and had the second highest single-season total in PGA Tour history) with $7,573,907, beating [[Tiger Woods]] by $900,494, though Singh played 27 tournaments compared to Woods' 18 tournaments. Singh also tied a 9-hole scoring record at the [[2003 U.S. Open Golf Championship|U.S. Open]] with a 29 on the back nine of his second round.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Clifton |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/sports/golf-63-singh-ties-record-and-shares-lead-with-furyk.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Singh Ties Record And Shares Lead With Furyk |newspaper=The New York Times |date=14 June 2003 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> His victories came at the [[Phoenix Open]], the [[EDS Byron Nelson Championship]], the [[John Deere Classic]] and the [[FUNAI Classic at the Walt Disney World Resort]]. He narrowly lost the vote for the [[PGA of America]]'s [[PGA Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] to Tiger Woods.\n\nHowever, the 2003 season was also spotted with controversy involving Singh surrounding the year's event at the [[Bank of America Colonial]]. [[LPGA]] star [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] became the first woman to play at a PGA Tour event since [[Babe Zaharias]] at the 1945 [[Los Angeles Open]]. Surrounding this fervor, Singh was misquoted as having said that S\u00f6renstam \"didn't belong\" on the men's tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her. What he actually said is that he would not be paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champion's pool. Singh later clarified, \"There are guys out there trying to make a living. It's not a ladies' tour. If she wants to play, she should\u2014or any other woman for that matter\u2014if they want to play the man's tour, they should qualify and play like everybody else.\"\n\nSingh began 2004 by winning the [[AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]] at \u221216 and winning $954,000 in prize money. This was his first win on tour in 2004 and his 16th all-time on the PGA Tour. It was his 12th consecutive top-10 finish, which is two shy of [[Jack Nicklaus]]' all-time record.\n\nSingh won the final major of 2004, winning the [[2004 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]], his third major, in a three-hole aggregate playoff over [[Justin Leonard]] and [[Chris DiMarco]]. Singh was the leader by one shot over Leonard going into the final round, but made no birdies in the final round, finishing regulation at 67-68-69-76=280. His final round of 76 was the highest winning score by a major champion since 1955. The playoff was a tense affair, and Singh's birdie on the first playoff hole, his first birdie of the day, proved to be the difference.\n\nOn 6 September 2004 ([[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]]), Singh won the [[Deutsche Bank Championship]] in [[Norton, Massachusetts]]. With the win, he overtook [[Tiger Woods]] at the top of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]], ending Woods' streak of 264 weeks at the top of the golf world.\n\nSingh finished the 2004 season with a career-best nine victories, 18 top-10s, and a record $10,905,166 in earnings and was named the PGA Tour's and [[PGA of America]]'s Player of the Year. The former award is decided by a vote of active PGA Tour players.\n\n====2005\u20132008: Success over 40 and FedEx Cup victory====\nDespite picking up a win early in 2005, Singh lost his world number 1 ranking when Tiger Woods won the [[Ford Championship at Doral]] on 6 March, but just two weeks later he took it back again after notching up top three finishes in three consecutive weeks. Followings Woods' win at the 2005 [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], Singh once again lost his place as World No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking and finished tied for fifth place. In April, he became the youngest living person elected to the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]], garnering 56% of the ballot. Thirty-year-old [[Karrie Webb]] was inducted into the Hall of Fame in October 2005, but Singh remained the youngest living electee, as Webb qualified for the Hall without an election process. (The 19th century great [[Tom Morris, Jr.]], who was elected in 1975, died at age 24.) Singh deferred his induction for a year, and it took place in October 2006.\n\nIn 2006, Singh played enough European Tour events to be listed on the European Tour Order of Merit title for the first time since 1995.\n\nAt the start of the 2007 season, Singh won the [[Mercedes-Benz Championship (PGA Tour)|Mercedes-Benz Championship]] which was the first [[FedEx Cup]] event in [[PGA Tour]] history. This win got Singh his 18th tour win over the age of 40, surpassing [[Sam Snead]] as most over 40 wins, and making all-time over 40 tour winner. He won again at The [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] in March, but did not win for the rest of the year which turned into a disappointing year for Singh. He did not finish in a top ten of a major for the first time in ten years and finished 10th in the FedEx Cup race. He went through swing changes during the end of 2007 which resulted in weeks of missed cuts and staying outside the top ten through the [[Presidents Cup]].\n\nA new swing brought big changes for Singh in 2008, although he had good opportunities at [[AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am|Pebble Beach]] and [[Arnold Palmer Invitational|Bay Hill]], he was not competing at a high level for the first half of the year. His game was plagued by poor putting for the better part of two years, but his season started to turn around with a tie for fifth at the [[Travelers Championship]]. After missing the cut at [[The Open Championship]], Singh won the [[WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]] in early August for his first win of the year and first [[World Golf Championship]]. His win had been a relief after missing short putts throughout the week. He missed the cut the following two weeks including at [[Oakland Hills Country Club|Oakland Hills]] for the [[PGA Championship]] and entered the PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoffs ranked 7th in the standings. At the first playoff event, Singh prevailed for his first FedEx Cup win defeating [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]] and [[Kevin Sutherland]] in a [[playoff]]. On the first playoff hole Garc\u00eda and Singh matched long birdie putts before Singh won with birdie on the second playoff hole. Singh was propelled into first place in the [[FedEx Cup]] race with three events remaining. At the second event of the playoffs, he triumphed once again, this time at the [[Deutsche Bank Championship]] bewildering the field with a five strokes victory and a final round 63. He had won three times in his last five starts and created an almost insurmountable lead in the points race. He would not contend in the remaining two events, but by playing in both the [[2008 FedEx Cup]] title belonged to Singh. His season which looked to be a major disappointment in July turned into an historic year for Singh: he won the PGA Tour money list for the third time in his career and he surpassed [[Harry Cooper (golfer)|Harry Cooper]] for most PGA Tour wins of all time for a non-American.\n\nSingh has won 22 times on the PGA Tour since turning 40 \u2013 beating the record previously set by [[Sam Snead]]. He is the second man to reach $60&nbsp;million in PGA Tour career earnings, after [[Tiger Woods]]. His 34 career victories are the most on the PGA Tour by a non-American player and place him 14th on the all-time list. He has spent [[List of male golfers who have been in the world top 10|over 540 weeks ranked in the top 10]] of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf |title=69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking |format=PDF |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=European Tour Official Guide 09 |edition=38th |year=2009 |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |chapter=Players who have reached the Top Ten in the Official World Golf Ranking since 1986 |page=558 }}</ref> Singh's longevity on the PGA Tour and his number of wins earn him a lifetime exemption on the PGA Tour.\n\n[[Kenny Perry]], another player who found success at a late age is good friends with Singh, who calls him \"Biggie\".

It was his first victory in the event. During the start of the 2009 season Singh announced that he would miss three weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.boston.com/2009-01-16/sports/29261843_1_three-time-major-champion-fedex-cup-brian-gay |title=Singh has knee scoped |newspaper=Boston Globe |agency=Associated Press |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> Singh had a mediocre 2009 season, with no top 5 finishes and ended the year with his lowest ever ranking on the PGA Tour money list in 68th.\n\nHis poor form continued into 2010, resulting 66th in the PGA Tour money list. He dropped out of the top 50 in the world rankings for the first time since the early 90s.\n\nAfter returning from knee surgery, Singh started the 2011 season making five out of his first five cuts. In February, Singh was in contention to win his first PGA Tour Title since 2008 at the [[Waste Management Phoenix Open]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]. Despite shooting a final round 66, Singh finished two shots behind [[Jason Dufner]] and eventual winner [[Mark Wilson (golfer)|Mark Wilson]]. A couple weeks later, Singh was in contention again, this time at the [[Northern Trust Open]] at [[Riviera Country Club]]. However he came up short again, not helped by back-to-back bogeys on holes 12 and 13. He would eventually finish two shots back of the winner [[Aaron Baddeley]], although he did secure second spot on his own. This early season form however was not enough to secure a spot at the opening [[World Golf Championship]] of the year, the [[WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]] the following week. However, at number 10 in the 2011 FedEx Cup standings, it was just enough to secure a spot at the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]] in March.\n\nOn 6 June 2011, Singh missed his tee-time for the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] qualifying in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. At the time, this ended the longest active streak of consecutive majors played by a professional golfer, at 67.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/news/2011/06/06/singhap.html |title=Singh fails to show up for U.S. Open qualifier |publisher=PGA Tour |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 January 2013, Singh admitted to using [[deer-antler spray]] while not knowing that it is a banned substance.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vijay Singh could face suspension |first=Bob |last=Harig |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/8897822/vijay-singh-admits-use-banned-substance-deer-antler-spray |work=ESPN |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref> The [[PGA Tour]] later dropped its case against him.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vijay Singh Sues the PGA Tour |first=Bob |last=Harig |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/9254013/vijay-singh-sues-pga-tour-handling-deer-antler-spray-case |work=ESPN |date=8 May 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> On 8 May 2013, Singh sued the PGA Tour for exposing him to public humiliation and ridicule during a 12-week investigation into his use of deer-antler spray.

A resident of [[Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida]], he is known for his meticulous preparation, often arriving hours before, and staying long after, his tournament rounds to work on his game on the driving range and putting greens.\n\n==Media relations==\nControversy surrounded Singh in 2003 before the [[Bank of America Colonial]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] was scheduled to play the event, and Singh was quoted as saying, \"I hope she misses the cut ... because she doesn't belong out here.\" He later said that the substance of his interview to an [[Associated Press]] reporter was that she would be displacing some other struggling male player, for whom he had his sympathies. However, the media focused on this statement. ''[[Golf Digest]]'' wrote that Singh had become \"pro golf's bad guy\".\n\nAfter Singh's win at the Masters, [[Ernie Els]] took issue with some of the negative press his friend received. He wrote an article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' to defend him, saying, \"Golf should be proud of Vijay Singh.\" Later Els said of Singh \"He's a wonderful guy.

He said that he did not expect anything in return from the Fijian government for representing his country. At a press conference on 18 May 2005, Singh commented on what he said was a deterioration in race relations in Fiji, saying that for such a small country, people of all races should live together, put their differences aside, and get on with life. Relations between [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]] and [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]] had been more harmonious when he was younger, he said.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/golf/05/18/singh.fiji/ |title=Singh returns to native Fiji |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=18 May 2005 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Professional wins (64)==\n===PGA Tour wins (34)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n|'''Legend'''\n|- style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n| Major championships (3)\n|- style=\"background:#dfe2e9;\"\n| World Golf Championships (1)\n|- style=\"background:thistle;\"\n| Tour C'ships/FedEx Cup playoff events (3)\n|- \n| Other PGA Tour (27)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n!No.!!Date!!Tournament!!Winning score!!Margin of<br>victory!!Runner(s)-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|13 Jun [[1993 PGA Tour|1993]]\n|[[Buick Classic]]\n|\u22124 (72-68-74-66=280)\n|Playoff\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mark Wiebe]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=right|29 Jan [[1995 PGA Tour|1995]]\n|[[Phoenix Open]]\n|\u221215 (70-67-66-66=269)\n|Playoff\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Billy Mayfair]]\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|align=right|21 May 1995\n|[[Buick Classic]] <small>(2)</small>\n|\u22126 (70-69-67-72=278)\n|Playoff\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Doug Martin (golfer)|Doug Martin]]\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|align=right|2 Jun [[1997 PGA Tour|1997]]\n|[[Memorial Tournament]]\n|\u221214 (70-65-67=202)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jim Furyk]], {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Greg Norman]]\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|align=right|10 Aug 1997\n|[[Buick Open]]\n|\u221215 (67-73-67-66=273)\n|4 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tom Byrum]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Russ Cochran]],<br>{{flagicon|ZAF}} [[Ernie Els]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Brad Fabel]],<br>{{flagicon|JPN|1870}} [[Naomichi Ozaki]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Curtis Strange]]\n|- style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|align=center|6\n|align=right|16 Aug [[1998 PGA Tour|1998]]\n|'''[[1998 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]]'''\n|\u22129 (70-66-67-68=271)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Steve Stricker]]\n|-\n|align=center|7\n|align=right|23 Aug 1998\n|[[The International (golf)|Sprint International]]\n|47 pts (15-12-6-14=47)\n|6 points\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Phil Mickelson]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Willie Wood (golfer)|Willie Wood]]\n|-\n|align=center|8\n|align=right|14 Mar [[1999 PGA Tour|1999]]\n|[[Honda Classic]]\n|\u221211 (71-69-68-69=277)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Payne Stewart]]\n|- style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|align=center|9\n|align=right|9 Apr [[2000 PGA Tour|2000]]\n|'''[[2000 Masters Tournament|Masters Tournament]]'''\n|\u221210 (72-67-70-69=278)\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|ZAF}} [[Ernie Els]]\n|-\n|align=center|10\n|align=right|31 Mar [[2002 PGA Tour|2002]]\n|[[Shell Houston Open]]\n|\u221222 (67-65-66-68=266)\n|6 strokes\n|{{flagicon|NIR}} [[Darren Clarke]]\n|- style=\"background:thistle;\"\n|align=center|11\n|align=right|3 Nov 2002\n|[[The Tour Championship]]\n|\u221212 (65-71-65-67=268)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Charles Howell III]]\n|-\n|align=center|12\n|align=right|26 Jan [[2003 PGA Tour|2003]]\n|[[Phoenix Open]] <small>(2)</small>\n|\u221223 (67-66-65-63=261)\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[John Huston (golfer)|John Huston]]\n|-\n|align=center|13\n|align=right|18 May 2003\n|[[EDS Byron Nelson Championship]]\n|\u221215 (65-65-69-66=265)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|ZWE}} [[Nick Price]]\n|-\n|align=center|14\n|align=right|15 Sep 2003\n|[[John Deere Classic]]\n|\u221216 (66-68-69-65=268)\n|4 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jonathan Byrd (golfer)|Jonathan Byrd]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[J.

Vijay was the 12th man to reach the world No. 1-ranking and was the only new world No. 1 in the 2000s decade. Singh was the leading PGA Tour money winner in 2003, 2004 and 2008.

My father used to say, 'Little Vijay, golf balls don't fall off trees you know,' so I found some that did!\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pacificislands.cc/pm112004/pmdefault.php?urlarticleid=0013 |title=Golf's Humble Fijian: Vijay Singh's Rise To Number One |first=Peter |last=Rees |magazine=Pacific Magazine |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=8 January 2007}}</ref> Growing up, he played [[snooker]], [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], and the island's most popular sport, [[Rugby football|rugby]]. He is the son of Mohan Singh, an airplane technician who also taught golf. Growing up, he admired the swing of [[Tom Weiskopf]], using it as an early model for his own.\n\n===Professional career===\n====1984\u20131988====\nTwo years after turning professional, Singh won the 1984 Malaysian PGA Championship. However, his career was plunged into crisis after he was suspended from the [[Asian Tour]] in 1985 over allegations he doctored his scorecard. It was alleged that he lowered his score from one over to one under in order to make the cut, but Singh denies this, saying that in any case, it should only have resulted in disqualification from the event rather than a ban. After investigation by the Tour of this and other alleged violations proved true, John Bender, Asian PGA Tour president, issued Singh a lifetime ban on Asian PGA Tour play.\n\nSingh felt he had been more harshly treated because the marker was \"the son of a VIP in the Indonesian PGA.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/12/31/sgspan31.xml |title=Singh hits top note but stays a man of mystery |first=Art |last=Spander |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=31 December 2004 |accessdate=8 January 2007}}</ref> He then took a job at the Keningau Club in [[Sabah]], Malaysia, before his move to the Miri Golf Club in [[Sarawak]]. While this was a period of hardship for him, he continued to gain experience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/041000/Sports/Experience_a_good_tea.shtml |title=Experience a good teacher |first=Hubert |last=Mizell |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=10 April 2000 |accessdate=8 January 2007}}</ref> He saved the money he needed to resurrect his career and began to re-enter tournaments. In 1988 he teamed up with a sponsor, Red Baron, which funded a trip to Africa to compete on the now defunct Safari Tour where he captured his first event, the 1988 [[Nigerian Open]], locals cheered him loudly. At the end of that year he entered the [[European Tour]] [[Qualifying school]] for the second consecutive year, and was successful on this occasion.\n\n====1989\u20131997: First wins in Europe and America====\nIn 1989, Singh won his first European Tour title at the [[Volvo Open Championship]] in Italy and finished 24th on the European Tour Order of Merit, putting his early struggles firmly behind him. He won four times in 1989, at the [[Volvo Open di Firenze]], Ivory Coast Open, Nigerian Open and Zimbabwe Open. He also finished tied for 23rd at [[The Open Championship]]. He won on the European Tour again in 1990 and did so twice in 1992. He also won several tournaments in Asia and Africa in this period.\n\nSingh entered the [[PGA Tour]] in 1993, winning his first PGA Tour event, the [[Buick Classic]] in a playoff over [[Mark Wiebe]]. That victory led to his being named the 1993 [[PGA Tour Rookie of the Year]]. After being hampered with back and neck problems in 1994, he came back to win the Buick Classic again in 1995 as well as the [[Phoenix Open]]. After playing well in 1996 (but with no victories), he won both the [[Memorial Tournament]] and the [[Buick Open]] in 1997.\n\n====1998\u20132004: Major champion to world number 1====\nIn 1998, Singh was victorious at the [[PGA Championship]] at [[Sahalee Country Club]] in [[Sammamish, Washington]], playing a 70-66-67-68 over the four days (the 66 tied a course record) and earning him his first Major title. He followed this up by winning The Masters in 2000, with a three-stroke victory over [[Ernie Els]].\n\nSingh did not win on the PGA Tour in 2001, but finished the year with a Tour-best 14 top-10 finishes and was fourth on the money list with $3,440,829 for the year. In 2002, he won at the [[Shell Houston Open]] at [[TPC at The Woodlands]], setting a new tournament 72-hole scoring record with a 266, and at the [[Tour Championship]], winning by two strokes over [[Charles Howell III]].\n\n2003 proved to be a very successful year for Singh. He won four tournaments, had 18 top-10 finishes and was the PGA Tour's money leader (and had the second highest single-season total in PGA Tour history) with $7,573,907, beating [[Tiger Woods]] by $900,494, though Singh played 27 tournaments compared to Woods' 18 tournaments. Singh also tied a 9-hole scoring record at the [[2003 U.S. Open Golf Championship|U.S. Open]] with a 29 on the back nine of his second round.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Clifton |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/sports/golf-63-singh-ties-record-and-shares-lead-with-furyk.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Singh Ties Record And Shares Lead With Furyk |newspaper=The New York Times |date=14 June 2003 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> His victories came at the [[Phoenix Open]], the [[EDS Byron Nelson Championship]], the [[John Deere Classic]] and the [[FUNAI Classic at the Walt Disney World Resort]]. He narrowly lost the vote for the [[PGA of America]]'s [[PGA Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] to Tiger Woods.\n\nHowever, the 2003 season was also spotted with controversy involving Singh surrounding the year's event at the [[Bank of America Colonial]]. [[LPGA]] star [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] became the first woman to play at a PGA Tour event since [[Babe Zaharias]] at the 1945 [[Los Angeles Open]]. Surrounding this fervor, Singh was misquoted as having said that S\u00f6renstam \"didn't belong\" on the men's tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her. What he actually said is that he would not be paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champion's pool. Singh later clarified, \"There are guys out there trying to make a living. It's not a ladies' tour. If she wants to play, she should\u2014or any other woman for that matter\u2014if they want to play the man's tour, they should qualify and play like everybody else.\"\n\nSingh began 2004 by winning the [[AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]] at \u221216 and winning $954,000 in prize money. This was his first win on tour in 2004 and his 16th all-time on the PGA Tour. It was his 12th consecutive top-10 finish, which is two shy of [[Jack Nicklaus]]' all-time record.\n\nSingh won the final major of 2004, winning the [[2004 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]], his third major, in a three-hole aggregate playoff over [[Justin Leonard]] and [[Chris DiMarco]]. Singh was the leader by one shot over Leonard going into the final round, but made no birdies in the final round, finishing regulation at 67-68-69-76=280. His final round of 76 was the highest winning score by a major champion since 1955. The playoff was a tense affair, and Singh's birdie on the first playoff hole, his first birdie of the day, proved to be the difference.\n\nOn 6 September 2004 ([[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]]), Singh won the [[Deutsche Bank Championship]] in [[Norton, Massachusetts]]. With the win, he overtook [[Tiger Woods]] at the top of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]], ending Woods' streak of 264 weeks at the top of the golf world.\n\nSingh finished the 2004 season with a career-best nine victories, 18 top-10s, and a record $10,905,166 in earnings and was named the PGA Tour's and [[PGA of America]]'s Player of the Year. The former award is decided by a vote of active PGA Tour players.\n\n====2005\u20132008: Success over 40 and FedEx Cup victory====\nDespite picking up a win early in 2005, Singh lost his world number 1 ranking when Tiger Woods won the [[Ford Championship at Doral]] on 6 March, but just two weeks later he took it back again after notching up top three finishes in three consecutive weeks. Followings Woods' win at the 2005 [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], Singh once again lost his place as World No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking and finished tied for fifth place. In April, he became the youngest living person elected to the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]], garnering 56% of the ballot. Thirty-year-old [[Karrie Webb]] was inducted into the Hall of Fame in October 2005, but Singh remained the youngest living electee, as Webb qualified for the Hall without an election process. (The 19th century great [[Tom Morris, Jr.]], who was elected in 1975, died at age 24.) Singh deferred his induction for a year, and it took place in October 2006.\n\nIn 2006, Singh played enough European Tour events to be listed on the European Tour Order of Merit title for the first time since 1995.\n\nAt the start of the 2007 season, Singh won the [[Mercedes-Benz Championship (PGA Tour)|Mercedes-Benz Championship]] which was the first [[FedEx Cup]] event in [[PGA Tour]] history. This win got Singh his 18th tour win over the age of 40, surpassing [[Sam Snead]] as most over 40 wins, and making all-time over 40 tour winner. He won again at The [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] in March, but did not win for the rest of the year which turned into a disappointing year for Singh. He did not finish in a top ten of a major for the first time in ten years and finished 10th in the FedEx Cup race. He went through swing changes during the end of 2007 which resulted in weeks of missed cuts and staying outside the top ten through the [[Presidents Cup]].\n\nA new swing brought big changes for Singh in 2008, although he had good opportunities at [[AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am|Pebble Beach]] and [[Arnold Palmer Invitational|Bay Hill]], he was not competing at a high level for the first half of the year. His game was plagued by poor putting for the better part of two years, but his season started to turn around with a tie for fifth at the [[Travelers Championship]]. After missing the cut at [[The Open Championship]], Singh won the [[WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]] in early August for his first win of the year and first [[World Golf Championship]]. His win had been a relief after missing short putts throughout the week. He missed the cut the following two weeks including at [[Oakland Hills Country Club|Oakland Hills]] for the [[PGA Championship]] and entered the PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoffs ranked 7th in the standings. At the first playoff event, Singh prevailed for his first FedEx Cup win defeating [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]] and [[Kevin Sutherland]] in a [[playoff]]. On the first playoff hole Garc\u00eda and Singh matched long birdie putts before Singh won with birdie on the second playoff hole. Singh was propelled into first place in the [[FedEx Cup]] race with three events remaining. At the second event of the playoffs, he triumphed once again, this time at the [[Deutsche Bank Championship]] bewildering the field with a five strokes victory and a final round 63. He had won three times in his last five starts and created an almost insurmountable lead in the points race. He would not contend in the remaining two events, but by playing in both the [[2008 FedEx Cup]] title belonged to Singh. His season which looked to be a major disappointment in July turned into an historic year for Singh: he won the PGA Tour money list for the third time in his career and he surpassed [[Harry Cooper (golfer)|Harry Cooper]] for most PGA Tour wins of all time for a non-American.\n\nSingh has won 22 times on the PGA Tour since turning 40 \u2013 beating the record previously set by [[Sam Snead]]. He is the second man to reach $60&nbsp;million in PGA Tour career earnings, after [[Tiger Woods]]. His 34 career victories are the most on the PGA Tour by a non-American player and place him 14th on the all-time list. He has spent [[List of male golfers who have been in the world top 10|over 540 weeks ranked in the top 10]] of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf |title=69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking |format=PDF |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=European Tour Official Guide 09 |edition=38th |year=2009 |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |chapter=Players who have reached the Top Ten in the Official World Golf Ranking since 1986 |page=558 }}</ref> Singh's longevity on the PGA Tour and his number of wins earn him a lifetime exemption on the PGA Tour.\n\n[[Kenny Perry]], another player who found success at a late age is good friends with Singh, who calls him \"Biggie\".

It was his first victory in the event. During the start of the 2009 season Singh announced that he would miss three weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.boston.com/2009-01-16/sports/29261843_1_three-time-major-champion-fedex-cup-brian-gay |title=Singh has knee scoped |newspaper=Boston Globe |agency=Associated Press |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> Singh had a mediocre 2009 season, with no top 5 finishes and ended the year with his lowest ever ranking on the PGA Tour money list in 68th.\n\nHis poor form continued into 2010, resulting 66th in the PGA Tour money list. He dropped out of the top 50 in the world rankings for the first time since the early 90s.\n\nAfter returning from knee surgery, Singh started the 2011 season making five out of his first five cuts. In February, Singh was in contention to win his first PGA Tour Title since 2008 at the [[Waste Management Phoenix Open]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]. Despite shooting a final round 66, Singh finished two shots behind [[Jason Dufner]] and eventual winner [[Mark Wilson (golfer)|Mark Wilson]]. A couple weeks later, Singh was in contention again, this time at the [[Northern Trust Open]] at [[Riviera Country Club]]. However he came up short again, not helped by back-to-back bogeys on holes 12 and 13. He would eventually finish two shots back of the winner [[Aaron Baddeley]], although he did secure second spot on his own. This early season form however was not enough to secure a spot at the opening [[World Golf Championship]] of the year, the [[WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]] the following week. However, at number 10 in the 2011 FedEx Cup standings, it was just enough to secure a spot at the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]] in March.\n\nOn 6 June 2011, Singh missed his tee-time for the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] qualifying in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. At the time, this ended the longest active streak of consecutive majors played by a professional golfer, at 67.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/news/2011/06/06/singhap.html |title=Singh fails to show up for U.S. Open qualifier |publisher=PGA Tour |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 January 2013, Singh admitted to using [[deer-antler spray]] while not knowing that it is a banned substance.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vijay Singh could face suspension |first=Bob |last=Harig |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/8897822/vijay-singh-admits-use-banned-substance-deer-antler-spray |work=ESPN |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref> The [[PGA Tour]] later dropped its case against him.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vijay Singh Sues the PGA Tour |first=Bob |last=Harig |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/9254013/vijay-singh-sues-pga-tour-handling-deer-antler-spray-case |work=ESPN |date=8 May 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> On 8 May 2013, Singh sued the PGA Tour for exposing him to public humiliation and ridicule during a 12-week investigation into his use of deer-antler spray.

A resident of [[Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida]], he is known for his meticulous preparation, often arriving hours before, and staying long after, his tournament rounds to work on his game on the driving range and putting greens.\n\n==Media relations==\nControversy surrounded Singh in 2003 before the [[Bank of America Colonial]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] was scheduled to play the event, and Singh was quoted as saying, \"I hope she misses the cut ... because she doesn't belong out here.\" He later said that the substance of his interview to an [[Associated Press]] reporter was that she would be displacing some other struggling male player, for whom he had his sympathies. However, the media focused on this statement. ''[[Golf Digest]]'' wrote that Singh had become \"pro golf's bad guy\".\n\nAfter Singh's win at the Masters, [[Ernie Els]] took issue with some of the negative press his friend received. He wrote an article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' to defend him, saying, \"Golf should be proud of Vijay Singh.\" Later Els said of Singh \"He's a wonderful guy. I've known him for the better part of 10 years now. He's a great competitor. I think people have a misconception of Vijay. He's a really good guy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/augusta/news/2001/03/29/single_minded/ |title=The many sides of Vijay Singh |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2005, Singh was appointed a [[goodwill ambassador]] for [[Fiji]]. He said that he did not expect anything in return from the Fijian government for representing his country. At a press conference on 18 May 2005, Singh commented on what he said was a deterioration in race relations in Fiji, saying that for such a small country, people of all races should live together, put their differences aside, and get on with life. Relations between [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]] and [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]] had been more harmonious when he was younger, he said.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/golf/05/18/singh.fiji/ |title=Singh returns to native Fiji |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=18 May 2005 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Professional wins (64)==\n===PGA Tour wins (34)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n|'''Legend'''\n|- style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n| Major championships (3)\n|- style=\"background:#dfe2e9;\"\n| World Golf Championships (1)\n|- style=\"background:thistle;\"\n| Tour C'ships/FedEx Cup playoff events (3)\n|- \n| Other PGA Tour (27)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n!No.!!Date!!Tournament!!Winning score!!Margin of<br>victory!!Runner(s)-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|13 Jun [[1993 PGA Tour|1993]]\n|[[Buick Classic]]\n|\u22124 (72-68-74-66=280)\n|Playoff\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mark Wiebe]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=right|29 Jan [[1995 PGA Tour|1995]]\n|[[Phoenix Open]]\n|\u221215 (70-67-66-66=269)\n|Playoff\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Billy Mayfair]]\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|align=right|21 May 1995\n|[[Buick Classic]] <small>(2)</small>\n|\u22126 (70-69-67-72=278)\n|Playoff\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Doug Martin (golfer)|Doug Martin]]\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|align=right|2 Jun [[1997 PGA Tour|1997]]\n|[[Memorial Tournament]]\n|\u221214 (70-65-67=202)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jim Furyk]], {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Greg Norman]]\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|align=right|10 Aug 1997\n|[[Buick Open]]\n|\u221215 (67-73-67-66=273)\n|4 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tom Byrum]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Russ Cochran]],<br>{{flagicon|ZAF}} [[Ernie Els]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Brad Fabel]],<br>{{flagicon|JPN|1870}} [[Naomichi Ozaki]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Curtis Strange]]\n|- style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|align=center|6\n|align=right|16 Aug [[1998 PGA Tour|1998]]\n|'''[[1998 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]]'''\n|\u22129 (70-66-67-68=271)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Steve Stricker]]\n|-\n|align=center|7\n|align=right|23 Aug 1998\n|[[The International (golf)|Sprint International]]\n|47 pts (15-12-6-14=47)\n|6 points\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Phil Mickelson]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Willie Wood (golfer)|Willie Wood]]\n|-\n|align=center|8\n|align=right|14 Mar [[1999 PGA Tour|1999]]\n|[[Honda Classic]]\n|\u221211 (71-69-68-69=277)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Payne Stewart]]\n|- style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|align=center|9\n|align=right|9 Apr [[2000 PGA Tour|2000]]\n|'''[[2000 Masters Tournament|Masters Tournament]]'''\n|\u221210 (72-67-70-69=278)\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|ZAF}} [[Ernie Els]]\n|-\n|align=center|10\n|align=right|31 Mar [[2002 PGA Tour|2002]]\n|[[Shell Houston Open]]\n|\u221222 (67-65-66-68=266)\n|6 strokes\n|{{flagicon|NIR}} [[Darren Clarke]]\n|- style=\"background:thistle;\"\n|align=center|11\n|align=right|3 Nov 2002\n|[[The Tour Championship]]\n|\u221212 (65-71-65-67=268)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Charles Howell III]]\n|-\n|align=center|12\n|align=right|26 Jan [[2003 PGA Tour|2003]]\n|[[Phoenix Open]] <small>(2)</small>\n|\u221223 (67-66-65-63=261)\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[John Huston (golfer)|John Huston]]\n|-\n|align=center|13\n|align=right|18 May 2003\n|[[EDS Byron Nelson Championship]]\n|\u221215 (65-65-69-66=265)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|ZWE}} [[Nick Price]]\n|-\n|align=center|14\n|align=right|15 Sep 2003\n|[[John Deere Classic]]\n|\u221216 (66-68-69-65=268)\n|4 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jonathan Byrd (golfer)|Jonathan Byrd]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[J.

Nelson's own version appears on his 1962 debut album ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]''.\n\n== Origin ==\nWith some help from a friend named Oliver English, Nelson wrote the song in early 1961; at the time he was a journeyman singer-songwriter who had written several hits for other artists but had not yet had a significant recording of his own. Nelson originally wrote the song for country singer [[Billy Walker (singer)|Billy Walker]], who turned it down for the same reason [[Roy Drusky]] turned down \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\" the previous year: that it was \"a girl's song\". The song's eventual success helped launch Nelson as a performer as well as a songwriter.\n\nMusically the song is a jazz-pop ballad with country overtones and a complex melody. The lyrics describe the singer's state of bemusement at the singer's own helpless love for the object of his affection.\n\nInterviewed for the [[Ken Burns]] 2019 American [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] TV miniseries ''[[Country Music (miniseries)|Country Music]]'', Nelson says he originally titled the song \"Stupid\", but changed it after playing it at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]] and getting fan reaction.\n\n== Patsy Cline version ==\n[[Patsy Cline]] was already a country music superstar{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and looking for material to extend a string of hits.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} She picked it as a follow-up to her previous big hit \"I Fall to Pieces\". \"Crazy\", its complex melody suiting Cline's vocal talent perfectly, was released in late 1961, immediately became another huge hit for Cline and widened the crossover audience she had established with her prior hits. It spent 21 weeks on the chart and eventually became one of her signature tunes. Cline's version is No. 85 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]], becoming the third highest ranked song by a solo female artist, after \"[[Respect (Aretha Franklin song)|Respect]]\" by [[Aretha Franklin]] at #5 and \"[[Walk on By (song)|Walk on By]]\" by [[Dionne Warwick]] at #70.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/patsy-cline-crazy-20110526|title=500 Greatest Songs of All Time|publisher=RollingStone.com|accessdate=2014-04-07|date=2011-04-07}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Willie Nelson in an interview with [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio|Sirius XM]] [[satellite radio]], he was at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]] and had put his own song \"Crazy\" in the jukebox.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjpqWBnHxEU|title=Willie Nelson on Pitching Crazy to Patsy Cline // Willie's Roadhouse|date=28 April 2017|publisher=[[SiriusXM]]|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Patsy Cline's husband heard it and wanted to get it to Patsy. They were both drunk, and Willie was reluctant to go, and he even stayed in the car while her husband played it for her. In the end, she recorded it a few weeks later. In another interview, Willie says that the song originally was called \"Stupid\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/willie-nelson-talks-writing-three-hits-in-one-road-trip-on-letterman-20121122|title=Willie Nelson Visits 'Letterman'|publisher=[[rollingstone.com]]|date=2012-11-22}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ellis Nassour's biography ''Patsy Cline'', Nelson, then a struggling songwriter known as Hugh Nelson, was a regular at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]] on Nashville's [[Lower Broadway]], which he frequented with friends [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Roger Miller]], both also unknown songwriters at this time. Nelson met Cline's husband Charlie Dick at the bar one evening and pitched the song to him. Dick took the track home and played it for Cline, who absolutely hated it at first because Nelson's demo \"spoke\" the lyrics ahead of and behind the beat; an annoyed Cline remarked that she \"couldn't sing like that\".\n\nHowever, Cline's producer, [[Owen Bradley]], loved the song and arranged it in the ballad form in which it later was recorded. On [[Loretta Lynn]]'s album ''[[I Remember Patsy]]'', Bradley reported that as Cline still was recovering from a recent automobile accident that nearly took her life, she'd had difficulty reaching the high notes of the song on the original production night due to her broken ribs. So after about four hours of trying \u2013 in the days of four songs being recorded in three hours \u2013 they called it a night. A week later, she recorded the lead vocal in one take.\n\nIn the same interview, Lynn remembers the first time Cline performed it at the Grand Ole Opry on crutches, and received three standing ovations. [[Barbara Mandrell]] remembers Cline introducing the song to her audiences live in concert saying <blockquote>All my recent hits have come true in my life. I had a hit out called \"Tra-La-La Triangle\" and people thought about me and Gerald and Charlie. I had another hit out called \"I Fall to Pieces\", and I was in a car wreck. Now I'm really worried because I have a new hit single out, and it's called 'Crazy'.</blockquote>\n\nWillie Nelson stated that Cline's version of \"Crazy\" was his favorite song of his that anybody has recorded because it \"was a lot of magic\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XzGOPwCEeY&t=1947|title=Remembering Patsy|publisher=[[TH Entertainment]]|date=1994-08-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Personnel ===\nThe session personnel included:<ref>http://www.patsycline.info/decca.html</ref>\n* [[Harold Bradley]] &ndash; [[Extended-range bass|6-string electric bass]]\n* [[Owen Bradley]] &ndash; organ\n* Patsy Cline &ndash; lead vocals\n* [[Floyd Cramer]] &ndash; piano\n* [[Buddy Harman]] &ndash; drums\n* [[Walter Haynes]] &ndash; [[steel guitar]]\n* Randy Hughes &ndash; acoustic guitar\n* [[The Jordanaires]] &ndash; backing vocals\n* [[Grady Martin]] &ndash; electric guitar\n* [[Bob Moore]] &ndash; acoustic bass\n\n=== Chart performance ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Nelson met Cline's husband Charlie Dick at the bar one evening and pitched the song to him. Dick took the track home and played it for Cline, who absolutely hated it at first because Nelson's demo \"spoke\" the lyrics ahead of and behind the beat; an annoyed Cline remarked that she \"couldn't sing like that\".\n\nHowever, Cline's producer, [[Owen Bradley]], loved the song and arranged it in the ballad form in which it later was recorded. On [[Loretta Lynn]]'s album ''[[I Remember Patsy]]'', Bradley reported that as Cline still was recovering from a recent automobile accident that nearly took her life, she'd had difficulty reaching the high notes of the song on the original production night due to her broken ribs. So after about four hours of trying \u2013 in the days of four songs being recorded in three hours \u2013 they called it a night. A week later, she recorded the lead vocal in one take.\n\nIn the same interview, Lynn remembers the first time Cline performed it at the Grand Ole Opry on crutches, and received three standing ovations. [[Barbara Mandrell]] remembers Cline introducing the song to her audiences live in concert saying <blockquote>All my recent hits have come true in my life. I had a hit out called \"Tra-La-La Triangle\" and people thought about me and Gerald and Charlie. I had another hit out called \"I Fall to Pieces\", and I was in a car wreck. Now I'm really worried because I have a new hit single out, and it's called 'Crazy'.</blockquote>\n\nWillie Nelson stated that Cline's version of \"Crazy\" was his favorite song of his that anybody has recorded because it \"was a lot of magic\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XzGOPwCEeY&t=1947|title=Remembering Patsy|publisher=[[TH Entertainment]]|date=1994-08-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Personnel ===\nThe session personnel included:<ref>http://www.patsycline.info/decca.html</ref>\n* [[Harold Bradley]] &ndash; [[Extended-range bass|6-string electric bass]]\n* [[Owen Bradley]] &ndash; organ\n* Patsy Cline &ndash; lead vocals\n* [[Floyd Cramer]] &ndash; piano\n* [[Buddy Harman]] &ndash; drums\n* [[Walter Haynes]] &ndash; [[steel guitar]]\n* Randy Hughes &ndash; acoustic guitar\n* [[The Jordanaires]] &ndash; backing vocals\n* [[Grady Martin]] &ndash; electric guitar\n* [[Bob Moore]] &ndash; acoustic bass\n\n=== Chart performance ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[biopic]] stars [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia]], a mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], who investigates the flaws of the [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] and the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of [[classical antiquity]] from destruction. [[Max Minghella]] co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and [[Oscar Isaac]] as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]].\n\nThe story uses [[historical fiction]] to highlight the [[relationship between religion and science]] at the time amidst the [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] and the [[Christianization of the Roman Empire]]. The title of the film takes its name from the ''[[agora]]'', a public gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]''. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of [[Malta]] from March to June 2008. [[Justin Pollard]], co-author of ''The Rise and Fall of Alexandria'' (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.\n\n''Agora'' was screened out of competition at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]] in May, and opened in Spain on 9 October 2009 becoming the highest-grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and seven [[Goya Awards]] in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize]] at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 391 AD, [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] is part of the [[Roman Empire]], and Greek philosopher [[Hypatia]] is a teacher at the [[Platonism|Platonic]] school, where future leaders are educated. Hypatia is the daughter of [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]], the director of the [[Musaeum]] of Alexandria. Hypatia, her father's [[slave]], Davus, and two of her pupils, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] and [[Synesius]], are immersed in the changing political and social landscape. She rejects Orestes's love as she prefers to devote herself to science. Davus assists Hypatia in her classes and is interested in science. He is also secretly in love with her.\n\nMeanwhile, social unrest begins challenging the Roman rule of the city as Pagans and Christians come into conflict. When the Christians start defiling the statues of the pagan gods and cause one of their priests to burn in a fire, the pagans, including Orestes and Theon, ambush the Christians. However, in the ensuing battle, the pagans unexpectedly find themselves outnumbered by a large Christian mob. Theon is gravely injured, and Hypatia and the pagans take refuge in the [[Serapeum#Alexandria|Library of the Serapeum]]. The Christian siege of the library ends when an envoy of the Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]] declares that the pagans are pardoned, but the Christians shall be allowed to take possession of the library. Hypatia and the pagans flee while trying to save the most important [[scroll]]s before the Christians overtake the library and destroy its contents. Davus chooses to join the Christian forces. He later returns with a [[gladius]] and [[sexual assault|sexually assaults]] her, but he begins to sob and offers his sword to her. However, she removes his slave collar and tells him that he is free.\n\nSeveral years later, Orestes, now converted to Christianity, is [[prefect]] of Alexandria. Hypatia continues to investigate the motions of the [[Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons#Prehistory|Sun, the Moon, the five known \"wanderers\" (planets)]], and the stars. Some Christians ridicule the thinking that [[spherical Earth|the Earth is a sphere]] by arguing that people far from the top would fall off the Earth. When they ask Davus what his opinion is, he avoids conflict by saying that only God knows these things.\n\nHypatia also investigates the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the solar system proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]] by having an object dropped from the mast of a moving ship which demonstrates that a possible motion of the Earth would not affect the motion, relative to Earth, of a falling object on Earth. However, due to [[Heliocentrism#Religious attitudes to heliocentrism|religious objections against heliocentrism]], the Christians have now forbidden Hypatia to teach at the school. The Christians and the [[Judaism|Jews]] come into violent conflict.\n\nThe leader of the Christians, [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], views Hypatia as having too much influence over Orestes and stages a public ceremony intended to force Orestes to subjugate her. Hypatia's former pupil, Synesius, now the Bishop of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], comes to her rescue as a religious authority counterweight but says he cannot help her unless she accepts Christianity; she refuses. Hypatia theorizes that the Earth orbits around the Sun in an [[elliptic orbit]], not a circular orbit, with the Sun at one of the [[focus (geometry)|foci]]. Cyril convinces a mob of Christians that Hypatia is a [[witch]], and they vow to kill her. Davus tries to run ahead to warn Hypatia, but she is captured. They strip Hypatia and are about to skin her alive until Davus persuades the mob otherwise, and they decide to [[stoning|stone]] her instead. When the mob goes outside to collect stones, Davus suffocates her to spare her the pain of being stoned and tells the mob that she fainted. Davus leaves as they begin to stone her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia of Alexandria]].

The [[biopic]] stars [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia]], a mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], who investigates the flaws of the [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] and the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of [[classical antiquity]] from destruction. [[Max Minghella]] co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and [[Oscar Isaac]] as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]].\n\nThe story uses [[historical fiction]] to highlight the [[relationship between religion and science]] at the time amidst the [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] and the [[Christianization of the Roman Empire]]. The title of the film takes its name from the ''[[agora]]'', a public gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]''. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of [[Malta]] from March to June 2008. [[Justin Pollard]], co-author of ''The Rise and Fall of Alexandria'' (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.\n\n''Agora'' was screened out of competition at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]] in May, and opened in Spain on 9 October 2009 becoming the highest-grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and seven [[Goya Awards]] in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize]] at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 391 AD, [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] is part of the [[Roman Empire]], and Greek philosopher [[Hypatia]] is a teacher at the [[Platonism|Platonic]] school, where future leaders are educated. Hypatia is the daughter of [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]], the director of the [[Musaeum]] of Alexandria. Hypatia, her father's [[slave]], Davus, and two of her pupils, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] and [[Synesius]], are immersed in the changing political and social landscape. She rejects Orestes's love as she prefers to devote herself to science. Davus assists Hypatia in her classes and is interested in science. He is also secretly in love with her.\n\nMeanwhile, social unrest begins challenging the Roman rule of the city as Pagans and Christians come into conflict. When the Christians start defiling the statues of the pagan gods and cause one of their priests to burn in a fire, the pagans, including Orestes and Theon, ambush the Christians. However, in the ensuing battle, the pagans unexpectedly find themselves outnumbered by a large Christian mob. Theon is gravely injured, and Hypatia and the pagans take refuge in the [[Serapeum#Alexandria|Library of the Serapeum]]. The Christian siege of the library ends when an envoy of the Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]] declares that the pagans are pardoned, but the Christians shall be allowed to take possession of the library. Hypatia and the pagans flee while trying to save the most important [[scroll]]s before the Christians overtake the library and destroy its contents. Davus chooses to join the Christian forces. He later returns with a [[gladius]] and [[sexual assault|sexually assaults]] her, but he begins to sob and offers his sword to her. However, she removes his slave collar and tells him that he is free.\n\nSeveral years later, Orestes, now converted to Christianity, is [[prefect]] of Alexandria. Hypatia continues to investigate the motions of the [[Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons#Prehistory|Sun, the Moon, the five known \"wanderers\" (planets)]], and the stars. Some Christians ridicule the thinking that [[spherical Earth|the Earth is a sphere]] by arguing that people far from the top would fall off the Earth. When they ask Davus what his opinion is, he avoids conflict by saying that only God knows these things.\n\nHypatia also investigates the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the solar system proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]] by having an object dropped from the mast of a moving ship which demonstrates that a possible motion of the Earth would not affect the motion, relative to Earth, of a falling object on Earth. However, due to [[Heliocentrism#Religious attitudes to heliocentrism|religious objections against heliocentrism]], the Christians have now forbidden Hypatia to teach at the school. The Christians and the [[Judaism|Jews]] come into violent conflict.\n\nThe leader of the Christians, [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], views Hypatia as having too much influence over Orestes and stages a public ceremony intended to force Orestes to subjugate her. Hypatia's former pupil, Synesius, now the Bishop of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], comes to her rescue as a religious authority counterweight but says he cannot help her unless she accepts Christianity; she refuses. Hypatia theorizes that the Earth orbits around the Sun in an [[elliptic orbit]], not a circular orbit, with the Sun at one of the [[focus (geometry)|foci]]. Cyril convinces a mob of Christians that Hypatia is a [[witch]], and they vow to kill her. Davus tries to run ahead to warn Hypatia, but she is captured. They strip Hypatia and are about to skin her alive until Davus persuades the mob otherwise, and they decide to [[stoning|stone]] her instead. When the mob goes outside to collect stones, Davus suffocates her to spare her the pain of being stoned and tells the mob that she fainted. Davus leaves as they begin to stone her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia of Alexandria]].

Using an experimental approach to each medium, DeFeo developed her own \u201cvisual vocabulary,\u201d playing with scale, color vs. black and white, texture or the illusion of texture, and precision vs. ambiguity. She wrote, \u201cI do believe that more so than most artists, I maintain a kind of consciousness of everything I\u2019ve ever done while I\u2019m engaged on a current work.\u201d<ref>DeFeo, Jay. \"My Visual Vocabulary\" in ''Jay DeFeo: The Ripple Effect'', 139-146</ref> DeFeo often made her artwork in series\u2014exploring, for example, light and dark versions, as well as mirror opposites. At times her artwork took off from a small quotidian object, such as a dental bridge or swimming goggles, transforming the everyday into something with \u201cuniversal character.\u201d<ref>DeFeo, Jay.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as [[stream]], creek, brook, rivulet, and [[rill]]. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to  [[Geographical feature|geographic features]],<ref name=GNIS>{{cite web | title = Mapping, Remote Sensing, and Geospatial Data: What is the difference between 'mountain', 'hill', and 'peak'; 'lake' and 'pond'; or 'river' and 'creek?'| publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | accessdate = 25 August 2019 | url = https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-difference-between-mountain-hill-and-peak-lake-and-pond-or-river-and-creek}}</ref> although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \"run\" in some parts of the United States, \"[[burn (topography)|burn]]\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \"beck\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek,<ref>{{cite web | title = WordNet Search: River | publisher = The Trustees of Princeton University | accessdate = 2 October 2009 | url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=river&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o7=&o5=&o1=1&o6=&o4=&o3=&h=}}</ref> but not always: the language is vague.<ref name=GNIS/>\n\nRivers are part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water generally collects in a river from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through a [[drainage basin]] from [[surface runoff]] and other sources such as [[groundwater recharge]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g., from [[glacier]]s). \nTiddies\nRivers and streams are often considered major features within a landscape, however, they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth. They are made more obvious and significant to humans by the fact that many human cities and civilizations are built around the freshwater supplied by rivers and streams.<ref>{{Cite web | author= Basic Biology | date= 16 January 2016 | title= River | url= https://basicbiology.net/environment/freshwater/river}}</ref> Most of the [[List of largest cities|major cities of the world]] are situated on the banks of rivers, as they are, or were, used as a [[drinking water|source of water]], for obtaining [[seafood|food]], for [[Maritime transport|transport]], as [[borders]], as a defensive measure, as a source of [[hydropower]] to drive machinery, for [[bathing]], and as a means of disposing of [[waste]]. \n\nPotamology is the scientific study of rivers, while [[limnology]] is the study of inland waters in general.\n\n==Topography==\n[[File:Horseshoe_Bend_TC_27-09-2012_15-34-14.jpg|thumbnail|The Colorado River at [[Horseshoe Bend (Arizona)|Horseshoe Bend]], [[Arizona]]]]\n\nA river begins at a [[river source|source]] (or more often several sources), follows a path called a course, and ends at a [[river mouth|mouth]] or mouths. The water in a river is usually confined to a [[stream channel|channel]], made up of a [[stream bed]] between [[stream bank|banks]]. In larger rivers there is often also a wider [[floodplain]] shaped by [[flood]]-waters over-topping the channel. Floodplains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. This distinction between river channel and floodplain can be blurred, especially in urban areas where the floodplain of a river channel can become greatly developed by housing and industry.\n\nRivers can flow down mountains, through [[valleys]] ([[depression (geology)|depressions]]) or along [[plain]]s, and can create [[canyons]] or gorges.\n\nThe term upriver (or upstream) refers to the direction towards the source of the river, i.e. against the direction of flow. Likewise, the term downriver (or downstream) describes the direction towards the mouth of the river, in which the [[current (stream)|current]] flows.\n\nThe term left bank refers to the left bank in the direction of flow, right bank to the right.\n\nThe river channel typically contains a single stream of water, but some rivers flow as several interconnecting streams of water, producing a [[braided river]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWMqaOTqSqcC&pg=PA308|title=Earth's Natural Resources|last=Walther|first=John V.|date=15 February 2013|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-3234-2}}</ref> Extensive braided rivers are now found in only a few regions worldwide,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} such as the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. They also occur on [[peneplain]]s and some of the larger [[river delta]]s. [[Anastomosing stream|Anastamosing rivers]] are similar to braided rivers and are quite rare. They have multiple sinuous channels carrying large volumes of sediment. There are rare cases of [[river bifurcation]] in which a river divides and the resultant flows ending in different seas. An example is the [[bifurcation of Nerodime River]] in [[Kosovo]].\n[[File:The River Cam from the Green Dragon Bridge.jpg|thumb|[[River Cam|The River Cam]] from the Green Dragon Bridge, Cambridge ([[Great Britain|Britain]])]]\n\nA river flowing in its channel is a source of energy which acts on the river channel to change its shape and form. In 1757, the German hydrologist [[Albert Brahms]] empirically observed that the submerged weight of objects that may be carried away by a river is proportional to the sixth power of the river flow speed.<ref name=\"Garde, 1995, 14\"/> This formulation is also sometimes called Airy's law.<ref name=\"Garde, 1995, 19\"/> Thus, if the speed of flow is doubled, the flow would dislodge objects with 64 times as much submerged weight. In mountainous torrential zones this can be seen as erosion channels through hard rocks and the creation of sands and gravels from the destruction of larger rocks. A river valley that was created from a U-shaped [[glaciated]] valley, can often easily be identified by the V-shaped channel that it has carved. In the middle reaches where a river flows over flatter land, [[meander]]s may form through erosion of the river banks and deposition on the inside of bends. Sometimes the river will cut off a loop, shortening the channel and forming an [[oxbow lake]] or [[billabong]]. Rivers that carry large amounts of [[sediment]] may develop conspicuous deltas at their mouths. Rivers whose mouths are in saline [[tide|tidal]] waters may form [[estuary|estuaries]].\n\nThroughout the course of the river, the total volume of water transported downstream will often be a combination of the free water flow together with a substantial volume flowing through sub-surface rocks and gravels that underlie the river and its [[floodplain]] (called the [[hyporheic zone]]). For many rivers in large valleys, this unseen component of flow may greatly exceed the visible flow.\n[[File:Melting Toe of Athabasca Glacier.jpg|thumb|right|Melting toe of Athabasca Glacier, [[Jasper National Park]], [[Alberta|Alberta, Canada]]]]\n\n===Subsurface streams===\nMost but not all rivers flow on the surface. [[Subterranean river]]s flow underground in [[cave]]s or caverns. Such rivers are frequently found in regions with [[limestone]] [[geologic formation]]s. [[Subglacial stream]]s are the braided rivers that flow at the beds of glaciers and [[ice sheet]]s, permitting meltwater to be discharged at the front of the glacier. Because of the gradient in [[pressure]] due to the overlying weight of the glacier, such streams can even flow uphill.\n\n===Permanence of flow===\n{{Main|Intermittent river}}\nAn intermittent river (or [[ephemeral]] river) only flows occasionally and can be dry for several years at a time. These rivers are found in regions with limited or highly variable rainfall, or can occur because of geologic conditions such as a highly permeable river bed. Some ephemeral rivers flow during the summer months but not in the winter. Such rivers are typically fed from chalk aquifers which recharge from winter rainfall. In England these rivers are called ''bournes'' and give their name to places such as [[Bournemouth]] and [[Eastbourne]]. Even in humid regions, the location where flow begins in the smallest tributary streams generally moves upstream in response to precipitation and downstream in its absence or when active summer vegetation diverts water for [[evapotranspiration]]. Normally-dry rivers in arid zones are often identified as [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] or other regional names.\n\nThe meltwater from large hailstorms can create a [[slurry]] of water, hail and sand or soil, forming temporary rivers.<ref>[http://www.tampabayreview.com/news/sand-river-in-iraq/1211/ \"Sand River\" in Iraq is actually a rapid movement of ice blocks].

The Nile is an example of a wave-dominated delta that has the classic Greek letter delta (\u0394) shape after which river deltas were named.]]\n[[File:PIA16197 Titan river.jpg|thumb|upright|A radar image of a {{convert|400|km|mi|adj=on}} river of methane and ethane near the north pole of Saturn's moon [[Lakes of Titan|Titan]]]]\nRivers have been classified by many criteria including their [[topography]], their [[biotic component|biotic]] status, and their relevance to white water [[rafting]] or [[canoe]]ing activities.\n\n===Topographical classification===\nRivers can generally be classified as either [[alluvial river|alluvial]], [[bedrock river|bedrock]], or some mix of the two. Alluvial rivers have channels and floodplains that are self-formed in unconsolidated or weakly consolidated sediments. They [[bank erosion|erode]] their [[streambank|banks]] and deposit material on [[bar (river morphology)|bars]] and their [[floodplain]]s. Bedrock rivers form when the river downcuts through the modern sediments and into the underlying bedrock. This occurs in regions that have experienced some kind of uplift (thereby steepening river gradients) or in which a particular hard [[lithology]] causes a river to have a steepened reach that has not been covered in modern [[alluvium]]. Bedrock rivers very often contain alluvium on their beds; this material is important in eroding and sculpting the channel. Rivers that go through patches of bedrock and patches of deep alluvial cover are classified as mixed bedrock-alluvial.\n\nAlluvial rivers can be further classified by their [[channel pattern]] as meandering, braided, wandering, anastomose, or straight. The morphology of an alluvial river reach is controlled by a combination of sediment supply, substrate composition, discharge, vegetation, and bed [[aggradation]].\n\nAt the start of the 20th century [[William Morris Davis]] devised the \"[[cycle of erosion]]\" method of classifying rivers based on their \"age\". Although Davis's system is still found in many books today, after the 1950s and 1960s it became increasingly criticized and rejected by geomorphologists. His scheme did not produce testable hypotheses and was therefore deemed non-scientific.<ref name=\"Castree2006\">{{cite book|last=Castree|first=Noel|title=Questioning geography: fundamental debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrbzXM_woFQC&pg=PA84|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0192-9|pages=84\u201385}}</ref> Examples of Davis's river \"ages\" include:\n* '''Youthful river''': A river with a steep gradient that has very few tributaries and flows quickly. Its channels erode deeper rather than wider. Examples are the [[Brazos River|Brazos]], [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity]] and [[Ebro River|Ebro]] rivers.\n* '''Mature river''': A river with a gradient that is less steep than those of youthful rivers and flows more slowly. A mature river is fed by many tributaries and has more discharge than a youthful river. Its channels erode wider rather than deeper. Examples are the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]], [[Danube River|Danube]], [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Paran\u00e1 River|Paran\u00e1]] rivers.\n* '''Old river''': A river with a low gradient and low erosive energy. Old rivers are characterized by flood plains. Examples are the [[Yellow River|Yellow]], lower [[Ganges]], [[Tigris]], [[Euphrates]], [[Indus River|Indus]] and lower [[Nile]] rivers.\n* '''Rejuvenated river''': A river with a gradient that is raised by [[tectonics|tectonic]] uplift. Examples are the [[Rio Grande]] and [[Colorado River]].\n\nThe ways in which a river's characteristics vary between its upper and lower course are summarized by the [[Bradshaw model]]. Power-law relationships between channel slope, depth, and width are given as a function of discharge by \"[[river regime]]\".\n\n===Biotic classification===\nThere are several systems of classification based on biotic conditions typically assigning classes from the most [[oligotrophic]] or unpolluted through to the most [[eutrophic]] or polluted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120620161237/http://www.sepa.org.uk/science_and_research/classification_schemes/river_classifications_scheme.aspx River Classification scheme]. sepa.org.uk</ref> Other systems are based on a whole eco-system approach such as developed by the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522192903/http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/publications/rmupdate/rm14/rm14-04.htm NZ\u2019s River Environment Classification system (REC)]. maf.govt.nz</ref>\nIn Europe, the requirements of the [[Water Framework Directive]] has led to the development of a wide range of classification methods including classifications based on fishery status<ref>Noble, Richard and Cowx, Ian et al. (May 2002) [http://fame.boku.ac.at/downloads/D1_2_typology_and%20species_classification.pdf Compilation and harmonisation of fish species classification]. University of Hull, UK. A project under the 5th Framework Programme Energy, Environment and Sustainable Management. Key Action 1: Sustainable Management and Quality of Water</ref>\nA system of river zonation used in [[francophone]] communities<ref name=IlliesBotosaneanu1963 /><ref name=Hawkes1975 />  divides rivers into three primary zones:\n* The ''crenon'' is the uppermost zone at the source of the river. It is further divided into the eucrenon (spring or boil zone) and the hypocrenon (brook or headstream zone). These areas have low temperatures, reduced oxygen content and slow moving water.\n* The ''rhithron'' is the upstream portion of the river that follows the crenon. It has relatively cool temperatures, high oxygen levels, and fast, turbulent, swift flow.\n* The ''potamon'' is the remaining downstream stretch of river. It has warmer temperatures, lower oxygen levels, slow flow and sandier bottoms.\n\n===Whitewater classification===\nThe  [[International Scale of River Difficulty]] is used to rate the challenges of navigation\u2014particularly those with rapids. Class I is the easiest and Class VI is the hardest.\n\n===Stream order classification===\nThe [[Strahler Stream Order]] ranks rivers based on the connectivity and hierarchy of contributing tributaries. Headwaters are first order while the [[Amazon River]] is twelfth order. Approximately 80% of the rivers and streams in the world are of the first and second order.\n\nIn certain languages, distinctions are made among rivers based on their stream order. In French, for example, rivers that run to the sea are called ''fleuve'', while other rivers are called ''rivi\u00e8re''. For example, in [[Canada]], the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]] in [[Manitoba]] is called ''la rivi\u00e8re Churchill'' as it runs to [[Hudson Bay]], but the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] in [[Labrador]] is called ''le fleuve Churchill'' as it runs to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As most rivers in France are known by their names only without the word ''rivi\u00e8re'' or ''fleuve'' (e.g. ''la [[Seine]]'', not ''le fleuve Seine'', even though the Seine is classed as a ''fleuve''), one of the most prominent rivers in the [[Francophonie]] commonly known as ''fleuve'' is ''le fleuve Saint-Laurent'' (the [[Saint Lawrence River]]).\n\nSince many ''fleuves'' are large and prominent, receiving many tributaries, the word is sometimes used to refer to certain large rivers that flow into other ''fleuves''; however, even small streams that run to the sea are called ''fleuve'' (e.g. ''[[:fr:Fleuve c\u00f4tier|fleuve c\u00f4tier]]'', \"coastal ''fleuve''\").\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:river avon at keynsham arp.jpg|thumb|right|Leisure activities on the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]] at Avon Valley Country Park, [[Keynsham]], [[United Kingdom]]. A boat giving trips to the public passes a moored private boat.]]\n\nRivers have been a source of food since pre-history.<ref>[http://en.nmp.gov.tw/park01-2.html \"National Museum of Prehistory-The Peinan Site-Settlements of the Prehistoric Times\"]. ''nmp.gov.tw''.</ref> They are often a rich source of fish and other edible aquatic life, and are a major source of fresh water, which can be used for drinking and [[irrigation]]. Rivers help to determine the [[urban design|urban form]] of cities and neighbourhoods and their corridors often present opportunities for [[urban renewal]] through the development of [[foreshoreway]]s such as river walks. Rivers also provide an easy means of disposing of [[waste water]] and, in much of the less developed world, other wastes. \n\nRivers have been used for [[navigation]] for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of navigation is found in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], which existed in northwestern India around 3300 BC.<ref>[http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/about_freshwater/rivers/ \"WWF \u2013 The World's Rivers\"]. ''panda.org''.</ref> Riverine navigation provides a cheap means of transport, and is still used extensively on most major rivers of the world like the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the [[Ganges River|Ganges]], the [[Nile]], the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and the [[River Indus|Indus]]. Since river boats are often not regulated, they contribute a large amount to global [[greenhouse gas]] [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]], and to local cancer due to inhaling of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] emitted by the transports.<ref name=Meybeck1993 /><ref name=Albrecht2003 /> \n\nRivers have been important in determining political boundaries and defending countries. For example, the [[Danube]] was a long-standing border of the [[Roman Empire]], and today it forms most of the border between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. The Mississippi in [[North America]] and the [[Rhine]] in Europe are major east-west boundaries in those continents. The [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] Rivers in [[southern Africa]] form the boundaries between provinces and countries along their routes.\n\nIn some heavily forested regions such as [[Scandinavia]] and [[Canada]], [[lumberjack]]s use the river to float felled trees downstream to lumber camps for further processing, saving much effort and cost by transporting the huge heavy logs by natural means.\n\n[[File:Braine-le-Ch\u00e2teau JPG02.jpg|thumb|right|Watermill in Belgium]]\nFast flowing rivers and waterfalls are widely used as sources of energy, via [[watermill]]s and [[hydroelectric plant]]s. Evidence of watermills shows them in use for many hundreds of years, for instance in [[Orkney]] at [[Dounby Click Mill]]. Prior to the invention of steam power, watermills for grinding [[cereal]]s and for processing [[wool]] and other textiles were common across [[Europe]]. In the 1890s the first machines to generate power from river water were established at places such as [[Cragside]] in [[Northumberland]] and in recent decades there has been a significant increase in the development of large scale power generation from water, especially in wet mountainous regions such as [[Norway]].\n\nThe coarse sediments, [[gravel]], and [[sand]], generated and moved by rivers are extensively used in construction. In parts of the world this can generate extensive new lake habitats as gravel pits re-fill with water. In other circumstances it can destabilise the river bed and the course of the river and cause severe damage to spawning fish populations which rely on stable gravel formations for egg laying. In upland rivers, [[rapid]]s with [[whitewater]] or even [[waterfall]]s occur. Rapids are often used for recreation, such as [[whitewater kayaking]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qLSsxFZxqIC&pg=PA25|title=Adventure Sport Physiology|last=Draper|first=Nick|last2=Hodgson|first2=Christopher|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-31913-0}}</ref>\n\n==Ecosystem==\n{{Main|River ecosystem}}\n\nThe organisms in the [[riparian zone]] respond to changes in river channel location and patterns of flow. The ecosystem of rivers is generally described by the [[river continuum concept]], which has some additions and refinements to allow for dams and waterfalls and temporary extensive flooding. The concept describes the river as a system in which the physical parameters, the availability of food particles and the composition of the ecosystem are continuously changing along its length. The food (energy) that remains from the upstream part is used downstream.\n\nThe general pattern is that the first order streams contain particulate matter (decaying leaves from the surrounding forests) which is processed there by shredders like [[Plecoptera]] larvae. The products of these shredders are used by collectors, such as [[Hydropsychidae]], and further downstream algae that create the [[primary production]] become the main food source of the organisms. All changes are gradual and the distribution of each species can be described as a [[normal curve]], with the highest density where the conditions are optimal. In rivers [[Ecological succession|succession]] is virtually absent and the composition of the ecosystem stays fixed in time.\n\n==Chemistry==\n{{Main|River chemistry}}\nThe chemistry of rivers is complex and depends on inputs from the atmosphere, the geology through which it travels and the inputs from man's activities. The chemical composition of the water has a large impact on the ecology of that water for both plants and animals and it also affects the uses that may be made of the river water. Understanding and characterising river water chemistry requires a well designed and managed sampling and analysis.\n\n==Brackish water==\n{{Further|Brackish water}}\nSome rivers generate brackish water by having their river mouth in the ocean.\n\n== Flooding ==\n{{main|Flood}}\n[[File:Trapped woman on a car roof during flash flooding in Toowoomba 2.jpg|thumb|[[Flash flood]]ing caused by a large amount of rain falling in a short amount of time]]\n\nFlooding is a natural part of a river's cycle. The majority of the erosion of river channels and the erosion and deposition on the associated floodplains occur during the [[flood stage]]. In many developed areas, human activity has changed the form of river channels, altering magnitudes and frequencies of flooding. Some examples of this are the building of [[levee]]s, the straightening of channels, and the draining of natural [[wetland]]s. In many cases human activities in rivers and floodplains have dramatically increased the risk of flooding. Straightening rivers allows water to flow more rapidly downstream, increasing the risk of flooding places further downstream. Building on flood plains removes flood storage, which again exacerbates downstream flooding. The building of levees only protects the area behind the levees and not those further downstream. Levees and flood-banks can also increase flooding upstream because of the back-water pressure as the river flow is impeded by the narrow channel banks. [[Detention basin]]s finally also reduce the risk of flooding significantly by being able to take up some of the flood water.\n\n==Flow==\nStudying the flows of rivers is one aspect of [[hydrology]].<ref name=Cave />\n\n===Direction===\n[[File:RiverMeanderingCourse.jpg|thumb|River meandering course]]\nRivers flow downhill with their power derived from gravity. The direction can involve all directions of the compass and can be a complex meandering path.<ref name=Rosenberg2006 /><ref name=Rosenberg1 /><ref name=Rydell1997 />\n\nRivers flowing downhill, from river source to river mouth, do not necessarily take the shortest path. For alluvial streams, straight and braided rivers have very low sinuosity and flow directly down hill, while meandering rivers flow from side to side across a valley. Bedrock rivers typically flow in either a [[fractal]] pattern, or a pattern that is determined by weaknesses in the bedrock, such as [[fault (geology)|faults]], [[fracture (geology)|fractures]], or more erodible layers.\n\n===Rate===\n{{main|Streamflow}}\n\n[[Volumetric flow rate]], also known as discharge, volume flow rate, and rate of water flow, is the volume of water which passes through a given cross-section of the river channel per unit time. It is typically measured in [[cubic metres per second]] (cumec) or [[cubic feet per second]] (cfs), where 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s = 35.51&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>/s; it is sometimes also measured in [[litre]]s or [[gallon]]s per second.\n\nVolumetric flow rate can be thought of as the mean velocity of the flow through a given cross-section, times that cross-sectional area. Mean velocity can be approximated through the use of the [[Law of the Wall]]. In general, velocity increases with the depth (or [[hydraulic radius]]) and slope of the river channel, while the cross-sectional area scales with the depth and the width: the double-counting of depth shows the importance of this variable in determining the discharge through the channel.\n\n== Fluvial erosion ==\nIn its youthful stage the river is causes  erosion in the water-course, deepening the valley. [[Hydraulic action]] loosens and dislodges the rock which further erodes the banks and the river bed. Over time, this deepens the river bed and creates steeper sides which are then weathered.\n\nThe steepened nature of the banks causes the sides of the valley to move downslope causing the valley to become [[Valley|V-shaped]]. \n\n[[Waterfall]]s also form in the youthful river valley where a band of hard rock overlays a layer of soft rock. [[Weathering|Differential erosion]] occurs as the river  erodes the soft rock more readily than the hard rock, this leaves the hard rock more elevated and stands out from the river below. A plunge pool forms at the bottom and deepens as a result of hydraulic action and abrasion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/GCSE/Year%2010/PhysicalWorld/Upper%20valley/upper_valley.htm|title=Landforms of the upper valley |website=www.coolgeography.co.uk|access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Sediment yield ==\nSediment yield is the total quantity of particulate matter (suspended or bedload) reaching the outlet of a drainage basin over a fixed time frame. Yield is usually expressed as kilograms per square kilometre per year. Sediment delivery processes are affected by a myriad of factors such as drainage area size, basin slope, climate, sediment type (lithology), vegetation cover, and human land use / management practices. The theoretical concept of the 'sediment delivery ratio' (ratio between yield and total amount of sediment eroded) captures the fact that not all of the sediment is eroded within a  certain catchment that reaches out to the outlet (due to, for example, deposition on floodplains). Such storage opportunities are typically increased in catchments of larger size, thus leading to a lower yield and sediment delivery ratio.\n[[File:Frozen river in Alaska.jpg|thumb|right|Frozen river in Alaska]]\n\n==Management==\n[[File:River bank repair on the River Avon, Saltford.jpg|thumb|River bank repair]]\n{{Main|River engineering}}\nRivers are often managed or controlled to make them more useful or less disruptive to human activity.\n* [[Dam]]s or [[weir]]s may be built to control the flow, store water, or extract energy.\n* [[Levee]]s, known as dikes in Europe, may be built to prevent river water from flowing on floodplains or floodways.\n* [[Canal]]s connect rivers to one another for [[Aqueduct (water supply)|water transfer]] or [[navigation]].\n* River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate.\n\nRiver management is a continuous activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by people. Dredged channels silt up, [[sluice|sluice mechanisms]] deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. The benefits sought through managing rivers may often be offset by the social and economic costs of mitigating the bad effects of such management. As an example, in parts of the developed world, rivers have been confined within channels to free up flat flood-plain land for development. Floods can inundate such development at high financial cost and often with loss of life.\n\nRivers are increasingly managed for [[habitat conservation]], as they are critical for many [[aquatic plant|aquatic]] and [[riparian zone|riparian]] plants, [[freshwater fish|resident]] and [[fish migration|migratory fishes]], [[waterfowl]], [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[bird migration|migrating birds]], and many [[mammal]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Rivers|Environment|Ecology}}\n{{See also|geography|water cycle|drainage basin}}\n;Arts, entertainment, and media\n* \"[[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]]\"\n* ''[[The Riverkeepers]]'' (book)\n;General\n* [[Drought]]\n* [[Fluvial]]\n* [[Salt tide]]\n* [[Water conflict]]\n;Crossings\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Bridge]]\n* [[Ferry]]\n* [[Ford (crossing)]]\n* [[Tunnel]]\n{{Div col end}}\n;Habitats\n* [[Exposed riverine sediments]]\n* [[Riparian zone]]\n;Lists\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Lists of rivers]]\n* [[List of international border rivers]]\n* [[List of rivers by continent]]\n* [[List of rivers by discharge]]\n* [[List of rivers by length]]\n* [[List of waterways]]\n{{Div col end}}\n;Transport\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Barge]]\n* [[Raft]]\n* [[River transport]]\n* [[Riverboat]]\n* [[Sailing]]\n* [[Steamboat]]\n* [[Towpath]]\n* [[Yacht]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=IlliesBotosaneanu1963>{{cite journal|author=Illies, J.|author2= Botosaneanu, L. |title=Probl\u00e9mes et m\u00e9thodes de la classification et de la zonation \u00e9ologique des eaux courantes, consider\u00e9es surtout du point de vue faunistique|journal=Mitt.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as [[stream]], creek, brook, rivulet, and [[rill]]. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to  [[Geographical feature|geographic features]],<ref name=GNIS>{{cite web | title = Mapping, Remote Sensing, and Geospatial Data: What is the difference between 'mountain', 'hill', and 'peak'; 'lake' and 'pond'; or 'river' and 'creek?'| publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | accessdate = 25 August 2019 | url = https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-difference-between-mountain-hill-and-peak-lake-and-pond-or-river-and-creek}}</ref> although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \"run\" in some parts of the United States, \"[[burn (topography)|burn]]\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \"beck\" in northern England.

Water generally collects in a river from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through a [[drainage basin]] from [[surface runoff]] and other sources such as [[groundwater recharge]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g., from [[glacier]]s). \n\nRivers and streams are often considered major features within a landscape, however, they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth. They are made more obvious and significant to humans by the fact that many human cities and civilizations are built around the freshwater supplied by rivers and streams.<ref>{{Cite web | author= Basic Biology | date= 16 January 2016 | title= River | url= https://basicbiology.net/environment/freshwater/river}}</ref> Most of the [[List of largest cities|major cities of the world]] are situated on the banks of rivers, as they are, or were, used as a [[drinking water|source of water]], for obtaining [[seafood|food]], for [[Maritime transport|transport]], as [[borders]], as a defensive measure, as a source of [[hydropower]] to drive machinery, for [[bathing]], and as a means of disposing of [[waste]]. \n\nPotamology is the scientific study of rivers, while [[limnology]] is the study of inland waters in general. \n\n==Topography==\n[[File:Horseshoe_Bend_TC_27-09-2012_15-34-14.jpg|thumbnail|The Colorado River at [[Horseshoe Bend (Arizona)|Horseshoe Bend]], [[Arizona]]]]\n\nA river begins at a [[river source|source]] (or more often several sources), follows a path called a course, and ends at a [[river mouth|mouth]] or mouths. The water in a river is usually confined to a [[stream channel|channel]], made up of a [[stream bed]] between [[stream bank|banks]]. In larger rivers there is often also a wider [[floodplain]] shaped by [[flood]]-waters over-topping the channel. Floodplains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. This distinction between river channel and floodplain can be blurred, especially in urban areas where the floodplain of a river channel can become greatly developed by housing and industry.\n\nRivers can flow down mountains, through [[valleys]] ([[depression (geology)|depressions]]) or along [[plain]]s, and can create [[canyons]] or gorges.\n\nThe term upriver (or upstream) refers to the direction towards the source of the river, i.e. against the direction of flow. Likewise, the term downriver (or downstream) describes the direction towards the mouth of the river, in which the [[current (stream)|current]] flows.\n\nThe term left bank refers to the left bank in the direction of flow, right bank to the right.\n\nThe river channel typically contains a single stream of water, but some rivers flow as several interconnecting streams of water, producing a [[braided river]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWMqaOTqSqcC&pg=PA308|title=Earth's Natural Resources|last=Walther|first=John V.|date=15 February 2013|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-3234-2}}</ref> Extensive braided rivers are now found in only a few regions worldwide,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} such as the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. They also occur on [[peneplain]]s and some of the larger [[river delta]]s. [[Anastomosing stream|Anastamosing rivers]] are similar to braided rivers and are quite rare. They have multiple sinuous channels carrying large volumes of sediment. There are rare cases of [[river bifurcation]] in which a river divides and the resultant flows ending in different seas. An example is the [[bifurcation of Nerodime River]] in [[Kosovo]].\n[[File:The River Cam from the Green Dragon Bridge.jpg|thumb|[[River Cam|The River Cam]] from the Green Dragon Bridge, Cambridge ([[Great Britain|Britain]])]]\n\nA river flowing in its channel is a source of energy which acts on the river channel to change its shape and form. In 1757, the German hydrologist [[Albert Brahms]] empirically observed that the submerged weight of objects that may be carried away by a river is proportional to the sixth power of the river flow speed.<ref name=\"Garde, 1995, 14\"/> This formulation is also sometimes called Airy's law.<ref name=\"Garde, 1995, 19\"/> Thus, if the speed of flow is doubled, the flow would dislodge objects with 64 times as much submerged weight. In mountainous torrential zones this can be seen as erosion channels through hard rocks and the creation of sands and gravels from the destruction of larger rocks. A river valley that was created from a U-shaped [[glaciated]] valley, can often easily be identified by the V-shaped channel that it has carved. In the middle reaches where a river flows over flatter land, [[meander]]s may form through erosion of the river banks and deposition on the inside of bends. Sometimes the river will cut off a loop, shortening the channel and forming an [[oxbow lake]] or [[billabong]]. Rivers that carry large amounts of [[sediment]] may develop conspicuous deltas at their mouths. Rivers whose mouths are in saline [[tide|tidal]] waters may form [[estuary|estuaries]].\n\nThroughout the course of the river, the total volume of water transported downstream will often be a combination of the free water flow together with a substantial volume flowing through sub-surface rocks and gravels that underlie the river and its [[floodplain]] (called the [[hyporheic zone]]). For many rivers in large valleys, this unseen component of flow may greatly exceed the visible flow.\n[[File:Melting Toe of Athabasca Glacier.jpg|thumb|right|Melting toe of Athabasca Glacier, [[Jasper National Park]], [[Alberta|Alberta, Canada]]]]\n\n===Subsurface streams===\nMost but not all rivers flow on the surface. [[Subterranean river]]s flow underground in [[cave]]s or caverns. Such rivers are frequently found in regions with [[limestone]] [[geologic formation]]s. [[Subglacial stream]]s are the braided rivers that flow at the beds of glaciers and [[ice sheet]]s, permitting meltwater to be discharged at the front of the glacier. Because of the gradient in [[pressure]] due to the overlying weight of the glacier, such streams can even flow uphill.\n\n===Permanence of flow===\n{{Main|Intermittent river}}\nAn intermittent river (or [[ephemeral]] river) only flows occasionally and can be dry for several years at a time. These rivers are found in regions with limited or highly variable rainfall, or can occur because of geologic conditions such as a highly permeable river bed. Some ephemeral rivers flow during the summer months but not in the winter. Such rivers are typically fed from chalk aquifers which recharge from winter rainfall. In England these rivers are called ''bournes'' and give their name to places such as [[Bournemouth]] and [[Eastbourne]]. Even in humid regions, the location where flow begins in the smallest tributary streams generally moves upstream in response to precipitation and downstream in its absence or when active summer vegetation diverts water for [[evapotranspiration]]. Normally-dry rivers in arid zones are often identified as [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] or other regional names.\n\nThe meltwater from large hailstorms can create a [[slurry]] of water, hail and sand or soil, forming temporary rivers.<ref>[http://www.tampabayreview.com/news/sand-river-in-iraq/1211/ \"Sand River\" in Iraq is actually a rapid movement of ice blocks].

The Nile is an example of a wave-dominated delta that has the classic Greek letter delta (\u0394) shape after which river deltas were named.]]\n[[File:PIA16197 Titan river.jpg|thumb|upright|A radar image of a {{convert|400|km|mi|adj=on}} river of methane and ethane near the north pole of Saturn's moon [[Lakes of Titan|Titan]]]]\nRivers have been classified by many criteria including their [[topography]], their [[biotic component|biotic]] status, and their relevance to white water [[rafting]] or [[canoe]]ing activities.\n\n===Topographical classification===\nRivers can generally be classified as either [[alluvial river|alluvial]], [[bedrock river|bedrock]], or some mix of the two. Alluvial rivers have channels and floodplains that are self-formed in unconsolidated or weakly consolidated sediments. They [[bank erosion|erode]] their [[streambank|banks]] and deposit material on [[bar (river morphology)|bars]] and their [[floodplain]]s. Bedrock rivers form when the river downcuts through the modern sediments and into the underlying bedrock. This occurs in regions that have experienced some kind of uplift (thereby steepening river gradients) or in which a particular hard [[lithology]] causes a river to have a steepened reach that has not been covered in modern [[alluvium]]. Bedrock rivers very often contain alluvium on their beds; this material is important in eroding and sculpting the channel. Rivers that go through patches of bedrock and patches of deep alluvial cover are classified as mixed bedrock-alluvial.\n\nAlluvial rivers can be further classified by their [[channel pattern]] as meandering, braided, wandering, anastomose, or straight. The morphology of an alluvial river reach is controlled by a combination of sediment supply, substrate composition, discharge, vegetation, and bed [[aggradation]].\n\nAt the start of the 20th century [[William Morris Davis]] devised the \"[[cycle of erosion]]\" method of classifying rivers based on their \"age\". Although Davis's system is still found in many books today, after the 1950s and 1960s it became increasingly criticized and rejected by geomorphologists. His scheme did not produce testable hypotheses and was therefore deemed non-scientific.<ref name=\"Castree2006\">{{cite book|last=Castree|first=Noel|title=Questioning geography: fundamental debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrbzXM_woFQC&pg=PA84|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0192-9|pages=84\u201385}}</ref> Examples of Davis's river \"ages\" include:\n* '''Youthful river''': A river with a steep gradient that has very few tributaries and flows quickly. Its channels erode deeper rather than wider. Examples are the [[Brazos River|Brazos]], [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity]] and [[Ebro River|Ebro]] rivers.\n* '''Mature river''': A river with a gradient that is less steep than those of youthful rivers and flows more slowly. A mature river is fed by many tributaries and has more discharge than a youthful river. Its channels erode wider rather than deeper. Examples are the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]], [[Danube River|Danube]], [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Paran\u00e1 River|Paran\u00e1]] rivers.\n* '''Old river''': A river with a low gradient and low erosive energy. Old rivers are characterized by flood plains. Examples are the [[Yellow River|Yellow]], lower [[Ganges]], [[Tigris]], [[Euphrates]], [[Indus River|Indus]] and lower [[Nile]] rivers.\n* '''Rejuvenated river''': A river with a gradient that is raised by [[tectonics|tectonic]] uplift. Examples are the [[Rio Grande]] and [[Colorado River]].\n\nThe ways in which a river's characteristics vary between its upper and lower course are summarized by the [[Bradshaw model]]. Power-law relationships between channel slope, depth, and width are given as a function of discharge by \"[[river regime]]\".\n\n===Biotic classification===\nThere are several systems of classification based on biotic conditions typically assigning classes from the most [[oligotrophic]] or unpolluted through to the most [[eutrophic]] or polluted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120620161237/http://www.sepa.org.uk/science_and_research/classification_schemes/river_classifications_scheme.aspx River Classification scheme]. sepa.org.uk</ref> Other systems are based on a whole eco-system approach such as developed by the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522192903/http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/publications/rmupdate/rm14/rm14-04.htm NZ\u2019s River Environment Classification system (REC)]. maf.govt.nz</ref>\nIn Europe, the requirements of the [[Water Framework Directive]] has led to the development of a wide range of classification methods including classifications based on fishery status<ref>Noble, Richard and Cowx, Ian et al. (May 2002) [http://fame.boku.ac.at/downloads/D1_2_typology_and%20species_classification.pdf Compilation and harmonisation of fish species classification]. University of Hull, UK. A project under the 5th Framework Programme Energy, Environment and Sustainable Management. Key Action 1: Sustainable Management and Quality of Water</ref>\nA system of river zonation used in [[francophone]] communities<ref name=IlliesBotosaneanu1963 /><ref name=Hawkes1975 />  divides rivers into three primary zones:\n* The ''crenon'' is the uppermost zone at the source of the river. It is further divided into the eucrenon (spring or boil zone) and the hypocrenon (brook or headstream zone). These areas have low temperatures, reduced oxygen content and slow moving water.\n* The ''rhithron'' is the upstream portion of the river that follows the crenon. It has relatively cool temperatures, high oxygen levels, and fast, turbulent, swift flow.\n* The ''potamon'' is the remaining downstream stretch of river. It has warmer temperatures, lower oxygen levels, slow flow and sandier bottoms.\n\n===Whitewater classification===\nThe  [[International Scale of River Difficulty]] is used to rate the challenges of navigation\u2014particularly those with rapids. Class I is the easiest and Class VI is the hardest.\n\n===Stream order classification===\nThe [[Strahler Stream Order]] ranks rivers based on the connectivity and hierarchy of contributing tributaries. Headwaters are first order while the [[Amazon River]] is twelfth order. Approximately 80% of the rivers and streams in the world are of the first and second order.\n\nIn certain languages, distinctions are made among rivers based on their stream order. In French, for example, rivers that run to the sea are called ''fleuve'', while other rivers are called ''rivi\u00e8re''. For example, in [[Canada]], the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]] in [[Manitoba]] is called ''la rivi\u00e8re Churchill'' as it runs to [[Hudson Bay]], but the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] in [[Labrador]] is called ''le fleuve Churchill'' as it runs to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As most rivers in France are known by their names only without the word ''rivi\u00e8re'' or ''fleuve'' (e.g. ''la [[Seine]]'', not ''le fleuve Seine'', even though the Seine is classed as a ''fleuve''), one of the most prominent rivers in the [[Francophonie]] commonly known as ''fleuve'' is ''le fleuve Saint-Laurent'' (the [[Saint Lawrence River]]).\n\nSince many ''fleuves'' are large and prominent, receiving many tributaries, the word is sometimes used to refer to certain large rivers that flow into other ''fleuves''; however, even small streams that run to the sea are called ''fleuve'' (e.g. ''[[:fr:Fleuve c\u00f4tier|fleuve c\u00f4tier]]'', \"coastal ''fleuve''\").\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:river avon at keynsham arp.jpg|thumb|right|Leisure activities on the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]] at Avon Valley Country Park, [[Keynsham]], [[United Kingdom]]. A boat giving trips to the public passes a moored private boat.]]\n\nRivers have been a source of food since pre-history.<ref>[http://en.nmp.gov.tw/park01-2.html \"National Museum of Prehistory-The Peinan Site-Settlements of the Prehistoric Times\"]. ''nmp.gov.tw''.</ref> They are often a rich source of fish and other edible aquatic life, and are a major source of fresh water, which can be used for drinking and [[irrigation]]. Rivers help to determine the [[urban design|urban form]] of cities and neighbourhoods and their corridors often present opportunities for [[urban renewal]] through the development of [[foreshoreway]]s such as river walks. Rivers also provide an easy means of disposing of [[waste water]] and, in much of the less developed world, other wastes. \n\nRivers have been used for [[navigation]] for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of navigation is found in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], which existed in northwestern India around 3300 BC.<ref>[http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/about_freshwater/rivers/ \"WWF \u2013 The World's Rivers\"]. ''panda.org''.</ref> Riverine navigation provides a cheap means of transport, and is still used extensively on most major rivers of the world like the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the [[Ganges River|Ganges]], the [[Nile]], the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and the [[River Indus|Indus]]. Since river boats are often not regulated, they contribute a large amount to global [[greenhouse gas]] [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]], and to local cancer due to inhaling of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] emitted by the transports.<ref name=Meybeck1993 /><ref name=Albrecht2003 /> \n\nRivers have been important in determining political boundaries and defending countries. For example, the [[Danube]] was a long-standing border of the [[Roman Empire]], and today it forms most of the border between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. The Mississippi in [[North America]] and the [[Rhine]] in Europe are major east-west boundaries in those continents. The [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] Rivers in [[southern Africa]] form the boundaries between provinces and countries along their routes.\n\nIn some heavily forested regions such as [[Scandinavia]] and [[Canada]], [[lumberjack]]s use the river to float felled trees downstream to lumber camps for further processing, saving much effort and cost by transporting the huge heavy logs by natural means.\n\n[[File:Braine-le-Ch\u00e2teau JPG02.jpg|thumb|right|Watermill in Belgium]]\nFast flowing rivers and waterfalls are widely used as sources of energy, via [[watermill]]s and [[hydroelectric plant]]s. Evidence of watermills shows them in use for many hundreds of years, for instance in [[Orkney]] at [[Dounby Click Mill]]. Prior to the invention of steam power, watermills for grinding [[cereal]]s and for processing [[wool]] and other textiles were common across [[Europe]]. In the 1890s the first machines to generate power from river water were established at places such as [[Cragside]] in [[Northumberland]] and in recent decades there has been a significant increase in the development of large scale power generation from water, especially in wet mountainous regions such as [[Norway]].\n\nThe coarse sediments, [[gravel]], and [[sand]], generated and moved by rivers are extensively used in construction. In parts of the world this can generate extensive new lake habitats as gravel pits re-fill with water. In other circumstances it can destabilise the river bed and the course of the river and cause severe damage to spawning fish populations which rely on stable gravel formations for egg laying. In upland rivers, [[rapid]]s with [[whitewater]] or even [[waterfall]]s occur. Rapids are often used for recreation, such as [[whitewater kayaking]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qLSsxFZxqIC&pg=PA25|title=Adventure Sport Physiology|last=Draper|first=Nick|last2=Hodgson|first2=Christopher|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-31913-0}}</ref>\n\n==Ecosystem==\n{{Main|River ecosystem}}\n\nThe organisms in the [[riparian zone]] respond to changes in river channel location and patterns of flow. The ecosystem of rivers is generally described by the [[river continuum concept]], which has some additions and refinements to allow for dams and waterfalls and temporary extensive flooding. The concept describes the river as a system in which the physical parameters, the availability of food particles and the composition of the ecosystem are continuously changing along its length. The food (energy) that remains from the upstream part is used downstream.\n\nThe general pattern is that the first order streams contain particulate matter (decaying leaves from the surrounding forests) which is processed there by shredders like [[Plecoptera]] larvae. The products of these shredders are used by collectors, such as [[Hydropsychidae]], and further downstream algae that create the [[primary production]] become the main food source of the organisms. All changes are gradual and the distribution of each species can be described as a [[normal curve]], with the highest density where the conditions are optimal. In rivers [[Ecological succession|succession]] is virtually absent and the composition of the ecosystem stays fixed in time.\n\n==Chemistry==\n{{Main|River chemistry}}\nThe chemistry of rivers is complex and depends on inputs from the atmosphere, the geology through which it travels and the inputs from man's activities. The chemical composition of the water has a large impact on the ecology of that water for both plants and animals and it also affects the uses that may be made of the river water. Understanding and characterising river water chemistry requires a well designed and managed sampling and analysis.\n\n==Brackish water==\n{{Further|Brackish water}}\nSome rivers generate brackish water by having their river mouth in the ocean.\n\n== Flooding ==\n{{main|Flood}}\n[[File:Trapped woman on a car roof during flash flooding in Toowoomba 2.jpg|thumb|[[Flash flood]]ing caused by a large amount of rain falling in a short amount of time]]\n\nFlooding is a natural part of a river's cycle. The majority of the erosion of river channels and the erosion and deposition on the associated floodplains occur during the [[flood stage]]. In many developed areas, human activity has changed the form of river channels, altering magnitudes and frequencies of flooding. Some examples of this are the building of [[levee]]s, the straightening of channels, and the draining of natural [[wetland]]s. In many cases human activities in rivers and floodplains have dramatically increased the risk of flooding. Straightening rivers allows water to flow more rapidly downstream, increasing the risk of flooding places further downstream. Building on flood plains removes flood storage, which again exacerbates downstream flooding. The building of levees only protects the area behind the levees and not those further downstream. Levees and flood-banks can also increase flooding upstream because of the back-water pressure as the river flow is impeded by the narrow channel banks. [[Detention basin]]s finally also reduce the risk of flooding significantly by being able to take up some of the flood water.\n\n==Flow==\nStudying the flows of rivers is one aspect of [[hydrology]].<ref name=Cave />\n\n===Direction===\n[[File:RiverMeanderingCourse.jpg|thumb|River meandering course]]\nRivers flow downhill with their power derived from gravity. The direction can involve all directions of the compass and can be a complex meandering path.<ref name=Rosenberg2006 /><ref name=Rosenberg1 /><ref name=Rydell1997 />\n\nRivers flowing downhill, from river source to river mouth, do not necessarily take the shortest path. For alluvial streams, straight and braided rivers have very low sinuosity and flow directly down hill, while meandering rivers flow from side to side across a valley. Bedrock rivers typically flow in either a [[fractal]] pattern, or a pattern that is determined by weaknesses in the bedrock, such as [[fault (geology)|faults]], [[fracture (geology)|fractures]], or more erodible layers.\n\n===Rate===\n{{main|Streamflow}}\n\n[[Volumetric flow rate]], also known as discharge, volume flow rate, and rate of water flow, is the volume of water which passes through a given cross-section of the river channel per unit time. It is typically measured in [[cubic metres per second]] (cumec) or [[cubic feet per second]] (cfs), where 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s = 35.51&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>/s; it is sometimes also measured in [[litre]]s or [[gallon]]s per second.\n\nVolumetric flow rate can be thought of as the mean velocity of the flow through a given cross-section, times that cross-sectional area. Mean velocity can be approximated through the use of the [[Law of the Wall]]. In general, velocity increases with the depth (or [[hydraulic radius]]) and slope of the river channel, while the cross-sectional area scales with the depth and the width: the double-counting of depth shows the importance of this variable in determining the discharge through the channel.\n\n== Fluvial erosion ==\nIn its youthful stage the river is causes  erosion in the water-course, deepening the valley. [[Hydraulic action]] loosens and dislodges the rock which further erodes the banks and the river bed. Over time, this deepens the river bed and creates steeper sides which are then weathered.\n\nThe steepened nature of the banks causes the sides of the valley to move downslope causing the valley to become [[Valley|V-shaped]]. \n\n[[Waterfall]]s also form in the youthful river valley where a band of hard rock overlays a layer of soft rock. [[Weathering|Differential erosion]] occurs as the river  erodes the soft rock more readily than the hard rock, this leaves the hard rock more elevated and stands out from the river below. A plunge pool forms at the bottom and deepens as a result of hydraulic action and abrasion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/GCSE/Year%2010/PhysicalWorld/Upper%20valley/upper_valley.htm|title=Landforms of the upper valley |website=www.coolgeography.co.uk|access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Sediment yield ==\nSediment yield is the total quantity of particulate matter (suspended or bedload) reaching the outlet of a drainage basin over a fixed time frame. Yield is usually expressed as kilograms per square kilometre per year. Sediment delivery processes are affected by a myriad of factors such as drainage area size, basin slope, climate, sediment type (lithology), vegetation cover, and human land use / management practices. The theoretical concept of the 'sediment delivery ratio' (ratio between yield and total amount of sediment eroded) captures the fact that not all of the sediment is eroded within a  certain catchment that reaches out to the outlet (due to, for example, deposition on floodplains). Such storage opportunities are typically increased in catchments of larger size, thus leading to a lower yield and sediment delivery ratio.\n[[File:Frozen river in Alaska.jpg|thumb|right|Frozen river in Alaska]]\n\n==Management==\n[[File:River bank repair on the River Avon, Saltford.jpg|thumb|River bank repair]]\n{{Main|River engineering}}\nRivers are often managed or controlled to make them more useful or less disruptive to human activity.\n* [[Dam]]s or [[weir]]s may be built to control the flow, store water, or extract energy.\n* [[Levee]]s, known as dikes in Europe, may be built to prevent river water from flowing on floodplains or floodways.\n* [[Canal]]s connect rivers to one another for [[Aqueduct (water supply)|water transfer]] or [[navigation]].\n* River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate.\n\nRiver management is a continuous activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by people. Dredged channels silt up, [[sluice|sluice mechanisms]] deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. The benefits sought through managing rivers may often be offset by the social and economic costs of mitigating the bad effects of such management. As an example, in parts of the developed world, rivers have been confined within channels to free up flat flood-plain land for development. Floods can inundate such development at high financial cost and often with loss of life.\n\nRivers are increasingly managed for [[habitat conservation]], as they are critical for many [[aquatic plant|aquatic]] and [[riparian zone|riparian]] plants, [[freshwater fish|resident]] and [[fish migration|migratory fishes]], [[waterfowl]], [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[bird migration|migrating birds]], and many [[mammal]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Rivers|Environment|Ecology}}\n{{See also|geography|water cycle|drainage basin}}\n;Arts, entertainment, and media\n* \"[[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]]\"\n* ''[[The Riverkeepers]]'' (book)\n;General\n* [[Drought]]\n* [[Fluvial]]\n* [[Salt tide]]\n* [[Water conflict]]\n;Crossings\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Bridge]]\n* [[Ferry]]\n* [[Ford (crossing)]]\n* [[Tunnel]]\n{{Div col end}}\n;Habitats\n* [[Exposed riverine sediments]]\n* [[Riparian zone]]\n;Lists\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Lists of rivers]]\n* [[List of international border rivers]]\n* [[List of rivers by continent]]\n* [[List of rivers by discharge]]\n* [[List of rivers by length]]\n* [[List of waterways]]\n{{Div col end}}\n;Transport\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Barge]]\n* [[Raft]]\n* [[River transport]]\n* [[Riverboat]]\n* [[Sailing]]\n* [[Steamboat]]\n* [[Towpath]]\n* [[Yacht]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=IlliesBotosaneanu1963>{{cite journal|author=Illies, J.|author2= Botosaneanu, L. |title=Probl\u00e9mes et m\u00e9thodes de la classification et de la zonation \u00e9ologique des eaux courantes, consider\u00e9es surtout du point de vue faunistique|journal=Mitt.
