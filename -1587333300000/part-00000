Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of \"heroic\" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism.<ref>\"'A remarkable thing,' continued Bazarov, 'these funny old Romantics!

The importance the Romantics placed on emotion is summed up in the remark of the German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]], \"the artist's feeling is his law\".<ref>Novotny, 96</ref> For [[William Wordsworth]], poetry should begin as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\", which the poet then \"recollect[s] in tranquility\", evoking a new but corresponding emotion the poet can then mold into art.<ref>From the Preface to the 2nd edition of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', quoted Day, 2</ref>\n\nTo express these feelings, it was considered the content of art had to come from the imagination of the artist, with as little interference as possible from \"artificial\" rules dictating what a work should consist of. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and others believed there were natural laws the imagination\u2014at least of a good creative artist\u2014would unconsciously follow through [[artistic inspiration]] if left alone.<ref>Day, 3</ref> As well as rules, the influence of models from other works was considered to impede the creator's own imagination, so that [[originality]] was essential. The concept of the [[genius]], or artist who was able to produce his own original work through this process of ''creation from nothingness'', is key to Romanticism, and to be derivative was the worst sin.<ref name=\"Ruthven01p40\">Ruthven (2001) p. 40 quote: \"Romantic ideology of literary authorship, which conceives of the text as an autonomous object produced by an individual genius.\"</ref><ref name=\"Spearing87\">Spearing (1987) quote: \"Surprising as it may seem to us, living after the Romantic movement has transformed older ideas about literature, in the Middle Ages authority was prized more highly than originality.\"</ref><ref name=\"Eco94\">Eco (1994) p. 95 quote:\nMuch art has been and is repetitive.

This particularly in the effect of nature upon the artist when he is surrounded by it, preferably alone. In contrast to the usually very social art of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romantics were distrustful of the human world, and tended to believe a close connection with nature was mentally and morally healthy. Romantic art addressed its audiences with what was intended to be felt as the personal voice of the artist. So, in literature, \"much of romantic poetry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves\".<ref>Day 3\u20134; quotation from M.H. Abrams, quoted in Day, 4</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Isaiah Berlin]], Romanticism embodied \"a new and restless spirit, seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms, a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness, a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual movement and change, an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life, a passionate effort at self-assertion both individual and collective, a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals\".<ref>Berlin, 92</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe group of words with the root \"Roman\" in the various European languages, such as \"romance\" and \"Romanesque\", has a complicated history, but by the middle of the 18th century \"romantic\" in English and ''romantique'' in French were both in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets, in a sense close to modern English usage but without the amorous connotation. The application of the term to literature first became common in Germany, where the circle around the Schlegel brothers, critics [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]], began to speak of ''romantische Poesie'' (\"romantic poetry\") in the 1790s, contrasting it with \"classic\" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating.  Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his ''Dialogue on Poetry'' (1800), \"I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived.\"<ref>Ferber, 6\u20137</ref>\n\nIn both French and German the closeness of the adjective to ''roman'', meaning the fairly new literary form of the [[novel]], had some effect on the sense of the word in those languages.  The use of the word, invented by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], did not become general very quickly, and was probably spread more widely in France by its persistent use by [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] in her ''[[De l'Allemagne]]'' (1813), recounting her travels in Germany.<ref name=\"Ferber, 7\">Ferber, 7</ref>  In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the \"romantic harp\" and \"classic lyre\",<ref name=\"Ferber, 7\"/> but in 1820 [[Lord Byron|Byron]] could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously, \"I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago\".<ref>Christiansen, 241.</ref>  It is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.<ref>Christiansen, 242.</ref>\n\n===Period===\nThe period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. [[Margaret Drabble]] described it in literature as taking place \"roughly between 1770 and 1848\",<ref>in her ''Oxford Companion'' article, quoted by Day, 1</ref> and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, [[M. H. Abrams]] placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics.<ref>Day, 1\u20135</ref> Others have proposed 1780\u20131830.<ref>{{Cite book|title = British Literature 1780\u20131830|last = Mellor|first = Anne|publisher = Harcourt Brace & Co./Wadsworth|year = 1996|isbn = 978-1-4130-2253-7|location = NY|pages = |last2 = Matlak|first2 = Richard}}</ref> In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; [[Romantic music|musical Romanticism]], for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of [[Richard Strauss]] are described stylistically as \"Late Romantic\" and were composed in 1946\u201348.<ref>Edward F.

These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Greenblatt et al., ''Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, \"The Romantic Period \u2013 Volume D\" (New York: W.W.

The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.<ref>Barzun, 469</ref>\n\n===Context and place in history===\nThe more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of [[intellectual history]] and [[literary history]] throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging. That it was part of the [[Counter-Enlightenment]], a reaction against the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is generally accepted in current scholarship. Its relationship to the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions. Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views,<ref>Day, 1\u20133; the arch-conservative and Romantic is [[Joseph de Maistre]], but many Romantics swung from youthful radicalism to conservative views in middle age, for example Wordsworth. [[Samuel Palmer]]'s only published text was a short piece opposing the [[Repeal of the corn laws]].</ref> and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.\n\nIn philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading \"to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth\",<ref>Berlin, 57</ref> and hence not only to nationalism, but also [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]], with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II.<ref>Several of Berlin's pieces dealing with this theme are collected in the work referenced. See in particular: Berlin, 34\u201347, 57\u201359, 183\u2013206, 207\u201337.</ref> For the Romantics, Berlin says, <blockquote>in the realm of ethics, politics, aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered; this applied equally to individuals and groups\u2014states, nations, movements. This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism, where the notion of eternal models, a Platonic vision of ideal beauty, which the artist seeks to convey, however imperfectly, on canvas or in sound, is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom, individual creativity. The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some \"external\" voice\u2014church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste\u2014is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.<ref>Berlin, 57\u201358</ref><!-- yes, 2 semi-colons & about 15 commas in the quote --></blockquote>\n[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[John William Waterhouse]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'', 1888, after a poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]; like many [[Victorian painting]]s, romantic but not Romantic.]]\n\n[[Arthur Lovejoy]] attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article \"On The Discrimination of Romanticisms\" in his ''Essays in the [[History of ideas|History of Ideas]]'' (1948); some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present, some like [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] see in it the inaugural moment of [[modernity]],<ref>[http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp Linda Simon ''The Sleep of Reason'' by Robert Hughes]</ref> and some like [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Novalis]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge see it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism\u2014a \"Counter-Enlightenment\"\u2014<ref>''[[Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder]]'', Pimlico, 2000 {{ISBN|0-7126-6492-0}} was one of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and organic,</ref><ref>[[Darrin McMahon|Darrin M.

An earlier definition comes from [[Charles Baudelaire]]: \"Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth, but in the way of feeling.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Salon_de_1846_%28Curiosit%C3%A9s_esth%C3%A9tiques%29#II._.E2.80.94_Qu.E2.80.99est-ce_que_le_romantisme.3F |title=Baudelaire's speech at the \"Salon des curiosit\u00e9s Estethiques |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], which affected literature, especially the novel and drama, painting, and even music, through [[Verismo]] opera. This movement was led by France, with [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]] and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] in literature and [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] in painting; [[Stendhal]] and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] were important precursors of Realism in their respective media. However, Romantic styles, now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled, continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond. In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as \"Late Romantic\" and by others as \"Neoromantic\" or \"Postromantic\", but other fields do not usually use these terms; in English literature and painting the convenient term \"Victorian\" avoids having to characterise the period further.\n\nIn northern Europe, the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished, and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was. Elsewhere, including in very different ways the United States and Russia, feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible. Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent, as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics, but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced, often replaced with meticulous technique, as in the poems of Tennyson or many paintings. If not realist, late 19th-century art was often extremely detailed, and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with. Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art, above all the pre-eminent importance of originality, remained important for later generations, and often underlie modern views, despite opposition from theorists.\n\n==Literature==\n{{See also|Romantic poetry}}\n[[File:Chatterton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Wallis]], ''[[The Death of Chatterton]]'' 1856, by suicide at 17 in 1770]]\n\nIn literature, Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past, the cult of \"[[sensibility]]\" with its emphasis on women and children, the isolation of the artist or narrator, and respect for nature. Furthermore, several romantic authors, such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], based their writings on the [[supernatural]]/[[occult]] and human [[psychology]]. Romanticism tended to regard [[satire]] as something unworthy of serious attention, a prejudice still influential today.<ref>[[James Runcieman Sutherland|Sutherland, James]] (1958) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1 ''English Satire''] p. 1. There were a few exceptions, notably Byron, who integrated satire into some of his greatest works, yet shared much in common with his Romantic contemporaries. Bloom, p. 18.</ref> The Romantic movement in literature was preceded by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and succeeded by [[Literary realism|Realism]].\n\nSome authors cite 16th-century poet [[Isabella di Morra]] as an early precursor of Romantic literature. Her lyrics covering themes of isolation and loneliness, which reflected the tragic events of her life, are considered \"an impressive prefigurement of Romanticism\",<ref>Paul F. Grendler, [[Renaissance Society of America]], ''Encyclopedia of the Renaissance'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]], 1999, p. 193</ref> differing from the [[Petrarch]]ist fashion of the time based on the [[philosophy of love]].\n\nThe precursors of Romanticism in English poetry go back to the middle of the 18th century, including figures such as [[Joseph Warton]] (headmaster at [[Winchester College]]) and his brother [[Thomas Warton]], [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at [[Oxford University]].<ref name=\"John Keats page 106\">John Keats. By Sidney Colvin, p. 106. Elibron Classics</ref> Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet. The Scottish poet [[James Macpherson]] influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his [[Ossian]] cycle of poems published in 1762, inspiring both [[Goethe]] and the young [[Walter Scott]]. [[Thomas Chatterton]] is generally considered the first Romantic poet in English.<ref name=\"Thomas Chatterton 1971, page 11\">Thomas Chatterton, Grevel Lindop, 1972, Fyffield Books, p. 11</ref> Both Chatterton and Macpherson's work involved elements of fraud, as what they claimed was earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was, in fact, entirely their own work. The [[Gothic novel]], beginning with [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764), was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism, with a delight in horror and threat, and exotic picturesque settings, matched in Walpole's case by his role in the early [[Gothic Revival|revival of Gothic architecture]]. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', a novel by [[Laurence Sterne]] (1759\u201367), introduced a whimsical version of the anti-rational [[sentimental novel]] to the English literary public.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Des Knaben Wunderhorn III (1808).jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume III of ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'', 1808]]\nAn early German influence came from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], whose 1774 novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist, a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament. At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states, and Goethe's works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of [[nationalism]]. Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], making [[Jena]] (where Fichte lived, as well as Schelling, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and the [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|brothers]] [[Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]]) a center for early [[German Romanticism]] (see [[Jena Romanticism]]). Important writers were [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Novalis]] (''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]'', 1799), [[Heinrich von Kleist]] and [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]. [[Heidelberg]] later became a center of German Romanticism, where writers and poets such as [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Achim von Arnim]], and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] (''[[Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts]]'') met regularly in literary circles.\n\nImportant motifs in German Romanticism are travelling, nature, for example the [[German Forest]], and [[Germanic mythology|Germanic myths]]. The later German Romanticism of, for example [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s ''[[Der Sandmann]]'' (''The Sandman''), 1817, and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]]'s ''Das Marmorbild'' (''The Marble Statue''), 1819, was darker in its motifs and has [[gothic novel|gothic]] elements.  The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to [[folk literature]], non-classical [[mythology]] and [[children's literature]], above all in Germany.  Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' (\"The Boy's Magic Horn\" or [[cornucopia]]), a collection of versified folk tales, in 1806\u201308.  The first collection of ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was published in 1812.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=1988 |title=The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World |edition=1st |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-90081-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/brothersgrimmfro0000zipe/page/7 7\u20138] |url=https://archive.org/details/brothersgrimmfro0000zipe/page/7 }}</ref> Unlike the much later work of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835, these German works were at least mainly based on collected [[Folklore|folk tales]], and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions, though later rewriting some parts.

The publication in 1798 of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement. The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native [[Lake District]], or his feelings about nature\u2014which he more fully developed in his long poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', never published in his lifetime. The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the [[Lake Poets]] were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer [[William Hazlitt]] and others.\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]], ''[[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]]'' in Rome, 1808]]\n\nIn contrast, [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]] achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings; Goethe called Byron \"undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century\".<ref>Christiansen, 215.</ref> Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' in 1805, followed by the full [[epic poem]] ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past, already evoked in ''Ossian''; [[Romanticism in Scotland|Romanticism and Scotland]] were to have a long and fruitful partnership. Byron had equal success with the first part of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' in 1812, followed by four \"Turkish tales\", all in the form of long poems, starting with ''[[The Giaour]]'' in 1813, drawing from his [[Grand Tour]], which had reached Ottoman Europe, and [[Orientalism|orientalizing]] the themes of the Gothic novel in verse. These featured different variations of the \"[[Byronic hero]]\", and his own life contributed a further version. Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the [[historical novel]], beginning in 1814 with ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', set in the [[1745 Jacobite rising]], which was an enormous and highly profitable success, followed by over 20 further [[Waverley Novels]] over the next 17 years, with settings going back to the [[Crusades]] that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature.<ref>Christiansen, 192\u201396.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on [[Lake Geneva]] with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by Shelley's wife-to-be [[Mary Shelley]] and the [[novella]] ''[[The Vampyre]]'' by Byron's doctor [[John William Polidori]]. The lyrics of [[Robert Burns]] in Scotland, and [[Thomas Moore]] from Ireland, reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature, but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work.\n\nThough they have modern critical champions such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]], Scott's novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that composers continued to base on them over the following decades, such as [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[I puritani]]'' (both 1835). Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings, especially his letters, and his unfinished [[satire]] ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]''.<ref>Christiansen, 197\u2013200.</ref> Unlike many Romantics, Byron's widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work, and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the [[Greek War of Independence]] appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end, entrenching his legend.<ref>Christiansen, 213\u201320.</ref> Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy, Blake (at almost 70) in 1827, and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s. Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded, holding a government [[sinecure]], but wrote relatively little. In the discussion of English literature, the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s, or sometimes even earlier, although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values.\n\nThe most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period, other than Walter Scott, was [[Jane Austen]], whose essentially conservative world-view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries, retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules, though critics such as [[Claudia L. Johnson]] have detected tremors under the surface of many works, such as ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1817),''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1817).<ref>Christiansen, 188\u201389.</ref> But around the mid-century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the [[Yorkshire]]-based [[Bront\u00eb family]] appeared. Most notably [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', both published in 1847, which also introduced more Gothic themes. While these two novels were written and published after the Romantic period is said to have ended, their novels were heavily influenced by Romantic literature they'd read as children.\n\nByron, Keats and Shelley all wrote for the stage, but with little success in England, with Shelley's ''[[The Cenci]]'' perhaps the best work produced, though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death. Byron's plays, along with dramatizations of his poems and Scott's novels, were much more popular on the Continent, and especially in France, and through these versions several were turned into operas, many still performed today. If contemporary poets had little success on the stage, the period was a legendary one for performances of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan \"improvements\" to them. The greatest actor of the period, [[Edmund Kean]], restored the tragic ending to ''[[King Lear]]'';<ref>Or at least he tried to; Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, and with regret, he reverted to [[Nahum Tate]]'s version with a comic ending, which had been standard since 1689.

[[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686\u20131758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].<ref>J.

Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard [[Ossian]], he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>J.

Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\" is often sung at [[Hogmanay]] (the last day of the year), and \"[[Scots Wha Hae]]\" served for a long time as an unofficial [[national anthem]] of the country.<ref>L.

Towards the end of the century there were \"[[closet drama]]s\", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and [[Joanna Baillie]] (1762\u20131851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] Romanticism.<ref name=Brown2007pp229-30>I.

The 18th-century precursor to Romanticism, the cult of sensibility, had become associated with the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first-hand. The first major figure was [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand]], a minor aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential [[novella]] of exile ''[[Ren\u00e9 (novella)|Ren\u00e9]]'' (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (''[[The Genius of Christianity|G\u00e9nie du christianisme]]'', 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous [[autobiography]] ''[[M\u00e9moires d'Outre-Tombe]]'' (\"Memoirs from beyond the grave\").<ref>Christiansen, 202\u201303, 241\u201342.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Jacques Grandville - Frenzied Romans at the First Performance of Hernani - WGA10359.jpg|thumb|The \"battle of ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''\" was fought nightly at the theatre in 1830]]\n\nAfter the [[Bourbon Restoration]], French Romanticism developed in the lively world of [[Theatre of France#19th century|Parisian theatre]], with productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Schiller (in France a key Romantic author), and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors, several of whom began to write in the late 1820s. Cliques of pro- and anti-Romantics developed, and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides, including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that \"Shakespeare, c'est l'aide-de-camp de Wellington\" (\"Shakespeare is [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]]\").<ref>Christiansen, 239\u201346, 240 quoted.</ref> [[Alexandre Dumas]] began as a dramatist, with a series of successes beginning with ''Henri III et sa cour'' (1829) before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott, most famously ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', both of 1844. [[Victor Hugo]] published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''\u2014a historical drama in a quasi-Shakespearian style that had famously riotous performances on its first run in 1830.<ref>Christiansen, 244\u201346.</ref> Like Dumas, Hugo is best known for his novels, and was already writing ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831), one of the best known works, which became a paradigm of the French Romantic movement. The preface to his unperformed play ''Cromwell'' gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism, stating that \"there are no rules, or models\". The career of [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] followed a similar pattern; he is now best known as the originator of the story of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', with his novella published 1845. Alfred de Vigny remains best known as a dramatist, with his play on the life of the English poet ''Chatterton'' (1835) perhaps his best work. [[George Sand]] was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene, famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] and several others;<ref>Christiansen</ref> she too was inspired by the theatre, and wrote works to be staged at her [[House of George Sand|private estate]].\n\nFrench Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include [[Alfred de Musset]], [[G\u00e9rard de Nerval]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and the flamboyant [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872.\n\n[[Stendhal]] is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period, but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism, and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism, qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction. As a survivor of the French [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|retreat from Moscow]] in 1812, fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him, and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism. His most important works are ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', 1830) and ''La Chartreuse de Parme'' (''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', 1839).\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:Adam Mickiewicz.PNG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Portrait of Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag Cliff|''Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag'']], by [[Walenty Wa\u0144kowicz]], 1828]]\n{{Main|Romanticism in Poland}}\n[[Romanticism in Poland]] is often taken to begin with the publication of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s first poems in 1822, and end with the crushing of the [[January Uprising]] of 1863 against the Russians. It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history.<ref>Leon Dyczewski, ''Values in the Polish cultural tradition'' (2002) p. 183</ref> Polish Romanticism revived the old \"Sarmatism\" traditions of the ''[[szlachta]]'' or Polish nobility. Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz (''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''), [[Juliusz S\u0142owacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski]], as well as prose writers such as [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] period, differentiating it from that of other countries. They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland.<ref>Christopher J. Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760\u20131850'' (2004) vol. 2. p. 742</ref> Influenced by the general spirit and main ideas of European Romanticism, the literature of Polish Romanticism is unique, as many scholars have pointed out, in having developed largely outside of Poland and in its emphatic focus upon the issue of Polish [[nationalism]]. The Polish intelligentsia, along with leading members of its government, left Poland in the early 1830s, during what is referred to as the \"[[Great Emigration]]\", resettling in France, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States.\n\n[[File:Juliusz S\u0142owacki 1.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Juliusz S\u0142owacki]], a Polish poet considered one of the [[Three Bards|\"Three National Bards\" of Polish literature]]\u2014a major figure in the Polish Romantic period, and the father of modern Polish drama.]]\n\nTheir art featured [[wikt:emotionalism|emotionalism]] and [[Irrationalism and Aestheticism|irrationality]], fantasy and imagination, personality cults, [[folklore]] and country life, and the propagation of ideals of freedom. In the second period, many of the [[Polish Romantics]] worked abroad, often banished from Poland by the occupying powers due to their politically subversive ideas. Their work became increasingly dominated by the ideals of political struggle for freedom and their country's [[sovereignty]]. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. There developed the idea of the ''[[Three Bards|poeta wieszcz]]'' (the prophet). The ''[[wieszcz]]'' (bard) functioned as spiritual leader to the nation fighting for its independence. The most notable poet so recognized was [[Adam Mickiewicz]].\n\n[[Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski]] also wrote to inspire political and religious hope in his countrymen. Unlike his predecessors, who called for victory at whatever price in Poland's struggle against Russia, Krasinski emphasized Poland's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] role in its fight for independence, advocating an intellectual rather than a military superiority. His works best exemplify the [[Messianism|Messianic movement in Poland]]: in two early dramas, ''Nie-boska komedia''<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Nie-Boska komedia|url = https://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nie-Boska_komedia&oldid=41481531|language = pl}}</ref> (1835; ''The Undivine Comedy'') and ''[[Irydion]]'' (1836; ''Iridion''), as well as in the later ''Psalmy przysz\u0142o\u015bci'' (1845), he asserted that Poland was the [[Christ of Europe]]: specifically chosen by God to carry the world's burdens, to suffer, and eventually be resurrected.\n\n=== Russia ===\nEarly Russian Romanticism is associated with the writers [[Konstantin Batyushkov]] (''A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe'', 1809), [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] (''The Bard'', 1811; ''Svetlana'', 1813) and [[Nikolay Karamzin]] (''Poor Liza'', 1792; ''Julia'', 1796; ''Martha the Mayoress'', 1802; ''The Sensitive and the Cold'', 1803). However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is [[Alexander Pushkin]] (''[[The Prisoner of the Caucasus (poem)|The Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', 1820\u20131821; ''The Robber Brothers'', 1822; ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', 1820; ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', 1825\u20131832). Pushkin's work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia's greatest poet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/dostoevsky/texts/devil_pushkinbio.html|title=Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799\u20131837) |publisher=University of Virginia Slavic Department|accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref> Other Russian Romantic poets include [[Mikhail Lermontov]] (''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'', 1839), [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] (''Silentium!'', 1830), [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] (''Eda'', 1826), [[Anton Delvig]], and [[Wilhelm K\u00fcchelbecker]].\n\nInfluenced heavily by Lord Byron, Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self, while Tyutchev's poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love. Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Baratynsky's style was fairly classical in nature, dwelling on the models of the previous century.\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Romanticism in Spanish literature}}\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[El escritor Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]]'', [[portrait]] by [[Antonio Mar\u00eda Esquivel]] ({{circa|1845}}) ([[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]])<ref>{{cite web |title=El escritor Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/obra-de-arte/jose-de-espronceda/e97beaab-f0a3-4f73-8302-1c8185110410 |access-date=March 27, 2013 |website=[[Museo del Prado]] |location=Madrid |language=es}}</ref>]]\n[[Romanticism in Spanish literature]] developed a well-known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights. The most important Spanish poet during this movement was [[Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]]. After him there were other poets like [[Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer]], [[Mariano Jos\u00e9 de Larra]] and the dramatists [[\u00c1ngel de Saavedra]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]], author of ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''. Before them may be mentioned the pre-romantics [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] and [[Manuel Jos\u00e9 Quintana]].<ref>Philip W. Silver, ''Ruin and restitution: reinterpreting romanticism in Spain'' (1997) p. 13</ref>  The plays of [[Antonio Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez]] were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi's operas ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures. For example, in [[Catalonia]] and in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] there was a national boom of writers in the local languages, like the Catalan [[Jacint Verdaguer]] and the Galician [[Rosal\u00eda de Castro]], the main figures of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revivalist]] movements [[Renaixen\u00e7a]] and [[Rexurdimento]], respectively.<ref>Gerald Brenan, ''The literature of the Spanish people: from Roman times to the present'' (1965) p. 364</ref>\n\nThere are scholars who consider Spanish Romanticism to be Proto-Existentialism because it is more anguished than the movement in other European countries. Foster et al., for example, say that the work of Spain's writers such as Espronceda, Larra, and other writers in the 19th century demonstrated a \"metaphysical crisis\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spanish Literature : Current debates on Hispanism|last=Foster|first=David|last2=Altamiranda|first2=Daniel|last3=de Urioste|first3=Carmen|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8153-3563-4|location=New York|page=78}}</ref> These observers put more weight on the link between the 19th-century Spanish writers with the existentialist movement that emerged immediately after.

Alexandre, bishop of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]], in the precepts of [[Neoclassicism]], which can be observed in his early work. The author himself confesses (in ''Cam\u00f5es''{{'}} preface) that he voluntarily refused to follow the principles of epic poetry enunciated by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], as he did the same to [[Horace]]'s [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|''Ars Poetica'']]. Almeida Garrett had participated in the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|1820 Liberal Revolution]], which caused him to exile himself in England in 1823 and then in France, after the [[Vilafrancada|Vila-Francada]]. While living in Great Britain, he had contacts with the Romantic movement and read authors such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Scott, Ossian, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine and de Sta\u00ebl, at the same time visiting feudal castles and ruins of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches and abbeys, which would be reflected in his writings. In 1838, he presented ''Um Auto de Gil Vicente'' (\"A Play by [[Gil Vicente]]\"), in an attempt to create a new national theatre, free of Greco-Roman and foreign influence. But his masterpiece would be ''Frei Lu\u00eds de Sousa'' (1843), named by himself as a \"Romantic drama\" and it was acclaimed as an exceptional work, dealing with themes as national independence, faith, justice and love. He was also deeply interested in Portuguese folkloric verse, which resulted in the publication of ''Romanceiro'' (\"Traditional Portuguese Ballads\") (1843), that recollect a great number of ancient popular ballads, known as \"romances\" or \"rimances\", in ''redondilha maior'' verse form, that contained stories of [[chivalry]], life of [[saint]]s, [[crusades]], [[courtly love]], etc. He wrote the novels ''Viagens na Minha Terra'', ''O Arco de Sant'Ana'' and ''Helena.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Obras Completas de Almeida Garrett \u2013 2 Volumes|last=Almeida Garrett|first=Jo\u00e3o Baptista|publisher=Lello Editores|year=1990|isbn=978-972-48-0192-6|location=Porto|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$almeida-garrett|title=Artigo de apoio Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Almeida Garrett|last=Infop\u00e9dia|website=Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Dicion\u00e1rios Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref><ref name=\"Jos\u00e9\">{{Cite book|title=Hist\u00f3ria da literatura portuguesa|last=Jos\u00e9.|first=Saraiva, Ant\u00f3nio|date=1996|publisher=Porto Editora|others=Lopes, Oscar|isbn=978-972-0-30170-3|edition= 17a|location=[Porto, Portugal]|oclc=35124986}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexandre Herculano]] is, alongside Almeida Garrett, one of the founders of Portuguese Romanticism.

He sought inspiration in medieval Portuguese poems and [[chronicle]]s as in the [[Bible]]. His output is vast and covers many different genres, such as historical essays, poetry, novels, opuscules and theatre, where he brings back a whole world of Portuguese legends, tradition and history, especially in ''Eurico, o Presb\u00edtero'' (\"Eurico, the Priest\") and ''Lendas e Narrativas'' (\"Legends and Narratives\").

He became an unquestionable master for successive Ultra-Romantic generations, whose influence would not be challenged until the famous Coimbra Question. He also created polemics by translating [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' without knowing German, but using French versions of the play. Other notable figures of Portuguese Romanticism are the famous novelists [[Camilo Castelo Branco]] and [[J\u00falio Dinis]], and [[Ant\u00f3nio Augusto Soares de Passos|Soares de Passos]], Bulh\u00e3o Pato and Pinheiro Chagas.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9\"/>\n\nRomantic style would be revived in the beginning of the 20th century, notably through the works of poets linked to the [[Portuguese Renaissance]], such as [[Teixeira de Pascoaes|Teixeira de Pascoais]], [[Jaime Cortes\u00e3o]], M\u00e1rio Beir\u00e3o, among others, who can be considered Neo-Romantics. An early Portuguese expression of Romanticism is found already in poets such as [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]] (especially in his sonnets dated at the end of the 18th century) and [[Leonor de Almeida Portugal, 4th Marquise of Alorna|Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna]].<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9\"/>\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Isabella di Morra.jpg|thumb|Italian poet [[Isabella di Morra]], sometimes cited as a precursor of Romantic poets<ref>Gaetana Marrone, Paolo Puppa, ''Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies: A\u2013J'', [[Taylor & Francis]], 2007, p. 1242</ref>]]\nRomanticism in Italian literature was a minor movement although some important works were produced; it began officially in 1816 when [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] wrote an article in the journal ''Biblioteca italiana'' called \"Sulla maniera e l'utilit\u00e0 delle traduzioni\", inviting Italian people to reject [[Neoclassicism]] and to study new authors from other countries.

His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], and filled with themes of blood and terror, using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas' dictatorship.\n\nBrazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods. The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity, using the ideal of the heroic Indian. Some examples include [[Jos\u00e9 de Alencar]], who wrote ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', and [[Gon\u00e7alves Dias]], renowned by the poem \"[[Can\u00e7\u00e3o do ex\u00edlio]]\" (Song of the Exile). The second period, sometimes called [[Ultra-Romanticism]], is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love. Goethe and Lord Byron are commonly quoted in these works. Some of the most notable authors of this phase are [[\u00c1lvares de Azevedo]], [[Casimiro de Abreu]], [[Fagundes Varela]] and [[Junqueira Freire]]. The third cycle is marked by social poetry, especially the abolitionist movement, and it includes [[Castro Alves]], [[Tobias Barreto]] and [[Pedro Lu\u00eds Pereira de Sousa]].<ref>Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda and Enrique Pupo-Walker, ''The Cambridge History of Latin American Literature: Brazilian Literature'' (1996) vol. 2 p. 367</ref>\n[[File:Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dennis Malone Carter]], ''Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat'', 1878.

American Romantic [[Gothic literature]] made an early appearance with [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820) and ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1819), followed from 1823 onwards by the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'' of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already-exotic mythicized frontier peopled by \"[[noble savage]]s\", similar to the philosophical theory of [[Rousseau]], exemplified by [[Uncas]], from ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. There are picturesque \"local color\" elements in Washington Irving's essays and especially his travel books. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home, but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and [[melodrama]] of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850). Later [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] writers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] still show elements of its influence and imagination, as does the [[romantic realism]] of [[Walt Whitman]]. The poetry of [[Emily Dickinson]]\u2014nearly unread in her own time\u2014and [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature. By the 1880s, however, psychological and [[social realism]] were competing with Romanticism in the novel.\n\n====Influence of European Romanticism on American writers====\nThe European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century. American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe. Like the Europeans, the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm, commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self, an emphasis on intuitive perception, and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good, while human society was filled with corruption.<ref name=\"George L 1997 p 613\">George L. McMichael and Frederick C. Crews, eds. ''Anthology of American Literature: Colonial through romantic'' (6th ed. 1997) p. 613</ref>\n\nRomanticism became popular in American politics, philosophy and art. The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement. The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect. It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism, which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained. The Romantic movement gave rise to [[New England]] [[Transcendentalism]], which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe. The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God. Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion, for both privileged feeling over reason, individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. It often involved a rapturous response to nature. It encouraged the rejection of harsh, rigid Calvinism, and promised a new blossoming of American culture.<ref name=\"George L 1997 p 613\"/><ref>\"Romanticism, American\", in ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'' ed by Ann Lee Morgan (Oxford University Press, 2007) [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t238.e1140 online]</ref>\n\nAmerican Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition. The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers. Novels, short stories, and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore. Romantic literature was personal, intense, and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature. America's preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy. They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters, and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement.<ref>The relationship of the American poet Wallace Stevens to Romanticism is raised in the poem \"[[Another Weeping Woman]]\" and its commentary.</ref>\n\nThe works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{See also|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nRomantic architecture appeared in the late 18th century in a reaction against the rigid forms of [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architecture. reached its peak in the mid-19th century, and continued to appear until the end of the 19th century. It was designed to evoke an emotional reaction, either respect for tradition or nostalgia for a bucolic past. It was frequently inspired by the architecture of the [[Middle Ages]], especially [[Gothic architecture]], It was strongly influenced by romanticism in literature, particularly the historical novels of [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Walter Scott]]. It sometimes moved into the domain of [[eclecticism]], with features assembled from different historic periods and regions of the world.<ref>Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), p. 63</ref>\n\n[[Gothic Revival architecture]] was a popular variant of the romantic style, particularly in the construction of churches, Cathedrals, and university buildings. Notable examples include the completion of [[Cologne Cathedral]] in Germany, by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. The cathedral had been begun in 1248, but work was halted in 1473. The original plans for the fa\u00e7ade were discovered in 1840, and it was decided to recommence. Schinkel followed the original design as much as possible, but used modern construction technology, including an iron frame for the roof. The building was finished in 1880.<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), pp. 64</ref>\n\nIn Britain, notable examples include the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]], a romantic version of traditional [[Indian architecture]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] (1815\u20131823), and the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, built in a Gothic revival style by [[Charles Barry]] between 1840 and 1876.<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64-65\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), pp. 64-65</ref>\n\nIn France, one of the earliest examples of romantic architecture is the [[Hameau de la Reine]], the small rustic hamlet created at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] between 1783 and 1785 by the royal architect [[Richard Mique]] with the help of the romantic painter [[Hubert Robert]]. It consisted of twelve structures, ten of which still exist, in the style of villages in [[Normandy]]. It was designed for the Queen and her friends to amuse themselves by playing at being peasants, and included a farmhouse with a dairy, a mill, a boudoir, a pigeon loft, a tower in the form of a lighthouse from which one could fish in the pond, a belvedere, a cascade and grotto, and a luxuriously furnished cottage with a billiard room for the Queen.{{Sfn|Saule|2014|page=92}}\n\nFrench romantic architecture in the 19th century was strongly influenced by two writers; [[Victor Hugo]], whose novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' inspired a resurgence in interest in the Middle Ages; and [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]], who wrote celebrated romantic novels and short stories and was also the first head of the commission of Historic Monuments in France, responsible for publicizing and restoring (and sometimes romanticizing) many French cathedrals and monuments desecrated and ruined after the [[French Revolution]]. His projects were carried out by the architect [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. These included the restoration (sometimes creative) of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], the fortified city of [[Carcassonne]], and the unfinished medieval [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]].<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64\"/><ref>Poisson, Georges; ''Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc'' (in French) (2014)</ref>\n\nThe romantic style continued in the second half of the 19th century. The [[Palais Garnier]], the Paris opera house designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] was a highly romantic and eclectic combination of artistic styles.  Another notable example of late 19th century romanticism is the [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] by [[Paul Abadie]], who drew upon the model of [[Byzantine architecture]] for his elongated domes (1875\u20131914).<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64-65\"/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"125\">\nFile:Marie Antoinette amusement at Versailles.JPG|[[Hameau de la Reine]], [[Palace of Versailles]] (1783\u20131785)\nFile:Brighton royal pavilion Qmin.jpg|[[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] (1815\u20131823)\nFile:Cologne cathedrale vue sud.jpg|[[Cologne Cathedral]] (1840\u201380)\nFile:Monumental stairway of the palais Garnier opera in Paris.jpg|Grand Staircase of the [[Paris Opera]] by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] (1861\u201375)\nFile:Le sacre coeur.jpg|[[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] by [[Paul Abadie]] (1875\u20131914)\n</gallery>\n\n==Visual arts==\n[[File:The Bard (1774).jpeg|thumb|[[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]], ''The Bard'', 1774, a prophetic combination of Romanticism and nationalism by the Welsh artist]]\n\nIn the visual arts, Romanticism first showed itself in [[landscape painting]], where from as early as the 1760s British artists began to turn to wilder landscapes and storms, and [[Gothic architecture]], even if they had to make do with [[Welsh art|Wales as a setting]]. [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] were born less than a year apart in 1774 and 1775 respectively and were to take German and English landscape painting to their extremes of Romanticism, but both their artistic sensibilities were formed when forms of Romanticism was already strongly present in art. [[John Constable]], born in 1776, stayed closer to the English landscape tradition, but in his largest \"six-footers\" insisted on the heroic status of a patch of the working countryside where he had grown up\u2014challenging the traditional [[hierarchy of genres]], which relegated landscape painting to a low status. Turner also painted very large landscapes, and above all, seascapes. Some of these large paintings had contemporary settings and [[staffage]], but others had small figures that turned the work into [[history painting]] in the manner of [[Claude Lorrain]], like [[Salvator Rosa]], a [[Rococo|late Baroque]] artist whose landscapes had elements that Romantic painters repeatedly turned to. Friedrich often used single figures, or features like crosses, set alone amidst a huge landscape, \"making them images of the transitoriness of human life and the premonition of death\".<ref>Novotny, 96\u2013101, 99 quoted</ref>\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', 1800\u201302]]\n\nOther groups of artists expressed feelings that verged on the mystical, many largely abandoning classical drawing and proportions.  These included [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]] and the other members of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] in England, and in Germany [[Philipp Otto Runge]]. Like Friedrich, none of these artists had significant influence after their deaths for the rest of the 19th century, and were 20th-century rediscoveries from obscurity, though Blake was always known as a poet, and Norway's leading painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]] was heavily influenced by Friedrich. The Rome-based [[Nazarene movement]] of German artists, active from 1810, took a very different path, concentrating on medievalizing history paintings with religious and nationalist themes.<ref>Novotny, 112\u201321</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of [[Neoclassicism]] on the academies, but from the [[Napoleonic]] period it became increasingly popular, initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime, of which [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]]'s ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', for Napoleon's [[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], was one of the earliest. Girodet's old teacher [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil's direction, saying: \"Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting\".<ref>Honour, 184\u2013190, 187 quoted</ref> A new generation of the French school,<ref>Walter Friedlaender, ''From David to Delacroix'', 1974, remains the best available account of the subject.</ref> developed personal Romantic styles, though still concentrating on history painting with a political message. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] (1791\u20131824) had his first success with ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'', a heroic military figure derived from [[Rubens]], at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1812 in the years of the Empire, but his next major completed work, ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' of 1821, remains the greatest achievement of the Romantic history painting, which in its day had a powerful anti-government message.\n\n[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] (1798\u20131863) made his first Salon hits with ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822), ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827). The second was a scene from the Greek War of Independence, completed the year Byron died there, and the last was a scene from one of Byron's plays. With Shakespeare, Byron was to provide the subject matter for many other works of Delacroix, who also spent long periods in North Africa, painting colourful scenes of mounted Arab warriors. His ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830) remains, with the ''Medusa'', one of the best-known works of French Romantic painting. Both reflected current events, and increasingly \"[[history painting]]\", literally \"story painting\", a phrase dating back to the Italian Renaissance meaning the painting of subjects with groups of figures, long considered the highest and most difficult form of art, did indeed become the painting of historical scenes, rather than those from religion or mythology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm|title=Romanticism|website=metmuseum.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Francisco Goya]] was called \"the last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity\".<ref>Novotny, 142</ref>  But the extent to which he was a Romantic is a complex question. In Spain, there was still a struggle to introduce the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in which Goya saw himself as a participant.  The demonic and anti-rational monsters thrown up by his imagination are only superficially similar to those of the Gothic fantasies of northern Europe, and in many ways he remained wedded to the classicism and realism of his training, as well as looking forward to the Realism of the later 19th century.<ref>Novotny, 133\u201342</ref> But he, more than any other artist of the period, exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist's feelings and his personal imaginative world.<ref>Hughes, 279\u201380</ref> He also shared with many of the Romantic painters a more free handling of paint, emphasized in the new prominence of the brushstroke and [[impasto]], which tended to be repressed in neoclassicism under a self-effacing finish.\n[[File:Cavalier gaulois pont d'iena RG am face.jpg|thumb|''Cavalier gaulois'' by [[Antoine-Augustin Pr\u00e9ault]], [[Pont d'I\u00e9na]], Paris]]\n\n[[Sculpture]] remained largely impervious to Romanticism, probably partly for technical reasons, as the most prestigious material of the day, marble, does not lend itself to expansive gestures. The leading sculptors in Europe, [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], were both based in Rome and firm Neoclassicists, not at all tempted to allow influence from medieval sculpture, which would have been one possible approach to Romantic sculpture. When it did develop, true Romantic sculpture\u2014with the exception of a few artists such as [[Rudolf Maison]]\u2014<ref>McKay, James, ''The Dictionary of Sculptors in Bronze'', Antique Collectors Club, London, 1995</ref> rather oddly was missing in Germany, and mainly found in France, with [[Fran\u00e7ois Rude]], best known from his group of the 1830s from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, [[David d'Angers]], and [[Auguste Pr\u00e9ault]]. Pr\u00e9ault's plaster relief entitled ''Slaughter'', which represented the horrors of wars with exacerbated passion, caused so much scandal at the 1834 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] that Pr\u00e9ault was banned from this official annual exhibition for nearly twenty years.<ref>Novotny, 397, 379\u201384</ref> In Italy, the most important Romantic sculptor was [[Lorenzo Bartolini]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dizionario di arte e letteratura|publisher=Zanichelli|location=Bologna|year=2002|page=544}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|[[Francisco Goya]], ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', 1814\nFile:JEAN LOUIS TH\u00c9ODORE G\u00c9RICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|[[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]], ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', 1819\nFile:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' 1830\nFile:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|[[J.

Delacroix, [[Ingres]] and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] all worked in this style, as did lesser specialists such as [[Pierre-Henri R\u00e9voil]] (1776\u20131842) and [[Fleury-Fran\u00e7ois Richard]] (1777\u20131852). Their pictures are often small, and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments, as well as those of high drama. The lives of great artists such as [[Raphael]] were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted. Fleury-Richard's ''Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband'', shown in the [[Paris Salon]] of 1802, marked the arrival of the style, which lasted until the mid-century, before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like [[Paul Delaroche]].<ref>Noon, throughout, especially pp. 124\u2013155</ref>\n\n[[File:Hayez, Fracesco - Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem - 1836-50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Francesco Hayez]], ''Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem'']]\n\nAnother trend was for very large apocalyptic history paintings, often combining extreme natural events, or divine wrath, with human disaster, attempting to outdo ''The Raft of the Medusa'', and now often drawing comparisons with effects from Hollywood. The leading English artist in the style was [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and worked his way through the biblical disasters, and those to come in the [[Christian eschatology|final days]]. Other works such as Delacroix's ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], with extra emotionalism and special effects.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, leading artists adopted Romantic styles: in Russia there were the portraitists [[Orest Kiprensky]] and [[Vasily Tropinin]], with [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] specializing in [[marine painting]], and in Norway [[Hans Gude]] painted scenes of [[fjord]]s. In Italy [[Francesco Hayez]] (1791\u20131882) was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid-19th-century [[Milan]]. His long, prolific and extremely successful career saw him begin as a Neoclassical painter, pass right through the Romantic period, and emerge at the other end as a sentimental painter of young women. His Romantic period included many historical pieces of \"Troubadour\" tendencies, but on a very large scale, that are heavily influenced by [[Gian Battista Tiepolo]] and other [[Rococo|late Baroque]] Italian masters.\n\nLiterary Romanticism had its counterpart in the American visual arts, most especially in the exaltation of an untamed American [[Landscape art|landscape]] found in the paintings of the [[Hudson River School]]. Painters like [[Thomas Cole]], [[Albert Bierstadt]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church]] and others often expressed Romantic themes in their paintings. They sometimes depicted ancient ruins of the old world, such as in Fredric Edwin Church's piece ''Sunrise in Syria''. These works reflected the Gothic feelings of death and decay. They also show the Romantic ideal that Nature is powerful and will eventually overcome the transient creations of men. More often, they worked to distinguish themselves from their European counterparts by depicting uniquely American scenes and landscapes. This idea of an American identity in the art world is reflected in [[William Cullen Bryant|W. C. Bryant]]'s poem ''To Cole, the Painter, Departing for Europe'', where Bryant encourages Cole to remember the powerful scenes that can only be found in America.\n\nSome American paintings (such as Albert Bierstadt's ''[[The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak]]'') promote the literary idea of the \"[[noble savage]]\" by portraying idealized Native Americans living in harmony with the natural world. Thomas Cole's paintings tend towards [[allegory]], explicit in ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series painted in the early 1840s, showing the stages of life set amidst an awesome and immense nature.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Thomas Cole - The Voyage of Life Childhood, 1842 (National Gallery of Art).jpg|[[Thomas Cole]], ''[[The Voyage of Life#Childhood|Childhood]]'', one of the four scenes in ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'', 1842\nFile:William Blake - Albion Rose - from A Large Book of Designs 1793-6.jpg|[[William Blake]], ''[[Albion (Blake)|Albion]] Rose'', 1794\u201395\nFile:Le poeme de lAme-14-Louis Janmot-MBA Lyon-IMG 0497.jpg|[[Louis Janmot]], from his series ''The Poem of the Soul'', before 1854\nFile:Thomas Cole - The Voyage of Life Old Age, 1842 (National Gallery of Art).jpg|Thomas Cole, 1842, ''The Voyage of Life<br />[[The Voyage of Life#Old Age|Old Age]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|Romantic music|Musical nationalism|List of Romantic-era composers}}\n[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]], painted by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]], 1820]]\nMusical Romanticism is predominantly a German phenomenon\u2014so much so that one respected French reference work defines it entirely in terms of \"The role of music in the aesthetics of German romanticism\".<ref>Boyer 1961, 585.</ref> Another French encyclopedia holds that the German temperament generally \"can be described as the deep and diverse action of romanticism on German musicians\", and that there is only one true representative of Romanticism in French music, [[Hector Berlioz]], while in Italy, the sole great name of musical Romanticism is [[Giuseppe Verdi]], \"a sort of [Victor] Hugo of opera, gifted with a real genius for dramatic effect\". Nevertheless, the huge popularity of German Romantic music led, \"whether by imitation or by reaction\", to an often nationalistically inspired vogue amongst Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Czech, and Scandinavian musicians, successful \"perhaps more because of its extra-musical traits than for the actual value of musical works by its masters\".<ref>Ferchault 1957.</ref>\n[[File:NiccoloPaganini.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], ''Portrait of [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'', 1819]]\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] in 1838 by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]]]\n\nAlthough the term \"Romanticism\" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of \"romantic\" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation.

In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, \"a child-like, serene disposition prevails\", while Mozart (in the late [[Symphony No. 39 (Mozart)|E-flat major Symphony]], for example) \"leads us into the depths of the spiritual world\", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, \"a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres\". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of \"the monstrous and immeasurable\", with the pain of an endless longing that \"will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions\".<ref>Hoffmann 1810, col. 632.</ref> This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder|Wackenroder]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and later by writers such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.<ref>Boyer 1961, 585\u201386.</ref>\n\nThis chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century, when [[Richard Wagner]] denigrated the music of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] as \"[[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]]\": \"The Opera, to which we shall now return, has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz, too, as a plump, fine-flavoured oyster, whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well-to-do appearance.\"<ref>Wagner 1995, 77.</ref>\n\nIt was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of ''Musikwissenschaft'' ([[musicology]])\u2014itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age\u2014attempted a more scientific [[periodization]] of music history, and a distinction between [[Classical period (music)|Viennese Classical]] and Romantic periods was proposed. The key figure in this trend was [[Guido Adler]], who viewed Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]] as transitional but essentially Classical composers, with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post-Beethoven generation of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn, [[Robert Schumann]], Hector Berlioz and [[Franz Liszt]]. From Adler's viewpoint, found in books like ''Der Stil in der Musik'' (1911), composers of the [[New German School]] and various late-19th-century [[Musical nationalism|nationalist]] composers were not Romantics but \"moderns\" or \"realists\" (by analogy with the fields of painting and literature), and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Samson 2001\"/>\n\nBy the second quarter of the 20th century, an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint, and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past. This in turn led historians such as [[Alfred Einstein]]<ref>Einstein 1947.</ref> to extend the musical \"[[Romantic music|Romantic era]]\" throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th. It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]''<ref>Warrack 2002.</ref> and [[Donald Jay Grout|Grout]]'s ''History of Western Music''<ref>Grout 1960, 492.</ref> but was not unchallenged. For example, the prominent German musicologist [[Friedrich Blume]], the chief editor of the first edition of ''[[Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'' (1949\u201386), accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century, but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century, including such pre-World War II developments as [[Expressionist music|expressionism]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]].<ref>Blume 1970; Samson 2001.</ref> This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''<ref name=\"Samson 2001\"/> and the new edition of ''[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]''.<ref>Wehnert 1998.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Mendelssohn Bartholdy.jpg|[[Felix Mendelssohn]], 1839\nFile:Robert Schumann 1839.jpg|[[Robert Schumann]], 1839\nFile:Barabas-liszt.jpg|[[Franz Liszt]], 1847\nFile:Postcard-1910 Daniel Fransois Auber.jpg|[[Daniel Auber]], c. 1868\nFile:Hector Berlioz.jpg|[[Hector Berlioz]], 1850\nFile:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|[[Giovanni Boldini]], ''Portrait of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'', 1886\nFile:Richardwagner1.jpg|[[Richard Wagner]], c. 1870s\nFile:Giacomo Meyerbeer nuorempana.jpg|[[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], 1847\n</gallery>\n\nIn the contemporary music culture, the romantic musician followed a public career depending on sensitive middle-class audiences rather than on a courtly patron, as had been the case with earlier musicians and composers.

Many scientists were influenced by versions of the ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and others, and without abandoning [[empiricism]], sought in their work to uncover what they tended to believe was a unified and organic Nature. The English scientist Sir [[Humphry Davy]], a prominent Romantic thinker, said that understanding nature required \"an attitude of admiration, love and worship, [...] a personal response\".<ref>Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 15.</ref> He believed that knowledge was only attainable by those who truly appreciated and respected nature. Self-understanding was an important aspect of Romanticism. It had less to do with proving that man was capable of understanding nature (through his budding intellect) and therefore controlling it, and more to do with the emotional appeal of connecting himself with nature and understanding it through a harmonious co-existence.<ref>Bossi, M., and Poggi, S., ed.

Romantic nationalism had a largely negative effect on the writing of history in the 19th century, as each nation tended to [[Historiography and nationalism|produce its own version of history]], and the critical attitude, even cynicism, of earlier historians was often replaced by a tendency to create romantic stories with clearly distinguished heroes and villains.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ceri Crossley|title=French Historians and Romanticism: Thierry, Guizot, the Saint-Simonians, Quinet, Michelet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovaIAgAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97668-3}}</ref>   Nationalist ideology of the period placed great emphasis on racial coherence, and the antiquity of peoples, and tended to vastly over-emphasize the continuity between past periods and the present, leading to [[national mysticism]].

Example of [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]].]]\n\nOne of Romanticism's key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of [[national language]]s and [[folklore]], and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning. One of the most important functions of medieval references in the 19th century was nationalist. Popular and epic poetry were its workhorses. This is visible in Germany and Ireland, where underlying Germanic or Celtic [[Stratum (linguistics)|linguistic substrates]] dating from before the Romanization-Latinization were sought out.\n\nEarly Romantic nationalism was strongly inspired by Rousseau, and by the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], who in 1784 argued that the geography formed the natural economy of a people, and shaped their customs and society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe nature of nationalism changed dramatically, however, after the [[French Revolution]] with the rise of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]], and the reactions in other nations. Napoleonic nationalism and republicanism were, at first, inspirational to movements in other nations: self-determination and a consciousness of national unity were held to be two of the reasons why France was able to defeat other countries in battle. But as the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] became [[First French Empire|Napoleon's Empire]], Napoleon became not the inspiration for nationalism, but the object of its struggle. In [[Prussia]], the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in [[Napoleonic Wars|the struggle against Napoleon]] was argued by, among others, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], a disciple of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The word ''[[Volkstum]]'', or nationality, was coined in German as part of this resistance to the now conquering emperor. Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his address \"To the German Nation\" in 1806:\n\n<blockquote>Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole. ...Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality\u2014then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be.<ref name=\"Fichte\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1806fichte.asp | title=Address to the German Nation | publisher=Fordham University | date=1806 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | author=Fichte, Johann}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis view of nationalism inspired the collection of [[folklore]] by such people as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the revival of old epics as national, and the construction of new epics as if they were old, as in the ''[[Kalevala]]'', compiled from Finnish tales and folklore, or ''[[Ossian]]'', where the claimed ancient roots were invented. The view that fairy tales, unless contaminated from outside literary sources, were preserved in the same form over thousands of years, was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists, but fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people. For instance, the Brothers Grimm rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by [[Charles Perrault]], which they thought proved they were not truly German tales;<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 31 {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref> ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' survived in their collection because the tale of [[Brunhild|Brynhildr]] convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German. [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] contributed to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation. He regarded the oral literature of the peasants as an integral part of Serbian culture, compiling it to use in his collections of folk songs, tales and proverbs, as well as the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian.<ref>{{cite book|title=Prilozi za knji\u017eevnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=\u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430, \u0425\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0430|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}</ref> Similar projects were undertaken by the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\n=== Polish nationalism and messianism ===\n[[File:Night november.jpg|thumb|The [[November Uprising]] (1830\u201331), in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], against the [[Russian Empire]]]]\n\nRomanticism played an essential role in the national awakening of many Central European peoples lacking their own national states, not least in Poland, which had recently failed to restore its independence when [[Imperial Russian Army|Russia's army]] crushed the [[November Uprising|Polish Uprising]] under [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Revival and reinterpretation of ancient myths, customs and traditions by Romantic poets and painters helped to distinguish their indigenous cultures from those of the dominant nations and crystallise the mythography of [[Romantic nationalism]]. Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. Arguably, the most distinguished Romantic poet of this part of Europe was [[Adam Mickiewicz]], who developed an idea that [[Christ of Europe|Poland was the Messiah of Nations]], predestined to suffer just as [[Jesus]] had suffered to save all the people. The Polish self-image as a \"[[Christ of Europe|Christ among nations]]\" or the martyr of Europe can be traced back to its history of [[Christendom]] and suffering under invasions. During the periods of foreign occupation, the Catholic Church served as bastion of Poland's national identity and language, and the major promoter of [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]]. The [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] came to be seen in Poland as a Polish sacrifice for the security for [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. Adam Mickiewicz wrote the patriotic drama ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (directed against the Russians), where he depicts Poland as the Christ of Nations. He also wrote \"Verily I say unto you, it is not for you to learn civilization from foreigners, but it is you who are to teach them civilization ... You are among the foreigners like the Apostles among the idolaters\". In ''Books of the Polish Nation and Polish Pilgrimage'' Mickiewicz detailed his vision of Poland as a Messias and a Christ of Nations, that would save mankind. Dziady is known for various interpretation. The most known ones are the moral aspect of part II, [[individualist]] and romantic message of part IV, as well as deeply patriotic, messianistic and Christian vision in part III of the poem. Zdzis\u0142aw K\u0119pi\u0144ski, however, focuses his interpretation on [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan]] and [[occult]] elements found in the drama. In his book ''Mickiewicz hermetyczny'' he writes about [[Hermeticism|hermetic]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophic]] and [[Alchemy|alchemical]] philosophy on the book as well as [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] symbols.\n\n==Gallery==\n;Emerging Romanticism in the 18th century\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Shipwrec-vernet.jpg|[[Joseph Vernet]], 1759, ''Shipwreck''; the 18th-century \"sublime\"\nFile:Joseph Wright 004.jpg|[[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], 1774, ''Cave at evening'', [[Smith College|Smith College Museum of Art]], [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]\nFile:John Henry Fuseli - The Nightmare.JPG|[[Henry Fuseli]], 1781, ''[[The Nightmare]]'', a classical artist whose themes often anticipate the Romantic\nFile:Philipp Jakob Loutherbourg d.

Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of \"heroic\" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism.<ref>\"'A remarkable thing,' continued Bazarov, 'these funny old Romantics!

The importance the Romantics placed on emotion is summed up in the remark of the German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]], \"the artist's feeling is his law\".<ref>Novotny, 96</ref> For [[William Wordsworth]], poetry should begin as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\", which the poet then \"recollect[s] in tranquility\", evoking a new but corresponding emotion the poet can then mold into art.<ref>From the Preface to the 2nd edition of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', quoted Day, 2</ref>\n\nTo express these feelings, it was considered the content of art had to come from the imagination of the artist, with as little interference as possible from \"artificial\" rules dictating what a work should consist of. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and others believed there were natural laws the imagination\u2014at least of a good creative artist\u2014would unconsciously follow through [[artistic inspiration]] if left alone.<ref>Day, 3</ref> As well as rules, the influence of models from other works was considered to impede the creator's own imagination, so that [[originality]] was essential. The concept of the [[genius]], or artist who was able to produce his own original work through this process of ''creation from nothingness'', is key to Romanticism, and to be derivative was the worst sin.<ref name=\"Ruthven01p40\">Ruthven (2001) p. 40 quote: \"Romantic ideology of literary authorship, which conceives of the text as an autonomous object produced by an individual genius.\"</ref><ref name=\"Spearing87\">Spearing (1987) quote: \"Surprising as it may seem to us, living after the Romantic movement has transformed older ideas about literature, in the Middle Ages authority was prized more highly than originality.\"</ref><ref name=\"Eco94\">Eco (1994) p. 95 quote:\nMuch art has been and is repetitive.

This particularly in the effect of nature upon the artist when he is surrounded by it, preferably alone. In contrast to the usually very social art of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romantics were distrustful of the human world, and tended to believe a close connection with nature was mentally and morally healthy. Romantic art addressed its audiences with what was intended to be felt as the personal voice of the artist. So, in literature, \"much of romantic poetry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves\".<ref>Day 3\u20134; quotation from M.H. Abrams, quoted in Day, 4</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Isaiah Berlin]], Romanticism embodied \"a new and restless spirit, seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms, a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness, a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual movement and change, an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life, a passionate effort at self-assertion both individual and collective, a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals\".<ref>Berlin, 92</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe group of words with the root \"Roman\" in the various European languages, such as \"romance\" and \"Romanesque\", has a complicated history, but by the middle of the 18th century \"romantic\" in English and ''romantique'' in French were both in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets, in a sense close to modern English usage but without the amorous connotation. The application of the term to literature first became common in Germany, where the circle around the Schlegel brothers, critics [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]], began to speak of ''romantische Poesie'' (\"romantic poetry\") in the 1790s, contrasting it with \"classic\" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating.  Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his ''Dialogue on Poetry'' (1800), \"I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived.\"<ref>Ferber, 6\u20137</ref>\n\nIn both French and German the closeness of the adjective to ''roman'', meaning the fairly new literary form of the [[novel]], had some effect on the sense of the word in those languages.  The use of the word, invented by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], did not become general very quickly, and was probably spread more widely in France by its persistent use by [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] in her ''[[De l'Allemagne]]'' (1813), recounting her travels in Germany.<ref name=\"Ferber, 7\">Ferber, 7</ref>  In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the \"romantic harp\" and \"classic lyre\",<ref name=\"Ferber, 7\"/> but in 1820 [[Lord Byron|Byron]] could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously, \"I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago\".<ref>Christiansen, 241.</ref>  It is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.<ref>Christiansen, 242.</ref>\n\n===Period===\nThe period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. [[Margaret Drabble]] described it in literature as taking place \"roughly between 1770 and 1848\",<ref>in her ''Oxford Companion'' article, quoted by Day, 1</ref> and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, [[M. H. Abrams]] placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics.<ref>Day, 1\u20135</ref> Others have proposed 1780\u20131830.<ref>{{Cite book|title = British Literature 1780\u20131830|last = Mellor|first = Anne|publisher = Harcourt Brace & Co./Wadsworth|year = 1996|isbn = 978-1-4130-2253-7|location = NY|pages = |last2 = Matlak|first2 = Richard}}</ref> In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; [[Romantic music|musical Romanticism]], for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of [[Richard Strauss]] are described stylistically as \"Late Romantic\" and were composed in 1946\u201348.<ref>Edward F.

These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Greenblatt et al., ''Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, \"The Romantic Period \u2013 Volume D\" (New York: W.W. Norton & Company Inc., 2006): {{Page needed|date=January 2016}}</ref> The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795\u20131805 had, in the words of one of their number, [[Alfred de Vigny]], been \"conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums\".<ref>Johnson, 147, inc. quotation</ref> According to [[Jacques Barzun]], there were three generations of Romantic artists. The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.<ref>Barzun, 469</ref>\n\n===Context and place in history===\nThe more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of [[intellectual history]] and [[literary history]] throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging. That it was part of the [[Counter-Enlightenment]], a reaction against the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is generally accepted in current scholarship. Its relationship to the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions. Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views,<ref>Day, 1\u20133; the arch-conservative and Romantic is [[Joseph de Maistre]], but many Romantics swung from youthful radicalism to conservative views in middle age, for example Wordsworth. [[Samuel Palmer]]'s only published text was a short piece opposing the [[Repeal of the corn laws]].</ref> and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.\n\nIn philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading \"to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth\",<ref>Berlin, 57</ref> and hence not only to nationalism, but also [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]], with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II.<ref>Several of Berlin's pieces dealing with this theme are collected in the work referenced. See in particular: Berlin, 34\u201347, 57\u201359, 183\u2013206, 207\u201337.</ref> For the Romantics, Berlin says, <blockquote>in the realm of ethics, politics, aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered; this applied equally to individuals and groups\u2014states, nations, movements. This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism, where the notion of eternal models, a Platonic vision of ideal beauty, which the artist seeks to convey, however imperfectly, on canvas or in sound, is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom, individual creativity. The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some \"external\" voice\u2014church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste\u2014is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.<ref>Berlin, 57\u201358</ref><!-- yes, 2 semi-colons & about 15 commas in the quote --></blockquote>\n[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[John William Waterhouse]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'', 1888, after a poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]; like many [[Victorian painting]]s, romantic but not Romantic.]]\n\n[[Arthur Lovejoy]] attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article \"On The Discrimination of Romanticisms\" in his ''Essays in the [[History of ideas|History of Ideas]]'' (1948); some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present, some like [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] see in it the inaugural moment of [[modernity]],<ref>[http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp Linda Simon ''The Sleep of Reason'' by Robert Hughes]</ref> and some like [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Novalis]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge see it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism\u2014a \"Counter-Enlightenment\"\u2014<ref>''[[Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder]]'', Pimlico, 2000 {{ISBN|0-7126-6492-0}} was one of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and organic,</ref><ref>[[Darrin McMahon|Darrin M.

An earlier definition comes from [[Charles Baudelaire]]: \"Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth, but in the way of feeling.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Salon_de_1846_%28Curiosit%C3%A9s_esth%C3%A9tiques%29#II._.E2.80.94_Qu.E2.80.99est-ce_que_le_romantisme.3F |title=Baudelaire's speech at the \"Salon des curiosit\u00e9s Estethiques |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], which affected literature, especially the novel and drama, painting, and even music, through [[Verismo]] opera. This movement was led by France, with [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]] and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] in literature and [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] in painting; [[Stendhal]] and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] were important precursors of Realism in their respective media. However, Romantic styles, now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled, continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond. In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as \"Late Romantic\" and by others as \"Neoromantic\" or \"Postromantic\", but other fields do not usually use these terms; in English literature and painting the convenient term \"Victorian\" avoids having to characterise the period further.\n\nIn northern Europe, the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished, and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was. Elsewhere, including in very different ways the United States and Russia, feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible. Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent, as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics, but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced, often replaced with meticulous technique, as in the poems of Tennyson or many paintings. If not realist, late 19th-century art was often extremely detailed, and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with. Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art, above all the pre-eminent importance of originality, remained important for later generations, and often underlie modern views, despite opposition from theorists.\n\n==Literature==\n{{See also|Romantic poetry}}\n[[File:Chatterton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Wallis]], ''[[The Death of Chatterton]]'' 1856, by suicide at 17 in 1770]]\n\nIn literature, Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past, the cult of \"[[sensibility]]\" with its emphasis on women and children, the isolation of the artist or narrator, and respect for nature. Furthermore, several romantic authors, such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], based their writings on the [[supernatural]]/[[occult]] and human [[psychology]]. Romanticism tended to regard [[satire]] as something unworthy of serious attention, a prejudice still influential today.<ref>[[James Runcieman Sutherland|Sutherland, James]] (1958) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1 ''English Satire''] p. 1. There were a few exceptions, notably Byron, who integrated satire into some of his greatest works, yet shared much in common with his Romantic contemporaries. Bloom, p. 18.</ref> The Romantic movement in literature was preceded by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and succeeded by [[Literary realism|Realism]].\n\nSome authors cite 16th-century poet [[Isabella di Morra]] as an early precursor of Romantic literature. Her lyrics covering themes of isolation and loneliness, which reflected the tragic events of her life, are considered \"an impressive prefigurement of Romanticism\",<ref>Paul F. Grendler, [[Renaissance Society of America]], ''Encyclopedia of the Renaissance'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]], 1999, p. 193</ref> differing from the [[Petrarch]]ist fashion of the time based on the [[philosophy of love]].\n\nThe precursors of Romanticism in English poetry go back to the middle of the 18th century, including figures such as [[Joseph Warton]] (headmaster at [[Winchester College]]) and his brother [[Thomas Warton]], [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at [[Oxford University]].<ref name=\"John Keats page 106\">John Keats. By Sidney Colvin, p. 106. Elibron Classics</ref> Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet. The Scottish poet [[James Macpherson]] influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his [[Ossian]] cycle of poems published in 1762, inspiring both [[Goethe]] and the young [[Walter Scott]]. [[Thomas Chatterton]] is generally considered the first Romantic poet in English.<ref name=\"Thomas Chatterton 1971, page 11\">Thomas Chatterton, Grevel Lindop, 1972, Fyffield Books, p. 11</ref> Both Chatterton and Macpherson's work involved elements of fraud, as what they claimed was earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was, in fact, entirely their own work. The [[Gothic novel]], beginning with [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764), was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism, with a delight in horror and threat, and exotic picturesque settings, matched in Walpole's case by his role in the early [[Gothic Revival|revival of Gothic architecture]]. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', a novel by [[Laurence Sterne]] (1759\u201367), introduced a whimsical version of the anti-rational [[sentimental novel]] to the English literary public.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Des Knaben Wunderhorn III (1808).jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume III of ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'', 1808]]\nAn early German influence came from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], whose 1774 novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist, a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament. At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states, and Goethe's works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of [[nationalism]]. Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], making [[Jena]] (where Fichte lived, as well as Schelling, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and the [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|brothers]] [[Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]]) a center for early [[German Romanticism]] (see [[Jena Romanticism]]). Important writers were [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Novalis]] (''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]'', 1799), [[Heinrich von Kleist]] and [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]. [[Heidelberg]] later became a center of German Romanticism, where writers and poets such as [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Achim von Arnim]], and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] (''[[Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts]]'') met regularly in literary circles.\n\nImportant motifs in German Romanticism are travelling, nature, for example the [[German Forest]], and [[Germanic mythology|Germanic myths]]. The later German Romanticism of, for example [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s ''[[Der Sandmann]]'' (''The Sandman''), 1817, and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]]'s ''Das Marmorbild'' (''The Marble Statue''), 1819, was darker in its motifs and has [[gothic novel|gothic]] elements.  The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to [[folk literature]], non-classical [[mythology]] and [[children's literature]], above all in Germany.  Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' (\"The Boy's Magic Horn\" or [[cornucopia]]), a collection of versified folk tales, in 1806\u201308.  The first collection of ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was published in 1812.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=1988 |title=The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World |edition=1st |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-90081-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/brothersgrimmfro0000zipe/page/7 7\u20138] |url=https://archive.org/details/brothersgrimmfro0000zipe/page/7 }}</ref> Unlike the much later work of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835, these German works were at least mainly based on collected [[Folklore|folk tales]], and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions, though later rewriting some parts.

The publication in 1798 of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement. The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native [[Lake District]], or his feelings about nature\u2014which he more fully developed in his long poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', never published in his lifetime. The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the [[Lake Poets]] were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer [[William Hazlitt]] and others.\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]], ''[[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]]'' in Rome, 1808]]\n\nIn contrast, [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]] achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings; Goethe called Byron \"undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century\".<ref>Christiansen, 215.</ref> Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' in 1805, followed by the full [[epic poem]] ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past, already evoked in ''Ossian''; [[Romanticism in Scotland|Romanticism and Scotland]] were to have a long and fruitful partnership. Byron had equal success with the first part of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' in 1812, followed by four \"Turkish tales\", all in the form of long poems, starting with ''[[The Giaour]]'' in 1813, drawing from his [[Grand Tour]], which had reached Ottoman Europe, and [[Orientalism|orientalizing]] the themes of the Gothic novel in verse. These featured different variations of the \"[[Byronic hero]]\", and his own life contributed a further version. Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the [[historical novel]], beginning in 1814 with ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', set in the [[1745 Jacobite rising]], which was an enormous and highly profitable success, followed by over 20 further [[Waverley Novels]] over the next 17 years, with settings going back to the [[Crusades]] that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature.<ref>Christiansen, 192\u201396.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on [[Lake Geneva]] with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by Shelley's wife-to-be [[Mary Shelley]] and the [[novella]] ''[[The Vampyre]]'' by Byron's doctor [[John William Polidori]]. The lyrics of [[Robert Burns]] in Scotland, and [[Thomas Moore]] from Ireland, reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature, but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work.\n\nThough they have modern critical champions such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]], Scott's novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that composers continued to base on them over the following decades, such as [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[I puritani]]'' (both 1835). Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings, especially his letters, and his unfinished [[satire]] ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]''.<ref>Christiansen, 197\u2013200.</ref> Unlike many Romantics, Byron's widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work, and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the [[Greek War of Independence]] appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end, entrenching his legend.<ref>Christiansen, 213\u201320.</ref> Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy, Blake (at almost 70) in 1827, and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s. Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded, holding a government [[sinecure]], but wrote relatively little. In the discussion of English literature, the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s, or sometimes even earlier, although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values.\n\nThe most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period, other than Walter Scott, was [[Jane Austen]], whose essentially conservative world-view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries, retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules, though critics such as [[Claudia L. Johnson]] have detected tremors under the surface of many works, such as ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (1817),''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1817).<ref>Christiansen, 188\u201389.</ref> But around the mid-century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the [[Yorkshire]]-based [[Bront\u00eb family]] appeared. Most notably [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Bront\u00eb|Emily]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', both published in 1847, which also introduced more Gothic themes. While these two novels were written and published after the Romantic period is said to have ended, their novels were heavily influenced by Romantic literature they'd read as children.\n\nByron, Keats and Shelley all wrote for the stage, but with little success in England, with Shelley's ''[[The Cenci]]'' perhaps the best work produced, though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death. Byron's plays, along with dramatizations of his poems and Scott's novels, were much more popular on the Continent, and especially in France, and through these versions several were turned into operas, many still performed today. If contemporary poets had little success on the stage, the period was a legendary one for performances of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan \"improvements\" to them. The greatest actor of the period, [[Edmund Kean]], restored the tragic ending to ''[[King Lear]]'';<ref>Or at least he tried to; Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, and with regret, he reverted to [[Nahum Tate]]'s version with a comic ending, which had been standard since 1689.

[[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686\u20131758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].<ref>J.

Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard [[Ossian]], he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>J.

Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\" is often sung at [[Hogmanay]] (the last day of the year), and \"[[Scots Wha Hae]]\" served for a long time as an unofficial [[national anthem]] of the country.<ref>L.

Towards the end of the century there were \"[[closet drama]]s\", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and [[Joanna Baillie]] (1762\u20131851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] Romanticism.<ref name=Brown2007pp229-30>I.

The 18th-century precursor to Romanticism, the cult of sensibility, had become associated with the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first-hand. The first major figure was [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand]], a minor aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential [[novella]] of exile ''[[Ren\u00e9 (novella)|Ren\u00e9]]'' (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (''[[The Genius of Christianity|G\u00e9nie du christianisme]]'', 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous [[autobiography]] ''[[M\u00e9moires d'Outre-Tombe]]'' (\"Memoirs from beyond the grave\").<ref>Christiansen, 202\u201303, 241\u201342.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Jacques Grandville - Frenzied Romans at the First Performance of Hernani - WGA10359.jpg|thumb|The \"battle of ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''\" was fought nightly at the theatre in 1830]]\n\nAfter the [[Bourbon Restoration]], French Romanticism developed in the lively world of [[Theatre of France#19th century|Parisian theatre]], with productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Schiller (in France a key Romantic author), and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors, several of whom began to write in the late 1820s. Cliques of pro- and anti-Romantics developed, and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides, including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that \"Shakespeare, c'est l'aide-de-camp de Wellington\" (\"Shakespeare is [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]]\").<ref>Christiansen, 239\u201346, 240 quoted.</ref> [[Alexandre Dumas]] began as a dramatist, with a series of successes beginning with ''Henri III et sa cour'' (1829) before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott, most famously ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', both of 1844. [[Victor Hugo]] published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''\u2014a historical drama in a quasi-Shakespearian style that had famously riotous performances on its first run in 1830.<ref>Christiansen, 244\u201346.</ref> Like Dumas, Hugo is best known for his novels, and was already writing ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831), one of the best known works, which became a paradigm of the French Romantic movement. The preface to his unperformed play ''Cromwell'' gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism, stating that \"there are no rules, or models\". The career of [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] followed a similar pattern; he is now best known as the originator of the story of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', with his novella published 1845. Alfred de Vigny remains best known as a dramatist, with his play on the life of the English poet ''Chatterton'' (1835) perhaps his best work. [[George Sand]] was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene, famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] and several others;<ref>Christiansen</ref> she too was inspired by the theatre, and wrote works to be staged at her [[House of George Sand|private estate]].\n\nFrench Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include [[Alfred de Musset]], [[G\u00e9rard de Nerval]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and the flamboyant [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872.\n\n[[Stendhal]] is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period, but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism, and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism, qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction. As a survivor of the French [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|retreat from Moscow]] in 1812, fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him, and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism. His most important works are ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', 1830) and ''La Chartreuse de Parme'' (''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', 1839).\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:Adam Mickiewicz.PNG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Portrait of Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag Cliff|''Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag'']], by [[Walenty Wa\u0144kowicz]], 1828]]\n{{Main|Romanticism in Poland}}\n[[Romanticism in Poland]] is often taken to begin with the publication of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s first poems in 1822, and end with the crushing of the [[January Uprising]] of 1863 against the Russians. It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history.<ref>Leon Dyczewski, ''Values in the Polish cultural tradition'' (2002) p. 183</ref> Polish Romanticism revived the old \"Sarmatism\" traditions of the ''[[szlachta]]'' or Polish nobility. Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz (''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''), [[Juliusz S\u0142owacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski]], as well as prose writers such as [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] period, differentiating it from that of other countries. They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland.<ref>Christopher J. Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760\u20131850'' (2004) vol. 2. p. 742</ref> Influenced by the general spirit and main ideas of European Romanticism, the literature of Polish Romanticism is unique, as many scholars have pointed out, in having developed largely outside of Poland and in its emphatic focus upon the issue of Polish [[nationalism]]. The Polish intelligentsia, along with leading members of its government, left Poland in the early 1830s, during what is referred to as the \"[[Great Emigration]]\", resettling in France, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States.\n\n[[File:Juliusz S\u0142owacki 1.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Juliusz S\u0142owacki]], a Polish poet considered one of the [[Three Bards|\"Three National Bards\" of Polish literature]]\u2014a major figure in the Polish Romantic period, and the father of modern Polish drama.]]\n\nTheir art featured [[wikt:emotionalism|emotionalism]] and [[Irrationalism and Aestheticism|irrationality]], fantasy and imagination, personality cults, [[folklore]] and country life, and the propagation of ideals of freedom. In the second period, many of the [[Polish Romantics]] worked abroad, often banished from Poland by the occupying powers due to their politically subversive ideas. Their work became increasingly dominated by the ideals of political struggle for freedom and their country's [[sovereignty]]. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. There developed the idea of the ''[[Three Bards|poeta wieszcz]]'' (the prophet). The ''[[wieszcz]]'' (bard) functioned as spiritual leader to the nation fighting for its independence. The most notable poet so recognized was [[Adam Mickiewicz]].\n\n[[Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski]] also wrote to inspire political and religious hope in his countrymen. Unlike his predecessors, who called for victory at whatever price in Poland's struggle against Russia, Krasinski emphasized Poland's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] role in its fight for independence, advocating an intellectual rather than a military superiority. His works best exemplify the [[Messianism|Messianic movement in Poland]]: in two early dramas, ''Nie-boska komedia''<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Nie-Boska komedia|url = https://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nie-Boska_komedia&oldid=41481531|language = pl}}</ref> (1835; ''The Undivine Comedy'') and ''[[Irydion]]'' (1836; ''Iridion''), as well as in the later ''Psalmy przysz\u0142o\u015bci'' (1845), he asserted that Poland was the [[Christ of Europe]]: specifically chosen by God to carry the world's burdens, to suffer, and eventually be resurrected.\n\n=== Russia ===\nEarly Russian Romanticism is associated with the writers [[Konstantin Batyushkov]] (''A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe'', 1809), [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] (''The Bard'', 1811; ''Svetlana'', 1813) and [[Nikolay Karamzin]] (''Poor Liza'', 1792; ''Julia'', 1796; ''Martha the Mayoress'', 1802; ''The Sensitive and the Cold'', 1803). However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is [[Alexander Pushkin]] (''[[The Prisoner of the Caucasus (poem)|The Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', 1820\u20131821; ''The Robber Brothers'', 1822; ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', 1820; ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', 1825\u20131832). Pushkin's work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia's greatest poet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/dostoevsky/texts/devil_pushkinbio.html|title=Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799\u20131837) |publisher=University of Virginia Slavic Department|accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref> Other Russian Romantic poets include [[Mikhail Lermontov]] (''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'', 1839), [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] (''Silentium!'', 1830), [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] (''Eda'', 1826), [[Anton Delvig]], and [[Wilhelm K\u00fcchelbecker]].\n\nInfluenced heavily by Lord Byron, Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self, while Tyutchev's poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love. Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Baratynsky's style was fairly classical in nature, dwelling on the models of the previous century.\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Romanticism in Spanish literature}}\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[El escritor Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]]'', [[portrait]] by [[Antonio Mar\u00eda Esquivel]] ({{circa|1845}}) ([[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]])<ref>{{cite web |title=El escritor Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/obra-de-arte/jose-de-espronceda/e97beaab-f0a3-4f73-8302-1c8185110410 |access-date=March 27, 2013 |website=[[Museo del Prado]] |location=Madrid |language=es}}</ref>]]\n[[Romanticism in Spanish literature]] developed a well-known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights. The most important Spanish poet during this movement was [[Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]]. After him there were other poets like [[Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer]], [[Mariano Jos\u00e9 de Larra]] and the dramatists [[\u00c1ngel de Saavedra]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]], author of ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''. Before them may be mentioned the pre-romantics [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] and [[Manuel Jos\u00e9 Quintana]].<ref>Philip W. Silver, ''Ruin and restitution: reinterpreting romanticism in Spain'' (1997) p. 13</ref>  The plays of [[Antonio Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez]] were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi's operas ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures. For example, in [[Catalonia]] and in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] there was a national boom of writers in the local languages, like the Catalan [[Jacint Verdaguer]] and the Galician [[Rosal\u00eda de Castro]], the main figures of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revivalist]] movements [[Renaixen\u00e7a]] and [[Rexurdimento]], respectively.<ref>Gerald Brenan, ''The literature of the Spanish people: from Roman times to the present'' (1965) p. 364</ref>\n\nThere are scholars who consider Spanish Romanticism to be Proto-Existentialism because it is more anguished than the movement in other European countries. Foster et al., for example, say that the work of Spain's writers such as Espronceda, Larra, and other writers in the 19th century demonstrated a \"metaphysical crisis\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spanish Literature : Current debates on Hispanism|last=Foster|first=David|last2=Altamiranda|first2=Daniel|last3=de Urioste|first3=Carmen|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8153-3563-4|location=New York|page=78}}</ref> These observers put more weight on the link between the 19th-century Spanish writers with the existentialist movement that emerged immediately after.

Alexandre, bishop of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]], in the precepts of [[Neoclassicism]], which can be observed in his early work. The author himself confesses (in ''Cam\u00f5es''{{'}} preface) that he voluntarily refused to follow the principles of epic poetry enunciated by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], as he did the same to [[Horace]]'s [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|''Ars Poetica'']]. Almeida Garrett had participated in the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|1820 Liberal Revolution]], which caused him to exile himself in England in 1823 and then in France, after the [[Vilafrancada|Vila-Francada]]. While living in Great Britain, he had contacts with the Romantic movement and read authors such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Scott, Ossian, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine and de Sta\u00ebl, at the same time visiting feudal castles and ruins of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches and abbeys, which would be reflected in his writings. In 1838, he presented ''Um Auto de Gil Vicente'' (\"A Play by [[Gil Vicente]]\"), in an attempt to create a new national theatre, free of Greco-Roman and foreign influence. But his masterpiece would be ''Frei Lu\u00eds de Sousa'' (1843), named by himself as a \"Romantic drama\" and it was acclaimed as an exceptional work, dealing with themes as national independence, faith, justice and love. He was also deeply interested in Portuguese folkloric verse, which resulted in the publication of ''Romanceiro'' (\"Traditional Portuguese Ballads\") (1843), that recollect a great number of ancient popular ballads, known as \"romances\" or \"rimances\", in ''redondilha maior'' verse form, that contained stories of [[chivalry]], life of [[saint]]s, [[crusades]], [[courtly love]], etc. He wrote the novels ''Viagens na Minha Terra'', ''O Arco de Sant'Ana'' and ''Helena.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Obras Completas de Almeida Garrett \u2013 2 Volumes|last=Almeida Garrett|first=Jo\u00e3o Baptista|publisher=Lello Editores|year=1990|isbn=978-972-48-0192-6|location=Porto|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$almeida-garrett|title=Artigo de apoio Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Almeida Garrett|last=Infop\u00e9dia|website=Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Dicion\u00e1rios Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref><ref name=\"Jos\u00e9\">{{Cite book|title=Hist\u00f3ria da literatura portuguesa|last=Jos\u00e9.|first=Saraiva, Ant\u00f3nio|date=1996|publisher=Porto Editora|others=Lopes, Oscar|isbn=978-972-0-30170-3|edition= 17a|location=[Porto, Portugal]|oclc=35124986}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexandre Herculano]] is, alongside Almeida Garrett, one of the founders of Portuguese Romanticism.

He sought inspiration in medieval Portuguese poems and [[chronicle]]s as in the [[Bible]]. His output is vast and covers many different genres, such as historical essays, poetry, novels, opuscules and theatre, where he brings back a whole world of Portuguese legends, tradition and history, especially in ''Eurico, o Presb\u00edtero'' (\"Eurico, the Priest\") and ''Lendas e Narrativas'' (\"Legends and Narratives\").

He also created polemics by translating [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' without knowing German, but using French versions of the play.

An early Portuguese expression of Romanticism is found already in poets such as [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]] (especially in his sonnets dated at the end of the 18th century) and [[Leonor de Almeida Portugal, 4th Marquise of Alorna|Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna]].<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9\"/>\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Isabella di Morra.jpg|thumb|Italian poet [[Isabella di Morra]], sometimes cited as a precursor of Romantic poets<ref>Gaetana Marrone, Paolo Puppa, ''Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies: A\u2013J'', [[Taylor & Francis]], 2007, p. 1242</ref>]]\nRomanticism in Italian literature was a minor movement although some important works were produced; it began officially in 1816 when [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] wrote an article in the journal ''Biblioteca italiana'' called \"Sulla maniera e l'utilit\u00e0 delle traduzioni\", inviting Italian people to reject [[Neoclassicism]] and to study new authors from other countries.

His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], and filled with themes of blood and terror, using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas' dictatorship.\n\nBrazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods. The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity, using the ideal of the heroic Indian. Some examples include [[Jos\u00e9 de Alencar]], who wrote ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', and [[Gon\u00e7alves Dias]], renowned by the poem \"[[Can\u00e7\u00e3o do ex\u00edlio]]\" (Song of the Exile). The second period, sometimes called [[Ultra-Romanticism]], is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love. Goethe and Lord Byron are commonly quoted in these works. Some of the most notable authors of this phase are [[\u00c1lvares de Azevedo]], [[Casimiro de Abreu]], [[Fagundes Varela]] and [[Junqueira Freire]].

American Romantic [[Gothic literature]] made an early appearance with [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820) and ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1819), followed from 1823 onwards by the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'' of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already-exotic mythicized frontier peopled by \"[[noble savage]]s\", similar to the philosophical theory of [[Rousseau]], exemplified by [[Uncas]], from ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. There are picturesque \"local color\" elements in Washington Irving's essays and especially his travel books. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home, but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and [[melodrama]] of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850). Later [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] writers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] still show elements of its influence and imagination, as does the [[romantic realism]] of [[Walt Whitman]]. The poetry of [[Emily Dickinson]]\u2014nearly unread in her own time\u2014and [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature. By the 1880s, however, psychological and [[social realism]] were competing with Romanticism in the novel.\n\n====Influence of European Romanticism on American writers====\nThe European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century. American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe. Like the Europeans, the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm, commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self, an emphasis on intuitive perception, and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good, while human society was filled with corruption.<ref name=\"George L 1997 p 613\">George L. McMichael and Frederick C. Crews, eds. ''Anthology of American Literature: Colonial through romantic'' (6th ed. 1997) p. 613</ref>\n\nRomanticism became popular in American politics, philosophy and art. The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement. The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect. It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism, which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained. The Romantic movement gave rise to [[New England]] [[Transcendentalism]], which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe. The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God. Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion, for both privileged feeling over reason, individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. It often involved a rapturous response to nature. It encouraged the rejection of harsh, rigid Calvinism, and promised a new blossoming of American culture.<ref name=\"George L 1997 p 613\"/><ref>\"Romanticism, American\", in ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'' ed by Ann Lee Morgan (Oxford University Press, 2007) [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t238.e1140 online]</ref>\n\nAmerican Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition. The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers. Novels, short stories, and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore. Romantic literature was personal, intense, and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature. America's preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy. They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters, and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement.<ref>The relationship of the American poet Wallace Stevens to Romanticism is raised in the poem \"[[Another Weeping Woman]]\" and its commentary.</ref>\n\nThe works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{See also|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nRomantic architecture appeared in the late 18th century in a reaction against the rigid forms of [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architecture. reached its peak in the mid-19th century, and continued to appear until the end of the 19th century. It was designed to evoke an emotional reaction, either respect for tradition or nostalgia for a bucolic past. It was frequently inspired by the architecture of the [[Middle Ages]], especially [[Gothic architecture]], It was strongly influenced by romanticism in literature, particularly the historical novels of [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Walter Scott]]. It sometimes moved into the domain of [[eclecticism]], with features assembled from different historic periods and regions of the world.<ref>Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), p. 63</ref>\n\n[[Gothic Revival architecture]] was a popular variant of the romantic style, particularly in the construction of churches, Cathedrals, and university buildings. Notable examples include the completion of [[Cologne Cathedral]] in Germany, by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. The cathedral had been begun in 1248, but work was halted in 1473. The original plans for the fa\u00e7ade were discovered in 1840, and it was decided to recommence. Schinkel followed the original design as much as possible, but used modern construction technology, including an iron frame for the roof. The building was finished in 1880.<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), pp. 64</ref>\n\nIn Britain, notable examples include the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]], a romantic version of traditional [[Indian architecture]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] (1815\u20131823), and the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, built in a Gothic revival style by [[Charles Barry]] between 1840 and 1876.<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64-65\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2008), pp. 64-65</ref>\n\nIn France, one of the earliest examples of romantic architecture is the [[Hameau de la Reine]], the small rustic hamlet created at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] between 1783 and 1785 by the royal architect [[Richard Mique]] with the help of the romantic painter [[Hubert Robert]]. It consisted of twelve structures, ten of which still exist, in the style of villages in [[Normandy]]. It was designed for the Queen and her friends to amuse themselves by playing at being peasants, and included a farmhouse with a dairy, a mill, a boudoir, a pigeon loft, a tower in the form of a lighthouse from which one could fish in the pond, a belvedere, a cascade and grotto, and a luxuriously furnished cottage with a billiard room for the Queen.{{Sfn|Saule|2014|page=92}}\n\nFrench romantic architecture in the 19th century was strongly influenced by two writers; [[Victor Hugo]], whose novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' inspired a resurgence in interest in the Middle Ages; and [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]], who wrote celebrated romantic novels and short stories and was also the first head of the commission of Historic Monuments in France, responsible for publicizing and restoring (and sometimes romanticizing) many French cathedrals and monuments desecrated and ruined after the [[French Revolution]]. His projects were carried out by the architect [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. These included the restoration (sometimes creative) of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]], the fortified city of [[Carcassonne]], and the unfinished medieval [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]].<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64\"/><ref>Poisson, Georges; ''Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc'' (in French) (2014)</ref>\n\nThe romantic style continued in the second half of the 19th century. The [[Palais Garnier]], the Paris opera house designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] was a highly romantic and eclectic combination of artistic styles.  Another notable example of late 19th century romanticism is the [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] by [[Paul Abadie]], who drew upon the model of [[Byzantine architecture]] for his elongated domes (1875\u20131914).<ref name=\"Weber, Patrick 2008 pp. 64-65\"/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"125\">\nFile:Marie Antoinette amusement at Versailles.JPG|[[Hameau de la Reine]], [[Palace of Versailles]] (1783\u20131785)\nFile:Brighton royal pavilion Qmin.jpg|[[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] (1815\u20131823)\nFile:Cologne cathedrale vue sud.jpg|[[Cologne Cathedral]] (1840\u201380)\nFile:Monumental stairway of the palais Garnier opera in Paris.jpg|Grand Staircase of the [[Paris Opera]] by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] (1861\u201375)\nFile:Le sacre coeur.jpg|[[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] by [[Paul Abadie]] (1875\u20131914)\n</gallery>\n\n==Visual arts==\n[[File:The Bard (1774).jpeg|thumb|[[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]], ''The Bard'', 1774, a prophetic combination of Romanticism and nationalism by the Welsh artist]]\n\nIn the visual arts, Romanticism first showed itself in [[landscape painting]], where from as early as the 1760s British artists began to turn to wilder landscapes and storms, and [[Gothic architecture]], even if they had to make do with [[Welsh art|Wales as a setting]]. [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] were born less than a year apart in 1774 and 1775 respectively and were to take German and English landscape painting to their extremes of Romanticism, but both their artistic sensibilities were formed when forms of Romanticism was already strongly present in art. [[John Constable]], born in 1776, stayed closer to the English landscape tradition, but in his largest \"six-footers\" insisted on the heroic status of a patch of the working countryside where he had grown up\u2014challenging the traditional [[hierarchy of genres]], which relegated landscape painting to a low status. Turner also painted very large landscapes, and above all, seascapes. Some of these large paintings had contemporary settings and [[staffage]], but others had small figures that turned the work into [[history painting]] in the manner of [[Claude Lorrain]], like [[Salvator Rosa]], a [[Rococo|late Baroque]] artist whose landscapes had elements that Romantic painters repeatedly turned to. Friedrich often used single figures, or features like crosses, set alone amidst a huge landscape, \"making them images of the transitoriness of human life and the premonition of death\".<ref>Novotny, 96\u2013101, 99 quoted</ref>\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', 1800\u201302]]\n\nOther groups of artists expressed feelings that verged on the mystical, many largely abandoning classical drawing and proportions.  These included [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]] and the other members of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] in England, and in Germany [[Philipp Otto Runge]]. Like Friedrich, none of these artists had significant influence after their deaths for the rest of the 19th century, and were 20th-century rediscoveries from obscurity, though Blake was always known as a poet, and Norway's leading painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]] was heavily influenced by Friedrich. The Rome-based [[Nazarene movement]] of German artists, active from 1810, took a very different path, concentrating on medievalizing history paintings with religious and nationalist themes.<ref>Novotny, 112\u201321</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of [[Neoclassicism]] on the academies, but from the [[Napoleonic]] period it became increasingly popular, initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime, of which [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]]'s ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', for Napoleon's [[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], was one of the earliest. Girodet's old teacher [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil's direction, saying: \"Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting\".<ref>Honour, 184\u2013190, 187 quoted</ref> A new generation of the French school,<ref>Walter Friedlaender, ''From David to Delacroix'', 1974, remains the best available account of the subject.</ref> developed personal Romantic styles, though still concentrating on history painting with a political message. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] (1791\u20131824) had his first success with ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'', a heroic military figure derived from [[Rubens]], at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1812 in the years of the Empire, but his next major completed work, ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' of 1821, remains the greatest achievement of the Romantic history painting, which in its day had a powerful anti-government message.\n\n[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] (1798\u20131863) made his first Salon hits with ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822), ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827). The second was a scene from the Greek War of Independence, completed the year Byron died there, and the last was a scene from one of Byron's plays. With Shakespeare, Byron was to provide the subject matter for many other works of Delacroix, who also spent long periods in North Africa, painting colourful scenes of mounted Arab warriors. His ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830) remains, with the ''Medusa'', one of the best-known works of French Romantic painting. Both reflected current events, and increasingly \"[[history painting]]\", literally \"story painting\", a phrase dating back to the Italian Renaissance meaning the painting of subjects with groups of figures, long considered the highest and most difficult form of art, did indeed become the painting of historical scenes, rather than those from religion or mythology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm|title=Romanticism|website=metmuseum.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Francisco Goya]] was called \"the last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity\".<ref>Novotny, 142</ref>  But the extent to which he was a Romantic is a complex question. In Spain, there was still a struggle to introduce the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in which Goya saw himself as a participant.  The demonic and anti-rational monsters thrown up by his imagination are only superficially similar to those of the Gothic fantasies of northern Europe, and in many ways he remained wedded to the classicism and realism of his training, as well as looking forward to the Realism of the later 19th century.<ref>Novotny, 133\u201342</ref> But he, more than any other artist of the period, exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist's feelings and his personal imaginative world.<ref>Hughes, 279\u201380</ref> He also shared with many of the Romantic painters a more free handling of paint, emphasized in the new prominence of the brushstroke and [[impasto]], which tended to be repressed in neoclassicism under a self-effacing finish.\n[[File:Cavalier gaulois pont d'iena RG am face.jpg|thumb|''Cavalier gaulois'' by [[Antoine-Augustin Pr\u00e9ault]], [[Pont d'I\u00e9na]], Paris]]\n\n[[Sculpture]] remained largely impervious to Romanticism, probably partly for technical reasons, as the most prestigious material of the day, marble, does not lend itself to expansive gestures. The leading sculptors in Europe, [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], were both based in Rome and firm Neoclassicists, not at all tempted to allow influence from medieval sculpture, which would have been one possible approach to Romantic sculpture. When it did develop, true Romantic sculpture\u2014with the exception of a few artists such as [[Rudolf Maison]]\u2014<ref>McKay, James, ''The Dictionary of Sculptors in Bronze'', Antique Collectors Club, London, 1995</ref> rather oddly was missing in Germany, and mainly found in France, with [[Fran\u00e7ois Rude]], best known from his group of the 1830s from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, [[David d'Angers]], and [[Auguste Pr\u00e9ault]]. Pr\u00e9ault's plaster relief entitled ''Slaughter'', which represented the horrors of wars with exacerbated passion, caused so much scandal at the 1834 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] that Pr\u00e9ault was banned from this official annual exhibition for nearly twenty years.<ref>Novotny, 397, 379\u201384</ref> In Italy, the most important Romantic sculptor was [[Lorenzo Bartolini]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dizionario di arte e letteratura|publisher=Zanichelli|location=Bologna|year=2002|page=544}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|[[Francisco Goya]], ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', 1814\nFile:JEAN LOUIS TH\u00c9ODORE G\u00c9RICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|[[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]], ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', 1819\nFile:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' 1830\nFile:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|[[J.

Delacroix, [[Ingres]] and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] all worked in this style, as did lesser specialists such as [[Pierre-Henri R\u00e9voil]] (1776\u20131842) and [[Fleury-Fran\u00e7ois Richard]] (1777\u20131852). Their pictures are often small, and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments, as well as those of high drama. The lives of great artists such as [[Raphael]] were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted. Fleury-Richard's ''Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband'', shown in the [[Paris Salon]] of 1802, marked the arrival of the style, which lasted until the mid-century, before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like [[Paul Delaroche]].<ref>Noon, throughout, especially pp. 124\u2013155</ref>\n\n[[File:Hayez, Fracesco - Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem - 1836-50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Francesco Hayez]], ''Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem'']]\n\nAnother trend was for very large apocalyptic history paintings, often combining extreme natural events, or divine wrath, with human disaster, attempting to outdo ''The Raft of the Medusa'', and now often drawing comparisons with effects from Hollywood. The leading English artist in the style was [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and worked his way through the biblical disasters, and those to come in the [[Christian eschatology|final days]]. Other works such as Delacroix's ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], with extra emotionalism and special effects.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, leading artists adopted Romantic styles: in Russia there were the portraitists [[Orest Kiprensky]] and [[Vasily Tropinin]], with [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] specializing in [[marine painting]], and in Norway [[Hans Gude]] painted scenes of [[fjord]]s. In Italy [[Francesco Hayez]] (1791\u20131882) was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid-19th-century [[Milan]]. His long, prolific and extremely successful career saw him begin as a Neoclassical painter, pass right through the Romantic period, and emerge at the other end as a sentimental painter of young women. His Romantic period included many historical pieces of \"Troubadour\" tendencies, but on a very large scale, that are heavily influenced by [[Gian Battista Tiepolo]] and other [[Rococo|late Baroque]] Italian masters.\n\nLiterary Romanticism had its counterpart in the American visual arts, most especially in the exaltation of an untamed American [[Landscape art|landscape]] found in the paintings of the [[Hudson River School]]. Painters like [[Thomas Cole]], [[Albert Bierstadt]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church]] and others often expressed Romantic themes in their paintings. They sometimes depicted ancient ruins of the old world, such as in Fredric Edwin Church's piece ''Sunrise in Syria''. These works reflected the Gothic feelings of death and decay. They also show the Romantic ideal that Nature is powerful and will eventually overcome the transient creations of men. More often, they worked to distinguish themselves from their European counterparts by depicting uniquely American scenes and landscapes. This idea of an American identity in the art world is reflected in [[William Cullen Bryant|W. C.

Nevertheless, the huge popularity of German Romantic music led, \"whether by imitation or by reaction\", to an often nationalistically inspired vogue amongst Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Czech, and Scandinavian musicians, successful \"perhaps more because of its extra-musical traits than for the actual value of musical works by its masters\".<ref>Ferchault 1957.</ref>\n[[File:NiccoloPaganini.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], ''Portrait of [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'', 1819]]\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] in 1838 by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]]]\n\nAlthough the term \"Romanticism\" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of \"romantic\" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation. Indeed, one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789, in the ''M\u00e9moires'' of [[Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try]].<ref>Gr\u00e9tre 1789.</ref> This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans, but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (himself a composer, amongst other things) and, by so doing, establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally.<ref name=\"Samson 2001\">Samson 2001.</ref> In 1810 [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] named [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as \"the three masters of instrumental compositions\" who \"breathe one and the same romantic spirit\". He justified his view on the basis of these composers' depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality. In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, \"a child-like, serene disposition prevails\", while Mozart (in the late [[Symphony No. 39 (Mozart)|E-flat major Symphony]], for example) \"leads us into the depths of the spiritual world\", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, \"a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres\". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of \"the monstrous and immeasurable\", with the pain of an endless longing that \"will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions\".<ref>Hoffmann 1810, col. 632.</ref> This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder|Wackenroder]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and later by writers such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.<ref>Boyer 1961, 585\u201386.</ref>\n\nThis chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century, when [[Richard Wagner]] denigrated the music of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] as \"[[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]]\": \"The Opera, to which we shall now return, has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz, too, as a plump, fine-flavoured oyster, whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well-to-do appearance.\"<ref>Wagner 1995, 77.</ref>\n\nIt was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of ''Musikwissenschaft'' ([[musicology]])\u2014itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age\u2014attempted a more scientific [[periodization]] of music history, and a distinction between [[Classical period (music)|Viennese Classical]] and Romantic periods was proposed. The key figure in this trend was [[Guido Adler]], who viewed Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]] as transitional but essentially Classical composers, with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post-Beethoven generation of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn, [[Robert Schumann]], Hector Berlioz and [[Franz Liszt]]. From Adler's viewpoint, found in books like ''Der Stil in der Musik'' (1911), composers of the [[New German School]] and various late-19th-century [[Musical nationalism|nationalist]] composers were not Romantics but \"moderns\" or \"realists\" (by analogy with the fields of painting and literature), and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Samson 2001\"/>\n\nBy the second quarter of the 20th century, an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint, and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past. This in turn led historians such as [[Alfred Einstein]]<ref>Einstein 1947.</ref> to extend the musical \"[[Romantic music|Romantic era]]\" throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th. It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]''<ref>Warrack 2002.</ref> and [[Donald Jay Grout|Grout]]'s ''History of Western Music''<ref>Grout 1960, 492.</ref> but was not unchallenged. For example, the prominent German musicologist [[Friedrich Blume]], the chief editor of the first edition of ''[[Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'' (1949\u201386), accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century, but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century, including such pre-World War II developments as [[Expressionist music|expressionism]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]].<ref>Blume 1970; Samson 2001.</ref> This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''<ref name=\"Samson 2001\"/> and the new edition of ''[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]''.<ref>Wehnert 1998.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Mendelssohn Bartholdy.jpg|[[Felix Mendelssohn]], 1839\nFile:Robert Schumann 1839.jpg|[[Robert Schumann]], 1839\nFile:Barabas-liszt.jpg|[[Franz Liszt]], 1847\nFile:Postcard-1910 Daniel Fransois Auber.jpg|[[Daniel Auber]], c. 1868\nFile:Hector Berlioz.jpg|[[Hector Berlioz]], 1850\nFile:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|[[Giovanni Boldini]], ''Portrait of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'', 1886\nFile:Richardwagner1.jpg|[[Richard Wagner]], c. 1870s\nFile:Giacomo Meyerbeer nuorempana.jpg|[[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], 1847\n</gallery>\n\nIn the contemporary music culture, the romantic musician followed a public career depending on sensitive middle-class audiences rather than on a courtly patron, as had been the case with earlier musicians and composers.

The English scientist Sir [[Humphry Davy]], a prominent Romantic thinker, said that understanding nature required \"an attitude of admiration, love and worship, [...] a personal response\".<ref>Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 15.</ref> He believed that knowledge was only attainable by those who truly appreciated and respected nature. Self-understanding was an important aspect of Romanticism. It had less to do with proving that man was capable of understanding nature (through his budding intellect) and therefore controlling it, and more to do with the emotional appeal of connecting himself with nature and understanding it through a harmonious co-existence.<ref>Bossi, M., and Poggi, S., ed.

Example of [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]].]]\n\nOne of Romanticism's key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of [[national language]]s and [[folklore]], and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning. One of the most important functions of medieval references in the 19th century was nationalist. Popular and epic poetry were its workhorses. This is visible in Germany and Ireland, where underlying Germanic or Celtic [[Stratum (linguistics)|linguistic substrates]] dating from before the Romanization-Latinization were sought out.\n\nEarly Romantic nationalism was strongly inspired by Rousseau, and by the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], who in 1784 argued that the geography formed the natural economy of a people, and shaped their customs and society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe nature of nationalism changed dramatically, however, after the [[French Revolution]] with the rise of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]], and the reactions in other nations. Napoleonic nationalism and republicanism were, at first, inspirational to movements in other nations: self-determination and a consciousness of national unity were held to be two of the reasons why France was able to defeat other countries in battle. But as the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] became [[First French Empire|Napoleon's Empire]], Napoleon became not the inspiration for nationalism, but the object of its struggle. In [[Prussia]], the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in [[Napoleonic Wars|the struggle against Napoleon]] was argued by, among others, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], a disciple of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The word ''[[Volkstum]]'', or nationality, was coined in German as part of this resistance to the now conquering emperor. Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his address \"To the German Nation\" in 1806:\n\n<blockquote>Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole. ...Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality\u2014then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be.<ref name=\"Fichte\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1806fichte.asp | title=Address to the German Nation | publisher=Fordham University | date=1806 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | author=Fichte, Johann}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis view of nationalism inspired the collection of [[folklore]] by such people as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the revival of old epics as national, and the construction of new epics as if they were old, as in the ''[[Kalevala]]'', compiled from Finnish tales and folklore, or ''[[Ossian]]'', where the claimed ancient roots were invented. The view that fairy tales, unless contaminated from outside literary sources, were preserved in the same form over thousands of years, was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists, but fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people. For instance, the Brothers Grimm rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by [[Charles Perrault]], which they thought proved they were not truly German tales;<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 31 {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}</ref> ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' survived in their collection because the tale of [[Brunhild|Brynhildr]] convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German. [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] contributed to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation. He regarded the oral literature of the peasants as an integral part of Serbian culture, compiling it to use in his collections of folk songs, tales and proverbs, as well as the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian.<ref>{{cite book|title=Prilozi za knji\u017eevnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=\u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430, \u0425\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0430|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}</ref> Similar projects were undertaken by the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\n=== Polish nationalism and messianism ===\n[[File:Night november.jpg|thumb|The [[November Uprising]] (1830\u201331), in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], against the [[Russian Empire]]]]\n\nRomanticism played an essential role in the national awakening of many Central European peoples lacking their own national states, not least in Poland, which had recently failed to restore its independence when [[Imperial Russian Army|Russia's army]] crushed the [[November Uprising|Polish Uprising]] under [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Revival and reinterpretation of ancient myths, customs and traditions by Romantic poets and painters helped to distinguish their indigenous cultures from those of the dominant nations and crystallise the mythography of [[Romantic nationalism]]. Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. Arguably, the most distinguished Romantic poet of this part of Europe was [[Adam Mickiewicz]], who developed an idea that [[Christ of Europe|Poland was the Messiah of Nations]], predestined to suffer just as [[Jesus]] had suffered to save all the people. The Polish self-image as a \"[[Christ of Europe|Christ among nations]]\" or the martyr of Europe can be traced back to its history of [[Christendom]] and suffering under invasions. During the periods of foreign occupation, the Catholic Church served as bastion of Poland's national identity and language, and the major promoter of [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]]. The [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] came to be seen in Poland as a Polish sacrifice for the security for [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. Adam Mickiewicz wrote the patriotic drama ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (directed against the Russians), where he depicts Poland as the Christ of Nations. He also wrote \"Verily I say unto you, it is not for you to learn civilization from foreigners, but it is you who are to teach them civilization ... You are among the foreigners like the Apostles among the idolaters\". In ''Books of the Polish Nation and Polish Pilgrimage'' Mickiewicz detailed his vision of Poland as a Messias and a Christ of Nations, that would save mankind. Dziady is known for various interpretation. The most known ones are the moral aspect of part II, [[individualist]] and romantic message of part IV, as well as deeply patriotic, messianistic and Christian vision in part III of the poem. Zdzis\u0142aw K\u0119pi\u0144ski, however, focuses his interpretation on [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan]] and [[occult]] elements found in the drama. In his book ''Mickiewicz hermetyczny'' he writes about [[Hermeticism|hermetic]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophic]] and [[Alchemy|alchemical]] philosophy on the book as well as [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] symbols.\n\n==Gallery==\n;Emerging Romanticism in the 18th century\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Shipwrec-vernet.jpg|[[Joseph Vernet]], 1759, ''Shipwreck''; the 18th-century \"sublime\"\nFile:Joseph Wright 004.jpg|[[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], 1774, ''Cave at evening'', [[Smith College|Smith College Museum of Art]], [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]\nFile:John Henry Fuseli - The Nightmare.JPG|[[Henry Fuseli]], 1781, ''[[The Nightmare]]'', a classical artist whose themes often anticipate the Romantic\nFile:Philipp Jakob Loutherbourg d.

The Harris Farm Engagement was a part of the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse]]. The battle was led by Union Major General [[Winfield S. Hancock]] and Confederate general [[Richard S. Ewell]]. The battle was caused when the Union commander, Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered Hancock's Union II Corps to trap Confederate soldiers between [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]. Before General Hancock could trap the Confederate soldiers, Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] ordered Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell, in command of the ''Confederate ''II Corps to ambush General Hancock's troops at the Harris Farm (also known as [[Bloomsbury Farm (Spotsylvania County, Virginia)|Bloomsbury Farm)]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe Harris Farm Engagement was a part of the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. At the battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's Federal II Corps to trap receding Confederate troops who were heading to Fredericksburg. Unbeknownst to General Grant, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee heard of this and ordered Richard S. Ewell and the rest of the surviving Confederate [[Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Second Corps]] of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] to ambush Hancock's troops at the Harris Farm. Ewell made camp near the Harris Farm and waited for the Hancock's troops to come near.\n\n== Battle ==\nWhen Hancock's troops came into view Ewell had his men fire at them. Ewell then ordered a charge on Hancock's troops. Early in the battle Ewell had the upper hand until Hancock's superior numbers soon gained the control. Both sides quickly began taking heavy casualties, and Ewell began falling back. [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]], who was observing the battle, ordered Hancock to pursue the remaining troops. The battle continued until General Lee, who was also observing the battle, thought this engagement was about to turn into a battle of itself. Lee ordered his troops to disengage and head to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Grant and Hancock claimed victory, as they had forced a retreat of the enemy and officially ended the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Harris Farm Engagement claimed 1,598 casualties on both sides. The engagement was the end of the long Battle of the Spotsylvania Courthouse.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:EwellsDeadSpotsylvania1864crop02.jpg|This unidentified, dead Confederate soldier of Ewell's Corps was killed during their attack at Alsop's farm.

[[Capital flight]] ensued almost immediately, beginning an international chain reaction.

[[Hong Kong]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[Philippines]] were also hurt by the slump. [[Brunei]], [[China|mainland China]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Vietnam]] were less affected, although all suffered from a loss of demand and confidence throughout the region. [[Japan]] was also affected, though less significantly.\n \nForeign [[debt-to-GDP ratio]]s rose from 100% to 167% in the four large [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) economies in 1993\u201396, then shot up beyond 180% during the worst of the crisis. In South Korea, the ratios rose from 13% to 21% and then as high as 40%, while the other northern [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]] fared much better. Only in Thailand and South Korea did debt service-to-exports ratios rise.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.adb.org/publications/key-indicators-developing-asian-and-pacific-countries-2003|title = Key Indicators of Developing Asian and Pacific Countries 2003|date = August 2003|journal= Asian Development Bank|access-date = 16 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the governments of Asia had seemingly sound [[fiscal policies]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) stepped in to initiate a $40 billion program to stabilize the currencies of South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia, economies particularly hard hit by the crisis. The efforts to stem a global economic crisis did little to stabilize the domestic situation in Indonesia, however. After 30 years in power, Indonesian President [[Suharto]] was [[Fall of Suharto|forced to step down]] on 21 May 1998 in the wake of widespread rioting that followed sharp price increases caused by a drastic devaluation of the [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]]. The effects of the crisis lingered through 1998. In 1998, growth in the Philippines dropped to virtually zero. Only Singapore and Taiwan proved relatively insulated from the shock, but both suffered serious hits in passing, the former due to its size and geographical location between Malaysia and Indonesia. By 1999, however, analysts saw signs that the [[Economy of Asia|economies of Asia]] were beginning to recover.<ref>Pempel: pp 118\u2013143</ref> After the crisis, economies in the region worked toward financial stability and better financial supervision.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kawai |first1=Masahiro |last2=Morgan |first2=Peter J. |date=2012 |title=Central Banking for Financial Stability in Asia |work=ADBI Working Paper 377 |place=Tokyo |publisher=Asian Development Bank Institute |url=http://www.adbi.org/files/2012.08.28.wp377.central.banking.financial.stability.asia.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018154416/http://www.adbi.org/files/2012.08.28.wp377.central.banking.financial.stability.asia.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1999, Asia attracted almost half of the total [[Capital (economics)|capital]] inflow into [[Developing country|developing countries]]. The economies of Southeast Asia in particular maintained high interest rates attractive to foreign investors looking for a high [[rate of return]]. As a result, the region's economies received a large inflow of money and experienced a dramatic run-up in asset prices. At the same time, the regional economies of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and South Korea experienced high growth rates, of 8\u201312% GDP, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This achievement was widely acclaimed by financial institutions including IMF and [[World Bank]], and was known as part of the \"[[Four Asian Tigers|Asian economic miracle]]\".\n\n==Credit bubbles and fixed currency exchange rates==\nThe cause of the debacle are many and disputed. Thailand's economy developed into an [[economic bubble]] fueled by [[hot money]]. More and more was required as the size of the bubble grew. The same type of situation happened in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], which had the added complication of what was called \"[[crony capitalism]]\".<ref>Hughes, Helen. Crony Capitalism and the East Asian Currency Financial 'Crises'. ''Policy''. Spring 1999.</ref> The short-term capital flow was expensive and often highly conditioned for quick [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. Development money went in a largely uncontrolled manner to certain people only - not necessarily the best suited or most efficient, but those closest to the centers of power.<ref>Blustein: p. 73</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Thailand, Indonesia and [[South Korea]] had large private [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficits, and the maintenance of [[fixed exchange rate]]s encouraged external borrowing and led to excessive exposure to [[foreign exchange risk]] in both the financial and corporate sectors.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of external shocks began to change the economic environment. The [[devaluation]] of the Chinese [[renminbi]], and the Japanese [[yen]] due to the [[Plaza Accord]] of 1985, the raising of U.S. interest rates which led to a strong U.S. dollar, and the sharp decline in semiconductor prices, all adversely affected their growth.<ref>[http://www.frbsf.org/econrsrch/wklyltr/wklyltr98/el98-24.html FRBSF Economic Letter : What Caused East Asia's Financial Crisis?] 7 August 1998</ref> As the [[U.S. economy]] recovered from a recession in the early 1990s, the [[U.S. Federal Reserve Bank]] under [[Alan Greenspan]] began to raise U.S. interest rates to head off inflation.\n\nThis made the United States a more attractive investment destination relative to Southeast Asia, which had been attracting hot money flows through high short-term interest rates, and raised the value of the U.S. dollar. For the Southeast Asian nations which had currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, the higher U.S. dollar caused their own exports to become more expensive and less competitive in the global markets. At the same time, Southeast Asia's export growth slowed dramatically in the spring of 1996, deteriorating their current account position.\n\nSome economists have advanced the growing exports of China as a factor contributing to ASEAN nations' export growth slowdown, though these economists maintain the main cause of their crises was excessive real estate speculation.<ref>[https://www.newschool.edu/scepa/publications/workingpapers/archive/cepa0318.pdf The Three Routes to Financial Crises: The Need for Capital Controls] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117144558/https://www.newschool.edu/scepa/publications/workingpapers/archive/cepa0318.pdf |date=17 November 2015 }}. Gabriel Palma (Cambridge University). Center for Economic Policy Analysis.

Other economists dispute China's impact, noting that both ASEAN and China experienced simultaneous rapid export growth in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Asia-Pacific Profile |author1=Bernard Eccleston |author2=Michael Dawson |author3=Deborah J.

The resulting large quantities of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] that became available generated a highly [[leverage (finance)|leveraged]] economic climate, and pushed up asset prices to an unsustainable level.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/FIRESALE.htm FIRE-SALE FDI] by [[Paul Krugman]].</ref> These asset prices eventually began to collapse, causing individuals and companies to [[Default (finance)|default]] on debt obligations.\n\n==Panic among lenders and withdrawal of credit==\nThe resulting panic among lenders led to a large withdrawal of credit from the crisis countries, causing a [[credit crunch]] and further bankruptcies. In addition, as foreign investors attempted to withdraw their money, the [[Foreign exchange market|exchange market]] was flooded with the currencies of the crisis countries, putting [[Depreciation (currency)|depreciative]] pressure on their exchange rates. To prevent currency values collapsing, these countries' governments raised domestic interest rates to exceedingly high levels (to help diminish [[Capital flight|flight of capital]] by making lending more attractive to investors) and intervened in the exchange market, buying up any excess domestic currency at the [[fixed exchange rate]] with [[foreign reserves]]. Neither of these policy responses could be sustained for long.\n\nVery high interest rates, which can be extremely damaging to a healthy economy, wreaked further havoc on economies in an already fragile state, while the central banks were hemorrhaging foreign reserves, of which they had finite amounts. When it became clear that the tide of capital fleeing these countries was not to be stopped, the authorities ceased defending their fixed exchange rates and allowed their currencies to [[Floating exchange rate|float]]. The resulting depreciated value of those currencies meant that foreign currency-denominated [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]] grew substantially in domestic currency terms, causing more bankruptcies and further deepening the crisis.\n\nOther economists, including [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]], have downplayed the role of the real economy in the crisis compared to the financial markets. The rapidity with which the crisis happened has prompted Sachs and others to compare it to a classic [[bank run]] prompted by a sudden risk shock. Sachs pointed to strict monetary and contractionary fiscal policies implemented by the governments on the advice of the IMF in the wake of the crisis, while [[Frederic Mishkin]] points to the role of [[asymmetric information]] in the financial markets that led to a \"[[herd mentality]]\" among investors that magnified a small risk in the real economy. The crisis has thus attracted interest from [[behavioral economics|behavioral economists]] interested in [[market psychology]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Goel|first=Suresh|title=Crisis management : master the skills to prevent disasters|year=2009|publisher=Global India Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9789380228082|page=101}}</ref>\n\nAnother possible cause of the sudden risk shock may also be attributable to the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong sovereignty on 1 July 1997]]. During the 1990s, hot money flew into the Southeast Asia region through [[financial hub]]s, especially Hong Kong. The investors were often ignorant of the actual fundamentals or risk profiles of the respective economies, and once the crisis gripped the region, the political uncertainty regarding the future of Hong Kong as an Asian financial centre led some investors to withdraw from Asia altogether.

The SAPs called on crisis-struck nations to reduce government spending and deficits, allow [[insolvency|insolvent]] banks and financial institutions to fail, and aggressively raise interest rates. The reasoning was that these steps would restore confidence in the nations' fiscal [[solvency]], penalize insolvent companies, and protect currency values. Above all, it was stipulated that IMF-funded capital had to be administered rationally in the future, with no favored parties receiving funds by preference. In at least one of the affected countries the restrictions on foreign ownership were greatly reduced.<ref>{{citation|last=Woo-Cumings|first=Meredith|authorlink=Meredith Jung-En Woo|title=South Korean Anti-Americanism|journal=Working Paper No. 93|date=July 2003|url=http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp93.html}} Korea:\"[T]he ceiling on foreign ownership of publicly traded companies was raised to 50 percent from 26 percent; and the ceiling on individual foreign ownership went up from 7 percent to 50 percent.\"</ref>\n\nThere were to be adequate government controls set up to supervise all financial activities, ones that were to be independent, in theory, of private interest. Insolvent institutions had to be closed, and insolvency itself had to be clearly defined. In addition, financial systems were to become \"transparent\", that is, provide the kind of reliable financial information used in the West to make sound financial decisions.<ref>Noland: pp. 98\u2013103</ref>\n\nAs countries fell into crisis, many local businesses and governments that had taken out loans in US dollars, which suddenly became much more expensive relative to the local currency which formed their earned income, found themselves unable to pay their creditors. The dynamics of the situation were similar to that of the [[Latin American debt crisis]]. The effects of the SAPs were mixed and their impact controversial. Critics, however, noted the contractionary nature of these policies, arguing that in a [[recession]], the traditional [[Keynesian]] response was to increase government spending, prop up major companies, and lower interest rates.\n\nThe reasoning was that by stimulating the economy and staving off recession, governments could restore confidence while preventing [[pure economic loss|economic loss]]. They pointed out that the U.S. government had pursued expansionary policies, such as lowering interest rates, increasing government spending, and cutting taxes, when the United States itself entered a recession in 2001, and arguably the same in the fiscal and monetary policies during the 2008\u20132009 Global Financial Crisis.\n\nMany commentators in retrospect criticized the IMF for encouraging the developing economies of Asia down the path of \"fast-track capitalism\", meaning liberalization of the financial sector (elimination of restrictions on capital flows), maintenance of high domestic interest rates to attract [[portfolio investment]] and bank capital, and pegging of the national currency to the dollar to reassure foreign investors against currency risk.<ref name=\"waldenbelloimf\">{{Cite news|url = https://focusweb.org/addicted-to-foreign-capital/|title = Addicted to foreign capital|last = Bello|first = Walden|date = 4 December 1997|work= Nation Newspaper|access-date = 22 February 2020|via = Focus on the Global South}}</ref>\n\n===IMF and high interest rates===\nThe conventional high-interest-rate economic wisdom is normally employed by monetary authorities to attain the chain objectives of tightened [[money supply]], discouraged [[currency speculation]], stabilized exchange rate, curbed currency depreciation, and ultimately contained [[inflation]].\n\nIn the Asian meltdown, highest IMF officials rationalized their prescribed high interest rates as follows:\n\nFrom then IMF First Deputy managing director, [[Stanley Fischer]] in 1998:<ref>(Stanley Fischer, \"The IMF and the Asian Crisis,\" Forum Funds Lecture at UCLA, Los Angeles on 20 March 1998)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>When their governments \"approached the IMF, the reserves of Thailand and South Korea were perilously low, and the Indonesian Rupiah was excessively depreciated. Thus, the first order of business was... to restore confidence in the currency. To achieve this, countries have to make it more attractive to hold domestic currency, which in turn, requires increasing interest rates temporarily, even if higher interest costs complicate the situation of weak banks and corporations...\n\nWhy not operate with lower interest rates and a greater devaluation? This is a relevant tradeoff, but there can be no question that the degree of devaluation in the Asian countries is excessive, both from the viewpoint of the individual countries, and from the viewpoint of the international system. Looking first to the individual country, companies with substantial foreign currency debts, as so many companies in these countries have, stood to suffer far more from\u2026 currency (depreciation) than from a temporary rise in domestic interest rates\u2026. Thus, on macroeconomics\u2026 monetary policy has to be kept tight to restore confidence in the currency....</blockquote>\n\nFrom the then IMF managing director [[Michel Camdessus]]:<ref>(\"Doctor Knows Best?\" ''[[Asiaweek]]'', 17 July 1998, p.&nbsp;46)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>To reverse (currency depreciation), countries have to make it more attractive to hold domestic currency, and that means temporarily raising interest rates, even if this (hurts) weak banks and corporations.</blockquote>\n\n==Countries affected==\n===Thailand===\n{{Further|Economy of Thailand}}\n\nFrom 1985 to 1996, [[Thailand]]'s economy grew at an average of over 9% per year, the highest economic growth rate of any country at the time.

On 30 June 1997, Prime Minister [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] said that he would not devalue the baht. However, Thailand lacked the foreign reserves to support the USD\u2013Baht currency peg, and the Thai government was eventually forced to float the Baht, on 2 July 1997, allowing the value of the Baht to be set by the currency market.

Unlike Thailand, Indonesia had low inflation, a [[trade surplus]] of more than $900 million, huge foreign exchange reserves of more than $20 billion, and a good banking sector. But a large number of Indonesian corporations had been borrowing in U.S. dollars. During the preceding years, as the [[rupiah]] had strengthened respective to the dollar, this practice had worked well for these corporations; their effective levels of debt and financing costs had decreased as the local currency's value rose.\n\nIn July 1997, when Thailand floated the baht, Indonesia's monetary authorities widened the rupiah [[currency trading band]] from 8% to 12%. The rupiah suddenly came under severe attack in August. On 14 August 1997, the managed floating exchange regime was replaced by a free-floating exchange rate arrangement. The rupiah dropped further. The IMF came forward with a rescue package of $23 billion, but the rupiah was sinking further amid fears over corporate debts, massive selling of rupiah, and strong demand for dollars. The rupiah and the [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]] touched a historic low in September. [[Moody's]] eventually downgraded Indonesia's long-term debt to \"[[junk bond]]\".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper= Wall Street Journal | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB882840058627490500?mod=googlewsj | title = Japan Stocks Slide Again on Fears About Stability | date = 26 December 1997 | accessdate = 2 September 2009 | first=Anita | last=Raghavan}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the rupiah crisis began in July and August 1997, it intensified in November when the effects of that summer devaluation showed up on corporate balance sheets. Companies that had borrowed in dollars had to face the higher costs imposed upon them by the rupiah's decline, and many reacted by buying dollars through selling rupiah, undermining the value of the latter further. Before the crisis, the exchange rate between the rupiah and the dollar was roughly 2,600 rupiah to 1 U.S. dollar.<ref>[http://www.oanda.com/convert/fxhistory Historical Exchange Rates].

During that time, there was a haste to build great [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] to compete on the world stage. Many businesses ultimately failed to ensure returns and profitability. The [[chaebol]], South Korean conglomerates, simply absorbed more and more capital investment. Eventually, excess debt led to major failures and takeovers.

That contributed to a further decline in South Korean shares since stock markets were already bearish in November. The [[Korea Exchange|Seoul stock exchange]] fell by 4% on 7 November 1997. On 8 November, it plunged by 7%, its biggest one-day drop to that date. And on 24 November, stocks fell a further 7.2% on fears that the IMF would demand tough reforms. In 1998, [[Hyundai Motor Company]] took over Kia Motors. [[Renault Samsung Motors|Samsung Motors]]' $5 billion venture was dissolved due to the crisis, and eventually [[Daewoo]] Motors was sold to the American company [[General Motors]] (GM).\n\nThe [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) provided US$58.4 billion as a bailout package.<ref>Kihwan, Kim.

However, like the chaebol, South Korea's government did not escape unscathed. Its [[national debt]]-to-GDP ratio more than doubled (approximately 13% to 30%) as a result of the crisis.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Further|Economy of the Philippines}}\n{{Unreferenced section|small = y|date=November 2015}}\nIn May 1997, the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], the country's central bank, raised interest rates by 1.75 percentage points and again by 2 points on 19 June. Thailand triggered the crisis on 2 July and on 3 July, the Bangko Sentral intervened to defend the [[Philippine peso|peso]], raising the overnight rate from 15% to 32% at the onset of the Asian crisis in mid-July 1997. The peso dropped from 26 pesos per dollar at the start of the crisis to 46.50 pesos in early 1998 to 53 pesos as in July 2001.\n\nThe Philippine GDP contracted by 0.6% during the worst part of the crisis, but grew by 3% by 2001, despite scandals of the administration of [[Joseph Estrada]] in 2001, most notably the \"jueteng\" scandal, causing the [[PSE Composite Index]], the main index of the Philippine Stock Exchange, to fall to 1,000 points from a high of 3,448 points in 1997. The peso's value declined to around 55.75 pesos to the U.S. dollar. Later that year, Estrada was on the verge of impeachment but his allies in the senate voted against continuing the proceedings.\n\nThis led to popular protests culminating in the \"[[EDSA II Revolution]]\", which effected his resignation and elevated [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to the presidency. Arroyo lessened the crisis in the country. The Philippine peso rose to about 50 pesos by the year's end and traded at around 41 pesos to a dollar in late 2007. The stock market also reached an all-time high in 2007 and the economy was growing by more than 7 percent, its highest in nearly two decades.\n\n===Mainland China===\n{{Further|Economy of China}}\n\n{{Unreferenced section|small = y|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe Chinese currency, the [[renminbi]] (RMB), had been [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] in 1994 to the [[U.S. dollar]] at a ratio of 8.3 RMB to the dollar. Having largely kept itself above the fray throughout 1997\u20131998, there was heavy speculation in the Western press that China would soon be forced to devalue its currency to protect the competitiveness of its exports vis-a-vis those of the [[ASEAN]] nations, whose exports became cheaper relative to China's. However, the RMB's non-[[convertibility]] protected its value from currency speculators, and the decision was made to maintain the peg of the currency, thereby improving the country's standing within Asia. The currency peg was partly scrapped in July 2005, rising 2.3% against the dollar, reflecting pressure from the United States.\n\nUnlike investments of many of the Southeast Asian nations, almost all of China's foreign investment took the form of factories on the ground rather than securities, which insulated the country from rapid [[capital flight]]. While China was unaffected by the crisis compared to Southeast Asia and South Korea, GDP growth slowed sharply in 1998 and 1999, calling attention to structural problems within its economy. In particular, the Asian financial crisis convinced the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] of the need to resolve the issues of its enormous financial weaknesses, such as having too many [[non-performing loans]] within its banking system, and relying heavily on trade with the United States.\n\n===Hong Kong===\n{{Further|Economy of Hong Kong}}\n\n{{Unreferenced section|small = y|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn October 1997, the [[Hong Kong dollar]], which had been pegged at 7.8 to the U.S. dollar since 1983, came under speculative pressure because Hong Kong's inflation rate had been significantly higher than the United States' for years. Monetary authorities spent more than $1 billion to defend the local currency. Since Hong Kong had more than $80 billion in [[foreign reserves]], which is equivalent to 700% of its [[Money supply#Scope|M1]] money supply and 45% of its M3 money supply,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] (effectively the region's central bank) managed to maintain the peg.\n\nStock markets became more and more volatile; between 20 and 23 October the [[Hang Seng Index]] dropped 23%. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority then promised to protect the currency. On 23 October 1997, it raised overnight interest rates from 8% to 23%, and at one point to '280%'.The HKMA had recognized that speculators were taking advantage of the city's unique [[currency-board]] system, in which overnight rates([[HIBOR]]) automatically increase in proportion to large net sales of the local currency. The rate hike, however, increased downward pressure on the stock market, allowing speculators to profit by [[short selling]] shares. The HKMA started buying component shares of the Hang Seng Index in mid-August 1998.\n\nThe HKMA and [[Donald Tsang]], the then Financial Secretary, declared war on speculators. The Government ended up buying approximately HK$120 billion (US$15 billion) worth of shares in various companies,<ref>Bayani Cruz, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=48383&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19980829&sear_year=1998 We will hold on to blue-chip shares: Tsang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016114305/http://thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=48383&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19980829&sear_year=1998 |date=16 October 2007 }}, [[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]], 29 August 1998.</ref> and became the largest shareholder of some of those companies (e.g., the government owned 10% of [[HSBC]]) at the end of August, when hostilities ended with the closing of the August Hang Seng Index futures contract. In 1999, the Government started selling those shares by launching the [[Tracker Fund of Hong Kong]], making a profit of about HK$30 billion (US$4 billion).\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{Further|Economy of Malaysia}}\n\nIn July 1997, within days of the [[Thai baht]] devaluation, the Malaysian [[ringgit]] was heavily traded by speculators. The overnight rate jumped from under 8% to over 40%. This led to rating downgrades and a general sell off on the stock and currency markets. By end of 1997, ratings had fallen many notches from investment grade to [[junk bond|junk]], the KLSE had lost more than 50% from above 1,200 to under 600, and the ringgit had lost 50% of its value, falling from above 2.50 to under 4.57 on (23 January 1998) to the dollar. The then prime minister, [[Mahathir Mohamad]] imposed strict capital controls and introduced a 3.80 peg against the U.S. dollar.\n\nMalaysian moves involved fixing the local currency to the U.S. dollar, stopping the overseas trade in ringgit currency and other ringgit assets therefore making offshore use of the ringgit invalid, restricting the amount of currency and investments that residents can take abroad, and imposed for foreign portfolio funds, a minimum one-year \"stay period\" which since has been converted to an exit tax. The decision to make ringgit held abroad invalid has also dried up sources of ringgit held abroad that speculators borrow from to manipulate the ringgit, for example by \"[[selling short]]\". Those who did, had to repurchase the limited ringgit at higher prices, making it unattractive to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.henciclopedia.org.uy/autores/Khor/Malaysia.htm|title = Capital Controls in Malaysia|accessdate = 16 November 2015|website= Henciclopedia|last = Khor|first = Martin}}</ref> It also fully suspended the trading of CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) counters, indefinitely freezing approximately $4.47 billion worth of shares and affecting 172,000 investors, most of them Singaporeans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/BI02Ae05.html|title=INVESTMENT IN MALAYSIA|work=Asia Times|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/business/international-business-malaysia-extends-deadline-in-singapore-exchange-dispute.html|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Malaysia Extends Deadline in Singapore Exchange Dispute|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=1 January 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/221572|title=Malaysia's stockmarket; Daylight Robbery|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=10 July 1999}}</ref> which became a political issue between the two countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/intelligence/9910/26/|title=The CLOB Revisted|publisher=CNN|accessdate=23 July 2015|date=26 October 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the output of the real economy declined plunging the country into its first recession for many years. The construction sector contracted 23.5%, manufacturing shrunk 9% and the agriculture sector 5.9%. Overall, the country's gross domestic product plunged 6.2% in 1998. During that year, the ringgit plunged below 4.7 and the KLSE fell below 270 points. In September that year, various defensive measures were announced to overcome the crisis.\n\nThe principal measure taken were to move the ringgit from a free float to a fixed exchange rate regime. [[Bank Negara]] fixed the ringgit at 3.8 to the dollar. Capital controls were imposed while aid offered from the IMF was refused. Various task force agencies were formed. The Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee dealt with corporate loans. [[Danaharta]] discounted and bought bad loans from banks to facilitate orderly asset realization. [[Danamodal]] recapitalized banks.\n\nGrowth then settled at a slower but more sustainable pace. The massive current account deficit became a fairly substantial surplus. Banks were better capitalized and NPLs were realised in an orderly way. Small banks were bought out by strong ones. A large number of PLCs were unable to regulate their financial affairs and were delisted. Compared to the 1997 current account, by 2005, Malaysia was estimated to have a $14.06 billion surplus.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/my.html|title = The World Factbook - Malaysia|accessdate = 16 November 2015|website= CIA Factbook|publisher= The United States|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613005830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/my.html|archivedate = 13 June 2007}}</ref> Asset values however, have not returned to their pre-crisis highs.

[[Economic growth]] picked up in 1997\u201399 after stalling in 1996 due to a series of [[natural disaster]]s and increases in world prices of [[copper]] and cashmere. Public revenues and exports collapsed in 1998 and 1999 due to the repercussions of the [[Asian financial crisis]]. In August and September 1999, the economy suffered from a temporary Russian ban on exports of oil and oil products. Mongolia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1997. The international donor community pledged over $300 million per year at the last Consultative Group Meeting, held in [[Ulaanbaatar]] in June 1999.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{Further|Economy of Singapore}}\n\nAs the financial crisis [[financial contagion|spread]] the economy of [[Singapore]] dipped into a short [[recession]]. The short duration and milder effect on its economy was credited to the active management by the government. For example, the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] allowed for a gradual 20% depreciation of the [[Singapore dollar]] to cushion and guide the economy to a soft landing. The timing of government programs such as the Interim Upgrading Program and other construction related projects were brought forward.<ref name=\"Ngian Kee Jin: p. 12\">Ngian Kee Jin: p. 12</ref>\n\nInstead of allowing the labor markets to work, the National Wage Council pre-emptively agreed to [[Central Provident Fund]] cuts to lower labor costs, with limited impact on [[disposable income]] and local demand. Unlike in Hong Kong, no attempt was made to directly intervene in the [[capital market]]s and the [[Straits Times Index|''Straits Times'' Index]] was allowed to drop 60%. In less than a year, the Singaporean economy fully recovered and continued on its growth trajectory.<ref name=\"Ngian Kee Jin: p. 12\"/>\n\n===United States and Japan===\n{{Further|Economy of the United States|Economy of Japan}}\n\nThe \"Asian flu\" had also put pressure on the United States and Japan. Their markets did not collapse, but they were severely hit. On 27 October 1997, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones industrial]] plunged 554 points or 7.2%, amid ongoing worries about the [[Economy of Asia|Asian economies]]. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] briefly suspended trading. The crisis led to a drop in [[consumer confidence|consumer]] and spending confidence (see 27 October 1997 [[October 27, 1997, mini-crash|mini-crash]]). Indirect effects included the [[dot-com bubble]], and years later the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].<ref name=\"Pettis: pp. 55\u201360\">Pettis: pp. 55\u201360</ref>\n\nJapan was affected because its economy is prominent in the region. Asian countries usually run a [[trade deficit]] with Japan because the latter's economy was more than twice the size of the rest of Asia together; about 40% of Japan's exports go to Asia. The [[Japanese yen]] fell to 147 as mass selling began, but Japan was the world's largest holder of currency reserves at the time, so it was easily defended, and quickly bounced back. The real GDP growth rate slowed dramatically in 1997, from 5% to 1.6%, and even sank into recession in 1998 due to intense competition from cheapened rivals. The Asian financial crisis also led to more bankruptcies in Japan. In addition, with South Korea's devalued currency, and China's steady gains, many companies complained outright that they could not compete.<ref name=\"Pettis: pp. 55\u201360\"/>\n\nAnother longer-term result was the changing relationship between the United States and Japan, with the United States no longer openly supporting the highly artificial trade environment and exchange rates that governed economic relations between the two countries for almost five decades after [[World War II]].<ref>Pettis: p. 79</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\n===Asia===\nThe crisis had significant [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]]-level effects, including sharp reductions in values of currencies, [[stock market]]s, and other asset prices of several [[Asian countries]].<ref>Tiwari: pp. 1\u20133</ref> The nominal U.S. dollar GDP of ASEAN fell by $9.2 billion in 1997 and $218.2 billion (31.7%) in 1998.

This created grave doubts on the credibility of IMF and the validity of its high-interest-rate prescription to economic crisis.\n\nThe economic crisis also led to a political upheaval, most notably culminating in the resignations of President [[Suharto]] in Indonesia and Prime Minister General [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] in Thailand. There was a general rise in [[anti-Western sentiment]], with [[George Soros]] and the IMF in particular singled out as targets of criticisms. Heavy U.S. investment in Thailand ended, replaced by mostly European investment, though Japanese investment was sustained. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} [[Islam]]ic and other separatist movements intensified in Southeast Asia as central authorities weakened.<ref>Radelet: pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\nNew regulations weakened the influence of the [[bamboo network]], a network of [[overseas Chinese]] family-owned businesses that dominate the private sector of Southeast Asia.

The changing economic situation in Vietnam: A product of the Asian crisis?</ref>\n\nThe crisis has been intensively analyzed by economists for its breadth, speed, and dynamism; it affected dozens of countries, had a direct impact on the livelihood of millions, happened within the course of a mere few months, and at each stage of the crisis leading economists, in particular the international institutions, seemed a step behind. Perhaps more interesting to economists was the speed with which it ended, leaving most of the developed economies unharmed. These curiosities have prompted an explosion of literature about [[financial economics]] and a litany of explanations why the crisis occurred. A number of critiques have been leveled against the conduct of the IMF in the crisis, including one by former World Bank economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]]. Politically there were some benefits. In several countries, particularly South Korea and Indonesia, there was renewed push for improved [[corporate governance]]. Rampaging inflation weakened the authority of the Suharto regime and led to its toppling in 1998, as well as accelerating [[East Timor]]'s independence.<ref>Weisbrot: p. 6</ref>\n\nIt is believed that 10,400 people committed suicide in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea as a result of the crisis.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Asia learned from its financial crisis 20 years ago|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21724402-and-it-enough-protect-it-future-disasters-what-asia-learned-its|accessdate=30 June 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Outside Asia===\n{{see also|Impeachment of Bill Clinton}}\n{{see also|September 11 attacks}}\n{{see also|Economic effects of the September 11 attacks}}\nAfter the Asian crisis, international investors were reluctant to lend to developing countries, leading to economic slowdowns in developing countries in many parts of the world. The powerful negative shock also sharply reduced the price of oil, which reached a low of about $11 per barrel towards the end of 1998, causing a financial pinch in [[OPEC]] nations and other oil exporters. In response to a severe fall in [[oil prices]], the [[supermajor]]s that emerged in the late-1990s, undertook some [[Supermajor#History|major mergers and acquisitions]] between 1998 and 2002 \u2013 often in an effort to improve [[economies of scale]], hedge against oil [[volatility (finance)|price volatility]], and reduce large cash reserves through reinvestment.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec98/oil_12-1.html\n|title=Slick Deal?\n|publisher=[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]\n|date=1 December 1998\n|accessdate=20 August 2007}}\n</ref>\n\nThe reduction in oil revenue also contributed to the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], which in turn caused [[Long-Term Capital Management]] in the United States to collapse after losing $4.6 billion in 4 months. A wider collapse in the financial markets was avoided when [[Alan Greenspan]] and the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] organized a $3.625 billion [[bailout]]. Major [[emerging economies]] [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] also fell into crisis in the late 1990s (see [[Argentine economic crisis|Argentine debt crisis]]). The [[September 11 attacks]] contributed to major shockwave in developed and developing economies (see [[Stock market downturn of 2002]])<ref>''The Crash'' transcript. [[PBS Frontline]].</ref>\n\nThe crisis in general was part of a global backlash against the [[Washington Consensus]] and institutions such as the IMF and [[World Bank]], which simultaneously became unpopular in developed countries following the rise of the [[anti-globalization movement]] in 1999. Four major rounds of world trade talks since the crisis, in [[Seattle]], [[Doha]], [[Canc\u00fan]], and Hong Kong, have failed to produce a significant agreement as developing countries have become more assertive, and nations are increasingly turning toward regional or bilateral [[free trade agreement]]s (FTAs) as an alternative to global institutions.\n\nMany nations learned from this, and quickly built up [[foreign exchange reserve]]s as a hedge against attacks, including Japan, China, South Korea. Pan Asian [[currency swap]]<nowiki/>s were introduced in the event of another crisis. However, nations such as Brazil, Russia, and India as well as most of East Asia began copying the Japanese model of weakening their currencies, and restructuring their economies so as to create a [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] surplus to build large [[foreign currency reserves]]. This has led to ever-increasing funding for U.S. [[treasury bonds]], allowing or aiding housing (in 2001\u20132005) and stock asset bubbles (in 1996\u20132000) to develop in the United States.\n\n==See also==\n* [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], partly connected to the 1997 Asian financial crisis\n* [[Bamboo network]]\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[1990s Chinese bank restructurings]]\n* [[Financial contagion]]\n* [[Liquidity crisis]]\n* [[Stock disasters in Hong Kong]]\n\n==References==\n;Books\n* {{cite book|last=Allen|first=Larry|title=The Encyclopedia of Money|year=2009|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|edition=2nd|place=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara, CA]]|pages=125\u2013127|isbn=978-1598842517}}\n* {{Cite book | last =Blustein | first =Paul | title =The Chastening: Inside the Crisis that Rocked the Global Financial System and Humbled the IMF | publisher =[[PublicAffairs]] | year =2001 | url =https://archive.org/details/chasteninginside00blus | isbn =978-1-891620-81-2 | url-access =registration }}\n* Delhaise Philippe F.

[[Capital flight]] ensued almost immediately, beginning an international chain reaction.

The efforts to stem a global economic crisis did little to stabilize the domestic situation in Indonesia, however. After 30 years in power, Indonesian President [[Suharto]] was [[Fall of Suharto|forced to step down]] on 21 May 1998 in the wake of widespread rioting that followed sharp price increases caused by a drastic devaluation of the [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]]. The effects of the crisis lingered through 1998. In 1998, growth in the Philippines dropped to virtually zero. Only Singapore and Taiwan proved relatively insulated from the shock, but both suffered serious hits in passing, the former due to its size and geographical location between Malaysia and Indonesia.

As a result, the region's economies received a large inflow of money and experienced a dramatic run-up in asset prices. At the same time, the regional economies of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and South Korea experienced high growth rates, of 8\u201312% GDP, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This achievement was widely acclaimed by financial institutions including IMF and [[World Bank]], and was known as part of the \"[[Four Asian Tigers|Asian economic miracle]]\".\n\n==Credit bubbles and fixed currency exchange rates==\nThe cause of the debacle are many and disputed. Thailand's economy developed into an [[economic bubble]] fueled by [[hot money]]. More and more was required as the size of the bubble grew. The same type of situation happened in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], which had the added complication of what was called \"[[crony capitalism]]\".<ref>Hughes, Helen.

The [[devaluation]] of the Chinese [[renminbi]], and the Japanese [[yen]] due to the [[Plaza Accord]] of 1985, the raising of U.S. interest rates which led to a strong U.S. dollar, and the sharp decline in semiconductor prices, all adversely affected their growth.<ref>[http://www.frbsf.org/econrsrch/wklyltr/wklyltr98/el98-24.html FRBSF Economic Letter : What Caused East Asia's Financial Crisis?] 7 August 1998</ref> As the [[U.S. economy]] recovered from a recession in the early 1990s, the [[U.S. Federal Reserve Bank]] under [[Alan Greenspan]] began to raise U.S. interest rates to head off inflation.\n\nThis made the United States a more attractive investment destination relative to Southeast Asia, which had been attracting hot money flows through high short-term interest rates, and raised the value of the U.S. dollar. For the Southeast Asian nations which had currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, the higher U.S. dollar caused their own exports to become more expensive and less competitive in the global markets. At the same time, Southeast Asia's export growth slowed dramatically in the spring of 1996, deteriorating their current account position.\n\nSome economists have advanced the growing exports of China as a factor contributing to ASEAN nations' export growth slowdown, though these economists maintain the main cause of their crises was excessive real estate speculation.<ref>[https://www.newschool.edu/scepa/publications/workingpapers/archive/cepa0318.pdf The Three Routes to Financial Crises: The Need for Capital Controls] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117144558/https://www.newschool.edu/scepa/publications/workingpapers/archive/cepa0318.pdf |date=17 November 2015 }}.

The resulting large quantities of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] that became available generated a highly [[leverage (finance)|leveraged]] economic climate, and pushed up asset prices to an unsustainable level.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/FIRESALE.htm FIRE-SALE FDI] by [[Paul Krugman]].</ref> These asset prices eventually began to collapse, causing individuals and companies to [[Default (finance)|default]] on debt obligations.\n\n==Panic among lenders and withdrawal of credit==\nThe resulting panic among lenders led to a large withdrawal of credit from the crisis countries, causing a [[credit crunch]] and further bankruptcies. In addition, as foreign investors attempted to withdraw their money, the [[Foreign exchange market|exchange market]] was flooded with the currencies of the crisis countries, putting [[Depreciation (currency)|depreciative]] pressure on their exchange rates. To prevent currency values collapsing, these countries' governments raised domestic interest rates to exceedingly high levels (to help diminish [[Capital flight|flight of capital]] by making lending more attractive to investors) and intervened in the exchange market, buying up any excess domestic currency at the [[fixed exchange rate]] with [[foreign reserves]]. Neither of these policy responses could be sustained for long.\n\nVery high interest rates, which can be extremely damaging to a healthy economy, wreaked further havoc on economies in an already fragile state, while the central banks were hemorrhaging foreign reserves, of which they had finite amounts. When it became clear that the tide of capital fleeing these countries was not to be stopped, the authorities ceased defending their fixed exchange rates and allowed their currencies to [[Floating exchange rate|float]]. The resulting depreciated value of those currencies meant that foreign currency-denominated [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]] grew substantially in domestic currency terms, causing more bankruptcies and further deepening the crisis.\n\nOther economists, including [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]], have downplayed the role of the real economy in the crisis compared to the financial markets. The rapidity with which the crisis happened has prompted Sachs and others to compare it to a classic [[bank run]] prompted by a sudden risk shock. Sachs pointed to strict monetary and contractionary fiscal policies implemented by the governments on the advice of the IMF in the wake of the crisis, while [[Frederic Mishkin]] points to the role of [[asymmetric information]] in the financial markets that led to a \"[[herd mentality]]\" among investors that magnified a small risk in the real economy. The crisis has thus attracted interest from [[behavioral economics|behavioral economists]] interested in [[market psychology]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Goel|first=Suresh|title=Crisis management : master the skills to prevent disasters|year=2009|publisher=Global India Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9789380228082|page=101}}</ref>\n\nAnother possible cause of the sudden risk shock may also be attributable to the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong sovereignty on 1 July 1997]]. During the 1990s, hot money flew into the Southeast Asia region through [[financial hub]]s, especially Hong Kong. The investors were often ignorant of the actual fundamentals or risk profiles of the respective economies, and once the crisis gripped the region, the political uncertainty regarding the future of Hong Kong as an Asian financial centre led some investors to withdraw from Asia altogether.

The SAPs called on crisis-struck nations to reduce government spending and deficits, allow [[insolvency|insolvent]] banks and financial institutions to fail, and aggressively raise interest rates. The reasoning was that these steps would restore confidence in the nations' fiscal [[solvency]], penalize insolvent companies, and protect currency values. Above all, it was stipulated that IMF-funded capital had to be administered rationally in the future, with no favored parties receiving funds by preference. In at least one of the affected countries the restrictions on foreign ownership were greatly reduced.<ref>{{citation|last=Woo-Cumings|first=Meredith|authorlink=Meredith Jung-En Woo|title=South Korean Anti-Americanism|journal=Working Paper No. 93|date=July 2003|url=http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp93.html}} Korea:\"[T]he ceiling on foreign ownership of publicly traded companies was raised to 50 percent from 26 percent; and the ceiling on individual foreign ownership went up from 7 percent to 50 percent.\"</ref>\n\nThere were to be adequate government controls set up to supervise all financial activities, ones that were to be independent, in theory, of private interest.

The dynamics of the situation were similar to that of the [[Latin American debt crisis]]. The effects of the SAPs were mixed and their impact controversial. Critics, however, noted the contractionary nature of these policies, arguing that in a [[recession]], the traditional [[Keynesian]] response was to increase government spending, prop up major companies, and lower interest rates.\n\nThe reasoning was that by stimulating the economy and staving off recession, governments could restore confidence while preventing [[pure economic loss|economic loss]].

Thus, the first order of business was... to restore confidence in the currency. To achieve this, countries have to make it more attractive to hold domestic currency, which in turn, requires increasing interest rates temporarily, even if higher interest costs complicate the situation of weak banks and corporations...\n\nWhy not operate with lower interest rates and a greater devaluation? This is a relevant tradeoff, but there can be no question that the degree of devaluation in the Asian countries is excessive, both from the viewpoint of the individual countries, and from the viewpoint of the international system. Looking first to the individual country, companies with substantial foreign currency debts, as so many companies in these countries have, stood to suffer far more from\u2026 currency (depreciation) than from a temporary rise in domestic interest rates\u2026. Thus, on macroeconomics\u2026 monetary policy has to be kept tight to restore confidence in the currency....</blockquote>\n\nFrom the then IMF managing director [[Michel Camdessus]]:<ref>(\"Doctor Knows Best?\" ''[[Asiaweek]]'', 17 July 1998, p.&nbsp;46)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>To reverse (currency depreciation), countries have to make it more attractive to hold domestic currency, and that means temporarily raising interest rates, even if this (hurts) weak banks and corporations.</blockquote>\n\n==Countries affected==\n===Thailand===\n{{Further|Economy of Thailand}}\n\nFrom 1985 to 1996, [[Thailand]]'s economy grew at an average of over 9% per year, the highest economic growth rate of any country at the time.

The rupiah suddenly came under severe attack in August. On 14 August 1997, the managed floating exchange regime was replaced by a free-floating exchange rate arrangement. The rupiah dropped further. The IMF came forward with a rescue package of $23 billion, but the rupiah was sinking further amid fears over corporate debts, massive selling of rupiah, and strong demand for dollars.

The [[chaebol]], South Korean conglomerates, simply absorbed more and more capital investment. Eventually, excess debt led to major failures and takeovers. The [[Hanbo scandal]] of early 1997 exposed South Koreas economic weaknesses and corruption problems to the international financial community.<ref name=\":1hanbo\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB856112251674048000|title=Hanbo Scandal Highlights Failings of Kim's Crusade|last=Journal|first=Michael SchumanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street|work=WSJ|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\"Quah2011\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qV6un8vKNUC&pg=PA307|title=Curbing Corruption in Asian Countries: An Impossible Dream?|author=Jon S.

That contributed to a further decline in South Korean shares since stock markets were already bearish in November. The [[Korea Exchange|Seoul stock exchange]] fell by 4% on 7 November 1997. On 8 November, it plunged by 7%, its biggest one-day drop to that date. And on 24 November, stocks fell a further 7.2% on fears that the IMF would demand tough reforms. In 1998, [[Hyundai Motor Company]] took over Kia Motors. [[Renault Samsung Motors|Samsung Motors]]' $5 billion venture was dissolved due to the crisis, and eventually [[Daewoo]] Motors was sold to the American company [[General Motors]] (GM).\n\nThe [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) provided US$58.4 billion as a bailout package.<ref>Kihwan, Kim.

Examples include New Bridge Capital's takeover of Korea First Bank.\n\nThe [[South Korean won]], meanwhile, weakened to more than 1,700 per U.S. dollar from around 800, but later managed to recover. However, like the chaebol, South Korea's government did not escape unscathed. Its [[national debt]]-to-GDP ratio more than doubled (approximately 13% to 30%) as a result of the crisis.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Further|Economy of the Philippines}}\n{{Unreferenced section|small = y|date=November 2015}}\nIn May 1997, the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], the country's central bank, raised interest rates by 1.75 percentage points and again by 2 points on 19 June. Thailand triggered the crisis on 2 July and on 3 July, the Bangko Sentral intervened to defend the [[Philippine peso|peso]], raising the overnight rate from 15% to 32% at the onset of the Asian crisis in mid-July 1997. The peso dropped from 26 pesos per dollar at the start of the crisis to 46.50 pesos in early 1998 to 53 pesos as in July 2001.\n\nThe Philippine GDP contracted by 0.6% during the worst part of the crisis, but grew by 3% by 2001, despite scandals of the administration of [[Joseph Estrada]] in 2001, most notably the \"jueteng\" scandal, causing the [[PSE Composite Index]], the main index of the Philippine Stock Exchange, to fall to 1,000 points from a high of 3,448 points in 1997. The peso's value declined to around 55.75 pesos to the U.S. dollar. Later that year, Estrada was on the verge of impeachment but his allies in the senate voted against continuing the proceedings.\n\nThis led to popular protests culminating in the \"[[EDSA II Revolution]]\", which effected his resignation and elevated [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to the presidency. Arroyo lessened the crisis in the country. The Philippine peso rose to about 50 pesos by the year's end and traded at around 41 pesos to a dollar in late 2007. The stock market also reached an all-time high in 2007 and the economy was growing by more than 7 percent, its highest in nearly two decades.\n\n===Mainland China===\n{{Further|Economy of China}}\n\n{{Unreferenced section|small = y|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe Chinese currency, the [[renminbi]] (RMB), had been [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] in 1994 to the [[U.S. dollar]] at a ratio of 8.3 RMB to the dollar. Having largely kept itself above the fray throughout 1997\u20131998, there was heavy speculation in the Western press that China would soon be forced to devalue its currency to protect the competitiveness of its exports vis-a-vis those of the [[ASEAN]] nations, whose exports became cheaper relative to China's. However, the RMB's non-[[convertibility]] protected its value from currency speculators, and the decision was made to maintain the peg of the currency, thereby improving the country's standing within Asia. The currency peg was partly scrapped in July 2005, rising 2.3% against the dollar, reflecting pressure from the United States.\n\nUnlike investments of many of the Southeast Asian nations, almost all of China's foreign investment took the form of factories on the ground rather than securities, which insulated the country from rapid [[capital flight]]. While China was unaffected by the crisis compared to Southeast Asia and South Korea, GDP growth slowed sharply in 1998 and 1999, calling attention to structural problems within its economy. In particular, the Asian financial crisis convinced the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] of the need to resolve the issues of its enormous financial weaknesses, such as having too many [[non-performing loans]] within its banking system, and relying heavily on trade with the United States.\n\n===Hong Kong===\n{{Further|Economy of Hong Kong}}\n\n{{Unreferenced section|small = y|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn October 1997, the [[Hong Kong dollar]], which had been pegged at 7.8 to the U.S. dollar since 1983, came under speculative pressure because Hong Kong's inflation rate had been significantly higher than the United States' for years. Monetary authorities spent more than $1 billion to defend the local currency. Since Hong Kong had more than $80 billion in [[foreign reserves]], which is equivalent to 700% of its [[Money supply#Scope|M1]] money supply and 45% of its M3 money supply,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] (effectively the region's central bank) managed to maintain the peg.\n\nStock markets became more and more volatile; between 20 and 23 October the [[Hang Seng Index]] dropped 23%. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority then promised to protect the currency. On 23 October 1997, it raised overnight interest rates from 8% to 23%, and at one point to '280%'.The HKMA had recognized that speculators were taking advantage of the city's unique [[currency-board]] system, in which overnight rates([[HIBOR]]) automatically increase in proportion to large net sales of the local currency. The rate hike, however, increased downward pressure on the stock market, allowing speculators to profit by [[short selling]] shares. The HKMA started buying component shares of the Hang Seng Index in mid-August 1998.\n\nThe HKMA and [[Donald Tsang]], the then Financial Secretary, declared war on speculators. The Government ended up buying approximately HK$120 billion (US$15 billion) worth of shares in various companies,<ref>Bayani Cruz, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=48383&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19980829&sear_year=1998 We will hold on to blue-chip shares: Tsang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016114305/http://thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=48383&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19980829&sear_year=1998 |date=16 October 2007 }}, [[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]], 29 August 1998.</ref> and became the largest shareholder of some of those companies (e.g., the government owned 10% of [[HSBC]]) at the end of August, when hostilities ended with the closing of the August Hang Seng Index futures contract. In 1999, the Government started selling those shares by launching the [[Tracker Fund of Hong Kong]], making a profit of about HK$30 billion (US$4 billion).\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{Further|Economy of Malaysia}}\n\nIn July 1997, within days of the [[Thai baht]] devaluation, the Malaysian [[ringgit]] was heavily traded by speculators. The overnight rate jumped from under 8% to over 40%. This led to rating downgrades and a general sell off on the stock and currency markets. By end of 1997, ratings had fallen many notches from investment grade to [[junk bond|junk]], the KLSE had lost more than 50% from above 1,200 to under 600, and the ringgit had lost 50% of its value, falling from above 2.50 to under 4.57 on (23 January 1998) to the dollar. The then prime minister, [[Mahathir Mohamad]] imposed strict capital controls and introduced a 3.80 peg against the U.S. dollar.\n\nMalaysian moves involved fixing the local currency to the U.S. dollar, stopping the overseas trade in ringgit currency and other ringgit assets therefore making offshore use of the ringgit invalid, restricting the amount of currency and investments that residents can take abroad, and imposed for foreign portfolio funds, a minimum one-year \"stay period\" which since has been converted to an exit tax. The decision to make ringgit held abroad invalid has also dried up sources of ringgit held abroad that speculators borrow from to manipulate the ringgit, for example by \"[[selling short]]\". Those who did, had to repurchase the limited ringgit at higher prices, making it unattractive to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.henciclopedia.org.uy/autores/Khor/Malaysia.htm|title = Capital Controls in Malaysia|accessdate = 16 November 2015|website= Henciclopedia|last = Khor|first = Martin}}</ref> It also fully suspended the trading of CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) counters, indefinitely freezing approximately $4.47 billion worth of shares and affecting 172,000 investors, most of them Singaporeans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/BI02Ae05.html|title=INVESTMENT IN MALAYSIA|work=Asia Times|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/business/international-business-malaysia-extends-deadline-in-singapore-exchange-dispute.html|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Malaysia Extends Deadline in Singapore Exchange Dispute|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=1 January 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/221572|title=Malaysia's stockmarket; Daylight Robbery|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=10 July 1999}}</ref> which became a political issue between the two countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/intelligence/9910/26/|title=The CLOB Revisted|publisher=CNN|accessdate=23 July 2015|date=26 October 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the output of the real economy declined plunging the country into its first recession for many years. The construction sector contracted 23.5%, manufacturing shrunk 9% and the agriculture sector 5.9%. Overall, the country's gross domestic product plunged 6.2% in 1998. During that year, the ringgit plunged below 4.7 and the KLSE fell below 270 points. In September that year, various defensive measures were announced to overcome the crisis.\n\nThe principal measure taken were to move the ringgit from a free float to a fixed exchange rate regime. [[Bank Negara]] fixed the ringgit at 3.8 to the dollar. Capital controls were imposed while aid offered from the IMF was refused. Various task force agencies were formed. The Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee dealt with corporate loans. [[Danaharta]] discounted and bought bad loans from banks to facilitate orderly asset realization. [[Danamodal]] recapitalized banks.\n\nGrowth then settled at a slower but more sustainable pace. The massive current account deficit became a fairly substantial surplus. Banks were better capitalized and NPLs were realised in an orderly way. Small banks were bought out by strong ones. A large number of PLCs were unable to regulate their financial affairs and were delisted. Compared to the 1997 current account, by 2005, Malaysia was estimated to have a $14.06 billion surplus.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/my.html|title = The World Factbook - Malaysia|accessdate = 16 November 2015|website= CIA Factbook|publisher= The United States|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613005830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/my.html|archivedate = 13 June 2007}}</ref> Asset values however, have not returned to their pre-crisis highs.

But unlike the pre-crisis days, it did not appear to be a free float, but a managed float, like the [[Singapore dollar]].\n\n===Mongolia===\n{{Further|Economy of Mongolia}}\n\nMongolia was adversely affected by the ''Asian financial crisis'' of 1997-98 and suffered a further loss of income as a result of the Russian crisis in 1999. [[Economic growth]] picked up in 1997\u201399 after stalling in 1996 due to a series of [[natural disaster]]s and increases in world prices of [[copper]] and cashmere. Public revenues and exports collapsed in 1998 and 1999 due to the repercussions of the [[Asian financial crisis]]. In August and September 1999, the economy suffered from a temporary Russian ban on exports of oil and oil products. Mongolia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1997. The international donor community pledged over $300 million per year at the last Consultative Group Meeting, held in [[Ulaanbaatar]] in June 1999.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{Further|Economy of Singapore}}\n\nAs the financial crisis [[financial contagion|spread]] the economy of [[Singapore]] dipped into a short [[recession]]. The short duration and milder effect on its economy was credited to the active management by the government. For example, the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] allowed for a gradual 20% depreciation of the [[Singapore dollar]] to cushion and guide the economy to a soft landing. The timing of government programs such as the Interim Upgrading Program and other construction related projects were brought forward.<ref name=\"Ngian Kee Jin: p. 12\">Ngian Kee Jin: p. 12</ref>\n\nInstead of allowing the labor markets to work, the National Wage Council pre-emptively agreed to [[Central Provident Fund]] cuts to lower labor costs, with limited impact on [[disposable income]] and local demand. Unlike in Hong Kong, no attempt was made to directly intervene in the [[capital market]]s and the [[Straits Times Index|''Straits Times'' Index]] was allowed to drop 60%. In less than a year, the Singaporean economy fully recovered and continued on its growth trajectory.<ref name=\"Ngian Kee Jin: p. 12\"/>\n\n===United States and Japan===\n{{Further|Economy of the United States|Economy of Japan}}\n\nThe \"Asian flu\" had also put pressure on the United States and Japan. Their markets did not collapse, but they were severely hit. On 27 October 1997, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones industrial]] plunged 554 points or 7.2%, amid ongoing worries about the [[Economy of Asia|Asian economies]]. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] briefly suspended trading. The crisis led to a drop in [[consumer confidence|consumer]] and spending confidence (see 27 October 1997 [[October 27, 1997, mini-crash|mini-crash]]). Indirect effects included the [[dot-com bubble]], and years later the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].<ref name=\"Pettis: pp. 55\u201360\">Pettis: pp. 55\u201360</ref>\n\nJapan was affected because its economy is prominent in the region. Asian countries usually run a [[trade deficit]] with Japan because the latter's economy was more than twice the size of the rest of Asia together; about 40% of Japan's exports go to Asia. The [[Japanese yen]] fell to 147 as mass selling began, but Japan was the world's largest holder of currency reserves at the time, so it was easily defended, and quickly bounced back. The real GDP growth rate slowed dramatically in 1997, from 5% to 1.6%, and even sank into recession in 1998 due to intense competition from cheapened rivals. The Asian financial crisis also led to more bankruptcies in Japan. In addition, with South Korea's devalued currency, and China's steady gains, many companies complained outright that they could not compete.<ref name=\"Pettis: pp. 55\u201360\"/>\n\nAnother longer-term result was the changing relationship between the United States and Japan, with the United States no longer openly supporting the highly artificial trade environment and exchange rates that governed economic relations between the two countries for almost five decades after [[World War II]].<ref>Pettis: p. 79</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\n===Asia===\nThe crisis had significant [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]]-level effects, including sharp reductions in values of currencies, [[stock market]]s, and other asset prices of several [[Asian countries]].<ref>Tiwari: pp. 1\u20133</ref> The nominal U.S. dollar GDP of ASEAN fell by $9.2 billion in 1997 and $218.2 billion (31.7%) in 1998.

This created grave doubts on the credibility of IMF and the validity of its high-interest-rate prescription to economic crisis.\n\nThe economic crisis also led to a political upheaval, most notably culminating in the resignations of President [[Suharto]] in Indonesia and Prime Minister General [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] in Thailand. There was a general rise in [[anti-Western sentiment]], with [[George Soros]] and the IMF in particular singled out as targets of criticisms. Heavy U.S. investment in Thailand ended, replaced by mostly European investment, though Japanese investment was sustained. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} [[Islam]]ic and other separatist movements intensified in Southeast Asia as central authorities weakened.<ref>Radelet: pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\nNew regulations weakened the influence of the [[bamboo network]], a network of [[overseas Chinese]] family-owned businesses that dominate the private sector of Southeast Asia.

Perhaps more interesting to economists was the speed with which it ended, leaving most of the developed economies unharmed. These curiosities have prompted an explosion of literature about [[financial economics]] and a litany of explanations why the crisis occurred. A number of critiques have been leveled against the conduct of the IMF in the crisis, including one by former World Bank economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]]. Politically there were some benefits. In several countries, particularly South Korea and Indonesia, there was renewed push for improved [[corporate governance]]. Rampaging inflation weakened the authority of the Suharto regime and led to its toppling in 1998, as well as accelerating [[East Timor]]'s independence.<ref>Weisbrot: p. 6</ref>\n\nIt is believed that 10,400 people committed suicide in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea as a result of the crisis.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Asia learned from its financial crisis 20 years ago|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21724402-and-it-enough-protect-it-future-disasters-what-asia-learned-its|accessdate=30 June 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Outside Asia===\n{{see also|Impeachment of Bill Clinton}}\n{{see also|September 11 attacks}}\n{{see also|Economic effects of the September 11 attacks}}\nAfter the Asian crisis, international investors were reluctant to lend to developing countries, leading to economic slowdowns in developing countries in many parts of the world. The powerful negative shock also sharply reduced the price of oil, which reached a low of about $11 per barrel towards the end of 1998, causing a financial pinch in [[OPEC]] nations and other oil exporters. In response to a severe fall in [[oil prices]], the [[supermajor]]s that emerged in the late-1990s, undertook some [[Supermajor#History|major mergers and acquisitions]] between 1998 and 2002 \u2013 often in an effort to improve [[economies of scale]], hedge against oil [[volatility (finance)|price volatility]], and reduce large cash reserves through reinvestment.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec98/oil_12-1.html\n|title=Slick Deal?\n|publisher=[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]\n|date=1 December 1998\n|accessdate=20 August 2007}}\n</ref>\n\nThe reduction in oil revenue also contributed to the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], which in turn caused [[Long-Term Capital Management]] in the United States to collapse after losing $4.6 billion in 4 months. A wider collapse in the financial markets was avoided when [[Alan Greenspan]] and the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] organized a $3.625 billion [[bailout]]. Major [[emerging economies]] [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] also fell into crisis in the late 1990s (see [[Argentine economic crisis|Argentine debt crisis]]).

[[PBS Frontline]].</ref>\n\nThe crisis in general was part of a global backlash against the [[Washington Consensus]] and institutions such as the IMF and [[World Bank]], which simultaneously became unpopular in developed countries following the rise of the [[anti-globalization movement]] in 1999. Four major rounds of world trade talks since the crisis, in [[Seattle]], [[Doha]], [[Canc\u00fan]], and Hong Kong, have failed to produce a significant agreement as developing countries have become more assertive, and nations are increasingly turning toward regional or bilateral [[free trade agreement]]s (FTAs) as an alternative to global institutions.\n\nMany nations learned from this, and quickly built up [[foreign exchange reserve]]s as a hedge against attacks, including Japan, China, South Korea. Pan Asian [[currency swap]]<nowiki/>s were introduced in the event of another crisis. However, nations such as Brazil, Russia, and India as well as most of East Asia began copying the Japanese model of weakening their currencies, and restructuring their economies so as to create a [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] surplus to build large [[foreign currency reserves]]. This has led to ever-increasing funding for U.S. [[treasury bonds]], allowing or aiding housing (in 2001\u20132005) and stock asset bubbles (in 1996\u20132000) to develop in the United States.\n\n==See also==\n* [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], partly connected to the 1997 Asian financial crisis\n* [[Bamboo network]]\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[1990s Chinese bank restructurings]]\n* [[Financial contagion]]\n* [[Liquidity crisis]]\n* [[Stock disasters in Hong Kong]]\n\n==References==\n;Books\n* {{cite book|last=Allen|first=Larry|title=The Encyclopedia of Money|year=2009|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|edition=2nd|place=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara, CA]]|pages=125\u2013127|isbn=978-1598842517}}\n* {{Cite book | last =Blustein | first =Paul | title =The Chastening: Inside the Crisis that Rocked the Global Financial System and Humbled the IMF | publisher =[[PublicAffairs]] | year =2001 | url =https://archive.org/details/chasteninginside00blus | isbn =978-1-891620-81-2 | url-access =registration }}\n* Delhaise Philippe F.
