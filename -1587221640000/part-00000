Charlie was part of Bergen's act as early as high school, and by 1930, was attired in his famous top hat, tuxedo, and monocle. Charlie's personality was that of a mischievous little boy (with an Irish lilt), who could crack wise, misbehave, and flirt shamelessly in a way that Bergen couldn't (much the same way that the Muppet characters behaved more outrageously than any of their human co-stars). The original McCarthy dummy was built by noted carpenter/dummy-maker Theodore Mack, and was later rebuilt by Frank Marshall.\n\nCharlie and Bergen made their [[old-time radio|radio]] debut on [[NBC]]'s ''The Chase and Sanborn Hour'' (sponsored by a noted coffee brand) in 1937, supported by singer [[Nelson Eddy]] (a role later filled by [[Dale Evans]], amongst others). The following year, Charlie would be joined by a much dumber dummy, \"''Mortimer Snerd''\". After a famous feud with [[W. C. Fields]] in the 1930s (during which Charlie often vowed to the comedian that he'd \"mow him down\"), the dummy became a true icon. \n\nBy 1939, Charlie was commanding 35.7% of the audience share, and was programmed opposite ''The Mercury Theater on the Air'' on [[CBS]], a struggling intellectual program helmed by [[Orson Welles]]. On October 30, many listeners fiddled with the dial during Nelson Eddy's musical interlude, intending to switch back for Charlie's next comedy spot, and stumbled on Welles' production of ''The War of the Worlds'', engendering a panic. As later reported, noted critic and wit Alexander Woolcott sent the young Welles a telegram on the subject: \"This only goes to prove, my beamish boy, that the intelligent people were all listening to the dummy, and that all the dummies were listening to you.\" Ironically, by 1944, Orson Welles had become a recurring guest, with the dummy puncturing the pomposity of the genius. \n\nThough shortened to 30 minutes as ''The Chase and Sanborn Program'', it wasn't until 1947, in a rare case of star taking precedent over sponsor in the title, that the series was officially renamed ''The Charlie McCarthy Show''. After a year's hiatus while the duo toured the stage, 1949 brought a switch to [[CBS]] and change of sponsors to [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]]. In 1955, Charlie and Bergen entered their last format, with the ventriloquist taking top billing for once, in ''The New Edgar Bergen Hour'', which ran until 1956. \n\nDuring this lengthy tenure, Charlie's guest roster was filled by many of the biggest stars of the day, including [[Henry Fonda]], [[the Andrews Sisters]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Roy Rogers]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Carol Channing]], [[Groucho Marx]], [[Dinah Shore]],  [[Liberace]], Bergen's wife [[Frances Bergen]], and in occasional appearances, Charlie's \"''sister''\" [[Candice Bergen]]. Bergen and McCarthy also co-starred with [[Mickey Mouse]] in the 1947 [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''.\n\nIn 1977, Charlie appeared with Bergen and Mortimer Snerd on Episode 207 of ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie's]] dummy \"''Chuckie''\" is based on Charlie. \n\nBergen and McCarthy made their final film appearance in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', as guest judges of the Bogen County Fair beauty contest.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

He has sold 20 million records worldwide.  \n[[AllMusic]] considers him to be \"among the most important [[electronic dance music|dance music]] figures of the early 1990s, helping bring dance music to a mainstream audience both in the United Kingdom and the United States\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p13697 | title = Moby |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=Allmusic |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking up guitar and piano at age nine, he played in several underground punk rock bands through the 1980s before turning to electronic dance music. In 1989, he moved to New York City and became a prolific figure as a DJ, producer, and remixer. His 1991 single \"[[Go (Moby song)|Go]]\" was his mainstream breakthrough, reaching No. 10 in the United Kingdom. Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs]] chart including \"[[Move (Moby song)|Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)]]\", \"[[Feeling So Real]]\", and \"[[James Bond Theme#Moby re-version|James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)]]\". Through the decade he also produced music under various pseudonyms, released the critically acclaimed ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'' (1995), and composed music for films. His punk-oriented album ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996) alienated much of his fan base.\n\nMoby found commercial and critical success with his fifth album ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]'' (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials. It remains his highest selling album with 12 million copies sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213050246/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2006|title=Moby Didn't Feel Pressure To Follow Up 'Play,' '18' Bows At Number Four|date=December 13, 2006|access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> Its seventh single, \"[[South Side (song)|South Side]]\", featuring [[Gwen Stefani]], remains his only one to appear on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching No. 14. Moby followed ''Play'' with albums of varied styles including electronic, dance, rock, and [[downtempo]] music, starting with ''[[18 (Moby album)|18]]'' (2002), ''[[Hotel (album)|Hotel]]'' (2005), and ''[[Last Night (Moby album)|Last Night]]'' (2008). His later albums saw him explore [[ambient music]], including the almost four-hour release ''[[Long Ambients 1: Calm. Sleep.]]'' (2016). Moby has not toured since 2014 but continues to record and release albums; his most recent is ''[[Long Ambients 2]]'' (2019). Moby has co-written, produced, or remixed music for various artists.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Moby is known for his [[veganism]] and support for animal welfare and humanitarian aid except towards those employed under him during times of crisis. He is the owner of [[Little Pine (restaurant)|Little Pine]], a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles, and organized the vegan music and food festival Circle V. He is the author of four books, including a collection of his photography and two memoirs: ''[[Porcelain: A Memoir]]'' (2016) and ''[[Then It Fell Apart]]'' (2019).\n\n== Early life ==\nRichard Melville Hall was born September 11, 1965, in the neighborhood of [[Harlem]] in Manhattan, New York City. He is the only child of Elizabeth McBride (''n\u00e9e'' Warner), a medical secretary, and James Frederick Hall, a chemistry professor, who died in a car crash while drunk when Moby was two.<ref name=TI05>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/moby-i-am-a-messy-human-being-and-i-dont-have-a-problem-admitting-it-4325.html|title=Moby: 'I am a messy human being, and I don't have a problem admitting|date=March 5, 2005|work=The Independent|first=Nick|last=Duerden|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=TG14/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cujamison.home.comcast.net/~cujamison/genhtm/genfrance.htm |title=Genealogy of Claire and Alex Jamison |publisher=Cujamison.home.comcast.net |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005015831/http://cujamison.home.comcast.net/~cujamison/genhtm/genfrance.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=TG160521>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/21/moby-bags-drugs-having-sex-stranger-miranda-sawyer|title=Moby: 'There were bags of drugs, I was having sex with a stranger'|date=May 21, 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=November 25, 2018|first=Miranda|last=Sawyer}}</ref> His father gave him the nickname Moby three days after his birth as his parents considered the name Richard too large for a newborn baby.

He has sold 20 million records worldwide.  \n[[AllMusic]] considers him to be \"among the most important [[electronic dance music|dance music]] figures of the early 1990s, helping bring dance music to a mainstream audience both in the United Kingdom and the United States\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p13697 | title = Moby |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=Allmusic |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking up guitar and piano at age nine, he played in several underground punk rock bands through the 1980s before turning to electronic dance music. In 1989, he moved to New York City and became a prolific figure as a DJ, producer, and remixer. His 1991 single \"[[Go (Moby song)|Go]]\" was his mainstream breakthrough, reaching No. 10 in the United Kingdom. Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs]] chart including \"[[Move (Moby song)|Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)]]\", \"[[Feeling So Real]]\", and \"[[James Bond Theme#Moby re-version|James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)]]\". Through the decade he also produced music under various pseudonyms, released the critically acclaimed ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'' (1995), and composed music for films. His punk-oriented album ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996) alienated much of his fan base.\n\nMoby found commercial and critical success with his fifth album ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]'' (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials.
