These steel-reinforced turbans, it was said, afforded enough protection so that there was no need for any other form of headgear. Today, Nihang still wear miniature versions of five weapons (''pancha shastra'') in their turbans, namely the [[chakram]], the [[khanda (sword)]], the ''karud'' (dagger), the [[kirpan]], and the ''tir'' (arrow).\n\n== Nihang today ==\n[[File:Group of Nihang Singhs.jpg|thumb|A group of Nihang]]\n\nNihang today are accorded great respect and affection by sections of the Sikh community, but they have  separate beliefs and certain practices.
