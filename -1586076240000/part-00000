This can cause complications if patients are confined to a hospital and may lead to agitation, distress and [[anxiety]].<ref name = Headway/> Many patients report feeling as though they were being \"held prisoner\" and being prevented from carrying on with their daily lives.<ref name = Headway/> Other symptoms include agitation, [[confusion]], [[disorientation]], and restlessness.<ref name = Metting >{{cite journal |author1=Metting Z. |author2=Rodiger L.

Patients may shout, swear and behave in a disinhibited fashion.<ref name = Headway/> There have been cases in which patients who do not recognize anyone will ask for family members or acquaintances that they have not seen in years.<ref name = Headway/> Some patients exhibit childlike behavior.<ref name = Headway/> Other patients show uncharacteristically quiet, friendly and loving behavior. Although this behavior may seem less threatening because of its lack of aggressiveness, it may be equally worrisome.<ref name = Headway/>\n\nPTA patients are often unaware of their surroundings and will ask questions repeatedly.<ref name = Headway/> Patients may also have a tendency to wander off, which can be a major concern in those who have suffered additional injuries at the time of trauma, such as injured limbs, as it may lead to the worsening of these secondary injuries.<ref name = Headway/>\n\n===Attention===\n\n[[Attention]] is a cognitive resource that contributes to many mental functions. The ability to engage attention requires a certain level of conscious awareness, arousal and concentration, all mechanisms that are generally impaired by traumatic brain injury.<ref name=Tittle>{{cite journal | author = Tittle A., Burgess G. H. | year = 2011 | title = Relative contribution of attention and memory toward disorientation or post-traumatic amnesia in an acute brain injury sample | url = | journal = Brain Injury | volume = 25 | issue = 10| pages = 933\u2013942 | doi=10.3109/02699052.2011.597042| pmid = 21749193 }}</ref>  The involvement of attention in such a vast array of cognitive processes has led to the suggestion that attentional deficit may act as an underlying factor in the range of cognitive deficits observed in patients experiencing post-traumatic amnesia (PTA).\n\nAttention has been regarded as an important factor in the healthy functioning of encoding, verbal comprehension and new learning.<ref name=Tittle/> Automatic attention processes (such as counting forwards) are recovered before simple memory skills (such as a recognition test of verbal material) in individuals with mild to moderate brain injury.<ref name=Tittle/> This implies that the recovery of attentional ability precedes the progression of memory recovery after injury, helping to pave the way to regain ability for new learning. In terms of more severe brain injuries, this automatic attention task performance recovers before disorientation completely resolves.<ref name=Tittle/>\n\nOne of the weaknesses of the method most often used in assessing PTA, the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT), is that it does not include any assessment of attention, which could help give a better indication of potential for recovery. By omitting attention, the test is omitting some crucial aspects of a person's cognitive capabilities.\n\nIn addition, assessing attention during the period of PTA may help determine whether the patient is still in a state of PTA or if they are suffering from a more permanent form of memory deficit.<ref name=Tittle/> In patients with mild TBI, the damage consists primarily of [[diffuse axonal injury]] (widespread damage to white matter) without any focal damage (damage to specific areas). Sometimes, injury of the [[brainstem]] was also observed. In these cases, there is likely the presence of an attentional deficit without a true amnesiac state. In more severely brain-damaged individuals, the damage to the [[temporal lobes]] and the [[frontal lobes]] serves as good indication that amnesia will result.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Stuss D.

PTA patients exhibit poor simple [[reaction time]], reduced information processing speed and reduced verbal fluency, which are all attentional deficits that could be used to distinguish these patients from those suffering from more severe and permanent memory problems.<ref name=Tittle/>\n\n===Communication skills===\nThe effects of PTA on communication skills were studied using the Revised Edinburgh Functional Communication Profile (REFCP), which measures both linguistic elements (related to speech) and [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] elements (related to body language and other non-verbal communication skills).<ref name = Deal>{{cite journal | author = Deal R.

Patients showed mild deficits in verbal communication skills, and moderate to severe deficits in nonverbal communication skills such as maintaining eye contact, initiating greetings, and responding appropriately.<ref name = Deal/> Also, a negative correlation was found between the duration of a patient's episode of PTA and his REFCP score; the longer the PTA episode, the more severe the deficit in non-linguistic pragmatic skills. However, the small sample size of this study (only 10 males) means that the results must be interpreted with caution, as they may not generalize to larger samples or to the population at large.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[Pathophysiology]] is the study of the changes to an individual's normal physical, biological, and mental functions as a result of disease, injury, or other damage. Currently, the [[pathophysiological]] mechanisms which produce post-traumatic amnesia are not completely known. The most common research strategy to clarify these mechanisms is the  examination of the impaired functional capabilities of people with post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) after a traumatic brain injury.<ref name = Ahmed>{{cite journal |author1=Ahmed S. |author2=Bierley R. |author3=Sheikh J.

Elevated [[stress (psychological)|stress]] levels can lead to an increase in the production of [[enkephalins]] and [[corticosteroids]], which can produce abnormal neural activity and disrupt [[long-term potentiation]] (a neural mechanism associated with learning) in the hippocampus.<ref name = Joseph/> Individuals who have been subjected to repeated sexual abuse during childhood or who have experienced combat show significant impairment and atrophy of the hippocampal region of the brain.<ref name = Joseph>{{cite journal | author = Joseph R | year = 1998 | title = Traumatic amnesia, repression, and hippocampus injury due to emotional stress, corticosteroids and enkephalins | url = | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 169\u2013185 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025092117657 }}</ref>  The [[amygdala]], an area of the brain involved in emotional regulation, may be involved in producing remembrance for some aspects of the trauma.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Roozendaal B. |author2=Mcewen B.

Diaschisis is implicated as playing an important role in PTA, more particularly in the [[declarative memory]] impairments observed in patients experiencing an episode of PTA. The loss of function observed after traumatic brain injuries, as well as the resulting loss of consciousness, was thought to be mediated by the 'neural shock' associated with diaschisis.<ref name = Feeney>{{cite journal | author = Feeney D. M., Baron J. C. | year = 1986 | title = Diaschisis | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 817\u2013830 | doi=10.1161/01.str.17.5.817}}</ref>\n\nDiaschisis was originally believed to be a result of disruption to neural tissue, but more recent evidence implicates increased activity levels of [[choline acetyltransferase]], the enzyme responsible for the production of [[acetylcholine]], as a major cause. Based on these findings, diaschisis could be helped through the use of drugs that would reduce cholinergic (acetylcholine) activity, and reduce the levels of acetylcholine in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Riese W | year = 1958 | title = The Principle of diaschisis: Its History, its nature, and its general significance | url = | journal = International Record of Medicine | volume = 171 | issue = | pages = 73\u201381 }}</ref> This idea is supported by the fact that there is an increase in acetylcholine concentrations in the brain after head injury. Animal studies have shown that concussive injuries in rats lead to changes in the [[central nervous system]]'s cholinergic system. This increase in acetylcholine levels has also been tied to behavioral suppression and unconsciousness, both symptoms of PTA. In long-term recovery, acetylcholine levels associated with diaschisis may continue to play a role in maintaining memory deficits.<ref name = Ahmed/>\n\n===Brain-imaging studies===\n[[Brain imaging]] techniques are useful for examining the changes in the brain that occur as a result of damage. Metting et al. (2001) used [[CT scans]] to examine the pathophyiological damage in patients currently experiencing an episode of PTA, patients with resolved PTA, and a [[control group]] that had not experienced PTA. Bloodflow to the [[occipital lobe]], the [[caudate nucleus]], and the [[grey matter]] of the frontal lobe was significantly reduced in patients who were scanned during the episode of PTA. No differences were seen between patients with resolved PTA and the control group.<ref name = Metting /> This encouraging finding points to the positive long term prognosis of PTA; most patients return to normal levels of functioning.<ref name = Metting /> The frontal lobes are associated with [[explicit memory]] [[memory retrieval|retrieval]], and deficits on explicit memory tasks are often found with patients experiencing PTA.\n\nWorking memory deficits are a common symptom in patients with PTA.  The duration of an episode of PTA was correlated with reduced bloodflow to the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]], a finding which was consistent with [[functional MRI]] studies that link [[working memory]] with right frontal activity.<ref name = Metting />  The [[prefrontal cortex]], which plays an important role in explicit memory retrieval, was also found to have decreased neural activation in patients scanned during the episode of PTA.<ref name = Metting /> Researchers noted that the damage was related to [[vascularization]] and neural functionality, but not to structural injury, suggesting that the resolution of PTA is dependent on functional changes.<ref name = Metting />\n\nMemory and new learning involve the [[cerebral cortex]], the subcortical projections, the [[hippocampus]], the [[diencephalon]] and the [[thalamus]], areas that often suffer damage as a result of TBI. Frontal lobe lesions may also play a role in PTA, as damage to these areas is associated with changes in behavior, including irritability, aggressiveness, disinhibition, and a loss of judgment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cantu R. C. | year = 2001 | title = Posttraumatic retrograde and anterograde amnesia: Pathophysiology and implications in grading and safe return to play | url = | journal = Journal of Athletic Training | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 244\u2013248 | pmid = 12937491 | pmc = 155413 }}</ref> Damage to this area may account for the uncharacteristic behavior often exhibited in PTA patients.\n\n====Accelerated forgetting====\nResearchers have also found that individuals experiencing PTA show accelerated forgetting. This contrasts with the normal forgetting observed by patients with normal amnesia related to brain damage. The [[temporal lobes]] are often the most vulnerable to the diffuse (widely distributed) and focal (more specifically localized) effects of TBI and it is possible that temporal lobe lesions may account for the accelerated forgetting observed in patients with PTA. These predictions were supported by the finding that most of the patients who showed rapid forgetting also had lesions to the temporal lobe.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Levin H. S. |author2=High W. M. |author3=Eisenberg H. M. | year = 1988 | title = Learning and forgetting during posttraumatic amnesia in head injured patients | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 14\u201320 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.51.1.14|pmid=3351514 |pmc=1032708}}</ref> Bilateral damage to the temporal lobes also causes severe anterograde amnesia, making it likely that lesions to this area would be involved in PTA. Patients exhibit a temporal gradient with memory loss, meaning that older memories are preserved at the expense of newer memories. Temporal lobe damage has been linked to a temporal gradient of this sort, because older memories are less dependent on the hippocampus and thus are less influenced by its damage.<ref name = Ahmed />\n\nThere is a significant link between individuals currently suffering from PTA and their performance on the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] (WAIS). The scores of those currently experiencing an episode of PTA were compared to individuals who had previously suffered a traumatic brain injury resulting in PTA. Those still suffering from PTA performed significantly worse on both the performance and the verbal subscales of the WAIS.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mandleberg I. A. | year = 1975 | title = Cognitive recovery after severe head injury: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale during post-traumatic amnesia | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 38 | issue = 11| pages = 1127\u20131132 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.38.11.1127| pmid = 1206424 | pmc = 492168}}</ref> Also, people in early stages of PTA have substantial impairment to anterograde memory function. For example, in the [[case report]] of a patient referred to as \"JL\", Demery et al. noted that his memory impairments were so severe following his injury that he had forgotten that he had attended a [[Major League Baseball]] game less than 30 minutes after returning to the center where he was being treated.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Demery J.

However, there is little research done on this topic, and as new research is done, more information should come forth concerning  functionality in these areas in PTA patients. One MRI study showed that a long duration of PTA was correlated with damage in the hemispheric and central areas, regardless of whether the duration of the coma  was relatively short. In patients who had a longer coma duration, deeper lesions in the central area were observed without extensive damage to the hemispheric area.<ref name = Ahmed />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n===Measure of traumatic brain injury severity===\n\n{| border=\"0\" align=\"right\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style = \"margin-left:15px; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ''' Levels of TBI severity'''<ref name=RaoLyketsos>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao V, Lyketsos C |title=Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of Traumatic Brain Injury |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=95\u2013103 |year=2000 |pmid=10749946 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.41.2.95 \n}}\n</ref>\n! &nbsp; !!

The retrospective method, however, fails to account for the apparent lucidity of patients who are still experiencing substantial disorientation, or the finding that the recovery from post-traumatic amnesia is often characterized by the presence of \"islands of memory\" (short periods of clarity).<ref name = Ahmed/> A failure to take these facts into consideration may have biased retrospective methods towards underestimating the length and severity of an episode of PTA.<ref name = Ahmed/> Also, the retrospective method relies on [[retrospective memory]], one's memory for past events, which is not very reliable in healthy individuals, and even less so in patients who have recently experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients may also unconsciously or consciously bias their answers because they want to appear more healthy or more ill than they truly were, or because of poor insight.<ref name = Ahmed/> The retrospective method is also flawed because there is no standard measurement procedure.<ref name = Ahmed/> Although the retrospective method may provide useful subjective data, it is not a useful tool for measurement or categorization.\n\n====GOAT====\nThe Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) is the most frequently used test for assessing PTA in the United States and Canada. The test consists of 10 items that involve the recall of events that occurred right before and after the injury, as well as questions about [[disorientation]]. Scores of 75 or more on this scale (out of a total possible score of 100) correspond to the termination  of the PTA episode. The GOAT typically classifies orientation into three categories: orientation to the person, orientation to the place, and orientation to the time. The idea behind these questions is that each of these classifications places a large demand on the patient's memory and learning abilities.<ref name = Ahmed/>\n\n====WPTAS and AWPTAS====\nThe [[Westmead Post-Traumatic Amnesia Scale]] (WPTAS)<ref name=\"Shores1986\"/><ref name=\"mqpta\"/> is commonly used in Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Seeman2014\"/> It questions twelve questions that examine orientation to person, place and time, in addition to the ability to consistently remember new information from one day to the next. The scale is administered once each day, until the patient scores 12/12 on three consecutive days. The WPTAS is suitable for patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. An abbreviated version of the WPTAS, the [http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/gcs Abbreviated Westmead PTA Scale] (AWPTAS) assesses patients with mild traumatic brain injury.<ref name=\"Meares2011\"/>\n\n=====Drawbacks=====\nAlthough the GOAT has proved useful in acute care, recent research has called attention to some of its drawbacks. The GOAT's assessment of orientation may put too much of a focus on memory as the main mechanism behind orientation. The range of cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with PTA seems to indicate that the patient's disorientation is more than just a memory deficit. Consequently, it may be beneficial to incorporate tests of other cognitive functions, such as attention, which relate to both memory and orientation.<ref name=Tittle/>\n\nAnother recent study compared the success of the GOAT and the Orientation Log (O-Log) in predicting rehabilitation outcomes, and found that, while the O-Log and the GOAT perform similarly as measures of PTA severity and duration, the O-Log provides a more accurate picture of rehabilitation.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Frey K.

[[Lysine]] vasopressin, a modified form of the vasopressin molecule, had positive effects on memory when administered by injection to patients with amnesia resulting from traumatic brain injury and [[Korsakoff's syndrome]].<ref>Oliveros, J. C., Jandali, M. K., Timsit-Berthier, M. et al. (1978). Vasopressin in amnesia. ''Lancet, 42.''</ref> Subsequent animal studies with rats found similar results, particularly in aversion and avoidance learning tasks. Rats lacking adequate vasopressin, either due to genetic defect or [[hypophysectomy]] (surgical removal of the pituitary gland), exhibited significant improvements in memory and learning functions when [[exogenous]] vasopressin was administered.<ref name = Eames>{{cite journal | author = Eames P., Wood R. L. | year = 1999 | title = Lysine vasopressin in post-traumatic memory disorders: an uncontrolled pilot study | url = | journal = Brain Injury | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 255\u2013260 | doi=10.1080/026990599121629}}</ref> Particularly encouraging was the finding that a short treatment period produced long-lasting improvements, in both humans and rats.<ref name = Eames/> However, the animal models of PTA are highly limited, as the dimension of self-awareness and orientation is almost impossible to model adequately. PTA in animals, especially rats, is often observed post-trauma (commonly post-surgery), but it is often only measured in terms of impaired learning or unusual behavior.<ref name = Eames/>\n\n====Human studies====\nOne subsequent human study found no effects of vasopressin on memory.<ref>Jenkins, J. S., Mather, H. M., Coughlan, A. K., & Jenkins, D. G. (1981). Desmopressin and desglycinamide vasopressin in post-traumatic amnesia. ''Lancet, 39.''</ref> The nonsignificant results were attributed to the study's many potential flaws, particularly its small sample size, the inability of vasopressin to penetrate the [[blood brain barrier]] when administered as a nasal spray, inadequate dosing and differences in severity of head injury between the samples. However, Eames et al. (1999) found statistically significant improvements on several tests of memory with the use of a vasopressin nasal spray, with no reported ill effects.<ref name = Eames/> Although the degree of improvement was mild, and it could be attributed to numerous other factors of the rehabilitative program, the lack of any ill effects suggests that vasopressin is, at the least, a possible enhancement for a treatment regimen.<ref name = Eames/>\n\n===Norepinephrine agonists===\n[[Diaschisis]], as mentioned earlier, has been linked to the mechanism of PTA. The noradrenergic systems may play a role in diaschisis. [[Norepinephrine]], also known as noradrenalin, is a [[catecholamine]] [[neurotransmitter]].  Administering a norepinephrine receptor [[agonist]] (a substance that initiates a cell response when it binds with a receptor) to patients promoted the recovery of memory and many other cognitive functions after a traumatic brain injury.<ref name = Feeney/> Conversely,  the administration of norpinephrine [[antagonist]]s slowed recovery, and could lead to the reinstatement of deficits when administered after recovery. Noradrenergic antagonists were not prescribed for the purposes of slowing the recovery of memory. Rather, these findings are based on the effects of other commonly prescribed drugs that happen to block noradrenergic receptors. The [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor]] is specifically implicated.<ref name = Feeney/> Although it has not yet been thoroughly investigated, there is potential for [[stimulants]], which promote catecholamine release, to be an effective treatment in the early stages of recovery from brain trauma, and these positive effects could reduce the symptoms of PTA.<ref name=\"pmid8959228\">{{cite journal |vauthors = Feeney DM |title=From laboratory to clinic: noradrenergic enhancement of physical therapy for stroke or trauma patients |journal=Adv Neurol |volume=73 |issue= |pages=383\u201394 |year=1997 |pmid=8959228 }}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\n===The North Star Project ===\nThe North Star Project was developed by researchers at [[McGill University]]. Researchers developed a \"reality orientation\", which involved discussing general facts (e.g. date, time, names of family members, etc.) with amnesic patients twice a day in an attempt to lessen their confusion during the early stages of their recovery. Younger patients often had  shorter amnesic episodes than older patients, especially those in the North Star group.

Concussions could account for the [[anterograde amnesia]] and [[retrograde amnesia]] observed in patients, as well as the periods of fluctuating consciousness or delirium that sometimes followed. However, many soldiers who showed these amnesiac effects did not suffer injuries that would have led to concussions.<ref name=Hart/> As a result, there was controversy over the possible causes of PTA in these non-concussed soldiers, with a separation between proponents of [[Freudian]] [[Psychological repression|repression]] and those supporting a [[dissociative]] view of the condition. This dissociative view was ultimately supported, and accounted for the [[fugue state]] seen in soldiers who were thought to have dissociated from normal consciousness.<ref name=Hart/>\n\n==Other psychological disorders ==\n\nResearchers have investigated the relationship between posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the development of symptoms of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and [[acute stress disorder]] (ASD). 282 outpatients, who were an average of 53 days post-TBI in their recovery, were divided into four groups: PTA episode lasting less than one hour; PTA episode lasting between one hour and 24 hours; PTA episode lasting between 24 hours and one week; and PTA episode lasting for longer than one week. The patients' personal details were used as variables classified for age, gender, marital status, time elapsed between injury and assessment, and type of injury (motor vehicle accident, pedestrian, assault and other). Patients were given two [[self-report inventories]]: the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The IES measures  symptoms of PTSD and contains questions regarding the intrusiveness of the traumatic event (ex. nightmares) and avoidant behaviours related to the traumatic event (ex. avoiding a certain location).<ref name =Feinstein/>  The GHQ was used as an indicator of overall psychological health.<ref name =Feinstein>{{cite journal | author = Feinstein A., Hershkop S., Ouchterlony D., Jardine A., McCullagh S. | year = 2002 | title = Posttraumatic amnesia and recall of a traumatic event following traumatic brain injury | url = | journal = Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 25\u201330 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14.1.25 | pmid = 195251885 }}</ref> The majority of subjects were in Group 1 (PTA episode lasting less than one hour), injured in motor vehicle accidents, and male.\n\nThere were no statistical differences found with regards to age, gender, marital status and type of injury. There was an increase in the severity of all indicators of brain damage for the longest durations of PTA; specifically, the GCS scores for this group decreased and the number of patients with an abnormal CT scan increased.<ref name = Feinstein/> There were significant differences in IES scores when comparing the group with the least serious episode of PTA, lasting less than an hour, to all other groups, with the duration of the episode of PTA lasting longer than an hour. The group with an episode of PTA lasting less than an hour had higher IES scores and more intrusive and avoidant symptoms.<ref name = Feinstein/> The fact that GHQ scores were constant throughout all groups, although there were differences in IES scores, suggests that the two scores measure different phenomena.<ref name = Feinstein/>\n\n==Aging==\n[[File:Elderly Woman, B&W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|left|An elderly woman]]\nGrey and white matter are both found in the many areas of the brain, as well as throughout the central nervous system. [[Grey matter]] is more involved in nerve function, and [[white matter]] is more involved in nerve maintenance,  as well as the regulation of unconscious functions. However, both are important for memory and learning. The volume of grey and white matter in the brains of aging individuals has been correlated with working memory and retention of cognitive function.<ref name = Schonberger/> Researchers hypothesized that the lesions of both grey and white matter would be larger in older individuals and in those with more severe traumatic brain injuries, and longer episodes of PTA, and the volume of grey and white matter would be smaller in those injured at an older age. A group of 98 participants, predominantly male, were examined using fMRI. The results supported these hypotheses, leading researchers to suggest that the impact of traumatic brain injury gets more severe as age progresses.<ref name = Schonberger>{{cite journal | author = Sch\u00f6nberger M., Ponsford J., Reutens D., Beare R., O'Sullivan R. | year = 2009 | title = The Relationship between age, injury, severity, and MRI findings after traumatic brain injury | url = | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 2157\u20132167 | doi = 10.1089/neu.2009.0939 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough grey and white matter volume was reduced throughout the brain, researchers noted that the grey matter of the [[neocortical]] brain regions was particularly affected.<ref name = Schonberger/> This is consistent with the fact that older individuals who had experienced PTA showed greater cognitive impairments than a control group of individuals of the same age who had not experienced PTA. The duration of the episode of PTA was related to the size of the grey matter lesion; longer episodes of PTA correlated with larger grey matter lesions. Advanced age also correlated with reduced [[glial]] activity. With less grey matter, the patient is less able to retrieve memories effectively, as neuron function is impaired.<ref name = Schonberger />\n\n==Controversies==\nOn the topic of trauma and memory, [[Richard McNally]] (2005) wrote that memories are not videotapes of our experiences, meaning that they are not unchangeable records.<ref name = Mcnally>{{cite journal | author = McNally R | year = 2005 | title = Debunking Myths about Trauma and Memory | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 13| pages = 817\u2013822 | doi = 10.1177/070674370505001302 | pmid = 16483114 }}</ref> The mechanism that retrieves a memory involves activation of several areas of the brain. Similarly, the mechanism that encodes a memory requires the use of different parts of the brain. Any fault in the encoding-retrieval system will degrade memory, and there are many potential faults, such as distortion by emotion, or focusing on the peripheral details at the expense of central details.<ref name = Mcnally/> An example of the latter is the well-known phenomenon where a person being robbed at gunpoint is so distracted by the gun that they don't have time to encode the robber's face.<ref name = Mcnally/>\n\nMisconstruing retrieval failure as traumatic amnesia is not the same phenomenon as post-traumatic amnesia, which describes amnesia for the current elapsing time post-trauma, not amnesia for trauma from the past.

A more viable explanation for this forgetting is [[childhood amnesia]], a phenomenon describing the fact that most children do not have recall of events in their lives before the age of three, partially due to the lack of development of cognitive elements such as language.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{memory}}\n\n[[Category:Amnesia]]\n[[Category:Medical signs]]\n[[Category:Neurotrauma]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = <!--{{PAGENAME}} by default-->\n| synonym         = \n| image           = \n| image_size      = \n| alt             = \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| specialty       = psychiatry, neurology, neuropsychology\n| symptoms        =\n| complications   =\n| onset           =\n| duration        =\n| types           = \n| causes          =\n| risks           =\n| diagnosis       =\n| differential    =\n| prevention      =\n| treatment       =\n| medication      =\n| prognosis       =\n| frequency       =\n| deaths          =\n}}\n'''Post-traumatic amnesia''' ('''PTA''') is a state of [[mental confusion|confusion]] that occurs immediately following a [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) in which the injured person is [[Orientation (mental)|disoriented]] and unable to remember events that occur after the [[physical injury|injury]].<ref name=LeeLK07>\n{{cite journal |author=Lee LK |title=Controversies in the sequelae of pediatric mild traumatic brain injury |journal=Pediatric Emergency Care |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=580\u201383; quiz 584\u201386 |year=2007 |pmid=17726422 |doi=10.1097/PEC.0b013e31813444ea\n}}\n</ref>  The person may be unable to state their name, where they are, and what time it is.<ref name=LeeLK07/>  When continuous memory returns, PTA is considered to have resolved.<ref name=Petchprapai07>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Petchprapai N, Winkelman C |title=Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: Determinants and Subsequent Quality of Life.

This can cause complications if patients are confined to a hospital and may lead to agitation, distress and [[anxiety]].<ref name = Headway/> Many patients report feeling as though they were being \"held prisoner\" and being prevented from carrying on with their daily lives.<ref name = Headway/> Other symptoms include agitation, [[confusion]], [[disorientation]], and restlessness.<ref name = Metting >{{cite journal |author1=Metting Z. |author2=Rodiger L.

Although this behavior may seem less threatening because of its lack of aggressiveness, it may be equally worrisome.<ref name = Headway/>\n\nPTA patients are often unaware of their surroundings and will ask questions repeatedly.<ref name = Headway/> Patients may also have a tendency to wander off, which can be a major concern in those who have suffered additional injuries at the time of trauma, such as injured limbs, as it may lead to the worsening of these secondary injuries.<ref name = Headway/>\n\n===Attention===\n\n[[Attention]] is a cognitive resource that contributes to many mental functions. The ability to engage attention requires a certain level of conscious awareness, arousal and concentration, all mechanisms that are generally impaired by traumatic brain injury.<ref name=Tittle>{{cite journal | author = Tittle A., Burgess G. H. | year = 2011 | title = Relative contribution of attention and memory toward disorientation or post-traumatic amnesia in an acute brain injury sample | url = | journal = Brain Injury | volume = 25 | issue = 10| pages = 933\u2013942 | doi=10.3109/02699052.2011.597042| pmid = 21749193 }}</ref>  The involvement of attention in such a vast array of cognitive processes has led to the suggestion that attentional deficit may act as an underlying factor in the range of cognitive deficits observed in patients experiencing post-traumatic amnesia (PTA).\n\nAttention has been regarded as an important factor in the healthy functioning of encoding, verbal comprehension and new learning.<ref name=Tittle/> Automatic attention processes (such as counting forwards) are recovered before simple memory skills (such as a recognition test of verbal material) in individuals with mild to moderate brain injury.<ref name=Tittle/> This implies that the recovery of attentional ability precedes the progression of memory recovery after injury, helping to pave the way to regain ability for new learning. In terms of more severe brain injuries, this automatic attention task performance recovers before disorientation completely resolves.<ref name=Tittle/>\n\nOne of the weaknesses of the method most often used in assessing PTA, the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT), is that it does not include any assessment of attention, which could help give a better indication of potential for recovery. By omitting attention, the test is omitting some crucial aspects of a person's cognitive capabilities.\n\nIn addition, assessing attention during the period of PTA may help determine whether the patient is still in a state of PTA or if they are suffering from a more permanent form of memory deficit.<ref name=Tittle/> In patients with mild TBI, the damage consists primarily of [[diffuse axonal injury]] (widespread damage to white matter) without any focal damage (damage to specific areas). Sometimes, injury of the [[brainstem]] was also observed. In these cases, there is likely the presence of an attentional deficit without a true amnesiac state. In more severely brain-damaged individuals, the damage to the [[temporal lobes]] and the [[frontal lobes]] serves as good indication that amnesia will result.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Stuss D.

Patients showed mild deficits in verbal communication skills, and moderate to severe deficits in nonverbal communication skills such as maintaining eye contact, initiating greetings, and responding appropriately.<ref name = Deal/> Also, a negative correlation was found between the duration of a patient's episode of PTA and his REFCP score; the longer the PTA episode, the more severe the deficit in non-linguistic pragmatic skills. However, the small sample size of this study (only 10 males) means that the results must be interpreted with caution, as they may not generalize to larger samples or to the population at large.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[Pathophysiology]] is the study of the changes to an individual's normal physical, biological, and mental functions as a result of disease, injury, or other damage. Currently, the [[pathophysiological]] mechanisms which produce post-traumatic amnesia are not completely known. The most common research strategy to clarify these mechanisms is the  examination of the impaired functional capabilities of people with post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) after a traumatic brain injury.<ref name = Ahmed>{{cite journal |author1=Ahmed S. |author2=Bierley R. |author3=Sheikh J.

Elevated [[stress (psychological)|stress]] levels can lead to an increase in the production of [[enkephalins]] and [[corticosteroids]], which can produce abnormal neural activity and disrupt [[long-term potentiation]] (a neural mechanism associated with learning) in the hippocampus.<ref name = Joseph/> Individuals who have been subjected to repeated sexual abuse during childhood or who have experienced combat show significant impairment and atrophy of the hippocampal region of the brain.<ref name = Joseph>{{cite journal | author = Joseph R | year = 1998 | title = Traumatic amnesia, repression, and hippocampus injury due to emotional stress, corticosteroids and enkephalins | url = | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 169\u2013185 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025092117657 }}</ref>  The [[amygdala]], an area of the brain involved in emotional regulation, may be involved in producing remembrance for some aspects of the trauma.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Roozendaal B. |author2=Mcewen B.

Diaschisis is implicated as playing an important role in PTA, more particularly in the [[declarative memory]] impairments observed in patients experiencing an episode of PTA. The loss of function observed after traumatic brain injuries, as well as the resulting loss of consciousness, was thought to be mediated by the 'neural shock' associated with diaschisis.<ref name = Feeney>{{cite journal | author = Feeney D. M., Baron J. C. | year = 1986 | title = Diaschisis | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 817\u2013830 | doi=10.1161/01.str.17.5.817}}</ref>\n\nDiaschisis was originally believed to be a result of disruption to neural tissue, but more recent evidence implicates increased activity levels of [[choline acetyltransferase]], the enzyme responsible for the production of [[acetylcholine]], as a major cause. Based on these findings, diaschisis could be helped through the use of drugs that would reduce cholinergic (acetylcholine) activity, and reduce the levels of acetylcholine in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Riese W | year = 1958 | title = The Principle of diaschisis: Its History, its nature, and its general significance | url = | journal = International Record of Medicine | volume = 171 | issue = | pages = 73\u201381 }}</ref> This idea is supported by the fact that there is an increase in acetylcholine concentrations in the brain after head injury. Animal studies have shown that concussive injuries in rats lead to changes in the [[central nervous system]]'s cholinergic system. This increase in acetylcholine levels has also been tied to behavioral suppression and unconsciousness, both symptoms of PTA. In long-term recovery, acetylcholine levels associated with diaschisis may continue to play a role in maintaining memory deficits.<ref name = Ahmed/>\n\n===Brain-imaging studies===\n[[Brain imaging]] techniques are useful for examining the changes in the brain that occur as a result of damage. Metting et al. (2001) used [[CT scans]] to examine the pathophyiological damage in patients currently experiencing an episode of PTA, patients with resolved PTA, and a [[control group]] that had not experienced PTA. Bloodflow to the [[occipital lobe]], the [[caudate nucleus]], and the [[grey matter]] of the frontal lobe was significantly reduced in patients who were scanned during the episode of PTA. No differences were seen between patients with resolved PTA and the control group.<ref name = Metting /> This encouraging finding points to the positive long term prognosis of PTA; most patients return to normal levels of functioning.<ref name = Metting /> The frontal lobes are associated with [[explicit memory]] [[memory retrieval|retrieval]], and deficits on explicit memory tasks are often found with patients experiencing PTA.\n\nWorking memory deficits are a common symptom in patients with PTA.  The duration of an episode of PTA was correlated with reduced bloodflow to the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]], a finding which was consistent with [[functional MRI]] studies that link [[working memory]] with right frontal activity.<ref name = Metting />  The [[prefrontal cortex]], which plays an important role in explicit memory retrieval, was also found to have decreased neural activation in patients scanned during the episode of PTA.<ref name = Metting /> Researchers noted that the damage was related to [[vascularization]] and neural functionality, but not to structural injury, suggesting that the resolution of PTA is dependent on functional changes.<ref name = Metting />\n\nMemory and new learning involve the [[cerebral cortex]], the subcortical projections, the [[hippocampus]], the [[diencephalon]] and the [[thalamus]], areas that often suffer damage as a result of TBI. Frontal lobe lesions may also play a role in PTA, as damage to these areas is associated with changes in behavior, including irritability, aggressiveness, disinhibition, and a loss of judgment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cantu R. C. | year = 2001 | title = Posttraumatic retrograde and anterograde amnesia: Pathophysiology and implications in grading and safe return to play | url = | journal = Journal of Athletic Training | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 244\u2013248 | pmid = 12937491 | pmc = 155413 }}</ref> Damage to this area may account for the uncharacteristic behavior often exhibited in PTA patients.\n\n====Accelerated forgetting====\nResearchers have also found that individuals experiencing PTA show accelerated forgetting. This contrasts with the normal forgetting observed by patients with normal amnesia related to brain damage. The [[temporal lobes]] are often the most vulnerable to the diffuse (widely distributed) and focal (more specifically localized) effects of TBI and it is possible that temporal lobe lesions may account for the accelerated forgetting observed in patients with PTA. These predictions were supported by the finding that most of the patients who showed rapid forgetting also had lesions to the temporal lobe.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Levin H. S. |author2=High W. M. |author3=Eisenberg H. M. | year = 1988 | title = Learning and forgetting during posttraumatic amnesia in head injured patients | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 14\u201320 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.51.1.14|pmid=3351514 |pmc=1032708}}</ref> Bilateral damage to the temporal lobes also causes severe anterograde amnesia, making it likely that lesions to this area would be involved in PTA. Patients exhibit a temporal gradient with memory loss, meaning that older memories are preserved at the expense of newer memories. Temporal lobe damage has been linked to a temporal gradient of this sort, because older memories are less dependent on the hippocampus and thus are less influenced by its damage.<ref name = Ahmed />\n\nThere is a significant link between individuals currently suffering from PTA and their performance on the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] (WAIS). The scores of those currently experiencing an episode of PTA were compared to individuals who had previously suffered a traumatic brain injury resulting in PTA. Those still suffering from PTA performed significantly worse on both the performance and the verbal subscales of the WAIS.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mandleberg I.

For example, in the [[case report]] of a patient referred to as \"JL\", Demery et al. noted that his memory impairments were so severe following his injury that he had forgotten that he had attended a [[Major League Baseball]] game less than 30 minutes after returning to the center where he was being treated.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Demery J.

However, there is little research done on this topic, and as new research is done, more information should come forth concerning  functionality in these areas in PTA patients. One MRI study showed that a long duration of PTA was correlated with damage in the hemispheric and central areas, regardless of whether the duration of the coma  was relatively short. In patients who had a longer coma duration, deeper lesions in the central area were observed without extensive damage to the hemispheric area.<ref name = Ahmed />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n===Measure of traumatic brain injury severity===\n\n{| border=\"0\" align=\"right\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style = \"margin-left:15px; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ''' Levels of TBI severity'''<ref name=RaoLyketsos>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao V, Lyketsos C |title=Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of Traumatic Brain Injury |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=95\u2013103 |year=2000 |pmid=10749946 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.41.2.95 \n}}\n</ref>\n! &nbsp; !!

The retrospective method, however, fails to account for the apparent lucidity of patients who are still experiencing substantial disorientation, or the finding that the recovery from post-traumatic amnesia is often characterized by the presence of \"islands of memory\" (short periods of clarity).<ref name = Ahmed/> A failure to take these facts into consideration may have biased retrospective methods towards underestimating the length and severity of an episode of PTA.<ref name = Ahmed/> Also, the retrospective method relies on [[retrospective memory]], one's memory for past events, which is not very reliable in healthy individuals, and even less so in patients who have recently experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients may also unconsciously or consciously bias their answers because they want to appear more healthy or more ill than they truly were, or because of poor insight.<ref name = Ahmed/> The retrospective method is also flawed because there is no standard measurement procedure.<ref name = Ahmed/> Although the retrospective method may provide useful subjective data, it is not a useful tool for measurement or categorization.\n\n====GOAT====\nThe Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) is the most frequently used test for assessing PTA in the United States and Canada. The test consists of 10 items that involve the recall of events that occurred right before and after the injury, as well as questions about [[disorientation]]. Scores of 75 or more on this scale (out of a total possible score of 100) correspond to the termination  of the PTA episode. The GOAT typically classifies orientation into three categories: orientation to the person, orientation to the place, and orientation to the time. The idea behind these questions is that each of these classifications places a large demand on the patient's memory and learning abilities.<ref name = Ahmed/>\n\n====WPTAS and AWPTAS====\nThe [[Westmead Post-Traumatic Amnesia Scale]] (WPTAS)<ref name=\"Shores1986\"/><ref name=\"mqpta\"/> is commonly used in Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Seeman2014\"/> It questions twelve questions that examine orientation to person, place and time, in addition to the ability to consistently remember new information from one day to the next. The scale is administered once each day, until the patient scores 12/12 on three consecutive days. The WPTAS is suitable for patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. An abbreviated version of the WPTAS, the [http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/gcs Abbreviated Westmead PTA Scale] (AWPTAS) assesses patients with mild traumatic brain injury.<ref name=\"Meares2011\"/>\n\n=====Drawbacks=====\nAlthough the GOAT has proved useful in acute care, recent research has called attention to some of its drawbacks. The GOAT's assessment of orientation may put too much of a focus on memory as the main mechanism behind orientation. The range of cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with PTA seems to indicate that the patient's disorientation is more than just a memory deficit. Consequently, it may be beneficial to incorporate tests of other cognitive functions, such as attention, which relate to both memory and orientation.<ref name=Tittle/>\n\nAnother recent study compared the success of the GOAT and the Orientation Log (O-Log) in predicting rehabilitation outcomes, and found that, while the O-Log and the GOAT perform similarly as measures of PTA severity and duration, the O-Log provides a more accurate picture of rehabilitation.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Frey K.

[[Lysine]] vasopressin, a modified form of the vasopressin molecule, had positive effects on memory when administered by injection to patients with amnesia resulting from traumatic brain injury and [[Korsakoff's syndrome]].<ref>Oliveros, J. C., Jandali, M. K., Timsit-Berthier, M. et al. (1978). Vasopressin in amnesia. ''Lancet, 42.''</ref> Subsequent animal studies with rats found similar results, particularly in aversion and avoidance learning tasks. Rats lacking adequate vasopressin, either due to genetic defect or [[hypophysectomy]] (surgical removal of the pituitary gland), exhibited significant improvements in memory and learning functions when [[exogenous]] vasopressin was administered.<ref name = Eames>{{cite journal | author = Eames P., Wood R.

PTA in animals, especially rats, is often observed post-trauma (commonly post-surgery), but it is often only measured in terms of impaired learning or unusual behavior.<ref name = Eames/>\n\n====Human studies====\nOne subsequent human study found no effects of vasopressin on memory.<ref>Jenkins, J. S., Mather, H. M., Coughlan, A. K., & Jenkins, D. G. (1981). Desmopressin and desglycinamide vasopressin in post-traumatic amnesia. ''Lancet, 39.''</ref> The nonsignificant results were attributed to the study's many potential flaws, particularly its small sample size, the inability of vasopressin to penetrate the [[blood brain barrier]] when administered as a nasal spray, inadequate dosing and differences in severity of head injury between the samples. However, Eames et al. (1999) found statistically significant improvements on several tests of memory with the use of a vasopressin nasal spray, with no reported ill effects.<ref name = Eames/> Although the degree of improvement was mild, and it could be attributed to numerous other factors of the rehabilitative program, the lack of any ill effects suggests that vasopressin is, at the least, a possible enhancement for a treatment regimen.<ref name = Eames/>\n\n===Norepinephrine agonists===\n[[Diaschisis]], as mentioned earlier, has been linked to the mechanism of PTA. The noradrenergic systems may play a role in diaschisis. [[Norepinephrine]], also known as noradrenalin, is a [[catecholamine]] [[neurotransmitter]].  Administering a norepinephrine receptor [[agonist]] (a substance that initiates a cell response when it binds with a receptor) to patients promoted the recovery of memory and many other cognitive functions after a traumatic brain injury.<ref name = Feeney/> Conversely,  the administration of norpinephrine [[antagonist]]s slowed recovery, and could lead to the reinstatement of deficits when administered after recovery. Noradrenergic antagonists were not prescribed for the purposes of slowing the recovery of memory. Rather, these findings are based on the effects of other commonly prescribed drugs that happen to block noradrenergic receptors. The [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor]] is specifically implicated.<ref name = Feeney/> Although it has not yet been thoroughly investigated, there is potential for [[stimulants]], which promote catecholamine release, to be an effective treatment in the early stages of recovery from brain trauma, and these positive effects could reduce the symptoms of PTA.<ref name=\"pmid8959228\">{{cite journal |vauthors = Feeney DM |title=From laboratory to clinic: noradrenergic enhancement of physical therapy for stroke or trauma patients |journal=Adv Neurol |volume=73 |issue= |pages=383\u201394 |year=1997 |pmid=8959228 }}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\n===The North Star Project ===\nThe North Star Project was developed by researchers at [[McGill University]].

Younger patients often had  shorter amnesic episodes than older patients, especially those in the North Star group.

Concussions could account for the [[anterograde amnesia]] and [[retrograde amnesia]] observed in patients, as well as the periods of fluctuating consciousness or delirium that sometimes followed. However, many soldiers who showed these amnesiac effects did not suffer injuries that would have led to concussions.<ref name=Hart/> As a result, there was controversy over the possible causes of PTA in these non-concussed soldiers, with a separation between proponents of [[Freudian]] [[Psychological repression|repression]] and those supporting a [[dissociative]] view of the condition.

The patients' personal details were used as variables classified for age, gender, marital status, time elapsed between injury and assessment, and type of injury (motor vehicle accident, pedestrian, assault and other). Patients were given two [[self-report inventories]]: the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The IES measures  symptoms of PTSD and contains questions regarding the intrusiveness of the traumatic event (ex. nightmares) and avoidant behaviours related to the traumatic event (ex. avoiding a certain location).<ref name =Feinstein/>  The GHQ was used as an indicator of overall psychological health.<ref name =Feinstein>{{cite journal | author = Feinstein A., Hershkop S., Ouchterlony D., Jardine A., McCullagh S. | year = 2002 | title = Posttraumatic amnesia and recall of a traumatic event following traumatic brain injury | url = | journal = Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 25\u201330 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14.1.25 | pmid = 195251885 }}</ref> The majority of subjects were in Group 1 (PTA episode lasting less than one hour), injured in motor vehicle accidents, and male.\n\nThere were no statistical differences found with regards to age, gender, marital status and type of injury.

The group with an episode of PTA lasting less than an hour had higher IES scores and more intrusive and avoidant symptoms.<ref name = Feinstein/> The fact that GHQ scores were constant throughout all groups, although there were differences in IES scores, suggests that the two scores measure different phenomena.<ref name = Feinstein/>\n\n==Aging==\n[[File:Elderly Woman, B&W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|left|An elderly woman]]\nGrey and white matter are both found in the many areas of the brain, as well as throughout the central nervous system. [[Grey matter]] is more involved in nerve function, and [[white matter]] is more involved in nerve maintenance,  as well as the regulation of unconscious functions. However, both are important for memory and learning. The volume of grey and white matter in the brains of aging individuals has been correlated with working memory and retention of cognitive function.<ref name = Schonberger/> Researchers hypothesized that the lesions of both grey and white matter would be larger in older individuals and in those with more severe traumatic brain injuries, and longer episodes of PTA, and the volume of grey and white matter would be smaller in those injured at an older age.

The duration of the episode of PTA was related to the size of the grey matter lesion; longer episodes of PTA correlated with larger grey matter lesions.

Any fault in the encoding-retrieval system will degrade memory, and there are many potential faults, such as distortion by emotion, or focusing on the peripheral details at the expense of central details.<ref name = Mcnally/> An example of the latter is the well-known phenomenon where a person being robbed at gunpoint is so distracted by the gun that they don't have time to encode the robber's face.<ref name = Mcnally/>\n\nMisconstruing retrieval failure as traumatic amnesia is not the same phenomenon as post-traumatic amnesia, which describes amnesia for the current elapsing time post-trauma, not amnesia for trauma from the past. Typically, \"[[repressed memory]]\" is the term used to explain this sort of traumatic amnesia; the experience was so horrific that the adult cannot process what occurred years before.<ref name = Mcnally/> The topic of repressed memory is controversial within psychology; many clinicians argue for its importance, while researchers remain skeptical of its existence. A more viable explanation for this forgetting is [[childhood amnesia]], a phenomenon describing the fact that most children do not have recall of events in their lives before the age of three, partially due to the lack of development of cognitive elements such as language.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{memory}}\n\n[[Category:Amnesia]]\n[[Category:Medical signs]]\n[[Category:Neurotrauma]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_amnesia"}

It concerns an unnamed young woman who impetuously marries a wealthy widower, only to discover that he and his household are haunted by the memory of his late first wife, the title character. A best-seller which has never gone out of print, ''Rebecca'' sold 2.8&nbsp;million copies between its publication in 1938 and 1965. It has been adapted numerous times for stage and screen, including a 1939 play by du Maurier herself, and the film, ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile working as the companion to a rich American woman on holiday in [[Monte Carlo]], the unnamed narrator, a na\u00efve young woman in her early 20s, becomes acquainted with a wealthy Englishman, George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter, a 42-year-old widower. After a fortnight of courtship, she agrees to marry him and, after the wedding and honeymoon, accompanies him to his mansion in [[Cornwall]], the beautiful estate [[Manderley]].\n\nMrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper, was profoundly devoted to the first Mrs de Winter, Rebecca, who died in a boating accident about a year before Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter met. She continually attempts to undermine the new Mrs de Winter psychologically, subtly suggesting to her that she will never attain the beauty, [[urbanity]], and charm her predecessor possessed. Whenever the new Mrs de Winter attempts to make changes at Manderley, Mrs Danvers describes how Rebecca ran it when she was alive. Each time Mrs Danvers does this, she implies that the new Mrs de Winter lacks the experience and knowledge necessary for running an important estate. Cowed by Mrs Danvers' imposing manner, and the other members of West Country society's unwavering reverence for Rebecca, the new mistress becomes isolated.\n\nShe is soon convinced that Maxim regrets his impetuous decision to marry her and is still deeply in love with the seemingly perfect Rebecca. The climax occurs at Manderley's annual costume ball. Mrs Danvers manipulates the protagonist into wearing a replica of the dress shown in a portrait of one of the former inhabitants of the house\u2014hiding the fact that the same costume was worn by Rebecca to much acclaim shortly before her death. The narrator has a drummer announce her entrance using the name of the lady in the portrait: Caroline de Winter. When the narrator shows Maxim the dress, he gets very angry at her and orders her to change.\n\nShortly after the ball, Mrs Danvers reveals her contempt for the second Mrs de Winter, believing she is trying to replace Rebecca, and reveals her deep, unhealthy obsession with the dead woman. Mrs Danvers tries to get Mrs de Winter to commit suicide by encouraging her to jump out of the window. However, she is thwarted at the last moment by the disturbance occasioned by a nearby shipwreck. A diver investigating the condition of the wrecked ship's hull also discovers the remains of Rebecca's sailing boat, with her decomposed body still on board.\n\nThis discovery causes Maxim to confess the truth to the second Mrs de Winter. He tells her how his marriage to Rebecca was nothing but a sham: how from the very first days husband and wife loathed each other. Rebecca, Maxim reveals, was a cruel and selfish woman who manipulated everyone around her into believing her to be the perfect wife and a paragon of virtue. She repeatedly taunted Maxim with sordid tales of her numerous love affairs. The night of her death, she told Maxim that she was pregnant with another man's child, which she would raise under the pretense that it was Maxim's and he would be [[Presumption of legitimacy|powerless to stop her]]. In a rage, he had shot her through the heart, then disposed of her body by placing it in her boat and sinking it at sea. The second Mrs de Winter thinks little of Maxim's murder confession, but instead is relieved to hear that Maxim has always loved her and never Rebecca.\n\nRebecca's boat is raised and it is discovered that it was deliberately sunk. An [[inquest]] brings a verdict of suicide. However, Rebecca's first cousin, and lover, Jack Favell, attempts to blackmail Maxim, claiming to have proof that Rebecca could not have intended suicide based on a note she sent to him the night she died.\n\nIt is revealed that Rebecca had had an appointment with a Doctor Baker in London shortly before her death, presumably to confirm her pregnancy. When the doctor is found, he reveals that Rebecca had been suffering from [[cancer]] and would have died within a few months. Furthermore, due to the malformation of her [[uterus]], she could never have been pregnant. Maxim assumes that Rebecca, knowing that she was going to die, manipulated him into killing her quickly. Mrs Danvers had said after the inquiry that Rebecca feared nothing except dying a lingering death.\n\nMaxim feels a great sense of foreboding, and insists on driving through the night to return to Manderley. However, before he comes in sight of the house, it is clear from a glow on the horizon and wind-borne ashes that it is ablaze.\n\nThe novel is remembered especially<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.strandmag.com/the-magazine/articles/daphne-du-mauriers-rebecca/|author=Charles L.P. Silet|title=Daphne DuMaurier's Rebecca|journal=The Strand Magazine}}</ref> for the character [[Mrs. Danvers]], the fictional estate [[Manderley]], and its opening line: {{Quote|\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\" |The second Mrs de Winter}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n* '''The Narrator/the Second Mrs de Winter''': A timid, na\u00efve, middle-class woman in her early twenties, who enjoys sketching. Neither the narrator's first nor maiden name is revealed. She is referred to as \"my wife\", Mrs de Winter, \"my dear\", and so on. The one time she is introduced with a name is during a fancy dress ball, in which she dresses as a de Winter ancestor and is introduced as \"Caroline de Winter\", although this is clearly not her own name. She signs her name as \"Mrs M. de Winter\", using Maxim's initial. Early in the novel she receives a letter and remarks that her name was correctly spelled, which is \"an unusual thing,\" suggesting her name is uncommon, foreign or complex. While courting her, Maxim compliments her on her \"lovely and unusual name\". Despite her timidity, she gradually matures throughout the novel, refusing to be a victim of Rebecca's phantom-like influence any longer and becoming a strong, assertive woman in her own right.\n* '''George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter''': The reserved, unemotional owner of Manderley. He marries his new wife after a brief courtship, yet displays little affection toward her after the marriage. Emotionally scarred by his traumatic marriage to Rebecca, his distance toward his new wife causes her to fear he regrets his marriage to her and is still broken-hearted over Rebecca's death. Maxim killed Rebecca in a blind rage after she pushed him over the edge with her lie that she was carrying the child of one of her lovers and would force him to raise it as his own. He does eventually reveal to his new wife that he does love her, but not until several months of marriage have passed. His full name is tauntingly revealed, by Jack Favell, to be '''George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter'''.\n* '''Mrs Danvers''': The cold, creepy, overbearing housekeeper of Manderley. Danvers was Rebecca's family maid when she was a child and has lived with her for years. She is unhealthily obsessed with Rebecca and preserving Rebecca's memory. She resents the new Mrs de Winter, convinced she is trying to \"take Rebecca's place\". She tries to destroy the marriage, but her efforts fail and only serve to bring Maxim and his new wife closer together. After her scheme is ruined, Mrs Danvers apparently burns Manderley to the ground, preferring to destroy it than allow Maxim to share his home with another lover and wife. She is nicknamed '''Danny''' which is derived from her last name; her first name being unknown or unimportant, but in [[Sally Beauman]]'s sequel ''[[Rebecca's Tale]]'' it was said to be '''Edith'''.\n* '''Rebecca de Winter''': The unseen, deceased titular character, who has been dead for less than a year. A famous beauty, and on the surface a devoted wife and perfect hostess, Rebecca was actually a compulsive liar and an openly promiscuous woman who tormented her husband Maxim with lurid tales of her nonstop affairs. Her lingering presence overwhelms Manderley, dominating the visitors, the staff and the new Mrs de Winter. Through dialogue, it is slowly revealed that Rebecca possessed all the signs of a [[psychopath]]: habitual lying, superficial charm, expert manipulation, no conscience and no remorse. She was also revealed to be somewhat sadistic \u2014 Danvers tells a story of Rebecca, during her teenage years, cruelly whipping a horse until it bled. In the [[Rebecca (1940 film)|1940 film adaptation]], her maiden name was said to be '''Hildreth'''.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Frank Crawley:''' The hard-working, dutiful [[Estate agent|agent]] of Manderley. He is said to be Maxim's trusted advisor and faithful confidant. He soon becomes a good friend to the second Mrs de Winter, and helps her in the self-doubt of her inability to rule Manderley as its mistress.\n* '''Beatrice Lacy (formerly de Winter):''' Maxim's wilful and quick-witted sister, who develops an immediate fondness for the new Mrs de Winter. Prior to the novel, she had married Giles Lacy. She, along with her brother, is one of the few people who knew Rebecca's true, vile nature, and was one of her victims: Beatrice's husband was seduced by her.\n* '''Giles Lacy:''' The slightly slow-witted husband of Beatrice and Maxim's brother-in-law. He was one of the many men who fell for Rebecca's charms.\n* '''Frith:''' The middle-aged, kind and devoted butler at Manderley. He had worked for the de Winters when Maxim's late father was a boy.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n* '''Robert:''' A footman.\n* '''Clarice:''' Mrs de Winter's faithful and trusted [[Lady's maid|maid]]. She aided her lady and mistress in fitting her white, frilly gown for the fancy dress ball. She replaces the original maid, Alice, later on.\n* '''Jack Favell:''' The crafty and sneaky first cousin of the late Rebecca de Winter and her most frequent [[boyfriend]]/[[sexual partner|lover]]. He and Rebecca had grown up together as children, causing mayhem, and he shares many of her worst traits, suggesting insanity runs in their family. He is strongly disliked by Maxim and several other characters.

The best known of these is the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]\u2013winning 1940 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film version ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'', the first film Hitchcock made under his contract with [[David O. Selznick]]. The film, which starred [[Laurence Olivier]] as Max, [[Joan Fontaine]] as the heroine, and [[Judith Anderson]] as Mrs Danvers, was based on the novel. However, the Hollywood [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] required that if Max had murdered his wife, he would have to be punished for his crime. Therefore, the key turning point of the novel&nbsp;\u2013 the revelation that Max, in fact, murdered Rebecca&nbsp;\u2013 was altered so that it seemed as if Rebecca's death was accidental. At the end of the film version, Mrs Danvers perishes in the fire, which she had started. The film quickly became a classic and, at the time, was a major technical achievement in film-making.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe 1964 [[Bollywood]] Hindi film ''[[Kohra]]'' and the 2008 film ''[[Anamika (2008 film)|Anamika]]'' were inspired by ''Rebecca''.\n\nAn upcoming film adaptation, ''[[Rebecca (upcoming film)|Rebecca]]'', was directed by [[Ben Wheatley]] and written by [[Jane Goldman]], and stars [[Lily James]] and [[Armie Hammer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/lily-james-armie-hammer-rebecca-movie-director-ben-wheatley-1202502252/|title=Deadline|archivedate=14 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n[[File:DaphneDuMaurier Rebecca.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pan UK paperback edition cover (showing [[Joanna David]] as Mrs de Winter from the BBC television production.

In the book, Mrs Danvers serves as something of a [[bogeyman]] for the main character Mike Noonan. King also uses the character name for the chilly, obedient servant in \"Father's Day\", a tale in his 1982 film ''[[Creepshow]]''.\n\nIn [[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series, in the bookworld, they have accidentally made thousands of Mrs Danvers clones, which they use as troops against The Mispeling Vyrus and other threats.\n\nIn ''[[The Maxx]]'' issue No. 31, a teenage Julie Winters watches a black-and-white version of the movie.\n\nIn  ''[[Fifty Shades Darker]]'' by [[E.L. James]], Anastasia Steele reads ''Rebecca'' after an argument with Christian Grey. Anastasia is haunted by Christian's previous relationships with his \"submissives\" and like the second Mrs de Winters, is fearful she doesn't measure up.\n\nIn [[Danielle Steel]]'s novel ''Vanished'', it is mentioned that the main character is reading ''Rebecca''. This was most likely deliberate on Steele's part, considering that the novel has many of the same elements as ''Rebecca''.\n\nIn [[Linda Howard]]'s 2010 novel ''Veil of Night'', Eric compares an assistant to Danvers as well as stating he read the book under protest to pass a high school literature class.\n\n===Film===\nThe 1983 science fiction comedy film ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'' gives a brief nod to aspects of ''Rebecca.'' After falling for Dolores Benedict, Dr Hfuhruhurr ([[Steve Martin]]) intends to marry her and seeks a sign from the portrait of his deceased wife, Rebecca. The supernatural reaction of the portrait doesn't convince him and so he places her in a cupboard.\n\n===Television===\nThe 1970 Parallel Time storyline of the Gothic soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' was heavily inspired by ''Rebecca'' including the costume ball scene. Also the second ''Dark Shadows'' motion picture, ''[[Night of Dark Shadows]]'' took inspiration from the novel including a mention by Kate Jackson's character who hopes the housekeeper is not like Mrs Danvers\n\nThe film was parodied on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' in a 1972 skit called \"Rebecky\", with [[Carol Burnett]] as the heroine, Daphne; [[Harvey Korman]] as Max \"de Wintry\" and in the guise of Mother Marcus as Rebecky de Wintry; and [[Vicki Lawrence]] as Mrs Dampers. The story was again referenced in an episode of the series \"Mama's Family\" (a spinoff of the Burnett show) titled \"I Do, I Don't.\" In it, Bubba, Iola, and Mama each have nightmares about married life. Mama's dream is a parody of the ''Rebecca'' scenario.\n<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1787561 The Carol Burnett Show: Episode No. 6.3 (27 September 1972)], Internet Movie Database.

It concerns an unnamed young woman who impetuously marries a wealthy widower, only to discover that he and his household are haunted by the memory of his late first wife, the title character. A best-seller which has never gone out of print, ''Rebecca'' sold 2.8&nbsp;million copies between its publication in 1938 and 1965. It has been adapted numerous times for stage and screen, including a 1939 play by du Maurier herself, and the film, ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile working as the companion to a rich American woman on holiday in [[Monte Carlo]], the unnamed narrator, a na\u00efve young woman in her early 20s, becomes acquainted with a wealthy Englishman, George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter, a 42-year-old widower. After a fortnight of courtship, she agrees to marry him and, after the wedding and honeymoon, accompanies him to his mansion in [[Cornwall]], the beautiful estate [[Manderley]].\n\nMrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper, was profoundly devoted to the first Mrs de Winter, Rebecca, who died in a boating accident about a year before Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter met. She continually attempts to undermine the new Mrs de Winter psychologically, subtly suggesting to her that she will never attain the beauty, [[urbanity]], and charm her predecessor possessed. Whenever the new Mrs de Winter attempts to make changes at Manderley, Mrs Danvers describes how Rebecca ran it when she was alive. Each time Mrs Danvers does this, she implies that the new Mrs de Winter lacks the experience and knowledge necessary for running an important estate. Cowed by Mrs Danvers' imposing manner, and the other members of West Country society's unwavering reverence for Rebecca, the new mistress becomes isolated.\n\nShe is soon convinced that Maxim regrets his impetuous decision to marry her and is still deeply in love with the seemingly perfect Rebecca. The climax occurs at Manderley's annual costume ball. Mrs Danvers manipulates the protagonist into wearing a replica of the dress shown in a portrait of one of the former inhabitants of the house\u2014hiding the fact that the same costume was worn by Rebecca to much acclaim shortly before her death. The narrator has a drummer announce her entrance using the name of the lady in the portrait: Caroline de Winter. When the narrator shows Maxim the dress, he gets very angry at her and orders her to change.\n\nShortly after the ball, Mrs Danvers reveals her contempt for the second Mrs de Winter, believing she is trying to replace Rebecca, and reveals her deep, unhealthy obsession with the dead woman. Mrs Danvers tries to get Mrs de Winter to commit suicide by encouraging her to jump out of the window. However, she is thwarted at the last moment by the disturbance occasioned by a nearby shipwreck. A diver investigating the condition of the wrecked ship's hull also discovers the remains of Rebecca's sailing boat, with her decomposed body still on board.\n\nThis discovery causes Maxim to confess the truth to the second Mrs de Winter. He tells her how his marriage to Rebecca was nothing but a sham: how from the very first days husband and wife loathed each other. Rebecca, Maxim reveals, was a cruel and selfish woman who manipulated everyone around her into believing her to be the perfect wife and a paragon of virtue. She repeatedly taunted Maxim with sordid tales of her numerous love affairs. The night of her death, she told Maxim that she was pregnant with another man's child, which she would raise under the pretense that it was Maxim's and he would be [[Presumption of legitimacy|powerless to stop her]]. In a rage, he had shot her through the heart, then disposed of her body by placing it in her boat and sinking it at sea. The second Mrs de Winter thinks little of Maxim's murder confession, but instead is relieved to hear that Maxim has always loved her and never Rebecca.\n\nRebecca's boat is raised and it is discovered that it was deliberately sunk. An [[inquest]] brings a verdict of suicide. However, Rebecca's first cousin, and lover, Jack Favell, attempts to blackmail Maxim, claiming to have proof that Rebecca could not have intended suicide based on a note she sent to him the night she died.\n\nIt is revealed that Rebecca had had an appointment with a Doctor Baker in London shortly before her death, presumably to confirm her pregnancy. When the doctor is found, he reveals that Rebecca had been suffering from [[cancer]] and would have died within a few months. Furthermore, due to the malformation of her [[uterus]], she could never have been pregnant. Maxim assumes that Rebecca, knowing that she was going to die, manipulated him into killing her quickly. Mrs Danvers had said after the inquiry that Rebecca feared nothing except dying a lingering death.\n\nMaxim feels a great sense of foreboding, and insists on driving through the night to return to Manderley. However, before he comes in sight of the house, it is clear from a glow on the horizon and wind-borne ashes that it is ablaze.\n\nThe novel is remembered especially<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.strandmag.com/the-magazine/articles/daphne-du-mauriers-rebecca/|author=Charles L.P. Silet|title=Daphne DuMaurier's Rebecca|journal=The Strand Magazine}}</ref> for the character [[Mrs. Danvers]], the fictional estate [[Manderley]], and its opening line: {{Quote|\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\" |The second Mrs de Winter}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n* '''The Narrator/the Second Mrs de Winter''': A timid, na\u00efve, middle-class woman in her early twenties, who enjoys sketching. Neither the narrator's first nor maiden name is revealed. She is referred to as \"my wife\", Mrs de Winter, \"my dear\", and so on. The one time she is introduced with a name is during a fancy dress ball, in which she dresses as a de Winter ancestor and is introduced as \"Caroline de Winter\", although this is clearly not her own name. She signs her name as \"Mrs M. de Winter\", using Maxim's initial. Early in the novel she receives a letter and remarks that her name was correctly spelled, which is \"an unusual thing,\" suggesting her name is uncommon, foreign or complex. While courting her, Maxim compliments her on her \"lovely and unusual name\". Despite her timidity, she gradually matures throughout the novel, refusing to be a victim of Rebecca's phantom-like influence any longer and becoming a strong, assertive woman in her own right.\n* '''George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter''': The reserved, unemotional owner of Manderley. He marries his new wife after a brief courtship, yet displays little affection toward her after the marriage. Emotionally scarred by his traumatic marriage to Rebecca, his distance toward his new wife causes her to fear he regrets his marriage to her and is still broken-hearted over Rebecca's death. Maxim killed Rebecca in a blind rage after she pushed him over the edge with her lie that she was carrying the child of one of her lovers and would force him to raise it as his own. He does eventually reveal to his new wife that he does love her, but not until several months of marriage have passed. His full name is tauntingly revealed, by Jack Favell, to be '''George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter'''.\n* '''Mrs Danvers''': The cold, creepy, overbearing housekeeper of Manderley. Danvers was Rebecca's family maid when she was a child and has lived with her for years. She is unhealthily obsessed with Rebecca and preserving Rebecca's memory. She resents the new Mrs de Winter, convinced she is trying to \"take Rebecca's place\". She tries to destroy the marriage, but her efforts fail and only serve to bring Maxim and his new wife closer together. After her scheme is ruined, Mrs Danvers apparently burns Manderley to the ground, preferring to destroy it than allow Maxim to share his home with another lover and wife. She is nicknamed '''Danny''' which is derived from her last name; her first name being unknown or unimportant, but in [[Sally Beauman]]'s sequel ''[[Rebecca's Tale]]'' it was said to be '''Edith'''.\n* '''Rebecca de Winter''': The unseen, deceased titular character, who has been dead for less than a year. A famous beauty, and on the surface a devoted wife and perfect hostess, Rebecca was actually a compulsive liar and an openly promiscuous woman who tormented her husband Maxim with lurid tales of her nonstop affairs. Her lingering presence overwhelms Manderley, dominating the visitors, the staff and the new Mrs de Winter. Through dialogue, it is slowly revealed that Rebecca possessed all the signs of a [[psychopath]]: habitual lying, superficial charm, expert manipulation, no conscience and no remorse. She was also revealed to be somewhat sadistic \u2014 Danvers tells a story of Rebecca, during her teenage years, cruelly whipping a horse until it bled. In the [[Rebecca (1940 film)|1940 film adaptation]], her maiden name was said to be '''Hildreth'''.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Frank Crawley:''' The hard-working, dutiful [[Estate agent|agent]] of Manderley. He is said to be Maxim's trusted advisor and faithful confidant. He soon becomes a good friend to the second Mrs de Winter, and helps her in the self-doubt of her inability to rule Manderley as its mistress.\n* '''Beatrice Lacy (formerly de Winter):''' Maxim's wilful and quick-witted sister, who develops an immediate fondness for the new Mrs de Winter. Prior to the novel, she had married Giles Lacy. She, along with her brother, is one of the few people who knew Rebecca's true, vile nature, and was one of her victims: Beatrice's husband was seduced by her.\n* '''Giles Lacy:''' The slightly slow-witted husband of Beatrice and Maxim's brother-in-law. He was one of the many men who fell for Rebecca's charms.\n* '''Frith:''' The middle-aged, kind and devoted butler at Manderley. He had worked for the de Winters when Maxim's late father was a boy.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n* '''Robert:''' A footman.\n* '''Clarice:''' Mrs de Winter's faithful and trusted [[Lady's maid|maid]]. She aided her lady and mistress in fitting her white, frilly gown for the fancy dress ball. She replaces the original maid, Alice, later on.\n* '''Jack Favell:''' The crafty and sneaky first cousin of the late Rebecca de Winter and her most frequent [[boyfriend]]/[[sexual partner|lover]]. He and Rebecca had grown up together as children, causing mayhem, and he shares many of her worst traits, suggesting insanity runs in their family. He is strongly disliked by Maxim and several other characters. Since Rebecca's untimely demise, his one and only true friend and [[confidant]]e is Mrs Danvers, whom he calls \"Danny\", just as Rebecca had done.\n* '''Colonel Julyan:''' The investigator of the inquest of the true cause of Rebecca's untimely demise.\n* '''Dr. Baker:''' A doctor who specialises in the feminine problems of women. A few hours prior to her death, Rebecca went to see him in secret, when he diagnosed her with an unspecified type of [[cancer]].\n\n==Location==\n* The fictional H\u00f4tel C\u00f4te d'Azur, Monte Carlo\n* The fictional [[Manderley]], a country estate which du Maurier's editor noted \"is as much an atmosphere as a tangible erection of stones and mortar\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Development==\nIn 1937, Daphne du Maurier signed a three-book deal with Victor Gollancz and accepted an advance of \u00a31,000.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=Dennison|first=Matthew|date=19 April 2008|title=How Daphne Du Maurier Wrote Rebecca|newspaper=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3672739/How-Daphne-du-Maurier-wrote-Rebecca.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227063201/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3672739/How-Daphne-du-Maurier-wrote-Rebecca.html|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}.</ref> A 2008 article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' indicates she had been toying with the theme of jealousy for the five years since her marriage in 1932.<ref name=\":0\" /> She started \"sluggishly\" and wrote a desperate apology to Gollancz: \"The first 15,000 words I tore up in disgust and this literary miscarriage has cast me down rather.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHer husband, [[Frederick Browning|Tommy \"Boy\" Browning]], was Lieutenant Colonel of the Grenadier Guards and they were posted to Alexandria, Egypt, with the Second Battalion, leaving Britain on 30 July 1937.<ref name=\":0\" /> Gollancz expected her manuscript on their return to Britain in December but she wrote that she was \"ashamed to tell you that progress is slow on the new novel....There is little likelihood of my bringing back a finished manuscript in December.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn returning to Britain in December 1937, du Maurier decided to spend Christmas away from her family to write the book and she successfully delivered it to her publisher less than four months later.<ref name=\":0\" /> Du Maurier described the plot as \"a sinister tale about a woman who marries a widower....Psychological and rather macabre.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Derivation and inspiration===\nSome commentators have noted parallels with [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Du Maurier's 'Rebecca,' A Worthy 'Eyre' Apparent |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61821-2004Mar15.html |accessdate=12 December 2006 |first=Jonathan |last=Yardley |date=16 March 2004 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68H11m0Tb |archivedate=8 June 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite news | title=Presence of Orson Welles in Robert Stevenson's Jane Eyre (1944) | work=Literature Film Quarterly | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3768/is_200301/ai_n9228494/print| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124114310/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3768/is_200301/ai_n9228494/print| url-status=dead| archive-date=2007-01-24}}</ref> Another of du Maurier's works, ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]],'' is also linked to one of the Bront\u00eb sisters' works, Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.

Nabuco's ''[[A Sucessora]]'' (''The Successor'') has a main plot similar to ''Rebecca'', for example a young woman marrying a widower and the strange presence of the first wife&nbsp;\u2013 plot features also shared with the far older ''Jane Eyre''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Lins|first=\u00c1lvaro|language=Portuguese|title=Jornal de cr\u00edtica|trans-title=Journal of criticism|place=[[Brazil|BR]]|publisher=Jos\u00e9 Olympio|year=1941|pages=234\u201336}}.</ref> Nina Auerbach alleged in her book, ''Daphne du Maurier, Haunted Heiress'', that du Maurier read the Brazilian book when the first drafts were sent to be published in England and based her famous best-seller on it.\n\nAccording to Nabuco's autobiography, ''Eight Decades'', she (Nabuco) refused to sign an agreement brought to her by a [[United Artists]]' representative in which she agreed that the similarities between her book and the movie were mere coincidence.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/06/books/tiger-in-a-lifeboat-panther-in-a-lifeboat-a-furor-over-a-novel.html?pagewanted=all|date=6 November 2002|title=Tiger in a Lifeboat, Panther in a Lifeboat: A Furor Over a Novel|newspaper=The New York Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723014056/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/06/books/tiger-in-a-lifeboat-panther-in-a-lifeboat-a-furor-over-a-novel.html?pagewanted=all|archivedate=23 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}.</ref> Du Maurier denied copying Nabuco's book, as did her publisher, claiming that the plot used in ''Rebecca'' was quite common.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} A further, ironic complication in Nabuco's allegations is the similarity between her novel and the novel ''Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o'', written by [[Jos\u00e9 de Alencar]], Brazil's most celebrated novelist of the nineteenth century, and published posthumously in 1873.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Souza |first1=Daniel Nolasco |last2=Borges |first2=Valdeci Rezende |title=Intertextualidade em ''Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o'' de Jos\u00e9 de Alencar e ''A Sucessora'', de Carolina Nabuco |journal=Anais Eletr\u00f4nicos do XIV Semin\u00e1rio de Inicia\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica |date=2006|language=pt|url=https://projetos.extras.ufg.br/conpeex/2006/porta_arquivos/pibic/010853-DanielNolascodeSouza.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944 in the United States, du Maurier, her US publishers, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], and various parties connected with the 1940 film version of the novel, were sued for plagiarism by Edwina L. MacDonald who alleged that du Maurier had copied her novel ''Blind Windows''. Du Maurier successfully rebutted the allegations.\n\n==Publishing history and reception==\nDu Maurier delivered the manuscript to her publisher, Victor Gollancz, in April 1938.  On receipt, the book was read in Gollancz's office and her \"editor, Norman Collins, reported simply: 'The new Daphne du Maurier contains everything that the public could want.'\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Gollancz's \"reaction to ''Rebecca'' was relief and jubilation\" and \"a 'rollicking success' was predicted by him.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Beauman|first=Sally|year=2003|contribution=Introduction|title=Rebecca|publisher=Virago|place=London}}.</ref> He \"did not hang around\" and \"ordered a first print run of 20,000 copies and within a month ''Rebecca'' had sold more than twice that number.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The novel has been continuously in print since 1938 and in 1993 \"du Maurier's US publishers Avon estimated ongoing monthly paperback sales of ''Rebecca'' at more than 4,000 copies.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Promotion===\nDu Maurier \"did several radio interviews with BBC and other stations\" and \"attended Foyle's Literary Lunch\" in August 1938 while ''Good Housekeeping'', ''Ladies Home Journal'', and ''House & Garden'' published articles on du Maurier.<ref>{{Citation|last=Huber|first=Katherine|contribution=Du Maurier, Daphne: Rebecca|title=20th-Century American Bestsellers|publisher=University of Illinois|url=http://people.lis.illinois.edu/~unsworth/courses/entc312/s99/search.cgi?title=Rebecca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216190441/http://people.lis.illinois.edu/~unsworth/courses/entc312/s99/search.cgi?title=Rebecca|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 December 2013|accessdate=4 July 2013}}.</ref>\n\n===Contemporary reception in the professional and popular press===\n''[[The Times]]'' said that \"the material is of the humblest...nothing in this is beyond the novelette.\" In the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' of 14 September 1938, [[V.

The best known of these is the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]\u2013winning 1940 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film version ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'', the first film Hitchcock made under his contract with [[David O. Selznick]]. The film, which starred [[Laurence Olivier]] as Max, [[Joan Fontaine]] as the heroine, and [[Judith Anderson]] as Mrs Danvers, was based on the novel. However, the Hollywood [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] required that if Max had murdered his wife, he would have to be punished for his crime. Therefore, the key turning point of the novel&nbsp;\u2013 the revelation that Max, in fact, murdered Rebecca&nbsp;\u2013 was altered so that it seemed as if Rebecca's death was accidental. At the end of the film version, Mrs Danvers perishes in the fire, which she had started. The film quickly became a classic and, at the time, was a major technical achievement in film-making.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe 1964 [[Bollywood]] Hindi film ''[[Kohra]]'' and the 2008 film ''[[Anamika (2008 film)|Anamika]]'' were inspired by ''Rebecca''.\n\nAn upcoming film adaptation, ''[[Rebecca (upcoming film)|Rebecca]]'', was directed by [[Ben Wheatley]] and written by [[Jane Goldman]], and stars [[Lily James]] and [[Armie Hammer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/lily-james-armie-hammer-rebecca-movie-director-ben-wheatley-1202502252/|title=Deadline|archivedate=14 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n[[File:DaphneDuMaurier Rebecca.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pan UK paperback edition cover (showing [[Joanna David]] as Mrs de Winter from the BBC television production.

In the book, Mrs Danvers serves as something of a [[bogeyman]] for the main character Mike Noonan. King also uses the character name for the chilly, obedient servant in \"Father's Day\", a tale in his 1982 film ''[[Creepshow]]''.\n\nIn [[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series, in the bookworld, they have accidentally made thousands of Mrs Danvers clones, which they use as troops against The Mispeling Vyrus and other threats.\n\nIn ''[[The Maxx]]'' issue No. 31, a teenage Julie Winters watches a black-and-white version of the movie.\n\nIn  ''[[Fifty Shades Darker]]'' by [[E.L. James]], Anastasia Steele reads ''Rebecca'' after an argument with Christian Grey. Anastasia is haunted by Christian's previous relationships with his \"submissives\" and like the second Mrs de Winters, is fearful she doesn't measure up.\n\nIn [[Danielle Steel]]'s novel ''Vanished'', it is mentioned that the main character is reading ''Rebecca''. This was most likely deliberate on Steele's part, considering that the novel has many of the same elements as ''Rebecca''.\n\nIn [[Linda Howard]]'s 2010 novel ''Veil of Night'', Eric compares an assistant to Danvers as well as stating he read the book under protest to pass a high school literature class.\n\n===Film===\nThe 1983 science fiction comedy film ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'' gives a brief nod to aspects of ''Rebecca.'' After falling for Dolores Benedict, Dr Hfuhruhurr ([[Steve Martin]]) intends to marry her and seeks a sign from the portrait of his deceased wife, Rebecca. The supernatural reaction of the portrait doesn't convince him and so he places her in a cupboard.\n\n===Television===\nThe 1970 Parallel Time storyline of the Gothic soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' was heavily inspired by ''Rebecca'' including the costume ball scene. Also the second ''Dark Shadows'' motion picture, ''[[Night of Dark Shadows]]'' took inspiration from the novel including a mention by Kate Jackson's character who hopes the housekeeper is not like Mrs Danvers\n\nThe film was parodied on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' in a 1972 skit called \"Rebecky\", with [[Carol Burnett]] as the heroine, Daphne; [[Harvey Korman]] as Max \"de Wintry\" and in the guise of Mother Marcus as Rebecky de Wintry; and [[Vicki Lawrence]] as Mrs Dampers. The story was again referenced in an episode of the series \"Mama's Family\" (a spinoff of the Burnett show) titled \"I Do, I Don't.\" In it, Bubba, Iola, and Mama each have nightmares about married life. Mama's dream is a parody of the ''Rebecca'' scenario.\n<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1787561 The Carol Burnett Show: Episode No. 6.3 (27 September 1972)], Internet Movie Database.

The film was adapted by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Edwin Blum]] from the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] play of the same name by [[Donald Bevan]] and [[Edmund Trzcinski]], which was based on their experiences as prisoners in [[Stalag]] 17B in [[Austria]].\n\nProduced and directed by Wilder, it starred [[William Holden]] in his [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning role, [[Don Taylor (actor)|Don Taylor]], [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]], [[Neville Brand]], [[Harvey Lembeck]], [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]], [[Sig Ruman]] and [[Otto Preminger]]. Strauss and Lembeck both appeared in the original Broadway production.\n\nThe 1960s television comedy [[Hogan's Heroes]] was - at least in some part - based on Stalag 17.\n\n==Plot==\n''Stalag 17'' begins on \"the longest night of the year\" in 1944 in a [[Stalag|Luftwaffe prisoner-of-war camp]] somewhere along the [[Danube|Danube River]]. The story is narrated by Clarence Harvey \"Cookie\" Cook. The camp holds Poles, Czechs, Russian women and, in the American compound, 640 sergeants from bomber crews, gunners, radiomen, and flight engineers.\n\nManfredi and Johnson try to escape through a [[escape tunnel|tunnel]], but are shot by waiting guards when they emerge outside the barbed wire fence. The other prisoners conclude that one of their own must have told the Germans. Suspicion falls on Sefton, an enterprising cynic who barters openly with the German guards for eggs, silk stockings, blankets and other luxuries. He also organizes mouse races and various other profitable ventures. Sefton tells the men it is foolish to try to escape.\n\nThe lives of the prisoners are depicted: they receive mail, eat terrible food, wash in the latrine sinks, and collectively do their best to keep sane and defy the camp's commandant, [[Oberst]] [Colonel] von Scherbach. They use a clandestine radio, smuggled from barracks to barracks, to pick up the BBC and the war news.  One German guard, [[Feldwebel]] [Staff Sergeant] Schulz, confiscates the radio in another success for the \"stoolie.\"\n\n\"Animal\" Kuzawa is infatuated with movie star [[Betty Grable]], and becomes depressed when he learns she has married bandleader [[Harry James]]. Harry \"Sugar Lips\" Shapiro gets seven letters at mail call and makes Animal think they are from women. When Kuzawa sees a finance company letterhead, Harry admits they repossessed his [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]].\n\nSefton bribes the guards to let him spend the day in the Russian women's barracks. The other prisoners conclude that this is his reward for having informed the Germans about the radio. When he returns, he is accused of being a spy.\n\nThen von Scherbach takes Lieutenant James Schuyler Dunbar, a temporary inmate, away. Dunbar admitted to the other prisoners that he had blown up a passing German ammunition train while he was being transported to the camp. Sefton resents Dunbar for coming from a wealthy Boston family. The men are convinced that Sefton betrayed Dunbar, so they beat him up and ostracize him. Sefton then focuses more effort on uncovering the identity of the real spy. During a fake air raid, he remains unnoticed in the evacuated barracks and overhears the barracks security chief, Price, talking with Schulz in German and divulging the means by which Dunbar destroyed the train (a [[matchbook]] with a lit cigarette tucked into the edge to create a time delay). Sefton considers what to do; if he exposes Price, the Germans will simply remove him and plant him in another camp, while killing him could expose the entire barracks to retaliatory execution.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the men find out that [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] men are coming to take Dunbar to Berlin for his sabotage. They create a diversion, free Dunbar, and hide him in the Water Tower. Nobody but Hoffy, the compound chief, knows where he is. The Germans, despite extensive efforts, are unable to find Dunbar. After von Scherbach threatens to raze the camp if necessary, the men decide one of them must get Dunbar out. Price volunteers, but then Sefton accuses him of being a spy. Sefton asks him, \"When was [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]?\" Price knows the date, but Sefton quickly asks what time he heard the news. Without thinking, Price answers 6 o'clock and that he was eating dinner \u2014 the correct time in Berlin, but not in Cleveland, Ohio, his claimed hometown. Sefton then reaches into Price's jacket pocket and extracts the \"mailbox\" used to exchange messages with the Germans, a hollowed-out black chess queen.\n\nSefton decides to take Dunbar out himself because he likes the odds this time and the expected reward from Dunbar's family. The men give Sefton enough time to get Dunbar out of the water tower above one of the latrines, then throw Price out into the yard with tin cans tied to his legs. The ruse works: Price is killed in a hail of bullets, creating a diversion that allows Sefton and Dunbar to cut through the barbed wire and escape.

Trzcinski appears in the film as a prisoner.\n\nThe play was directed by [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] and was the Broadway debut of [[John Ericson]] as Sefton. First presented at the Edwin Burke Memorial Theater of [[The Lambs]], a theatrical club, on March 11, 1951 (staged by the authors). It began its Broadway run in May 1951 and continued for 472 performances. The character Sefton was loosely based on Joe Palazzo, a flier in Trzcinski's prisoner-of-war barracks. The script was rewritten extensively by Wilder and Blum.\n\n===Casting===\nBoth [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Kirk Douglas]] were considered for the role of Sefton.<ref name=\"Capua2009\">{{cite book|last=Capua|first=Michelangelo|title=William Holden: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMp6ACb74UkC&pg=PA65|date=9 October 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5550-8|page=65}}</ref>\n\n===Location===\nThe prison camp set was built on the John Show Ranch in [[Woodland Hills, California|Woodland Hills]], on the southwestern edge of the [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref name=\"Rowan\">{{cite book|last=Rowan|first=Terry|title=World War II Goes to the Movies & Television Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdvGBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA443|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-105-58602-6|page=443}}</ref> The shoot began in February 1952, during the rainy season in California, providing plenty of mud for the camp compound.<ref name=\"Phillips2010\">{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Gene|title=Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uohNoRFkwIC&pg=PT163|date=5 February 2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-7367-1|page=163}}</ref> It is now the location of a [[meetinghouse]] of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].\n\n===Filming and release===\nThe film was shot in chronological order, an unusual practice as that method is usually much more expensive and time-consuming. In a [[featurette]] released later, members of the cast said that they themselves did not know the identity of the informant until the last three days of shooting.\n\nPeter Graves recalled the film was held from release for over a year due to Paramount Pictures not believing anyone would be interested in seeing a film about prisoners of war. The 1953 release of American POWs from the [[Korean War]] led Paramount to release it on an [[exploitation film|exploitation]] angle.<ref>p.146 Weaver, Tom ''Peter Graves Interview'' in ''Earth Vs. the Sci-fi Filmmakers: 20 Interviews'' McFarland, 1 Jan 2005</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Stalag 17'' was a commercial success.

The film was well received and is considered, along with ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' and ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (also starring Holden), among the best [[World War II]] [[Prisoner of War]] films.

His acceptance speech is one of the shortest on record (\"thank you, thank you\"); the TV broadcast had a strict cutoff time which forced Holden's quick remarks. The frustrated Holden personally paid for advertisements in the Hollywood trade publications to thank everyone he wanted to on Oscar night. He also remarked that he felt that either [[Burt Lancaster]] or [[Montgomery Clift]] should have won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' instead of him. It is said that he felt he was given the award as consolation for not having previously won it for ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn addition, Wilder was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director Oscar]], and Strauss for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].<ref name=\"Holsinger1999\">{{cite book|last=Holsinger|first=M.

The 1953 release of American POWs from the [[Korean War]] led Paramount to release it on an [[exploitation film|exploitation]] angle.<ref>p.146 Weaver, Tom ''Peter Graves Interview'' in ''Earth Vs. the Sci-fi Filmmakers: 20 Interviews'' McFarland, 1 Jan 2005</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Stalag 17'' was a commercial success.

His acceptance speech is one of the shortest on record (\"thank you, thank you\"); the TV broadcast had a strict cutoff time which forced Holden's quick remarks. The frustrated Holden personally paid for advertisements in the Hollywood trade publications to thank everyone he wanted to on Oscar night. He also remarked that he felt that either [[Burt Lancaster]] or [[Montgomery Clift]] should have won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' instead of him. It is said that he felt he was given the award as consolation for not having previously won it for ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn addition, Wilder was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director Oscar]], and Strauss for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].<ref name=\"Holsinger1999\">{{cite book|last=Holsinger|first=M.

In 1977, Maddux broke up with Einhorn and went to [[New York City]], where she became involved with Saul Lapidus. On September 9, 1977, Maddux returned to the Philadelphia apartment she had previously shared with Einhorn to collect her belongings (which Einhorn had reportedly threatened to throw out into the street as trash) and was never seen again. Several weeks later, the [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia police]] questioned Einhorn about her disappearance. He claimed that Maddux had gone out to the neighborhood co-op to buy some [[tofu]] and [[Bean sprouts|sprouts]], and never returned.\n\nEinhorn's initial [[alibi]] came into question when his neighbors began complaining about a foul smell coming from his apartment, which in turn aroused the suspicion of authorities. Eighteen months later, on March 28, 1979, Maddux's [[human decomposition|decomposing]] corpse was found by police in a trunk stored in Einhorn's closet. After finding the body, a police officer reportedly said to Einhorn, \"It looks like we found Holly,\" to which he reportedly replied, \"You found what you found.\" Einhorn's [[bail]] was reduced to $40,000 at the request of his attorney [[Arlen Specter]]; he was released from custody in advance of his trial by paying 10% of the bond's value, or $4,000. This amount was paid by socialite [[Phyllis Lambert]], one of the many people Einhorn had convinced to support him financially.\n\nIn 1981, just days before his murder trial was to begin, Einhorn skipped bail and fled to [[Europe]]. He lived there for the next seventeen years and married a [[Sweden|Swedish]] woman named Annika Flodin. In [[Pennsylvania]], as Einhorn had already been [[arraignment|arraigned]], the state convicted him ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' of Maddux's murder in 1996. Einhorn was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] without the possibility of [[parole]].\n\n==Extradition==\nThroughout Ira Einhorn's fugitive flight he was supported by the wealthy Canadian Bronfman family,  heirs to the whisky fortune. Others, friends of the Bronfmans, joined them in supporting Einhorn, indifferent to or doubtful of his murder of his ex-girlfriend Holly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1997, Einhorn was arrested in [[Champagne-Mouton]], [[France]], where he had been living under the name \"Eug\u00e8ne Mallon\". The [[extradition]] process, however, proved more complex than initially envisioned. Under the extradition treaty between France and the US, either country may refuse extradition under certain circumstances, and Einhorn used multiple avenues to avoid extradition.\n\nAlthough Einhorn was not [[death penalty|sentenced to death]], his defense attorneys argued that he would face the death penalty if he were returned to the US. France, like many countries that have abolished the death penalty, does not extradite defendants to jurisdictions that retain the death penalty without assurance that it will be neither sought nor applied. Pennsylvania authorities pointed out that when the murder occurred, the state did not practice the death penalty and so Einhorn could not be executed because the state and federal constitutions forbid ''[[ex post facto]]'' law. Einhorn's next strategy involved French law and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which require a new trial when the defendant was tried ''in absentia'' and unable to present his [[defense (law)|defense]]. On this basis, the court of appeals of [[Bordeaux]] rejected the extradition request.\n\nFollowing the court's decision, thirty-five members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] sent a letter to [[President of France|French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] to ask for Einhorn's extradition. However, under France's doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], which was invoked in this case, the President cannot give orders to courts and does not intervene in extradition affairs. Therefore, in 1998, to secure Einhorn's extradition, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a bill, nicknamed the \"Einhorn Law\", allowing defendants convicted ''in absentia'' to request another trial. In another delay tactic, Einhorn's attorneys criticized the bill as unconstitutional and tried to get the French courts to once again deny the extradition on the grounds that the law would be inapplicable. However, the French court ruled itself unable to evaluate the constitutionality of foreign laws. Another point of friction with the US was that the court freed Einhorn under police supervision, as French laws put restrictions on [[detention of suspects|remand]], the imprisonment of suspects awaiting trial. Einhorn then became the focus of intense surveillance by French police.\n\nThe matter went before [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]]; extraditions, after having been approved by courts, must be ordered by the executive. The [[French Green Party]] stated that Einhorn should not be extradited until the issues concerning his case were fully settled.<ref name=\"LesVerts\"><!-- this site no longer exists: {{cite web|url=http://www.les-verts.org/article.php3?id_article=224 |title=Les Verts \u2013 Ira Einhorn extrad\u00e9 }}--> {{cite web|url=http://www.lesverts.fr/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&id_article=224|title=Ira Einhorn extrad\u00e9|date=July 20, 2001|publisher=Les Verts|language=french|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026202806/http://www.lesverts.fr/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&id_article=224|archivedate=October 26, 2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> Jospin rejected the claims and issued an extradition [[decree]].

In 1977, Maddux broke up with Einhorn and went to [[New York City]], where she became involved with Saul Lapidus. On September 9, 1977, Maddux returned to the Philadelphia apartment she had previously shared with Einhorn to collect her belongings (which Einhorn had reportedly threatened to throw out into the street as trash) and was never seen again. Several weeks later, the [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia police]] questioned Einhorn about her disappearance. He claimed that Maddux had gone out to the neighborhood co-op to buy some [[tofu]] and [[Bean sprouts|sprouts]], and never returned.\n\nEinhorn's initial [[alibi]] came into question when his neighbors began complaining about a foul smell coming from his apartment, which in turn aroused the suspicion of authorities. Eighteen months later, on March 28, 1979, Maddux's [[human decomposition|decomposing]] corpse was found by police in a trunk stored in Einhorn's closet. After finding the body, a police officer reportedly said to Einhorn, \"It looks like we found Holly,\" to which he reportedly replied, \"You found what you found.\" Einhorn's [[bail]] was reduced to $40,000 at the request of his attorney [[Arlen Specter]]; he was released from custody in advance of his trial by paying 10% of the bond's value, or $4,000. This amount was paid by socialite [[Phyllis Lambert]], one of the many people Einhorn had convinced to support him financially.\n\nIn 1981, just days before his murder trial was to begin, Einhorn skipped bail and fled to [[Europe]]. He lived there for the next seventeen years and married a [[Sweden|Swedish]] woman named Annika Flodin. In [[Pennsylvania]], as Einhorn had already been [[arraignment|arraigned]], the state convicted him ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for Maddux's murder in 1996. Einhorn was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] without the possibility of [[parole]].\n\n==Extradition==\nThroughout Ira Einhorn's fugitive flight he was supported by the wealthy Canadian Bronfman family,  heirs to the whisky fortune. Others, friends of the Bronfmans, joined them in supporting Einhorn, indifferent to or doubtful of his murder of his ex-girlfriend Holly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1997, Einhorn was arrested in [[Champagne-Mouton]], [[France]], where he had been living under the name \"Eug\u00e8ne Mallon\". The [[extradition]] process, however, proved more complex than initially envisioned. Under the extradition treaty between France and the US, either country may refuse extradition under certain circumstances, and Einhorn used multiple avenues to avoid extradition.\n\nAlthough Einhorn was not [[death penalty|sentenced to death]], his defense attorneys argued that he would face the death penalty if he were returned to the US. France, like many countries that have abolished the death penalty, does not extradite defendants to jurisdictions that retain the death penalty without assurance that it will be neither sought nor applied. Pennsylvania authorities pointed out that when the murder occurred, the state did not practice the death penalty and so Einhorn could not be executed because the state and federal constitutions forbid ''[[ex post facto]]'' law. Einhorn's next strategy involved French law and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which require a new trial when the defendant was tried ''in absentia'' and unable to present his [[defense (law)|defense]]. On this basis, the court of appeals of [[Bordeaux]] rejected the extradition request.\n\nFollowing the court's decision, thirty-five members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] sent a letter to [[President of France|French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] to ask for Einhorn's extradition. However, under France's doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], which was invoked in this case, the President cannot give orders to courts and does not intervene in extradition affairs. Therefore, in 1998, to secure Einhorn's extradition, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a bill, nicknamed the \"Einhorn Law\", allowing defendants convicted ''in absentia'' to request another trial. In another delay tactic, Einhorn's attorneys criticized the bill as unconstitutional and tried to get the French courts to once again deny the extradition on the grounds that the law would be inapplicable. However, the French court ruled itself unable to evaluate the constitutionality of foreign laws. Another point of friction with the US was that the court freed Einhorn under police supervision, as French laws put restrictions on [[detention of suspects|remand]], the imprisonment of suspects awaiting trial. Einhorn then became the focus of intense surveillance by French police.\n\nThe matter went before [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]]; extraditions, after having been approved by courts, must be ordered by the executive. The [[French Green Party]] stated that Einhorn should not be extradited until the issues concerning his case were fully settled.<ref name=\"LesVerts\"><!-- this site no longer exists: {{cite web|url=http://www.les-verts.org/article.php3?id_article=224 |title=Les Verts \u2013 Ira Einhorn extrad\u00e9 }}--> {{cite web|url=http://www.lesverts.fr/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&id_article=224|title=Ira Einhorn extrad\u00e9|date=July 20, 2001|publisher=Les Verts|language=french|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026202806/http://www.lesverts.fr/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&id_article=224|archivedate=October 26, 2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> Jospin rejected the claims and issued an extradition [[decree]].

The cap has been worn throughout history in many states such as [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]] and is still worn by many people without political significance. In 2013, the cap regained its political symbolism through the [[Aam Aadmi Party]], which flaunted Gandhi caps with \"I am a Common Man\" written over it.

These films were never released in the U.S until it was announced by [[Discotek Media]] in 2012 that they had acquired the rights to the first four movies in a two disc set. The DVDs contain the original Japanese audio track with English subtitles.<ref>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-04-16/discotek-announces-dvd-release-of-saint-seiya-movies</ref>\n\n==Evil Goddess Eris (1987)==\n{{main|Saint Seiya: The Movie}}\n:''Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Gekij\u014dban'' or ''Saint Seiya: Jashin Eris\n\nWhen Seiya, Hy\u014dga and Shun visit Saori (Athena) at the orphanage, they meet an employee called Eri. An orphan herself, Eri takes a liking to Hy\u014dga and one night they sit outside watching the stars. They see a shooting star and Hy\u014dga asks Eri to make a wish. After Hy\u014dga leaves, however, Eri becomes powerfully attracted to the shooting star and wanders alone into the woods, where she finds a [[apple of discord|golden apple]]. She is then possessed by [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the Goddess of Discord, and kidnaps Athena, planning to use the golden apple to suck her energy out, fully reincarnate and take over the world. Eris leaves a message for the Bronze Saints, who set out for the goddess's temple which appears on the mountains. There, the heroes fight the five Ghost Saints: [[Sagitta (constellation)|Sagitta]] Maya, [[Lyra (constellation)|Lyra]] Orpheus, [[Crux (constellation)|Southern Cross]] Khrist\u00f3s, [[Scutum (constellation)|Scutum]] Jan and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] J\u00e4ger.\n\n==The Heated Battle of the Gods (1988)==\n:''Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Kamigami no Atsuki Tatakai\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Saint Seiya: The Heated Battle of the Gods'''''|\u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2 \u795e\u3005\u306e\u71b1\u304d\u6226\u3044|Seinto Seiya: Kamigami no Atsuki Tatakai}} is the second [[anime]] film by [[Toei Animation]] based on the ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' manga. It premiered on March 12, 1988 in the Toei Manga Matsuri film festival along with the movie versions of ''[[Lady!!|Lady Lady!!]]'', ''[[Bikkuriman]]'' and ''[[Kamen Rider Black]]''. The soundtrack was composed by [[Seiji Yokoyama]] and released in the [[Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack I\u2013VIII#Saint Seiya OST IV|Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack IV \u2013 The Heated Battle of the Gods]] CD.\n\nIn Siberia, Hy\u014dga saves a man that is being attacked. Injured, the man manages only to say something about [[Asgard]]. Some days later, Saori, Seiya, Shiry\u016b and Shun are wondering about Hy\u014dga and decide to go to Asgard to investigate. At [[Valhalla]], the Lord of Asgard, Dolbar, says he has not heard of any Hy\u014dga and neither has his right hand, Loki. However, at all times Seiya and the others can feel an evil cosmo emanating from Loki and the other Odin Saints called God Warriors. Shiry\u016b, in particular, notices a familiar cosmo coming from Midgard, a mysterious, masked God Warrior. Dolbar makes it clear that he is trying to take control of both Asgard and the Sanctuary, imprisoning Athena in a strange dimension within the giant statue of [[Odin]]. Midgard reveals himself as Hy\u014dga and tries to kill Shiry\u016b to prove himself to Dolbar. Thus, it is the task of the Bronze Saints to defeat Dolbar, Loki and the rest of the God Warriors, to save Athena and Hy\u014dga.\n\nDue to this film's popularity, [[Toei Animation]] created the Asgard saga for the anime, which did not originally appear in the manga and is set between the Sanctuary and Poseidon arcs of the story.\n\n==Legend of Crimson Youth (1988)==\n:''Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Shinku no Sh\u014dnen Densetsu\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Saint Seiya: The Legend of Crimson Youth'''''|\u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2 \u771f\u7d05\u306e\u5c11\u5e74\u4f1d\u8aac|Seinto Seiya: Shinku no Sh\u014dnen Densetsu}} is the third [[anime]] film by [[Toei Animation]] based on the ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' manga. Unlike its predecessors, which premiered on the Toei Manga Matsuri film festivals, this installment was instead shown at the ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump|Weekly Jump]]'' 20th Anniversary Festival along with the animated movie version of ''[[Sakigake!! Otokojuku]]''.\n\nAthena receives the visit of Phoebus Abel, her older brother and God of the [[Stellar corona|Corona]]. He informs her that he has come to destroy humanity as punishment for their corruption, just as it was done in ancient times. He dismisses Seiya and the Bronze Saints, as she will now be guarded by Abel's three Corona Saints, Atlas of [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], Jaow of [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]] and Berenike of [[Coma Berenices]], and the five resurrected Gold Saints who died in the Sanctuary battle: Saga of [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], Deathmask of [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]], Shura of [[Capricornus|Capricorn]], Camus of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] and Aphrodite of [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. When Athena rebels against Abel's plan, he attacks her, sending her soul to [[Elysion]], the final resting place from which there is no return. The Bronze Saints immediately rush to the Sanctuary to save her and ultimately overcome Abel.\n\nUnlike the other ''Saint Seiya'' movies made in the 1980s, this one was a full featured film, having a running time of 75 minutes. The events occur sometime after the Poseidon saga and before the Fallen Angels saga (4th movie).\n\n==Warriors of the Final Holy Battle (1989)==\n:Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Saish\u016b Seisen no Senshitachi'' ([[:ja:\u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2 \u6700\u7d42\u8056\u6226\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u305f\u3061|\u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2 \u6700\u7d42\u8056\u6226\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u305f\u3061]])\nThe plot involves the coming of [[Lucifer]] to the Sanctuary, where his underlings systematically dispose of the surviving Gold Saints. Athena goes to Lucifer to ask for peace, placing herself in peril. The Bronze Saints must then come to her rescue, destroying Lucifer's Fallen Angels (''Seima Tenshi'' in Japanese) in the process.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by [[Seiji Yokoyama]] and released in the [[Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack I\u2013VIII#Saint Seiya OST VIII|Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack VIII \u2013 Warriors of the Final Holy Battle]] CD.\n\n==Heaven Chapter: Overture (2004)==\n:''Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Tenkaihen Jos\u014d Overture\n\n[[Image:Tenkai Overture Cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|DVD cover of Heaven Chapter: Overture]]\nAfter the success of the OVA series ''Hades - Chapter Sanctuary'', this movie served as a continuation to the Hades saga. Injured after his confrontation with Hades, Seiya is in a coma and under Saori's care. The Goddess Artemis, Saori's older sister, comes to Earth to ask why she is not fulfilling her duties as a Goddess and takes control of Sanctuary in her stead. Hoping that it may bring peace on Earth, Saori goes to the Sanctuary and starts spilling her blood and it is up to the Bronze Saints to save her.\n\nAfter the bloody battle against [[Hades (Saint Seiya)|Hades]], goddess [[Athena (Saint Seiya)|Athena]]'s Saints are still recovering when they find themselves face to face with their newest and most formidable foe: the dreadful goddess [[Artemis (Saint Seiya)|Artemis]], accompanied by her [[#Angels|Angels]]. Artemis replaces Athena as the [[Earth]] guardian deity and takes over the Sanctuary, turning Athena's Saints into her servants.\n\nUpon invading the Sanctuary, the Bronze Saints learn that Athena was banished by Artemis and decide to fight the moon goddess in order to rescue their true goddess and free the Earth from Artemis's ominous control.\n\nThe movie focuses mostly on Seiya and Athena, as the other Bronze Saints are not seen as much; they only appear during their respective fights with the other Angels, and briefly towards the end. However, [[Eagle Marin]] also appears, as [[Ophiuchus Shaina]], [[Unicorn Jabu]], and [[Hydra Ichi]] do, though the latter three are just cameos.\n\nThe movie also has a very ambiguous ending, with many plot points and danglers unresolved.\n\n==Legend of Sanctuary (2014)==\n{{Empty section|date=September 2013}}\n{{Main|Saint Seiya: Legend of Sanctuary}}\n\n==Live-action (TBA)==\nA Live Action film was announced at Comic Con Brazil 2016.<ref name=\"crunchyroll\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Saint Seiya}}\n\n[[Category:Saint Seiya lists|Films]]\n[[Category:Shueisha franchises|Saint Seiya (film series)]]\n[[Category:1987 anime films]]\n[[Category:1988 anime films]]\n[[Category:1989 anime films]]\n[[Category:2004 anime films]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime films|Saint Seiya]]\n[[Category:Japanese animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Discotek Media]]\n[[Category:Lists of films by franchise]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{ref improve|date=July 2014}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Saint Seiya (films)\n| italic title    = no\n| image           =\n| caption         =\n| ja_kanji        = \u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2\n| ja_romaji       = Seinto Seiya\n| genre           = [[Action genre|Action]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Loo|first=Egan|title=Clash of the Titans Posters by Saint Seiya's Kurumada Posted |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-12/clash-of-the-titans-posters-by-saint-seiya-kurumada-posted |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=July 29, 2018 |date=April 12, 2010}}</ref> [[fantasy]],<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.viz.com/knights-of-the-zodiac-saint-seiya|title=The Official Website for Knights of the Zodiac (Saint Seiya) |publisher=Viz Media |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}</ref> [[Mythic fiction|mythological]]<!--\"Saint Seiya mythological manga\"--><ref>{{cite web|last=Loo|first=Egan |title=Masami Kurumada Hints at New Ring ni Kakero Work |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-03-12/masami-kurumada-hints-at-new-ring-ni-kakero-work |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=July 29, 2018}}</ref><!-- Genres should be based on what reliable sources list them as and not on personal interpretations.

A sixth film, ''[[Saint Seiya: Legend of Sanctuary|Legend of Sanctuary]]'', was premiered in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-29/2014-saint-seiya-film-title-date-story-basis-unveiled|title=  2014 Saint Seiya Film's Title, Date, Story Basis Unveiled|date=2013-10-29|accessdate= 2013-10-29|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>\n\nThe first two movies received a theatrical release in France under ''Les Chevaliers du Zodiaque: La L\u00e9gende de la Pomme d'Or'', and ''La Guerre des Dieux'', where ''Knights of the Zodiac'' was at its prime popularity in that country. These films were never released in the U.S until it was announced by [[Discotek Media]] in 2012 that they had acquired the rights to the first four movies in a two disc set. The DVDs contain the original Japanese audio track with English subtitles.<ref>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-04-16/discotek-announces-dvd-release-of-saint-seiya-movies</ref>\n\n==Evil Goddess Eris (1987)==\n{{main|Saint Seiya: The Movie}}\n:''Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Gekij\u014dban'' or ''Saint Seiya: Jashin Eris\n\nWhen Seiya, Hy\u014dga and Shun visit Saori (Athena) at the orphanage, they meet an employee called Eri. An orphan herself, Eri takes a liking to Hy\u014dga and one night they sit outside watching the stars. They see a shooting star and Hy\u014dga asks Eri to make a wish. After Hy\u014dga leaves, however, Eri becomes powerfully attracted to the shooting star and wanders alone into the woods, where she finds a [[apple of discord|golden apple]]. She is then possessed by [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the Goddess of Discord, and kidnaps Athena, planning to use the golden apple to suck her energy out, fully reincarnate and take over the world. Eris leaves a message for the Bronze Saints, who set out for the goddess's temple which appears on the mountains. There, the heroes fight the five Ghost Saints: [[Sagitta (constellation)|Sagitta]] Maya, [[Lyra (constellation)|Lyra]] Orpheus, [[Crux (constellation)|Southern Cross]] Khrist\u00f3s, [[Scutum (constellation)|Scutum]] Jan and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] J\u00e4ger.\n\n==The Heated Battle of the Gods (1988)==\n:''Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Kamigami no Atsuki Tatakai\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Saint Seiya: The Heated Battle of the Gods'''''|\u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2 \u795e\u3005\u306e\u71b1\u304d\u6226\u3044|Seinto Seiya: Kamigami no Atsuki Tatakai}} is the second [[anime]] film by [[Toei Animation]] based on the ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' manga. It premiered on March 12, 1988 in the Toei Manga Matsuri film festival along with the movie versions of ''[[Lady!!|Lady Lady!!]]'', ''[[Bikkuriman]]'' and ''[[Kamen Rider Black]]''. The soundtrack was composed by [[Seiji Yokoyama]] and released in the [[Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack I\u2013VIII#Saint Seiya OST IV|Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack IV \u2013 The Heated Battle of the Gods]] CD.\n\nIn Siberia, Hy\u014dga saves a man that is being attacked. Injured, the man manages only to say something about [[Asgard]]. Some days later, Saori, Seiya, Shiry\u016b and Shun are wondering about Hy\u014dga and decide to go to Asgard to investigate. At [[Valhalla]], the Lord of Asgard, Dolbar, says he has not heard of any Hy\u014dga and neither has his right hand, Loki. However, at all times Seiya and the others can feel an evil cosmo emanating from Loki and the other Odin Saints called God Warriors. Shiry\u016b, in particular, notices a familiar cosmo coming from Midgard, a mysterious, masked God Warrior. Dolbar makes it clear that he is trying to take control of both Asgard and the Sanctuary, imprisoning Athena in a strange dimension within the giant statue of [[Odin]]. Midgard reveals himself as Hy\u014dga and tries to kill Shiry\u016b to prove himself to Dolbar. Thus, it is the task of the Bronze Saints to defeat Dolbar, Loki and the rest of the God Warriors, to save Athena and Hy\u014dga.\n\nDue to this film's popularity, [[Toei Animation]] created the Asgard saga for the anime, which did not originally appear in the manga and is set between the Sanctuary and Poseidon arcs of the story.\n\n==Legend of Crimson Youth (1988)==\n:''Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Shinku no Sh\u014dnen Densetsu\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Saint Seiya: The Legend of Crimson Youth'''''|\u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2 \u771f\u7d05\u306e\u5c11\u5e74\u4f1d\u8aac|Seinto Seiya: Shinku no Sh\u014dnen Densetsu}} is the third [[anime]] film by [[Toei Animation]] based on the ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' manga. Unlike its predecessors, which premiered on the Toei Manga Matsuri film festivals, this installment was instead shown at the ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump|Weekly Jump]]'' 20th Anniversary Festival along with the animated movie version of ''[[Sakigake!! Otokojuku]]''.\n\nAthena receives the visit of Phoebus Abel, her older brother and God of the [[Corona]]. He informs her that he has come to destroy humanity as punishment for their corruption, just as it was done in ancient times. He dismisses Seiya and the Bronze Saints, as she will now be guarded by Abel's three Corona Saints, Atlas of [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], Jaow of [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]] and Berenike of [[Coma Berenices]], and the five resurrected Gold Saints who died in the Sanctuary battle: Saga of [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], Deathmask of [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]], Shura of [[Capricornus|Capricorn]], Camus of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] and Aphrodite of [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. When Athena rebels against Abel's plan, he attacks her, sending her soul to [[Elysion]], the final resting place from which there is no return. The Bronze Saints immediately rush to the Sanctuary to save her and ultimately overcome Abel.\n\nUnlike the other ''Saint Seiya'' movies made in the 1980s, this one was a full featured film, having a running time of 75 minutes. The events occur sometime after the Poseidon saga and before the Fallen Angels saga (4th movie).\n\n==Warriors of the Final Holy Battle (1989)==\n:Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Saish\u016b Seisen no Senshitachi'' ([[:ja:\u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2 \u6700\u7d42\u8056\u6226\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u305f\u3061|\u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2 \u6700\u7d42\u8056\u6226\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u305f\u3061]])\nThe plot involves the coming of [[Lucifer]] to the Sanctuary, where his underlings systematically dispose of the surviving Gold Saints. Athena goes to Lucifer to ask for peace, placing herself in peril. The Bronze Saints must then come to her rescue, destroying Lucifer's Fallen Angels (''Seima Tenshi'' in Japanese) in the process.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by [[Seiji Yokoyama]] and released in the [[Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack I\u2013VIII#Saint Seiya OST VIII|Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack VIII \u2013 Warriors of the Final Holy Battle]] CD.\n\n==Heaven Chapter: Overture (2004)==\n:''Original title: ''Saint Seiya: Tenkaihen Jos\u014d Overture\n\n[[Image:Tenkai Overture Cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|DVD cover of Heaven Chapter: Overture]]\nAfter the success of the OVA series ''Hades - Chapter Sanctuary'', this movie served as a continuation to the Hades saga. Injured after his confrontation with Hades, Seiya is in a coma and under Saori's care. The Goddess Artemis, Saori's older sister, comes to Earth to ask why she is not fulfilling her duties as a Goddess and takes control of Sanctuary in her stead. Hoping that it may bring peace on Earth, Saori goes to the Sanctuary and starts spilling her blood and it is up to the Bronze Saints to save her.\n\nAfter the bloody battle against [[Hades (Saint Seiya)|Hades]], goddess [[Athena (Saint Seiya)|Athena]]'s Saints are still recovering when they find themselves face to face with their newest and most formidable foe: the dreadful goddess [[Artemis (Saint Seiya)|Artemis]], accompanied by her [[#Angels|Angels]]. Artemis replaces Athena as the [[Earth]] guardian deity and takes over the Sanctuary, turning Athena's Saints into her servants.\n\nUpon invading the Sanctuary, the Bronze Saints learn that Athena was banished by Artemis and decide to fight the moon goddess in order to rescue their true goddess and free the Earth from Artemis's ominous control.\n\nThe movie focuses mostly on Seiya and Athena, as the other Bronze Saints are not seen as much; they only appear during their respective fights with the other Angels, and briefly towards the end. However, [[Eagle Marin]] also appears, as [[Ophiuchus Shaina]], [[Unicorn Jabu]], and [[Hydra Ichi]] do, though the latter three are just cameos.\n\nThe movie also has a very ambiguous ending, with many plot points and danglers unresolved.\n\n==Legend of Sanctuary (2014)==\n{{Empty section|date=September 2013}}\n{{Main|Saint Seiya: Legend of Sanctuary}}\n\n==Live-action (TBA)==\nA Live Action film was announced at Comic Con Brazil 2016.<ref name=\"crunchyroll\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Saint Seiya}}\n\n[[Category:Saint Seiya lists|Films]]\n[[Category:Shueisha franchises|Saint Seiya (film series)]]\n[[Category:1987 anime films]]\n[[Category:1988 anime films]]\n[[Category:1989 anime films]]\n[[Category:2004 anime films]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime films|Saint Seiya]]\n[[Category:Japanese animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Discotek Media]]\n[[Category:Lists of films by franchise]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toCorona(link changed toStellar corona) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saint_Seiya_films"}
