His lyrics often focus on the underbelly of society and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He worked primarily in jazz during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected greater influence from blues, rock, vaudeville, and experimental genres.\n\nWaits was born and raised in a middle-class family in [[Pomona, California]]. Inspired by the work of [[Bob Dylan]] and the [[Beat Generation]], he began singing on the San Diego [[folk music]] circuit as a teenager. He relocated to [[Los Angeles]] in 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with [[Asylum Records]]. His first albums were the jazz-oriented ''[[Closing Time (album)|Closing Time]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Heart of Saturday Night]]'' (1974), which reflected his lyrical interest in nightlife, poverty, and criminality. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe, and Japan, and attracted greater critical recognition and commercial success with ''[[Small Change (Tom Waits album)|Small Change]]'' (1976), ''[[Blue Valentine (album)|Blue Valentine]]'' (1978), and ''[[Heartattack and Vine]]'' (1980). He produced the soundtrack for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[One from the Heart]]'' (1981), and subsequently made cameo appearances in several Coppola films.\n\nIn 1980, Waits married [[Kathleen Brennan]], split from his manager and record label, and moved to [[New York City]]. With Brennan's encouragement and frequent collaboration, he pursued a more experimental and eclectic musical aesthetic influenced by the work of [[Harry Partch]] and [[Captain Beefheart]]. This was reflected in a series of albums released by [[Island Records]], including ''[[Swordfishtrombones]]'' (1983), ''[[Rain Dogs]]'' (1985), and ''[[Franks Wild Years]]'' (1987). He continued appearing in films, notably starring in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Down by Law (film)|Down by Law]]'' (1986), and also made theatrical appearances. With theatre director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], he produced the musicals ''[[The Black Rider]]'' and ''Alice'', first performed in [[Hamburg]]. Having returned to California in the 1990s, his albums ''[[Bone Machine]]'' (1992), ''[[The Black Rider (album)|The Black Rider]]'' (1993), and ''[[Mule Variations]]'' (1999) earned him increasing critical acclaim and multiple Grammy Awards. In the late 1990s, he switched to the record label [[Anti- (record label)|ANTI-]], which released ''[[Blood Money (Tom Waits album)|Blood Money]]'' (2002), ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' (2002), ''[[Real Gone (album)|Real Gone]]'' (2004), and ''[[Bad as Me]]'' (2011).\n\nDespite a lack of mainstream commercial success, Waits has influenced many musicians and gained an international [[cult following]]. In 2011, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 2015, he was ranked at No. 55 on ''[[Rolling Stone magazine|Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]]\". Several biographies have also been written about him.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood: 1949\u20131971===\n[[File:Whittier CA seen from Hellman park (Peppergrass) trail.jpg|thumb|right|Waits' childhood home in [[Whittier, California]]]]\n\nThomas Alan Waits was born on December 7, 1949, in [[Pomona, California]].{{sfnm|1a1=Humphries|1y=2007|1p=10|2a1=Hoskyns|2y=2009|2p=6}} He has one older sister and one younger sister.{{sfnm|1a1=Humphries|1y=2007|1p=11|2a1=Hoskyns|2y=2009|2p=4}} His father, Jesse Frank Waits, was a [[Texas]] native of Scots-Irish descent, while his mother, Alma Fern (n\u00e9e Johnson), hailed from [[Oregon]] and had Norwegian ancestry.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=6}}<ref>https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sandiegouniontribune/obituary.aspx?n=alma-fern-mcmurray-waits&pid=140080899</ref> Alma was a conventional housewife and regular church-goer.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=7}} Jesse taught Spanish at a local school and was an alcoholic; Waits later related that his father was \"a tough one, always an outsider\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|pp=7, 8}} The family lived at 318 North Pickering Avenue in [[Whittier, California]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=4}} He described having a \"very middle-class\" upbringing and \"a pretty normal childhood\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|pp=4, 27}} He attended Jordan Elementary School, where he was bullied.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|pp=8, 13}} There, he learned to play the bugle and guitar,{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|pp=13, 16}} while his father taught him to play the ukulele.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=14}} During the summers, he visited maternal relatives in [[Gridley, California|Gridley]] and [[Marysville, California|Marysville]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=11}} He later recalled that it was an uncle's raspy, gravelly voice that inspired the manner in which he later sang.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=9}}\n\nIn 1959, his parents separated and his father moved away from the family home, which was a traumatic experience for 10-year-old Waits.{{sfnm|1a1=Humphries|1y=2007|1p=16|2a1=Hoskyns|2y=2009|2p=17}} Alma took her children and relocated to [[Chula Vista]], a middle-class suburb of [[San Diego]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=17}} Jesse visited the family there, taking his children on trips to [[Tijuana]].{{sfnm|1a1=Humphries|1y=2007|1p=17|2a1=Hoskyns|2y=2009|2p=19}} In Chula Vista, Waits attended [[O'Farrell Community School]], where he fronted a school band, the Systems,{{sfnm|1a1=Humphries|1y=2007|1p=22|2a1=Hoskyns|2y=2009|2p=22}} later describing the group as \"white kids trying to get that Motown sound\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=22}} He developed a love of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]] singers like [[Ray Charles]], [[James Brown]], and [[Wilson Pickett]],{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=21}} as well as country music and [[Roy Orbison]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=19}} [[Bob Dylan]] later became a strong influence, with Waits placing transcriptions of Dylan's lyrics on his bedroom walls.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|pp=22\u201323}} He was an avid watcher of ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=26}} By the time he was studying at Hilltop High School, he later related, he was \"kind of an amateur juvenile delinquent\", interested in \"malicious mischief\" and breaking the law.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=23}} He later described himself as a \"rebel against the rebels\", for he eschewed the [[hippie]] subculture which was growing in popularity and was instead inspired by the 1950s [[Beat generation]],{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=35}} having a love of Beat writers like [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], and [[William S.

American singer, songwriter, musician, composer, and actor. His lyrics often focus on the underbelly of society and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He worked primarily in jazz during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected greater influence from blues, rock, vaudeville, and experimental genres.\n\nWaits was born and raised in a middle-class family in [[Pomona, California]]. Inspired by the work of [[Bob Dylan]] and the [[Beat Generation]], he began singing on the San Diego [[folk music]] circuit as a teenager. He relocated to [[Los Angeles]] in 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with [[Asylum Records]]. His first albums were the jazz-oriented ''[[Closing Time (album)|Closing Time]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Heart of Saturday Night]]'' (1974), which reflected his lyrical interest in nightlife, poverty, and criminality. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe, and Japan, and attracted greater critical recognition and commercial success with ''[[Small Change (Tom Waits album)|Small Change]]'' (1976), ''[[Blue Valentine (album)|Blue Valentine]]'' (1978), and ''[[Heartattack and Vine]]'' (1980). He produced the soundtrack for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[One from the Heart]]'' (1981), and subsequently made cameo appearances in several Coppola films.\n\nIn 1980, Waits married [[Kathleen Brennan]], split from his manager and record label, and moved to [[New York City]]. With Brennan's encouragement and frequent collaboration, he pursued a more experimental and eclectic musical aesthetic influenced by the work of [[Harry Partch]] and [[Captain Beefheart]]. This was reflected in a series of albums released by [[Island Records]], including ''[[Swordfishtrombones]]'' (1983), ''[[Rain Dogs]]'' (1985), and ''[[Franks Wild Years]]'' (1987). He continued appearing in films, notably starring in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Down by Law (film)|Down by Law]]'' (1986), and also made theatrical appearances. With theatre director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], he produced the musicals ''[[The Black Rider]]'' and ''Alice'', first performed in [[Hamburg]]. Having returned to California in the 1990s, his albums ''[[Bone Machine]]'' (1992), ''[[The Black Rider (album)|The Black Rider]]'' (1993), and ''[[Mule Variations]]'' (1999) earned him increasing critical acclaim and multiple Grammy Awards. In the late 1990s, he switched to the record label [[Anti- (record label)|ANTI-]], which released ''[[Blood Money (Tom Waits album)|Blood Money]]'' (2002), ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' (2002), ''[[Real Gone (album)|Real Gone]]'' (2004), and ''[[Bad as Me]]'' (2011).\n\nDespite a lack of mainstream commercial success, Waits has influenced many musicians and gained an international [[cult following]].

Argentina had had a goal difference of +2, but in its last group match, it defeated Peru 6\u20130, and thus qualified for the final in a match accused of ultimately-unproven [[match fixing]].
