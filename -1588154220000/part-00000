He was also closely associated with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool Philharmonic]] and [[The Hall\u00e9|Hall\u00e9]] orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and, according to the [[BBC]], was Britain's first international conductor.\n\nBorn to a rich industrial family, Beecham began his career as a conductor in 1899. He used his access to the family fortune to finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War, staging seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] with international stars, his own orchestra and a wide repertoire. Among the works he introduced to England were [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and three operas by [[Frederick Delius]].\n\nTogether with his younger colleague [[Malcolm Sargent]], Beecham founded the London Philharmonic, and he conducted its first performance at the [[Queen's Hall]] in 1932. In the 1940s he worked for three years in the United States where he was music director of the [[Seattle Symphony]] and conducted at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. After his return to Britain, he founded the Royal Philharmonic in 1946 and conducted it until his death in 1961.\n\nBeecham's repertoire was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers whose works were neglected in Britain before he became their advocate, such as Delius and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and the composer he revered above all others, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:BeechamsBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|alt=exterior of nineteenth century industrial building|The Beecham factory in St Helens]]\nBeecham was born in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], Lancashire (now Merseyside), in a house adjoining the [[Beecham's Pills]] laxative factory founded by his grandfather, [[Thomas Beecham (chemist)|Thomas Beecham]].<ref name=reid19>Reid, p. 19</ref> His parents were [[Sir Joseph Beecham, 1st Baronet|Joseph Beecham]], the elder son of Thomas, and Josephine, ''n\u00e9e'' Burnett.<ref name=reid19/> He was an uncle of poet [[Audrey Beecham]].

He paid little attention to the box office: his programmes were described by a biographer as \"even more certain to deter the public then than it would be in our own day\".<ref name=reid55>Reid, p. 55</ref>  The principal pieces of his first concert with the orchestra were [[Vincent d'Indy|d'Indy]]'s symphonic ballad ''La for\u00eat enchant\u00e9e'', [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana|Smetana]]'s symphonic poem ''\u0160\u00e1rka'', and [[\u00c9douard Lalo|Lalo]]'s little-known [[Symphony in G minor (Lalo)|Symphony in G minor]].<ref>Reid, pp. 55\u201356</ref> Beecham retained an affection for the last work: it was among the works he conducted at his final recording sessions more than fifty years later.<ref name=salter>Salter, p. 4; and Procter-Gregg, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\nIn 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, the deputy system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert.<ref>Russell, p. 10</ref>  The treasurer of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] described it thus: \"''A'', whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends ''B'' (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. ''B'', without your knowledge or consent, sends ''C'' to the second rehearsal.

As a result of his estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of \u00a3700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts,<ref name=reid62>Reid, p. 62</ref> but it was not until father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.<ref>Reid, p. 88</ref>\n\n===1910\u20131920===\nFrom 1910, subsidised by his father, Beecham realised his ambition to mount opera seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] and other houses.

in 1948]]\n'''Sir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet''', [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]] (29 April 1879{{spaced ndash}}8 March 1961) was an English conductor and [[impresario]] best known for his association with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|Royal Philharmonic]] orchestras. He was also closely associated with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool Philharmonic]] and [[The Hall\u00e9|Hall\u00e9]] orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and, according to the [[BBC]], was Britain's first international conductor.\n\nBorn to a rich industrial family, Beecham began his career as a conductor in 1899. He used his access to the family fortune to finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War, staging seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] with international stars, his own orchestra and a wide repertoire. Among the works he introduced to England were [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and three operas by [[Frederick Delius]].\n\nTogether with his younger colleague [[Malcolm Sargent]], Beecham founded the London Philharmonic, and he conducted its first performance at the [[Queen's Hall]] in 1932. In the 1940s he worked for three years in the United States where he was music director of the [[Seattle Symphony]] and conducted at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. After his return to Britain, he founded the Royal Philharmonic in 1946 and conducted it until his death in 1961.\n\nBeecham's repertoire was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers whose works were neglected in Britain before he became their advocate, such as Delius and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and the composer he revered above all others, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:BeechamsBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|alt=exterior of nineteenth century industrial building|The Beecham factory in St Helens]]\nBeecham was born in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], Lancashire (now Merseyside), in a house adjoining the [[Beecham's Pills]] laxative factory founded by his grandfather, [[Thomas Beecham (chemist)|Thomas Beecham]].<ref name=reid19>Reid, p. 19</ref> His parents were [[Sir Joseph Beecham, 1st Baronet|Joseph Beecham]], the elder son of Thomas, and Josephine, ''n\u00e9e'' Burnett.<ref name=reid19/> He was an uncle of poet [[Audrey Beecham]].

In his early discussions with his new orchestra, he proposed works by a long list of barely known composers such as [[\u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul]], [[Nicolas Dalayrac]] and [[Ferdinando Paer]].<ref>Reid, p. 54</ref> During this period, Beecham first encountered the music of [[Frederick Delius]], which he at once loved deeply and with which he became closely associated for the rest of his life.<ref>Jefferson, p. 32</ref>\n\nBeecham quickly concluded that to compete with the two existing London orchestras, the [[Queen's Hall]] Orchestra and the recently founded [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO), his forces must be expanded to full symphonic strength and play in larger halls.<ref>Lucas, p. 24</ref> For two years starting in October 1907, Beecham and the enlarged New Symphony Orchestra gave concerts at the Queen's Hall. He paid little attention to the box office: his programmes were described by a biographer as \"even more certain to deter the public then than it would be in our own day\".<ref name=reid55>Reid, p. 55</ref>  The principal pieces of his first concert with the orchestra were [[Vincent d'Indy|d'Indy]]'s symphonic ballad ''La for\u00eat enchant\u00e9e'', [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana|Smetana]]'s symphonic poem ''\u0160\u00e1rka'', and [[\u00c9douard Lalo|Lalo]]'s little-known [[Symphony in G minor (Lalo)|Symphony in G minor]].<ref>Reid, pp. 55\u201356</ref> Beecham retained an affection for the last work: it was among the works he conducted at his final recording sessions more than fifty years later.<ref name=salter>Salter, p. 4; and Procter-Gregg, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\nIn 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, the deputy system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert.<ref>Russell, p. 10</ref>  The treasurer of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] described it thus: \"''A'', whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends ''B'' (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. ''B'', without your knowledge or consent, sends ''C'' to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, ''C'' sends ''D'', whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away.\"<ref>Reid, p. 50</ref>{{refn|The lines are put into Beecham's mouth in the 1980 play ''Beecham'' by [[Caryl Brahms]] and [[Ned Sherrin]].|group= n}} [[Henry Wood]] had already banned the deputy system in the Queen's Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit.<ref name=reid70>Reid, p. 70</ref> The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the [[Royal Albert Hall]] Orchestra.<ref name=reid70/>\n\nIn 1909, Beecham founded the Beecham Symphony Orchestra.<ref name=reid71>Reid, p. 71</ref> He did not poach from established symphony orchestras, but instead he recruited from theatre bandrooms, local symphony societies, the [[palm court]]s of hotels, and music colleges.<ref>Reid, pp. 70\u201371</ref> The result was a youthful team&nbsp;\u2013 the typical age of his players was 25. They included names that would become celebrated in their fields, such as [[Albert Sammons]], [[Lionel Tertis]], [[Eric Coates]] and [[Eugene Cruft]].<ref name=reid71/>\n\nBecause he persistently programmed works that did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As a result of his estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of \u00a3700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts,<ref name=reid62>Reid, p. 62</ref> but it was not until father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.<ref>Reid, p. 88</ref>\n\n===1910\u20131920===\nFrom 1910, subsidised by his father, Beecham realised his ambition to mount opera seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] and other houses. In the [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] opera house, the star singers were regarded as all-important, and conductors were seen as ancillary.<ref name=reid98>Reid, p. 98</ref> Between 1910 and 1939 Beecham did much to change the balance of power.<ref name=reid98/>\n\n[[File:Beecham-Strauss-Pitt-Walter.jpg|thumb|left|alt=face shots of four middle aged men, one bearded, one moustached, two clean shaven|Clockwise from top left: Beecham, [[Richard Strauss]], [[Bruno Walter]] and [[Percy Pitt]], all in 1910]]\nIn 1910, Beecham either conducted or was responsible as [[impresario]] for 190&nbsp;performances at Covent Garden and [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]].

Extreme economy in productions and great attention to the box-office were essential, and Beecham, though he had been hurt and furious at his exclusion, was not suited to participate in such an undertaking.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 106</ref> When offered a chorus of eighty singers for his return, conducting ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg|Die Meistersinger]]'', he insisted on augmenting their number to 200.

The horses were their most treasured possession since they were crucial for income and survival. They [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] their horses, keeping records of the [[pedigree chart|pedigrees]] via an [[oral tradition]]. Horses were managed and trained in very specific ways. Stallions were tethered next to the tent while mares and foals were free to seek forage. The stallions were covered from head to tail with up to seven layers of felt, which kept their coat short and shiny. Before raids they were put on a sparse diet to prepare them for the long ride through the desert with no water and hardly any feed.<ref>\u00c0 travers l'Asie Centrale: la Steppe kirghize, le Turkestan russe, Boukhara, Khiva, le pays des Turcomans et la Perse, impressions de voyage; Author: Henri Moser; Publisher: Plon, 1885; pp. 321-322 in Original from Princeton University; Digitized June 2, 2009; Length 463 pages</ref> The horses were called ''Argamaks'' (divine or Sacred Horses) by the [[Russia]]ns,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v3cEAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=snippet&q=argamaks&f=false Khiva and Turkestan], translated from Russian by Captain Henry Spalding FRGS, London, Chapman and Hall, 1874, p. 216</ref> and were cherished by those who valued their speed and stamina in the desert and loyalty to their owner.

The tribes fought with the [[tsar]], eventually losing.  In the process, however, the Russian general [[Kuropatkin]] developed a fondness for horses he had seen while fighting the tribesmen, founded a breeding farm after the war and renamed the horses, ''\"Akhal-Tekes\"'', after the Teke Turkmen tribe that lived around the Akhal oasis (near [[Geok Tepe]]).

In some cases, the front teeth are in at birth or molars grow abnormally from normal jaws. Other symptoms include persistent [[diarrhea]], frequent digestive disorders, and [[laminitis]]-like, treatment-resistant rotation of the [[coffin bone]]s in the [[horse hoof|hooves]]. Due the lack of normal skin protection, secondary symptoms include scaly, dry, and inflamed skin, as well as severe cases of sunburn in summer, and frequent pulmonary infections during winter. NFS is always fatal, most foals die within weeks of birth, although some horses have survived up to the age of two years. Early demise is usually caused by digestive problems, whereas older horses need to be humanely [[animal euthanasia|euthanized]] because of severe laminitis-induced pain. Some carriers have been identified, including 943 Arslan, 736 Keymir, 2001 Mariula, or 1054 Gilkuyruk, but the estimated number of unknown cases is likely higher, as several Russian and Turkmenian breeders have acknowledged that NFS foals are often just reported as stillborn or aborted.<ref>\"The Stavropol Sphinx\", Akhal Teke Inform 2006</ref><ref>e.g. \"10th Studbook, tome II, page 160\": 2860 Mriya, naked foal (dead) b.2000, by 1201 Kavkas, published in 2005 by VNIIK, Ryasan</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hairless Foal Photos|accessdate=May 8, 2010|url= http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/hairless/hairlesshorsephotos.html|publisher=Ultimatehorsesite.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082839/http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/hairless/hairlesshorsephotos.html|archivedate=June 10, 2011}}</ref>\n* ''Hereditary [[cryptorchidism]]'' exists within the Akhal-Teke breed and affected stallions can be traced through multiple generations.

Arthur and Adrian eventually show up, but Sam is caught and taken into custody. Arthur has to get Adrian, in his official capacity as the local [[justice of the peace]], to allow him to bail out their fellow poacher.\n\nThe next morning, Miranda is delighted to learn that Denys has changed his mind and declined the Hollywood job. It soon becomes apparent that he has also drastically changed his view of Miranda as well. Adrian, emboldened by his experience the night before, proposes to and is accepted by Mary.

His father, [[Louis I of Anjou]]{{mdash}}the founder of the [[House of Valois-Anjou]]{{mdash}}was a younger son of King [[John II of France]] and the adopted son of Queen [[Joanna I of Naples]]. When his father died during a military campaign in Naples in 1384, Louis II was still a child. He inherited Anjou from his father, but his mother, [[Marie of Blois, Duchess of Anjou|Marie of Blois]], could not convince his uncles, [[John, Duke of Berry]] and [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy]], to continue her husband's war for Naples. The Proven\u00e7al nobles and towns refused to acknowledge Louis II as their lawful ruler, but Marie of Blois persuaded them one after another to swear fealty to him between 1385 and 1387.\n\nHis cousin, King [[Charles VI of France]] decided to support Louis II's bid for Naples in 1389. After [[Antipope Clement VII]] crowned him king in [[Avignon]] on 1 November 1389, Louis II moved to Naples. His troops could not occupy the whole kingdom, thus it was practically divided between Louis II and his opponent, [[Ladislaus of Naples]]. The conflict between Clement VII's successor, [[Antipope Benedict XIII]], and France weakened Louis' position and Ladislaus forced him to leave Naples for Provence in 1399.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLouis was the elder of the two sons of Louis I of Anjou and Marie of Blois.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=xiv}} Louis I was a younger son of King John II of France who granted [[Duchy of Anjou|Anjou]] and [[Maine (province)|Maine]] to him as hereditary [[appanage]] in 1360.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=12}} The childless Queen [[Joanna I of Naples]] adopted Louis I as her son and heir in 1380,{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=12}} because she needed French support against her rival, [[Charles III of Naples|Charles of Durazzo]].{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=168}} The rulers of Naples had acknowledged the popes' suzerainty since 1130, but two rival popes were competing for the supreme authority after the [[Western Schism|Western Schism of 1378]].{{sfn|Peyronnet|2016|p=32}} Joanna's subjects regarded [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]] as the lawful pope, but she preferred Urban's opponent, Clement VII.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|pp=167\u2013168}} In retaliation, Pope Urban confirmed Charles' claim to her realms and crowned him king of Naples (formally, king of Sicily) in Rome in June 1381.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=168}} Charles of Durazzo invaded southern Italy, but Louis I could not leave France to protect his adoptive mother, because his brother, King [[Charles V of France]] had recently died.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=168}} Charles of Durazzo captured Queen Joanna and occupied Naples in September.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=439\u2013440}}\n\nLouis I was determined to seize her inheritance, which included the counties of [[County of Provence|Provence]] and [[County of

marriage were related to his father's search for allies against Charles of Durazzo.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=14}} In November 1381, Louis I was planning to forge an alliance with [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] through the marriage of Louis and Louis' younger brother, [[Charles, Prince of Taranto|Charles]], with King [[Peter IV of Aragon]]'s granddaughters, [[Joanna of Aragon, Countess of Foix|Joanna]] and [[Yolande of Aragon|Yolande]].{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=14}} The plan was soon set aside, because Louis I realized that an alliance with a powerful Italian ruler could serve his purposes.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=14\u201315}} After in early 1382 he decided to launch a military campaign against Charles of Durazzo, he started negotiations with [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti]], [[Lord of Milan]].{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}} Bernab\u00f2 agreed to hire troops to fight against Charles of Durazzo and engaged his daughter, [[Lucia Visconti|Lucia]], to Louis on 13 March 1382.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nLouis I had meanwhile come to [[Avignon]] where (Anti)pope Clement VII crowned him king.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}}{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=399}} He took possession of Provence and Forcalquier, allowing his mercenaries to freely loot the two counties.{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=399}} His military campaign decided Queen Joanna's fate, because Charles of Durazzo ordered her jailers to smother her in July.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}} Louis I crossed the borders of the Kingdom of Naples in September, but Charles of Durazzo avoid to give a pitched battle.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}}{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=401}} Louis I's most mercenaries deserted by the end of 1382, forcing him to offer to abandon his claim to Naples in return for Provence, but Charles of Durazzo rejected his offer.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}}{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=401}} The seven-year-old Louis, who was staying in Anjou, sent a ring to Lucia Visconti to Milan in token of their engagement on 6 May 1384.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=15}} He was styled as [[Duke of Calabria]] in the letter.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=15}}\n\nLouis I died in [[Bari]] on 20 September 1384.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=534}} In his last will, he asked Clement VII to support his son to seize the Kingdom of Naples.{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=408}} He appointed [[Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy|Enguerrand VII of Coucy]] to administer the occupied parts of the kingdom as viceroy, stipulating that his widow could only remove Coucy with the consent of his brothers, John, Duke of Berry and Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, and their nephew, King [[Charles VI of France]].{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=408}}\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Minority===\n\nLouis was only seven when his father died.{{sfn|Peyronnet|2016|p=34}} The widowed Marie of Blois tried to persuade Louis' two uncles, Philip II of Burgundy and John of Berry, to continue the military campaign against Naples.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=535}} Bernab\u00f2 Visconti supported her efforts, but both dukes refused to spend more money on the unsuccessful enterprise.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=535}} The Duke of Burgundy clearly stated that \"all these little ventures\" should be forgotten.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=535}} Bernab\u00f2 Visconti was killed on 6 May 1385, which put an end to negotiations about the marriage of his daughter and Louis.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=15}}\n\nMost towns and noblemen supported Charles of Durazzo in Provence and Forcelquier.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} They entered into a formal alliance against Louis and his mother in [[Aix-en-Provence]].{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} Marie of Blois who was determined to restore their rule in the two wealthy counties hurried to Marseille.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} Louis accompanied his mother and they jointly received the swear of fealty of the three highest-ranking magistrates of the town on 24 August 1385.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} In return, they ceremoniusly pledged that they would always observe the burghers' liberties.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} Marie of Blois entered into negotiations with the members of the League of Aix and persuaded them one by one to accept Louis' rule during the following two years.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|pp=50\u201355}}\n\nCharles of Durazzo fell victim to a plot while staying in Hungary in February 1386.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|pp=168\u2013169}} His ten-year-old son, Ladislaus, succeeded him under the guardianship of his mother, [[Margaret of Durazzo]].{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=779}} Urban VI's successor, [[Pope Boniface IX]], confirmed Ladislaus' right to rule the Kingdom of Naples.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=169}} Marie of Blois started negotiations about Louis' marriage with Ladislaus' sister, [[Joanna II of Naples|Joanna]], but Louis flatly refused to marry the daughter of his father's principal enemy in May 1387.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=17, 206}} Louis' supporters took possession of the town of Naples,{{sfn|Peyronnet|2016|p=34}} but his adversaries were able to retain the two most important fortresses, the [[Castel Nuovo]] and [[Castel Sant'Elmo]].{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=779}}\n\nCharles VI of France reached the age of majority, dismissed the dukes of Burgundy and Berry and decided to provide support to Louis.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=666, 779}} He [[Accolade|knighted]] Louis and his brother, Charles, at [[Basilica of Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis Abbey]] in Paris in May 1389.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=668\u2013669}} The celebrations which lasted for a week were \"carefully stage-managed propaganda for the royal house, deliberately contrived to show its fortunes in the hands of a younger generation\", according to historian [[Jonathan Sumption, Lord Sumption|Jonathan Sumption]].{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=669}} He promised to grant 300,000 florins to Louis to finance a military campaign to southern Italy.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=779}} (Anti)pope Clement VII soon promised to pay further 500,000 florins to Louis.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=779\u2013780}} Charles VI announced his decision to the burghers of Naples in a letter that was read out in the [[Naples Cathedral]] soon after the ritual liquefaction of the blood of [[Januarius|Saint Januarius]].{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=780}}\n\n===Naples===\n\nAntipope Clement VII crowned Louis king in the chapel of the [[Palais des Papes|Popes' Palace]] in Avignon on 1 November 1389.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=781}} Charles VI of France and his younger brother, [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Louis of

alliance.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=781}}\n\nLouis and his fleet of about 40 galleys sailed from Marseille in July 1390 and reached the [[Bay of Naples]] on 6 August.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=782}} His troops captured the Castel Sant'Elmo in October, and the Castel Nuovo weeks later.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=782}} Clement VII's [[papal legate|legate]], Cardinal [[Pierre de Thury]], who had accompanied Louis to Naples, administered the kingdom efficiently on his behalf.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=19}} Louis was engaged to King [[John I of Aragon]]'s daughter, Yolande.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=18\u201319}} Clement VII provided regular financial support to Louis{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=802}} whose troops achieved a series of major victories and captured [[Amalfi]] and [[Ravello]] in 1392.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=19}}{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}} Most [[Calabria]]n barons (including the heads of the powerful [[House of Sanseverino|Sanseverino]] and [[Ruffo di Calabria|Ruffo]] families) also swore fealty to him by the autumn of 1392.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}}{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=169}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=802}} In practice, the Kingdom of Naples was divided between Louis and Ladislaus.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=169}}\n\nCharles VI of France showed the first symptoms of madness on 5 August 1392, which enabled Philip II of Burgundy to strengthen his position at the French royal court.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=802\u2013803}} In November, Visconti sent an envoy to Paris to persuade the French to launch further military campaigns to Italy.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=802}} Louis of Turenne, who had received the [[Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duchy of Orl\u00e9ans]] from Charles VI, supported the plan, because he wanted to conquer large parts of the [[Papal States]] for himself; his maternal uncle, [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon]], also decided to lead a French army to Naples to support Louis.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=802\u2013803}} However, negotiations with their potential Italian allies and Clement VII proved that their goals could hardly be achieved, because of the lack of sufficient financial support.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=803}}\n\nClement VII died unexpectedly in Avignon on 16 September 1394.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=816}} Charles VI and his counsellors wanted to put an end to the schism and asked Clement VII's cardinals not to elect a new pope.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=817}} However, the cardinals ignored their request and elected an Aragonese cardinal who took the name Benedict XIII.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=818}} Louis supported Benedict,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} but the French prelates decided to enforce the abdication of both popes at their general assembly in Paris on 2 February 1395.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=819}} Louis of Orl\u00e9ans was determined to continue the military operations in Italy, but Charles VI's queen, [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], and Philip II of Burgundy convinced him to withdraw his troops from Italy in late February.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=820\u2013821}}\n\nThe conflict between France and Benedict XIII weakened Louis' position and Ladislaus could take advantage of his difficulties.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}} When analysing their situation, historian Alan Ryder concludes that Louis revealed a \"character devoid of leadership\" and Ladislaus displayed that \"acumen and ruthlessness which were to make him the terror of Italy\".{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=57}} Louis' real authority was restricted to the city of Naples, because the Calabrian barons only formally acknowledged his rule.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=57}} Charles VI of France openly abandoned Louis' case when he signed a treaty with Florence, promising not to intervene in Naples.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=57}}\n\nThe French clergy withdrew from the obedience to Benedict XIII and a French army laid siege to Avignon in July 1398.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=845}} The legitimacy of Louis's rule in Naples derived from his coronation by Benedict XIII's predecessor, but his mother who administered Provence was to support the French action.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=22, 208}} Deprived of his revenues from France, Benedict XIII was no more able to finance Louis's troops in Naples.{{sfn|Peyronnet|2016|p=34}} The Apulian barons rose up against Louis, forcing him to launch a military campaign to Apulia in February 1399.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=19\u201320}} The Sanseverini abandoned him and his absence from Naples enabled Ladislaus to seize the town on 10 July.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=20}} Louis could not continue the fight and left southern Italy for Provence in the same month.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=57}}\n\n===In France===\n\nLouis married Yolande of Aragon at the [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles|St. Trophime Cathedral]] in [[Arles]] on 2 December 1400.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=50}} On the same day, she was crowned queen.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=50}}\n\nHe founded a university in [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 1409.\n\nIn 1409, Louis liberated [[Rome]] from Ladislaus' occupation; in 1410, as an ally of the [[antipope John XXIII]] he attacked Ladislaus and defeated him at [[Roccasecca]] (1411).{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=52}} Eventually Louis lost his Neapolitan support and had to retire. His claim to Naples passed to his son, [[Louis III of Anjou|Louis III]].{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=52}}\n\nHe married his first cousin once removed [[Yolande of Aragon]] (1384&ndash;1443) in [[Arles]] in 1400,{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=51}} giving him a possibility of inheriting the throne of [[Aragon]] through her right.

His father, [[Louis I of Anjou]]{{mdash}}the founder of the [[House of Valois-Anjou]]{{mdash}}was a younger son of King [[John II of France]] and the adopted son of Queen [[Joanna I of Naples]]. When his father died during a military campaign in Naples in 1384, Louis II was still a child. He inherited Anjou from his father, but his mother, [[Marie of Blois, Duchess of Anjou|Marie of Blois]], could not convince his uncles, [[John, Duke of Berry]] and [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy]], to continue her husband's war for Naples. The Proven\u00e7al nobles and towns refused to acknowledge Louis II as their lawful ruler, but Marie of Blois persuaded them one after another to swear fealty to him between 1385 and 1387.\n\nHis cousin, King [[Charles VI of France]] decided to support Louis II's bid for Naples in 1389. After [[Antipope Clement VII]] crowned him king in [[Avignon]] on 1 November 1389, Louis II moved to Naples. His troops could not occupy the whole kingdom, thus it was practically divided between Louis II and his opponent, [[Ladislaus of Naples]]. The conflict between Clement VII's successor, [[Antipope Benedict XIII]], and France weakened Louis' position and Ladislaus forced him to leave Naples for Provence in 1399.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLouis was the elder of the two sons of Louis I of Anjou and Marie of Blois.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=xiv}} Louis I was a younger son of King John II of France who granted [[Duchy of Anjou|Anjou]] and [[Maine (province)|Maine]] to him as hereditary [[appanage]] in 1360.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=12}} The childless Queen [[Joanna I of Naples]] adopted Louis I as her son and heir in 1380,{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=12}} because she needed French support against her rival, [[Charles III of Naples|Charles of Durazzo]].{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=168}} The rulers of Naples had acknowledged the popes' suzerainty since 1130, but two rival popes were competing for the supreme authority after the [[Western Schism|Western Schism of 1378]].{{sfn|Peyronnet|2016|p=32}} Joanna's subjects regarded [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]] as the lawful pope, but she preferred Urban's opponent, Clement VII.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|pp=167\u2013168}} In retaliation, Pope Urban confirmed Charles' claim to her realms and crowned him king of Naples (formally, king of Sicily) in Rome in June 1381.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=168}} Charles of Durazzo invaded southern Italy, but Louis I could not leave France to protect his adoptive mother, because his brother, King [[Charles V of France]] had recently died.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=168}} Charles of Durazzo captured Queen Joanna and occupied Naples in September.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=439\u2013440}}\n\nLouis I was determined to seize her inheritance, which included the counties of [[County of Provence|Provence]] and [[County of

marriage were related to his father's search for allies against Charles of Durazzo.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=14}} In November 1381, Louis I was planning to forge an alliance with [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] through the marriage of Louis and Louis' younger brother, [[Charles, Prince of Taranto|Charles]], with King [[Peter IV of Aragon]]'s granddaughters, [[Joanna of Aragon, Countess of Foix|Joanna]] and [[Yolande of Aragon|Yolande]].{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=14}} The plan was soon set aside, because Louis I realized that an alliance with a powerful Italian ruler could serve his purposes.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=14\u201315}} After in early 1382 he decided to launch a military campaign against Charles of Durazzo, he started negotiations with [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti]], [[Lord of Milan]].{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}} Bernab\u00f2 agreed to hire troops to fight against Charles of Durazzo and engaged his daughter, [[Lucia Visconti|Lucia]], to Louis on 13 March 1382.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nLouis I had meanwhile come to [[Avignon]] where (Anti)pope Clement VII crowned him king.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}}{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=399}} He took possession of Provence and Forcalquier, allowing his mercenaries to freely loot the two counties.{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=399}} His military campaign decided Queen Joanna's fate, because Charles of Durazzo ordered her jailers to smother her in July.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}} Louis I crossed the borders of the Kingdom of Naples in September, but Charles of Durazzo avoid to give a pitched battle.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}}{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=401}} Louis I's most mercenaries deserted by the end of 1382, forcing him to offer to abandon his claim to Naples in return for Provence, but Charles of Durazzo rejected his offer.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=440}}{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=401}} The seven-year-old Louis, who was staying in Anjou, sent a ring to Lucia Visconti to Milan in token of their engagement on 6 May 1384.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=15}} He was styled as [[Duke of Calabria]] in the letter.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=15}}\n\nLouis I died in [[Bari]] on 20 September 1384.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=534}} In his last will, he asked Clement VII to support his son to seize the Kingdom of Naples.{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=408}} He appointed [[Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy|Enguerrand VII of Coucy]] to administer the occupied parts of the kingdom as viceroy, stipulating that his widow could only remove Coucy with the consent of his brothers, John, Duke of Berry and Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, and their nephew, King [[Charles VI of France]].{{sfn|Tuchman|1978|p=408}}\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Minority===\n\nLouis was only seven when his father died.{{sfn|Peyronnet|2016|p=34}} The widowed Marie of Blois tried to persuade Louis' two uncles, Philip II of Burgundy and John of Berry, to continue the military campaign against Naples.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=535}} Bernab\u00f2 Visconti supported her efforts, but both dukes refused to spend more money on the unsuccessful enterprise.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=535}} The Duke of Burgundy clearly stated that \"all these little ventures\" should be forgotten.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=535}} Bernab\u00f2 Visconti was killed on 6 May 1385, which put an end to negotiations about the marriage of his daughter and Louis.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=15}}\n\nMost towns and noblemen supported Charles of Durazzo in Provence and Forcelquier.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} They entered into a formal alliance against Louis and his mother in [[Aix-en-Provence]].{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} Marie of Blois who was determined to restore their rule in the two wealthy counties hurried to Marseille.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} Louis accompanied his mother and they jointly received the swear of fealty of the three highest-ranking magistrates of the town on 24 August 1385.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} In return, they ceremoniusly pledged that they would always observe the burghers' liberties.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=50}} Marie of Blois entered into negotiations with the members of the League of Aix and persuaded them one by one to accept Louis' rule during the following two years.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|pp=50\u201355}}\n\nCharles of Durazzo fell victim to a plot while staying in Hungary in February 1386.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|pp=168\u2013169}} His ten-year-old son, Ladislaus, succeeded him under the guardianship of his mother, [[Margaret of Durazzo]].{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=779}} Urban VI's successor, [[Pope Boniface IX]], confirmed Ladislaus' right to rule the Kingdom of Naples.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=169}} Marie of Blois started negotiations about Louis' marriage with Ladislaus' sister, [[Joanna II of Naples|Joanna]], but Louis flatly refused to marry the daughter of his father's principal enemy in May 1387.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=17, 206}} Louis' supporters took possession of the town of Naples,{{sfn|Peyronnet|2016|p=34}} but his adversaries were able to retain the two most important fortresses, the [[Castel Nuovo]] and [[Castel Sant'Elmo]].{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=779}}\n\nCharles VI of France reached the age of majority, dismissed the dukes of Burgundy and Berry and decided to provide support to Louis.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=666, 779}} He [[Accolade|knighted]] Louis and his brother, Charles, at [[Basilica of Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis Abbey]] in Paris in May 1389.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=668\u2013669}} The celebrations which lasted for a week were \"carefully stage-managed propaganda for the royal house, deliberately contrived to show its fortunes in the hands of a younger generation\", according to historian [[Jonathan Sumption, Lord Sumption|Jonathan Sumption]].{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=669}} He promised to grant 300,000 florins to Louis to finance a military campaign to southern Italy.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=779}} (Anti)pope Clement VII soon promised to pay further 500,000 florins to Louis.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=779\u2013780}} Charles VI announced his decision to the burghers of Naples in a letter that was read out in the [[Naples Cathedral]] soon after the ritual liquefaction of the blood of [[Januarius|Saint Januarius]].{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=780}}\n\n===Naples===\n\nAntipope Clement VII crowned Louis king in the chapel of the [[Palais des

alliance.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=781}}\n\nLouis and his fleet of about 40 galleys sailed from Marseille in July 1390 and reached the [[Bay of Naples]] on 6 August.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=782}} His troops captured the Castel Sant'Elmo in October, and the Castel Nuovo weeks later.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=782}} Clement VII's [[papal legate|legate]], Cardinal [[Pierre de Thury]], who had accompanied Louis to Naples, administered the kingdom efficiently on his behalf.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=19}} Louis was engaged to King [[John I of Aragon]]'s daughter, Yolande.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=18\u201319}} Clement VII provided regular financial support to Louis{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=802}} whose troops achieved a series of major victories and captured [[Amalfi]] and [[Ravello]] in 1392.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=19}}{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}} Most [[Calabria]]n barons (including the heads of the powerful [[House of Sanseverino|Sanseverino]] and [[Ruffo di Calabria|Ruffo]] families) also swore fealty to him by the autumn of 1392.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}}{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=169}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=802}} In practice, the Kingdom of Naples was divided between Louis and Ladislaus.{{sfn|Abulafia|2014|p=169}}\n\nCharles VI of France showed the first symptoms of madness on 5 August 1392, which enabled Philip II of Burgundy to strengthen his position at the French royal court.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=802\u2013803}} In November, Visconti sent an envoy to Paris to persuade the French to launch further military campaigns to Italy.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=802}} Louis of Turenne, who had received the [[Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duchy of Orl\u00e9ans]] from Charles VI, supported the plan, because he wanted to conquer large parts of the [[Papal States]] for himself; his maternal uncle, [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon]], also decided to lead a French army to Naples to support Louis.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}}{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=802\u2013803}} However, negotiations with their potential Italian allies and Clement VII proved that their goals could hardly be achieved, because of the lack of sufficient financial support.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=803}}\n\nClement VII died unexpectedly in Avignon on 16 September 1394.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=816}} Charles VI and his counsellors wanted to put an end to the schism and asked Clement VII's cardinals not to elect a new pope.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=817}} However, the cardinals ignored their request and elected an Aragonese cardinal who took the name Benedict XIII.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=818}} Louis supported Benedict,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} but the French prelates decided to enforce the abdication of both popes at their general assembly in Paris on 2 February 1395.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=819}} Louis of Orl\u00e9ans was determined to continue the military operations in Italy, but Charles VI's queen, [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], and Philip II of Burgundy convinced him to withdraw his troops from Italy in late February.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|pp=820\u2013821}}\n\nThe conflict between France and Benedict XIII weakened Louis' position and Ladislaus could take advantage of his difficulties.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=56}} When analysing their situation, historian Alan Ryder concludes that Louis revealed a \"character devoid of leadership\" and Ladislaus displayed that \"acumen and ruthlessness which were to make him the terror of Italy\".{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=57}} Louis' real authority was restricted to the city of Naples, because the Calabrian barons only formally acknowledged his rule.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=57}} Charles VI of France openly abandoned Louis' case when he signed a treaty with Florence, promising not to intervene in Naples.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=57}}\n\nThe French clergy withdrew from the obedience to Benedict XIII and a French army laid siege to Avignon in July 1398.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=845}} The legitimacy of Louis's rule in Naples derived from his coronation by Benedict XIII's predecessor, but his mother who administered Provence was to support the French action.{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=22, 208}} Deprived of his revenues from France, Benedict XIII was no more able to finance Louis's troops in Naples.{{sfn|Peyronnet|2016|p=34}} The Apulian barons rose up against Louis, forcing him to launch a military campaign to Apulia in February 1399.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Rohr|2016|pp=19\u201320}} The Sanseverini abandoned him and his absence from Naples enabled Ladislaus to seize the town on 10 July.{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Rohr|2016|p=20}} Louis could not continue the fight and left southern Italy for Provence in the same month.{{sfn|Ryder|2016|p=57}}\n\n===In France===\n\nLouis

Patel''' (1905 \u2013 1 October 1969), was a [[Indo-Fijian]] politician, farmers' leader and founder and leader of the [[National Federation Party]]. Patel was uncompromisingly committed to a vision of an independent [[Fiji]], with full racial integration.  He was one of the first to advocate a [[republic]], an ideal not realized in his lifetime.  He also advocated a common voters' roll and opposed the communal franchise that characterized Fijian politics.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nPatel was born in the [[Kheda]] district of [[Gujarat]], India, on 13 March 1905. He had three brothers and a sister. Ambalal and his younger brother, [[R. D. Patel]], became barristers in Fiji (hence they were known as A.D. and R.D.). Ambalal received his primary and secondary education in [[Nadiad]], which was the site used by [[Gandhi]] when he began his non-violent protest in India. He developed a habit of reading very early in his school days  and excelled in secondary school. He then entered the prestigious Gujarat College in [[Ahmedabad]] and studied economics, politics and history. He graduated with [[Bachelor of Arts]] with honours in 1925 at the age of 20.\n\nFollowing his early academic success, she was sent to prepare to sit for the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) examination. He enrolled in the [[London School of Economics]] to improve his chances of success in the exam by gaining direct experience of the English intellectual, social and political scene. In London he rubbed shoulders with other intellectuals from the sub-continent and became aware of the plight of Indians living in the other colonies. He changed his original plan for an ICS career without conferring with his parents joined the [[Middle Temple]] to qualify as a [[barrister]], graduating in 1928 at the age of 23.\n\n== First marriage ==\n\nPatel's father tried to persuade him to return and practice law in India and to help with the education of his younger siblings, but in the end helped pay his son's fare from [[London]] to Fiji, where he arrived on 11 October 1928. A reason for Patel to not want to return to India was his relationship with an English divorcee, Patricia Catherall Seymour, who had a son from her previous marriage. This was unacceptable for the [[Patel]] clan in India, especially since he had been betrothed to a girl from his community before leaving for London. Patricia Seymour arrived in [[Suva]] with her young son in 1933, and she and Patel were formally married on 25 January 1934. Their inter-racial marriage was strained by racially defined social hierarchy in Fiji. Patricia was ostracised by the local [[European ethnic groups|European]]s and she was unable to communicate with the local Indians. The couple separated in 1939 and divorced in 1943 and Patricia left for [[New Zealand]].\n\n== Early involvement in politics ==\n\nPatel was involved in the 1929 Legislative Council election campaign, together with [[S. B. Patel]] and [[Vishnu Deo]], but was ineligible to stand as he did not meet the two-year residency requirement for candidates. He was involved in discussions with the Governor, [[Sir Murchison Fletcher]], to resolve the political crisis brought about by the walkout of Fiji Indian members of the Legislative Council when their demand for common roll was rejected.\n\nBy 1930 Patel had taken up leadership positions in a number of organisations. These included president of the [[Fiji Indian Congress]], formed from the merger of two rival organisations, president of the Indian association of Fiji, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Patron of the ''Gujarat Mandal''.\n\nIn 1935, when there was a proposal to have members of the Legislative Council  nominated, instead of elected, Patel, together with Vishnu Deo, led the anti-nomination campaign from outside parliament as President and Secretary of the [[Indian Association of Fiji]].\n\n==First election ==\n\nPatel stood in the [[1937 Fijian general election|1937 Legislative Council election]] for the North Western Indian Division.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiji Elections Archive: Elections for the Legislative Council, North Western Division 1929 - 1959 |url=http://au.geocities.com/girmitya/FijiElections/1929/NorthWestDiv.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kkmvGFp5?url=http://au.geocities.com/girmitya/FijiElections/1929/NorthWestDiv.htm |archivedate=2009-10-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His opponent was [[Chattur Singh]], a law clerk. Chattur Singh polled 671 votes to Patel's 651. Patel's loss was a surprise, especially since he was supported by the Indian Leadership in Fiji, which included Vishnu Deo. His defeat was due to a number of factors. Chattur Singh was a well known [[Ba (town)|Ba]] resident, he was the President of the Ba branch of the Indian Association and his elder brother, [[Parmanand Singh]], was one of the 3 Indians elected to the Legislative Council in 1929, Patel had angered the [[Muslim]] community because of his strong public stance against nomination (The Muslims had asked for their own representative to be nominated),  Patel was a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] whom the farmers saw as exploiters because of the high interest rate charged by the Gujarati merchants. The deciding factor was that Chatuur Singh had turned the election to one between Fiji-born and India\u2013born and Patel did not make the situation better when he labelled Singh as having been born in a cane field.\n\n== General Manager of Sangam ==\n\nIn 1930 when the [[Then India Sanmarga Ikya Sangam|Sangam]] set up its first school, Patel became its manager. A. D. worked closely with [[Sadhu Kuppuswami]], the founder of the Sangam, and Swami Avinashananda, sent by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] on a fact finding mission to find out ways of promoting [[South Indian]] languages. On 31 October 1937 the Sangam was registered as a limited liability company, with Patel as general manager. Patel managed to persuade the government to exempt the Sangam from laws limiting ownership of land so that the Sangam could own up to one thousand acres (4&nbsp;km\u00b2). Furthermore, Patel sought Sangam representation on the Board of Education, appealed for help in getting teachers from India to teach [[Dravidian languages|South Indian languages]], and sought building grants from the Government. His persistence paid off when the Government paid the cost to bring two [[South Indians in Fiji|South Indian]] teachers from India to teach in Sangam schools.  Patel's involvement in the Sangam deepened with the arrival of [[Swami Rudrananda]] in 1939.\n\n== Establishment of the Maha Sangh ==\n\nAlthough, in 1938, he had rejected overtures by the [[Kisan Sangh]] to take over its leadership, in June 1941, Patel formed the Maha Sangh with the support of Swami Rudrananda. In 1943, he led the sugar cane farmers on a prolonged strike after his demands for an increase in the price of sugar cane in line with inflation was rejected by the [[Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]].  When the majority of farmers refused to harvest their cane, the Government invoked the Defence Regulation and restricted Patel and Swami Rudrananda to a radius of five miles (8&nbsp;km) from their homes in [[Nadi]] and required them to inform the police in person of their movements. Both Patel and Rudrananda decided to disobey the order and it landed both of them in court. This stirred up the farmers and a large number gathered in Nadi, holding prayer meetings. Shops were closed throughout the [[Western Division, Fiji|Western division]]. Both were fined \u00a350 each or one month's prison in default. Both refused to pay, but before the five days allowed was over, an anonymous well-wisher paid the fine but Patel later won the case on appeal.  The strike in the middle of a world war and his call for Indians to not join the army until they were given the same pay and conditions as Europeans, created a rift between Indians and Fijians which is remembered to this day.\n\n== Election wins and losses ==\n\nThe 1943 strike propelled Patel to the forefront of the political arena in Fiji and he easily won the 1944 Legislative Council election, defeating the sitting member for North West Viti Levu, by 1841 votes to 554. He retained the seat in the 1947 election, defeating Chattur Singh by 1972 votes to 1106. In 1948, with the support of three of the five ethnic Indians in the Legislative Council, he was appointed to the [[Executive Council of Fiji|Executive Council]], outmaneuvering his one-time ally Vishnu Deo.  In the [[Elections in Fiji|legislative council]] elections on 1950, however, he was defeated by Tulsi Ram Sharma of the rival Kisan Sangh.  In the 1953 election, he was defeated by his old rival, [[Ayodhya Prasad]] of the Kisan Sangh, by 2718 votes to 1919 votes. During his days in the political wilderness, Patel concentrated on his law practice and continued to support the Sangam and the Ramakrishna Mission.\n\n== Family life ==\n\nIn 1947, while in India, Patel married Leela Ben, 20-year-old daughter of an old acquaintance of his. Patel then was 42 years old. They had five children and the break from politics between 1950 and 1963 allowed Patel to devote more time to his family and to his law practice.\n\n==1960 sugar cane dispute ==\n\nWith the 1950 contract due to expire in 1960, the [[Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]] (CSR), in January 1959, drafted a new contract which rolled back most of the gains made by the farmers in the last 20 years. The growers were suspicious of the Company and in May 1959 decided to work together by forming the [[Federation of Cane Growers]]. Patel was a leading member of the Federation. A number of meetings were held between the Growers Federation, the Company and the Government. The Company refused to back down as it had a lot of sugar in stock and the talks soon broke down. The Governor suggested a commission of inquiry but this was rejected by Patel, who instead proposed a court of arbitration.\n\nOn 24 July 1960, [[Ayodhya Prasad]] of [[Kisan Sangh]] and [[Vijay R. Singh]] of [[Labasa Kisan Sangh]], broke away and signed an agreement with CSR for the purchase of the 1960 crop. Tensions rose as Patel's opponents, [[B. D. Lakshman]] and [[Vijay R. Singh]], accused him of again dividing the Indians and leading them further into debt and some Fijians, including Ratu Sir [[Kamisese Mara|Kamisese Mara]], made calls to have Patel deported. The government appointed a commission of inquiry, headed by [[Malcolm Eve|Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve]], into the sugar industry. The Federation Committee was represented by Patel, assisted by [[Sidiq Koya|S.M. Koya]].  Patel wanted legislation compelling CSR to keep it book of accounts in Fiji so that the Company could not cheat farmers from the proceeds of molasses, establishment of growers co-operative mills to break the monopoly of the CSR, setting up of an independent Sugar Board to oversee smooth functioning of the industry and the abolition of the Sugar Price Stabilisation Fund.\n\nThe finding of the commission was mostly against the demands of Patel.  The idea of cooperative mill was rejected because the commission believed that the farmers could not manage it when could not even manage farms on their own. The commission supported CSR's idea of setting up wholly owned subsidiary for managing its activities in Fiji and the [[South Pacific Sugar Mills Limited]] was born. Future levies to the Sugar price Stabilisation Fund were abolished, although the fund remained in existence. Instead of a Sugar Board the commission recommended an Advisory Sugar Council. The commission agreed that the CSR had profited from molasses but did not recommend price increases demanded by growers. The commission supported the Company's submission of production control by weight instead of area. On the question of sharing the proceeds from the sale of sugar, the growers ended up worse off, getting a basic share of 57.75%, much less than what had been obtained under the 1950-1959 contract (62.6%). Eve also criticised Patel for adopting policies that harmed the growers and not showing a greater sense of responsibility to the country of his adoption.\n\n== Formation of Federation Party ==\n\nThe Federation Committee contested the 1963 Legislative Council election under the banner of [[Citizens Federation]].  It was not a properly constituted political party but sought to promote economic, cultural and political progress and stability in a united Fiji. All three Citizen's Federation candidates were elected to the Legislative Council.  Patel defeated Deo Sharma, president of the Kisan Sangh by 6244 votes to 3346.\n\nThe success of the Citizens Federation in the 1963 elections, and the impending constitutional convention, prompted Patel to transform the Citizens Federation into a fully fledged political party.  The [[Federation Party]] came into existence on 21 June 1964, with Patel as president and S.M. Koya as vice-president.\n\n== Member for Social Services ==\n\nThe Membership System was introduced on 1 July 1964, and Patel was appointed as the Member for Social Services taking over responsibility for cultural activities, education, health, prisons, social welfare and charitable societies.  During his two years, as Member for Social Services, he carried out a number of significant changes. These included the establishment of the Western Regional Library in [[Lautoka]] with branches in Ba, Nadi and [[Sigatoka]], the establishment of the Fiji National Provident Fund, reform to the prisons systems to laying greater emphasis on the reformative side of prisons. Patel promoted non-racial schools and authorised the closure of schools to reduce fragmentation, duplication of effort, unnecessary competition and communal segregation.  He attempted to remove race form the names of schools but was unsuccessful due to strong opposition from Fijians. He also urged the [[Fiji Teachers Union]] and the [[Fijian Teachers Association]] to unite. He also spoke out about the need for a [http://www.unifiji.ac.fj/ University in Fiji].\n\n== Events leading to independence ==\n\nA constitutional conference in London in 1965 had made minor concessions to Indo-Fijians, abolishing educational and property qualifications for the franchise while confirming the sectarian basis of the electoral system.  The September, [[1966 Fijian general election|1966 elections]] were fought on the issue of the new constitution with the newly formed [[Alliance Party (Fiji)|Alliance Party]] applauding it and the Federation Party denouncing it. The Federation Party won all the nine Indian communal seats, obtaining 65.25 percent of the votes cast for these seats. Patel defeated his old rival, Ayodhya Prasad by 7601 votes to 4025.  Ratu Mara was elected the Chief Minister and Patel became the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nEthnic tensions escalated following the adoption of [[responsible government]] in 1967, when Patel's arch-rival, the [[Lau Islands|Lauan]] chief [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Kamisese Mara]] was appointed [[Chief Minister of Fiji|Chief Minister]] on 20 September.  Mara's Alliance Party was a coalition of indigenous and European factions, with minimal Indo-Fijian participation.  Patel and the NFP were consigned to the opposition benches.  In protest at the new government's refusal to call a second constitutional conference, Patel led the nine NFP legislators in a mass walkout in September 1967.  Missing two consecutive sections of the Legislative Council resulted in the forfeit of their seats, forcing [[by-election]]s.\n\nThe ensuing by-elections were marked by inter-ethnic violence.  Patel's inflammatory language  - he called Ratu Mara ''\"a crow among swans,\"'' declared that ''Mara'' was a swear-word in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], and characterized Chinese people as ''\"eaters of cats, rats, and bats\"'' - dissipated much of the remaining goodwill that Fijian and British leaders had towards him, and when all nine NFP legislators were returned with increased majorities (In the 1968 election, the NFP won 78.55% of the votes cast. Patel won by 7903 votes to 2772 for [[Manikam Pillai]].), relations between the Indo-Fijian and indigenous communities appeared to be at a new low.\n\n== The Denning Award ==\n\nPatel again took up the case on behalf of the farmers when arbitration proceedings were begun on 19 August 1969 for the new cane contract. He rejected the Eve contract, blaming it for leading the farmers deeper into debt. He spoke about the monopoly position of CSR, its secret accounting procedures, and concealed profits. He asked for a fairer price based on the price of sugar and its by-products. The Denning contract awarded the growers, 65% and the millers 35% of the proceeds of all sale, including molasses. It further guaranteed the growers a minimum price of $7.75 per ton of cane paid in two instalments. Denning commended Patel for having mastery of all the facts and problems of the sugar industry and presenting them with skill and understanding.\n\n== Death ==\n\nPatel died suddenly on 1 October 1969,<ref>[https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-330617646/view?partId=nla.obj-330622144#page/n29/mode/1up Death in Fiji of Mr. A. D. Patel] ''Pacific Islands Monthly'', October 1969, p28</ref> in the midst of negotiations leading to Fijian independence which was granted barely a year afterwards.  Despite his republicanism and his strident opposition to institutionalizing ethnic and sectarian rights, which ethnic Fijians believed best protected their interests, at the time of his death he was beginning to show signs willingness to meet indigenous leaders half-way.  His successor as leader of the NFP, [[Sidiq Koya]], did in fact agree to such a compromise with Mara at a London conference in April 1970.  Mara was of the opinion, however, that had Patel lived, an agreement with him would have commanded much greater respect in the Indo-Fijian community, such was his stature among them.\n\nMost Fijian leaders today take a kinder view of Patel.  In 2005, then-[[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]] [[Joni Madraiwiwi|Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi]] concluded after a study of Patel's private correspondence that in reality he was not unsympathetic to indigenous interests, but was misunderstood.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n* B.

This was unacceptable for the [[Patel]] clan in India, especially since he had been betrothed to a girl from his community before leaving for London. Patricia Seymour arrived in [[Suva]] with her young son in 1933, and she and Patel were formally married on 25 January 1934. Their inter-racial marriage was strained by racially defined social hierarchy in Fiji. Patricia was ostracised by the local [[European ethnic groups|European]]s and she was unable to communicate with the local Indians. The couple separated in 1939 and divorced in 1943 and Patricia left for [[New Zealand]].\n\n== Early involvement in politics ==\n\nPatel was involved in the 1929 Legislative Council election campaign, together with [[S. B. Patel]] and [[Vishnu Deo]], but was ineligible to stand as he did not meet the two-year residency requirement for candidates. He was involved in discussions with the Governor, [[Sir Murchison Fletcher]], to resolve the political crisis brought about by the walkout of Fiji Indian members of the Legislative Council when their demand for common roll was rejected.\n\nBy 1930 Patel had taken up leadership positions in a number of organisations. These included president of the [[Fiji Indian Congress]], formed from the merger of two rival organisations, president of the Indian association of Fiji, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Patron of the ''Gujarat Mandal''.\n\nIn 1935, when there was a proposal to have members of the Legislative Council  nominated, instead of elected, Patel, together with Vishnu Deo, led the anti-nomination campaign from outside parliament as President and Secretary of the [[Indian Association of Fiji]].\n\n==First election ==\n\nPatel stood in the [[1937 Fijian general election|1937 Legislative Council election]] for the North Western Indian Division.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiji Elections Archive: Elections for the Legislative Council, North Western Division 1929 - 1959 |url=http://au.geocities.com/girmitya/FijiElections/1929/NorthWestDiv.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kkmvGFp5?url=http://au.geocities.com/girmitya/FijiElections/1929/NorthWestDiv.htm |archivedate=2009-10-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His opponent was [[Chattur Singh]], a law clerk. Chattur Singh polled 671 votes to Patel's 651. Patel's loss was a surprise, especially since he was supported by the Indian Leadership in Fiji, which included Vishnu Deo. His defeat was due to a number of factors. Chattur Singh was a well known [[Ba (town)|Ba]] resident, he was the President of the Ba branch of the Indian Association and his elder brother, [[Parmanand Singh]], was one of the 3 Indians elected to the Legislative Council in 1929, Patel had angered the [[Muslim]] community because of his strong public stance against nomination (The Muslims had asked for their own representative to be nominated),  Patel was a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] whom the farmers saw as exploiters because of the high interest rate charged by the Gujarati merchants. The deciding factor was that Chatuur Singh had turned the election to one between Fiji-born and India\u2013born and Patel did not make the situation better when he labelled Singh as having been born in a cane field.\n\n== General Manager of Sangam ==\n\nIn 1930 when the [[Then India Sanmarga Ikya Sangam|Sangam]] set up its first school, Patel became its manager. A. D. worked closely with [[Sadhu Kuppuswami]], the founder of the Sangam, and Swami Avinashananda, sent by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] on a fact finding mission to find out ways of promoting [[South Indian]] languages. On 31 October 1937 the Sangam was registered as a limited liability company, with Patel as general manager. Patel managed to persuade the government to exempt the Sangam from laws limiting ownership of land so that the Sangam could own up to one thousand acres (4&nbsp;km\u00b2). Furthermore, Patel sought Sangam representation on the Board of Education, appealed for help in getting teachers from India to teach [[Dravidian languages|South Indian languages]], and sought building grants from the Government. His persistence paid off when the Government paid the cost to bring two [[South Indians in Fiji|South Indian]] teachers from India to teach in Sangam schools.  Patel's involvement in the Sangam deepened with the arrival of [[Swami Rudrananda]] in 1939.\n\n== Establishment of the Maha Sangh ==\n\nAlthough, in 1938, he had rejected overtures by the [[Kisan Sangh]] to take over its leadership, in June 1941, Patel formed the Maha Sangh with the support of Swami Rudrananda. In 1943, he led the sugar cane farmers on a prolonged strike after his demands for an increase in the price of sugar cane in line with inflation was rejected by the [[Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]].  When the majority of farmers refused to harvest their cane, the Government invoked the Defence Regulation and restricted Patel and Swami Rudrananda to a radius of five miles (8&nbsp;km) from their homes in [[Nadi]] and required them to inform the police in person of their movements. Both Patel and Rudrananda decided to disobey the order and it landed both of them in court. This stirred up the farmers and a large number gathered in Nadi, holding prayer meetings. Shops were closed throughout the [[Western Division, Fiji|Western division]]. Both were fined \u00a350 each or one month's prison in default. Both refused to pay, but before the five days allowed was over, an anonymous well-wisher paid the fine but Patel later won the case on appeal.  The strike in the middle of a world war and his call for Indians to not join the army until they were given the same pay and conditions as Europeans, created a rift between Indians and Fijians which is remembered to this day.\n\n== Election wins and losses ==\n\nThe 1943 strike propelled Patel to the forefront of the political arena in Fiji and he easily won the 1944 Legislative Council election, defeating the sitting member for North West Viti Levu, by 1841 votes to 554. He retained the seat in the 1947 election, defeating Chattur Singh by 1972 votes to 1106. In 1948, with the support of three of the five ethnic Indians in the Legislative Council, he was appointed to the [[Executive Council of Fiji|Executive Council]], outmaneuvering his one-time ally Vishnu Deo.  In the [[Elections in Fiji|legislative council]] elections on 1950, however, he was defeated by Tulsi Ram Sharma of the rival Kisan Sangh.  In the 1953 election, he was defeated by his old rival, [[Ayodhya Prasad]] of the Kisan Sangh, by 2718 votes to 1919 votes. During his days in the political wilderness, Patel concentrated on his law practice and continued to support the Sangam and the Ramakrishna Mission.\n\n== Family life ==\n\nIn 1947, while in India, Patel married Leela Ben, 20-year-old daughter of an old acquaintance of his. Patel then was 42 years old. They had five children and the break from politics between 1950 and 1963 allowed Patel to devote more time to his family and to his law practice.\n\n==1960 sugar cane dispute ==\n\nWith the 1950 contract due to expire in 1960, the [[Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]] (CSR), in January 1959, drafted a new contract which rolled back most of the gains made by the farmers in the last 20 years. The growers were suspicious of the Company and in May 1959 decided to work together by forming the [[Federation of Cane Growers]]. Patel was a leading member of the Federation. A number of meetings were held between the Growers Federation, the Company and the Government. The Company refused to back down as it had a lot of sugar in stock and the talks soon broke down. The Governor suggested a commission of inquiry but this was rejected by Patel, who instead proposed a court of arbitration.\n\nOn 24 July 1960, [[Ayodhya Prasad]] of [[Kisan Sangh]] and [[Vijay R. Singh]] of [[Labasa Kisan Sangh]], broke away and signed an agreement with CSR for the purchase of the 1960 crop. Tensions rose as Patel's opponents, [[B. D. Lakshman]] and [[Vijay R. Singh]], accused him of again dividing the Indians and leading them further into debt and some Fijians, including Ratu Sir [[Kamisese Mara|Kamisese Mara]], made calls to have Patel deported. The government appointed a commission of inquiry, headed by [[Malcolm Eve|Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve]], into the sugar industry. The Federation Committee was represented by Patel, assisted by [[Sidiq Koya|S.M. Koya]].  Patel wanted legislation compelling CSR to keep it book of accounts in Fiji so that the Company could not cheat farmers from the proceeds of molasses, establishment of growers co-operative mills to break the monopoly of the CSR, setting up of an independent Sugar Board to oversee smooth functioning of the industry and the abolition of the Sugar Price Stabilisation Fund.\n\nThe finding of the commission was mostly against the demands of Patel.  The idea of cooperative mill was rejected because the commission believed that the farmers could not manage it when could not even manage farms on their own. The commission supported CSR's idea of setting up wholly owned subsidiary for managing its activities in Fiji and the [[South Pacific Sugar Mills Limited]] was born. Future levies to the Sugar price Stabilisation Fund were abolished, although the fund remained in existence. Instead of a Sugar Board the commission recommended an Advisory Sugar Council. The commission agreed that the CSR had profited from molasses but did not recommend price increases demanded by growers. The commission supported the Company's submission of production control by weight instead of area. On the question of sharing the proceeds from the sale of sugar, the growers ended up worse off, getting a basic share of 57.75%, much less than what had been obtained under the 1950-1959 contract (62.6%). Eve also criticised Patel for adopting policies that harmed the growers and not showing a greater sense of responsibility to the country of his adoption.\n\n== Formation of Federation Party ==\n\nThe Federation Committee contested the 1963 Legislative Council election under the banner of [[Citizens Federation]].  It was not a properly constituted political party but sought to promote economic, cultural and political progress and stability in a united Fiji. All three Citizen's Federation candidates were elected to the Legislative Council.  Patel defeated Deo Sharma, president of the Kisan Sangh by 6244 votes to 3346.\n\nThe success of the Citizens Federation in the 1963 elections, and the impending constitutional convention, prompted Patel to transform the Citizens Federation into a fully fledged political party.  The [[Federation Party]] came into existence on 21 June 1964, with Patel as president and S.M. Koya as vice-president.\n\n== Member for Social Services ==\n\nThe Membership System was introduced on 1 July 1964, and Patel was appointed as the Member for Social Services taking over responsibility for cultural activities, education, health, prisons, social welfare and charitable societies.  During his two years, as Member for Social Services, he carried out a number of significant changes. These included the establishment of the Western Regional Library in [[Lautoka]] with branches in Ba, Nadi and [[Sigatoka]], the establishment of the Fiji National Provident Fund, reform to the prisons systems to laying greater emphasis on the reformative side of prisons. Patel promoted non-racial schools and authorised the closure of schools to reduce fragmentation, duplication of effort, unnecessary competition and communal segregation.  He attempted to remove race form the names of schools but was unsuccessful due to strong opposition from Fijians. He also urged the [[Fiji Teachers Union]] and the [[Fijian Teachers Association]] to unite. He also spoke out about the need for a [http://www.unifiji.ac.fj/ University in Fiji].\n\n== Events leading to independence ==\n\nA constitutional conference in London in 1965 had made minor concessions to Indo-Fijians, abolishing educational and property qualifications for the franchise while confirming the sectarian basis of the electoral system.  The September, [[1966 Fijian general election|1966 elections]] were fought on the issue of the new constitution with the newly formed [[Alliance Party (Fiji)|Alliance Party]] applauding it and the Federation Party denouncing it. The Federation Party won all the nine Indian communal seats, obtaining 65.25 percent of the votes cast for these seats. Patel defeated his old rival, Ayodhya Prasad by 7601 votes to 4025.  Ratu Mara was elected the Chief Minister and Patel became the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nEthnic tensions escalated following the adoption of [[responsible government]] in 1967, when Patel's arch-rival, the [[Lau Islands|Lauan]] chief [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Kamisese Mara]] was appointed [[Chief Minister of Fiji|Chief Minister]] on 20 September.  Mara's Alliance Party was a coalition of indigenous and European factions, with minimal Indo-Fijian participation.  Patel and the NFP were consigned to the opposition benches.  In protest at the new government's refusal to call a second constitutional conference, Patel led the nine NFP legislators in a mass walkout in September 1967.  Missing two consecutive sections of the Legislative Council resulted in the forfeit of their seats, forcing [[by-election]]s.\n\nThe ensuing by-elections were marked by inter-ethnic violence.  Patel's inflammatory language  - he called Ratu Mara ''\"a crow among swans,\"'' declared that ''Mara'' was a swear-word in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], and characterized Chinese people as ''\"eaters of cats, rats, and bats\"'' - dissipated much of the remaining goodwill that Fijian and British leaders had towards him, and when all nine NFP legislators were returned with increased majorities (In the 1968 election, the NFP won 78.55% of the votes cast. Patel won by 7903 votes to 2772 for [[Manikam Pillai]].), relations between the Indo-Fijian and indigenous communities appeared to be at a new low.\n\n== The Denning Award ==\n\nPatel again took up the case on behalf of the farmers when arbitration proceedings were begun on 19 August 1969 for the new cane contract. He rejected the Eve contract, blaming it for leading the farmers deeper into debt. He spoke about the monopoly position of CSR, its secret accounting procedures, and concealed profits. He asked for a fairer price based on the price of sugar and its by-products. The Denning contract awarded the growers, 65% and the millers 35% of the proceeds of all sale, including molasses. It further guaranteed the growers a minimum price of $7.75 per ton of cane paid in two instalments. Denning commended Patel for having mastery of all the facts and problems of the sugar industry and presenting them with skill and understanding.\n\n== Death ==\n\nPatel died suddenly on 1 October 1969,<ref>[https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-330617646/view?partId=nla.obj-330622144#page/n29/mode/1up Death in Fiji of Mr. A. D. Patel] ''Pacific Islands Monthly'', October 1969, p28</ref> in the midst of negotiations leading to Fijian independence which was granted barely a year afterwards.  Despite his republicanism and his strident opposition to institutionalizing ethnic and sectarian rights, which ethnic Fijians believed best protected their interests, at the time of his death he was beginning to show signs willingness to meet indigenous leaders half-way.  His successor as leader of the NFP, [[Sidiq Koya]], did in fact agree to such a compromise with Mara at a London conference in April 1970.  Mara was of the opinion, however, that had Patel lived, an agreement with him would have commanded much greater respect in the Indo-Fijian community, such was his stature among them.\n\nMost Fijian leaders today take a kinder view of Patel.  In 2005, then-[[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]] [[Joni Madraiwiwi|Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi]] concluded after a study of Patel's private correspondence that in reality he was not unsympathetic to indigenous interests, but was misunderstood.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n* B.

He is the son of the Eternals [[Virako]] and [[Tulayn]].  His real birth name is unknown. \n\nWhen the Second Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] sank the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]] in what is known as the \"Great Cataclysm,\" Ikaris guides a ship of humans to safety.  The humans mistake Ikaris for a bird, and (per [[Marvel Universe]] history) he is memorialized as the dove that guided [[Noah]] to the [[Mountains of Ararat]] (''Eternals'' vol. 1, #2).\n\n===Early centuries===\nIkaris chose his name due to a tragic accident hundreds of years ago.  While fighting the Deviants in ancient [[Greece]], the man eventually known as Ikaris meets and weds a human woman.  Together they bear a son named [[Icarus]], who loves to soar with his father high above the seas and mountains of Greece. In time, the Eternal builds his son a set of mechanical wings so the boy can fly on his own.\n\nWhen his father disappears while fighting the Deviants, the young Icarus seeks him out using the mechanical wings.  Too inexperienced to fly on his own, young Icarus soars too high, loses consciousness in the upper atmosphere, and falls to his death.  Finding his son dead, the father Eternal takes the name of his son, ''Ikaris'', in his memory.\n\nAround 1000 AD, Virako, Ikaris' father, dies in battle against the Deviant [[Dromedan]].  Ikaris is then adopted by his uncle [[Valkin]], who reveals to him his secret Arctic home, the Pyramid of the Winds.\n\nAt some point during the early centuries, Ikaris and the Eternals would come into conflict with the immortal mutant, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. This conflict would end with Ikaris and the Eternals defeating him, and Ikaris believing Apocalypse to be dead.\n\nIn 1823, as part of the Eternals' preparation for the coming of the Fourth Host of the Celestials, [[Zuras]] orders Ikaris to perfect his cosmic senses in anticipation of their coming.  When they draw near, Ikaris is ordered to go to the City of the Space Gods and revive the sleeping Eternal [[Ajak]] to greet them.\n\n===Modern Era===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ikaris 1.jpg|left|thumb|''The Eternals'' #1 limited series (1985).

After the battle, he was selected by the [[Uni-Mind]] to remain on Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #246-248</ref>\n\nDuring his long lifetime, Ikaris also attempts to be a fair and just leader of the Eternals, but has abandoned Eternal traditions to take an active and public role in protecting the human race.  He has even adopted a unique human identity by becoming a professional wrestler with the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]] as \"Iceberg\" Ike Harris.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> Ikaris and fellow Eternal [[Thena]] have had a strong dislike for each other for a long time, and find themselves coming to conflict when she is appointed as Prime Eternal. Questioning her worth as Prime Eternal, Ikaris faces her in the Hall of Eternal Judgment and defeats her, becoming the new Prime Eternal. Ikaris then battled [[Ghaur]] alongside the Eternals, Thor, and the [[West Coast Avengers]]. He also buried Margo Damian when she was killed.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #1-12</ref>\n\nLater, with the other Eternals, Ikaris captured the [[Silver Surfer]] on behalf of the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>''Silver Surfer Annual'' #1</ref> Some time after that, he was captured by the Deviant leader Brother Visara, and then freed by [[Kro (comics)|Kro]]. Ikaris exposed Dr. Damian as the Eternals' enemy, and battled a transformed [[Ajak]] as a result.<ref>''Eternals: The Herod Factor''</ref>\n\nIn ''The New Eternals'' series, Ikaris still retains the title of Prime Eternal. Ikaris and the Eternals' ancient nemesis Apocalypse returned to detonate a nuclear warhead on [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]]. He causes Ikaris's father Virako to return to life. Ikaris confronts, and fights Apocalypse. Although Ikaris is defeated by Apocalypse, Ikaris still manages to destroy his ship and thwart Apocalypse's plan. Virako is appalled to find the Eternals accepting Deviants such as [[Ransak the Reject]] and [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nUnder the alias of \"Sovereign\", he introduces the Eternals to the world as a team of super-heroes called the \"New Breed\".{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n====''Eternals'' mini-series (2006)====\nIkaris is featured in the Marvel mini-series ''Eternals'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and penciled by artist [[John Romita, Jr.]].  The [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] are the victims of memory and reality manipulation by former Eternal [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]], and thus have forgotten their true identities. Although Ikaris (calling himself Ike Harris) is captured and atomized by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] [[Gelt (comics)|Gelt]] and [[Morjak]],  his body reappears at the bottom of the (fictional) [[Antarctic]] city of Olympia. His body and powers fully restored by the sentient city, Ikaris regains his memories and sets out to awaken his fellow Eternals to their true identities. After a prolonged battle, he at last unites the few Eternals present. He then plans to team up with [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] and reawaken the ninety other Eternals.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n===''Eternals'' \u2013 Volume 4===\nAt the end of the last volume, [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] has been chosen as the \"chosen one\" that the awakened Dreaming Celestial communicates with. This is very frustrating to Ajak because he has spent his entire existence communing with the Celestials, their language and what their showing up means. In conversations between Makkari and the Dreaming Celestial, we find out that the Celestials pick or create a planet and seed it with life forms. They then create 100 Eternals and 100 Deviants. The Celestials then keep a watchful eye on the planet and weigh which of the two races influences the life forms more. This is done in servitude of the Fulcrum. If the Deviants influence has more prominence, the Celestials send the Horde to eradicate the race and they start over. If it is the Eternals, the Celestials allow the goodness to flow back into the Fulcrum, which the Celestials seems to serve.These conversations between Makkari and the Dreaming Celestial take place on a different plane of existence and cause Makkari's body to shut down, seemingly almost dying, which Sersi is concerned with because she thinks he is addicted to this state. We also see here the origin of the Dreaming Celestial and how he came to be put to sleep by the other Celestials.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nNext the story picks up with Thena and Ikaris, trying to find all of the other amnesiac Eternals and reminding them of who they are. They find that a similar effort is being conducted by Druig, who is now the ruler of Vorozheika. Druig is using a secret source to find the Eternals and is winning in the contest of finding and converting more Eternals to his cause. Ikaris and Thena approach Phastos, who thinks he is an engineer in Sweden named Phillip Voss. Thena tries to trigger his memory with questions about his past under the guise that she and Ikaris are attorneys executing the will of a deceased relative of Mr. Voss'. This ploy proves to be a failure and Ikaris just wants to force the memories on the Eternals who have lost their memories, but this also causes problems as they react violently to having their world's turned upside down like this.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nWe then see that Thena prior to her trip with Ikaris to visit Phastos, she leaves her son Joey Eliot in the care of her father: Zuras who seems a little absent-minded. Zuras begins to explore and show the different parts of the Eternals' habitat with Joey. It is here we learn that the Horde that the Dreaming Celestial has spoken of, that is coming to Earth has an agent already on Earth who is bonded to a human via a symbiotic relationship. This turns out to be Thena's son Joey. Joey is then seen going into a trance-like state when viewing new and unexplored areas of the habitat and information and transmitting that information back to the Horde. Sersi investigates and finds out about this through tracing a signal that is being sent from the habitat to the Horde and she informs Zuras of this fact. Zuras scoffs at this notion and Joey's life is terminated by the symbiote who determines that he has been detected.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nMakkari gets wind of Joey and his death from the Dreaming Celestial. He immediately goes to the habitat of the Eternals\u2014Olympia. Then Ajak comes up on the scene of a \"Burning Man\"-like party being held at the foot of the Dreaming Celestial. He attacks and disperses the worshippers there and is approached by Iron Man's strike team called the [[Order (comics)|Order]]. Ajak uses a \"jedi mind trick\" to send the Order away, and Ikaris shows up to have him go undercover inside Druig's stronghold. Ajak agrees and he soon is put to task to find Gilgamesh. Ajak finds him and convinces him that Thena, and Ikaris are possessed by the Deviants and their influence. Eventually Gilgamesh attacks Makkari and beats him violently, leaving to finish his attack against other Eternals. Ajak shows up in the aftermath of Gilgamesh's attack and atomizes Makkari, knowing that he will be given a new body and regenerated in one of the chambers in Olympus like their race has used for thousands of years. Makkari's death makes it necessary for the Dreaming Celestial, who does not have anyone to communicate with, use a failsafe that puts all humanoids asleep on the planet, except Eternals and Deviants.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nGilgamesh resumes his attack when he reaches Olympus and Thena barely defeats him, but only after he destroys the reassembling chamber that Makkari needs to reconstitute. Sersi then attacks the Dreaming Celestial and is told that she was given heightened powers to care for Makkari while he assisted the Dreaming Celestial in cataloging all super-powered beings on the planet. She then uses her powers to reconstitute Makkari, which stops the need for the failsafe of the Dreaming Celestial. And surprisingly when all of the humans awaken from their sleep, so to does Joey Eliot, ending Thena's sadness at the loss of her son. The Watcher mentions to the Dreaming Celestial that the child was dead and the Dreaming Celestial revived him. The Dreaming Celestial replies that the child was asleep like the rest of the humans and simply woke up when the rest did. The Watcher objects, and then realizes that the Dreaming Celestial has done this as an act of kindness, explained away as the child being simply asleep like the rest of the humans.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nIkaris' life force is augmented by cosmic energy and he has total mental control over his physical form and bodily processes even when he is asleep or unconscious. As a result, he is virtually immortal, immune to disease and aging, and invulnerable to conventional forms of injury. Should Ikaris be injured somehow, he could regenerate any injured or missing tissue. Cosmic energy bolsters Ikaris's metabolism so that he does not tire from any physical exertion. He can resist temperature extremes through mental concentration.\n\nIkaris can levitate himself by mentally manipulating gravitons around himself. He can also levitate other persons and objects, even while simultaneously levitating himself. Ikaris is able to fly via self-levitation at approximately 850 miles per hour, a rate of speed most other Eternals cannot match.\n\nIkaris has low level psychic abilities, enabling him to scan the superficial thoughts of any mind less adept than his own. He can mentally create illusions so as to disguise himself. Ikaris can also psionically manipulate atoms and molecules so as to transform an object's shape. However, Ikaris is only a second-level adept on a five level scale (the fifth level being the highest) in this discipline. He can rearrange molecules in the air so as to create a virtually impenetrable shield about himself.\n\nIkaris can project cosmic energy in the form of beams from his eyes or beams and flashes from his hands. This cosmic energy, stored in specialized enclaves of cells in his body, can be used as force, heat, light, and possibly other forms of electromagnetic energy. Ikaris can project a maximum concussive force of at least 260 pounds per square inch. He can project heat of a maximum temperature of at least 3,000 Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt iron. It takes about one minute for him to attain this maximum temperature. Because Ikaris's heat beams can vaporize solid objects, they are often called his disintegrator beams, The maximum range for his energy beams is about 200 feet. Ikaris is a fourth level adept on a five-level scale (the fifth level being the highest) in this discipline. The expenditure of cosmic energy in this way continually for several hours will temporarily deplete Ikaris's physical strength, but not his resistance to injury, although it will temporarily increase his sensitivity to pain. He will rapidly return to normal after such lengthy energy expenditure is over.\n\nIkaris can teleport himself psionically, but prefers not to do so, since, like other Eternals, he finds the self-teleportation process physically unpleasant. He can also teleport other people along with himself.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Marvel 2099===\nThere is an alternate future version of Ikaris in the [[Marvel 2099]] universe.

He is the son of the Eternals [[Virako]] and [[Tulayn]].  His real birth name is unknown. \n\nWhen the Second Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] sank the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]] in what is known as the \"Great Cataclysm,\" Ikaris guides a ship of humans to safety.  The humans mistake Ikaris for a bird, and (per [[Marvel Universe]] history) he is memorialized as the dove that guided [[Noah]] to the [[Mountains of Ararat]] (''Eternals'' vol. 1, #2).\n\n===Early centuries===\nIkaris chose his name due to a tragic accident hundreds of years ago.  While fighting the Deviants in ancient [[Greece]], the man eventually known as Ikaris meets and weds a human woman.  Together they bear a son named [[Icarus]], who loves to soar with his father high above the seas and mountains of Greece. In time, the Eternal builds his son a set of mechanical wings so the boy can fly on his own.\n\nWhen his father disappears while fighting the Deviants, the young Icarus seeks him out using the mechanical wings.  Too inexperienced to fly on his own, young Icarus soars too high, loses consciousness in the upper atmosphere, and falls to his death.  Finding his son dead, the father Eternal takes the name of his son, ''Ikaris'', in his memory.\n\nAround 1000 AD, Virako, Ikaris' father, dies in battle against the Deviant [[Dromedan]].  Ikaris is then adopted by his uncle [[Valkin]], who reveals to him his secret Arctic home, the Pyramid of the Winds.\n\nAt some point during the early centuries, Ikaris and the Eternals would come into conflict with the immortal mutant, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. This conflict would end with Ikaris and the Eternals defeating him, and Ikaris believing Apocalypse to be dead.\n\nIn 1823, as part of the Eternals' preparation for the coming of the Fourth Host of the Celestials, [[Zuras]] orders Ikaris to perfect his cosmic senses in anticipation of their coming.  When they draw near, Ikaris is ordered to go to the City of the Space Gods and revive the sleeping Eternal [[Ajak]] to greet them.\n\n===Modern Era===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ikaris 1.jpg|left|thumb|''The Eternals'' #1 limited series (1985). Art by [[Walter Simonson]].]] -->\nWhen the Celestials arrive on Earth around a century and a half later, Ikaris succeeds in this mission with the aid of human archaeologist Dr. Daniel Damian and his daughter, [[Margo Damian|Margo]]. Ikaris witnesses the arrival of the Fourth Celestial Host on Earth.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #1-4</ref> He then publicly reveals himself as all Eternals do.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #6</ref> He later battles a \"cosmic Hulk\" robot,<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #14-16</ref> and fights [[Dromedan]].<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #17</ref> During the Fourth Host, Valkin's son [[Druig]] captures and tortures Ikaris to force him to reveal the location of the Pyramid of the Winds.  Ikaris catches up with Druig and kills him, but not before Druig is able to fire a weapon at a Celestial; the Celestial, however, is unharmed.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #19</ref>\n\nLater, he encountered [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] for the first time.<ref>''Thor'' #284-289</ref> He next participated in a battle between the Eternals and the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian gods]] defeating Ares.<ref>''Thor'' #291-292</ref> Not long after that, he learned of the demise of [[Zuras]], the [[Prime Eternal]] (leader of Earth's Eternals).<ref>''Thor'' #301</ref>\n\nLater, it was revealed how Ikaris first encountered the [[Inhumans]].<ref>in a canonical story in ''What If'' Vol. 1 #29</ref> Ikaris was later captured with the other Eternals by a Deviant army. He joined with the other Eternals and [[War Machine|Iron Man]] (Jim Rhodes) in defeating the Deviants.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #6</ref> After that, Ikaris battled [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] alongside the other Eternals and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. After the battle, he was selected by the [[Uni-Mind]] to remain on Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #246-248</ref>\n\nDuring his long lifetime, Ikaris also attempts to be a fair and just leader of the Eternals, but has abandoned Eternal traditions to take an active and public role in protecting the human race.  He has even adopted a unique human identity by becoming a professional wrestler with the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]] as \"Iceberg\" Ike Harris.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> Ikaris and fellow Eternal [[Thena]] have had a strong dislike for each other for a long time, and find themselves coming to conflict when she is appointed as Prime Eternal. Questioning her worth as Prime Eternal, Ikaris faces her in the Hall of Eternal Judgment and defeats her, becoming the new Prime Eternal. Ikaris then battled [[Ghaur]] alongside the Eternals, Thor, and the [[West Coast Avengers]]. He also buried Margo Damian when she was killed.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #1-12</ref>\n\nLater, with the other Eternals, Ikaris captured the [[Silver Surfer]] on behalf of the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>''Silver Surfer Annual'' #1</ref> Some time after that, he was captured by the Deviant leader Brother Visara, and then freed by [[Kro (comics)|Kro]]. Ikaris exposed Dr. Damian as the Eternals' enemy, and battled a transformed [[Ajak]] as a result.<ref>''Eternals: The Herod Factor''</ref>\n\nIn ''The New Eternals'' series, Ikaris still retains the title of Prime Eternal. Ikaris and the Eternals' ancient nemesis Apocalypse returned to detonate a nuclear warhead on [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]]. He causes Ikaris's father Virako to return to life. Ikaris confronts, and fights Apocalypse. Although Ikaris is defeated by Apocalypse, Ikaris still manages to destroy his ship and thwart Apocalypse's plan. Virako is appalled to find the Eternals accepting Deviants such as [[Ransak the Reject]] and [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nUnder the alias of \"Sovereign\", he introduces the Eternals to the world as a team of super-heroes called the \"New Breed\".{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n====''Eternals'' mini-series (2006)====\nIkaris is featured in the Marvel mini-series ''Eternals'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and penciled by artist [[John Romita, Jr.]].  The [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] are the victims of memory and reality manipulation by former Eternal [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]], and thus have forgotten their true identities. Although Ikaris (calling himself Ike Harris) is captured and atomized by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] [[Gelt (comics)|Gelt]] and [[Morjak]],  his body reappears at the bottom of the (fictional) [[Antarctic]] city of Olympia. His body and powers fully restored by the sentient city, Ikaris regains his memories and sets out to awaken his fellow Eternals to their true identities. After a prolonged battle, he at last unites the few Eternals present. He then plans to team up with [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] and reawaken the ninety other Eternals.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n===''Eternals'' \u2013 Volume 4===\nAt the end of the last volume, [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] has been chosen as the \"chosen one\" that the awakened Dreaming Celestial communicates with. This is very frustrating to Ajak because he has spent his entire existence communing with the Celestials, their language and what their showing up means. In conversations between Makkari and the Dreaming Celestial, we find out that the Celestials pick or create a planet and seed it with life forms. They then create 100 Eternals and 100 Deviants. The Celestials then keep a watchful eye on the planet and weigh which of the two races influences the life forms more. This is done in servitude of the Fulcrum. If the Deviants influence has more prominence, the Celestials send the Horde to eradicate the race and they start over. If it is the Eternals, the Celestials allow the goodness to flow back into the Fulcrum, which the Celestials seems to serve.These conversations between Makkari and the Dreaming Celestial take place on a different plane of existence and cause Makkari's body to shut down, seemingly almost dying, which Sersi is concerned with because she thinks he is addicted to this state. We also see here the origin of the Dreaming Celestial and how he came to be put to sleep by the other Celestials.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nNext the story picks up with Thena and Ikaris, trying to find all of the other amnesiac Eternals and reminding them of who they are. They find that a similar effort is being conducted by Druig, who is now the ruler of Vorozheika. Druig is using a secret source to find the Eternals and is winning in the contest of finding and converting more Eternals to his cause. Ikaris and Thena approach Phastos, who thinks he is an engineer in Sweden named Phillip Voss. Thena tries to trigger his memory with questions about his past under the guise that she and Ikaris are attorneys executing the will of a deceased relative of Mr. Voss'. This ploy proves to be a failure and Ikaris just wants to force the memories on the Eternals who have lost their memories, but this also causes problems as they react violently to having their world's turned upside down like this.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nWe then see that Thena prior to her trip with Ikaris to visit Phastos, she leaves her son Joey Eliot in the care of her father: Zuras who seems a little absent-minded. Zuras begins to explore and show the different parts of the Eternals' habitat with Joey. It is here we learn that the Horde that the Dreaming Celestial has spoken of, that is coming to Earth has an agent already on Earth who is bonded to a human via a symbiotic relationship. This turns out to be Thena's son Joey. Joey is then seen going into a trance-like state when viewing new and unexplored areas of the habitat and information and transmitting that information back to the Horde. Sersi investigates and finds out about this through tracing a signal that is being sent from the habitat to the Horde and she informs Zuras of this fact. Zuras scoffs at this notion and Joey's life is terminated by the symbiote who determines that he has been detected.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nMakkari gets wind of Joey and his death from the Dreaming Celestial. He immediately goes to the habitat of the Eternals\u2014Olympia. Then Ajak comes up on the scene of a \"Burning Man\"-like party being held at the foot of the Dreaming Celestial. He attacks and disperses the worshippers there and is approached by Iron Man's strike team called the [[Order (comics)|Order]]. Ajak uses a \"jedi mind trick\" to send the Order away, and Ikaris shows up to have him go undercover inside Druig's stronghold. Ajak agrees and he soon is put to task to find Gilgamesh. Ajak finds him and convinces him that Thena, and Ikaris are possessed by the Deviants and their influence. Eventually Gilgamesh attacks Makkari and beats him violently, leaving to finish his attack against other Eternals. Ajak shows up in the aftermath of Gilgamesh's attack and atomizes Makkari, knowing that he will be given a new body and regenerated in one of the chambers in Olympus like their race has used for thousands of years. Makkari's death makes it necessary for the Dreaming Celestial, who does not have anyone to communicate with, use a failsafe that puts all humanoids asleep on the planet, except Eternals and Deviants.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nGilgamesh resumes his attack when he reaches Olympus and Thena barely defeats him, but only after he destroys the reassembling chamber that Makkari needs to reconstitute. Sersi then attacks the Dreaming Celestial and is told that she was given heightened powers to care for Makkari while he assisted the Dreaming Celestial in cataloging all super-powered beings on the planet. She then uses her powers to reconstitute Makkari, which stops the need for the failsafe of the Dreaming Celestial. And surprisingly when all of the humans awaken from their sleep, so to does Joey Eliot, ending Thena's sadness at the loss of her son. The Watcher mentions to the Dreaming Celestial that the child was dead and the Dreaming Celestial revived him. The Dreaming Celestial replies that the child was asleep like the rest of the humans and simply woke up when the rest did. The Watcher objects, and then realizes that the Dreaming Celestial has done this as an act of kindness, explained away as the child being simply asleep like the rest of the humans.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nIkaris' life force is augmented by cosmic energy and he has total mental control over his physical form and bodily processes even when he is asleep or unconscious. As a result, he is virtually immortal, immune to disease and aging, and invulnerable to conventional forms of injury. Should Ikaris be injured somehow, he could regenerate any injured or missing tissue. Cosmic energy bolsters Ikaris's metabolism so that he does not tire from any physical exertion. He can resist temperature extremes through mental concentration.\n\nIkaris can levitate himself by mentally manipulating gravitons around himself. He can also levitate other persons and objects, even while simultaneously levitating himself. Ikaris is able to fly via self-levitation at approximately 850 miles per hour, a rate of speed most other Eternals cannot match.\n\nIkaris has low level psychic abilities, enabling him to scan the superficial thoughts of any mind less adept than his own. He can mentally create illusions so as to disguise himself. Ikaris can also psionically manipulate atoms and molecules so as to transform an object's shape. However, Ikaris is only a second-level adept on a five level scale (the fifth level being the highest) in this discipline. He can rearrange molecules in the air so as to create a virtually impenetrable shield about himself.\n\nIkaris can project cosmic energy in the form of beams from his eyes or beams and flashes from his hands. This cosmic energy, stored in specialized enclaves of cells in his body, can be used as force, heat, light, and possibly other forms of electromagnetic energy. Ikaris can project a maximum concussive force of at least 260 pounds per square inch. He can project heat of a maximum temperature of at least 3,000 Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt iron. It takes about one minute for him to attain this maximum temperature. Because Ikaris's heat beams can vaporize solid objects, they are often called his disintegrator beams, The maximum range for his energy beams is about 200 feet. Ikaris is a fourth level adept on a five-level scale (the fifth level being the highest) in this discipline. The expenditure of cosmic energy in this way continually for several hours will temporarily deplete Ikaris's physical strength, but not his resistance to injury, although it will temporarily increase his sensitivity to pain. He will rapidly return to normal after such lengthy energy expenditure is over.\n\nIkaris can teleport himself psionically, but prefers not to do so, since, like other Eternals, he finds the self-teleportation process physically unpleasant. He can also teleport other people along with himself.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Marvel 2099===\nThere is an alternate future version of Ikaris in the [[Marvel 2099]] universe.
