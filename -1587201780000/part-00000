Supporting roles are played by [[Ed Harris]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Stephen Dillane]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Claire Danes]], and [[Eileen Atkins]]. The screenplay by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] is based on [[Michael Cunningham]]'s 1998 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Hours (novel)|novel of the same title]].\n\nThe plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]]. These are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950s California housewife in an unhappy marriage with a young son; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel.\n\nThe film was released in Los Angeles and New York City on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 2002, and was given a [[limited release]] in the United States and Canada two days later on December 27, 2002. It did not receive a [[wide release]] in North America until January 2003, and was then released in British cinemas on [[Valentine's Day]] that year. Critical reaction to the film was largely positive, with nine [[Academy Award]] nominations for ''The Hours'' including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and a win for [[Nicole Kidman]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nWith the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 [[suicide]] by drowning of [[Virginia Woolf]] in the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], the film takes place within the span of a single day in three different decades and alternates between them throughout the film. The following plot summary has been simplified and is in chronological order, not the order as presented in the film. \n\n=== 1923 ===\nVirginia Woolf has begun writing the book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' in her home in the town of [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] outside [[London]]. Virginia has experienced several [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]s and suffers from depression. She is constantly under the eye of her servants and her husband, [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who has begun a publishing business at home, [[Hogarth Press]], to stay close to her. Virginia's sister, [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]], and her children, [[Julian Bell|Julian]], [[Quentin Bell|Quentin]], and [[Angelica Garnett|Angelica]], come over for an afternoon visit. She and Virginia talk about Vanessa's life in London and Virginia's mental condition. She longs for a life similar to Vanessa, living in London. Vanessa's children find a dead bird. Virginia and Angelica make a funeral for the bird. Virginia lays down just like the bird and looks into the bird\u2019s eyes. She sees herself in the dead bird, suffering and dying in her circumstances. Everyone goes back inside and Virginia continues writing her book. She says that she was going to kill her heroine but instead chooses to kill another character in the book. Before Vanessa leaves, Virginia passionately kisses her sister. It is clear Virginia wants them to stay and wants her sister\u2019s life. After their departure, Virginia flees to the train station, where she is awaiting a train to London. Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where, stressing that she has the right to decide how her mental condition is treated and wanting to move back to London. Virginia returns home and begins writing again. Leonard questions her as to why someone has to die. Virginia says \u201cIn order that the rest of us should value life more.\u201d Leonard asks who will die and Virginia says \"The poet will die, the visionary.\u201d\n\n=== 1951 ===\nPregnant with her second child, Laura Brown spends her days in her [[Tract housing|tract home]] in Los Angeles with her young son, Richie, and escapes from her conventional life by reading ''Mrs Dalloway''. She married her husband, Dan, soon after [[World War II]]. On the surface they are living the [[American Dream]], but she is nonetheless deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty reveals that the procedure is related to the fact that she has been unable to conceive, and may portend permanent infertility, and that she really feels that a woman is not complete until she is a mother. Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her sadness and fear and boldly kisses her on the lips; Kitty acts as if it didn't happen. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with a babysitter, Mrs. Latch. Richie runs after his mother as she leaves, fearing that she will never come back. Laura checks into a hotel, where she intends to commit suicide. Laura removes several bottles of pills and ''Mrs Dalloway'' from her purse and begins to read it. She drifts off to sleep and dreams the hotel room is flooded. She awakens with a change of heart and caresses her belly. She picks up Richie, who fearfully tells his mother he loves her, and they return home to celebrate Dan's birthday.\n\n=== 2001 ===\nNew Yorker Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character. She spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] who is to receive a major literary award. Clarissa, who is bisexual and has been living with Sally Lester for 10 years, was in a relationship with Richard during their college years. She meets with Richard's ex-lover Louis Waters, who has returned for the festivities. Clarissa's daughter, Julia, comes home to help her prepare. Clarissa visits Richard and he tells Clarissa that he has stayed alive for her sake and that the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tries reassuring him. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \"Mrs. Dalloway\" \u2013 her namesake \u2013 because she distracts herself from her own life the way that the Woolf character does. Richard tells Clarissa that she is the most beautiful thing that he ever had in life, before he commits suicide in front of her. Later that night, Richard's mother, Laura Brown, arrives at Clarissa's apartment. Laura is aware that her abandonment of her family was deeply traumatic for Richard, but Laura reveals that it was a better decision for her to leave the family after the birth of her daughter than to commit suicide. She does not apologize for the hurt that she caused to her family and suggests that it's not possible to feel regret for something over which she had no choice. She acknowledges that no one will forgive her, but she offers an explanation: \"It was death. I chose life.\"\n\nThe film ends with Virginia's suicide by drowning with a voice-over in which Virginia thanks Leonard for loving her: \"Always the years between us. Always the years. Always the love. Always the hours.\"\n\n==Cast==\n;1923\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as [[Virginia Woolf]]\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as [[Leonard Woolf]]\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as [[Vanessa Bell]]\n* [[Lyndsey Marshal]] as Lottie Hope\n* [[Linda Bassett]] as Nelly Boxall\n*George Loftus as [[Quentin Bell]]\n*Charley Ramm as [[Julian Bell]]\n*Sophie Wyburd as [[Angelica Garnett|Angelica Bell]]\n\n;1951\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Laura Brown\n* [[John C.

Kidman's performance was widely acclaimed, and she won numerous awards for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf, including the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. ''The Hours'' has an 80% \"fresh\" rating on the film review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 193 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10. The consensus says that \"the movie may be a downer, but it packs an emotional wallop. Some fine acting on display here.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hours/|title=''The Hours''|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds an average score of 80 out of 100, based on 40 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/hours|title=''The Hours''|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' criticized the film's simplistic characterization, saying, \"Watching ''The Hours'', one finds oneself focusing excessively on the unfortunate prosthetic nose Kidman affects in order to look more like the novelist. And wondering why the screenwriter, David Hare, and the director, Stephen Daldry, turn Woolf, a woman of incisive mind, into a hapless ditherer.\" He also criticized its overt politicization: \"But this movie is in love with female victimization. Moore's Laura is trapped in the suburban flatlands of the '50s, while Streep's Clarissa is moored in a hopeless love for Laura's homosexual son (Ed Harris, in a truly ugly performance), an AIDS sufferer whose relentless anger is directly traceable to Mom's long-ago desertion of him. Somehow, despite the complexity of the film's structure, this all seems too simple-minded. Or should we perhaps say agenda driven? This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score \u2014 tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003931,00.html|title=Holiday Movie Preview: The Hours|author=RICHARD SCHICKEL|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=July 19, 2010|publisher=Time.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"deeply moving\" and \"an amazingly faithful screen adaptation\" and added, \"Although suicide eventually tempts three of the film's characters, ''The Hours'' is not an unduly morbid film. Clear eyed and austerely balanced would be a more accurate description, along with magnificently written and acted. Mr. Glass's surging minimalist score, with its air of cosmic abstraction, serves as ideal connective tissue for a film that breaks down temporal barriers.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/27HOUR.html |title=Who's Afraid Like Virginia Woolf? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 27, 2002 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204232423/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/27HOUR.html |archivedate=December 4, 2009}}</ref> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' observed, \"Director Stephen Daldry employs the wonderful things cinema can do in order to realize aspects of ''The Hours'' that Cunningham could only hint at or approximate on the page. The result is something rare, especially considering how fine the novel is, a film that's fuller and deeper than the book ... It's marvelous to watch the ways in which [David Hare] consistently dramatizes the original material without compromising its integrity or distorting its intent ... Cunningham's [novel] touched on notes of longing, middle-aged angst and the sense of being a small consciousness in the midst of a grand mystery. But Daldry and Hare's [film] sounds those notes and sends audiences out reverberating with them, exalted.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Mick |last=LaSalle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/12/27/DD114138.DTL |title=Film proves to be book's finest 'Hours' / Kidman, Moore, Streep lift story even higher |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=December 27, 2002 |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film, which he thought \"sometimes stumbles on literary pretensions,\" three out of four stars. He praised the performances, commenting, \"Kidman's acting is superlative, full of passion and feeling ...

The performances that Daldry elicits . . . are all strong: tightly managed, smoothly and dashingly juxtaposed under a plangent score . . .

Supporting roles are played by [[Ed Harris]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Stephen Dillane]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Claire Danes]], and [[Eileen Atkins]]. The screenplay by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] is based on [[Michael Cunningham]]'s 1998 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Hours (novel)|novel of the same title]].\n\nThe plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]]. These are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950s California housewife in an unhappy marriage with a young son; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel.\n\nThe film was released in Los Angeles and New York City on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 2002, and was given a [[limited release]] in the United States and Canada two days later on December 27, 2002. It did not receive a [[wide release]] in North America until January 2003, and was then released in British cinemas on [[Valentine's Day]] that year. Critical reaction to the film was largely positive, with nine [[Academy Award]] nominations for ''The Hours'' including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and a win for [[Nicole Kidman]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nWith the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 [[suicide]] by drowning of [[Virginia Woolf]] in the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], the film takes place within the span of a single day in three different decades and alternates between them throughout the film. The following plot summary has been simplified and is in chronological order, not the order as presented in the film. \n\n=== 1923 ===\nVirginia Woolf has begun writing the book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' in her home in the town of [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] outside [[London]]. Virginia has experienced several [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]s and suffers from depression. She is constantly under the eye of her servants and her husband, [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who has begun a publishing business at home, [[Hogarth Press]], to stay close to her. Virginia's sister, [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]], and her children, [[Julian Bell|Julian]], [[Quentin Bell|Quentin]], and [[Angelica Garnett|Angelica]], come over for an afternoon visit. She and Virginia talk about Vanessa's life in London and Virginia's mental condition. She longs for a life similar to Vanessa, living in London. Vanessa's children find a dead bird. Virginia and Angelica make a funeral for the bird. Virginia lays down just like the bird and looks into the bird\u2019s eyes. She sees herself in the dead bird, suffering and dying in her circumstances. Everyone goes back inside and Virginia continues writing her book. She says that she was going to kill her heroine but instead chooses to kill another character in the book. Before Vanessa leaves, Virginia passionately kisses her sister. It is clear Virginia wants them to stay and wants her sister\u2019s life. After their departure, Virginia flees to the train station, where she is awaiting a train to London. Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where, stressing that she has the right to decide how her mental condition is treated and wanting to move back to London. Virginia returns home and begins writing again. Leonard questions her as to why someone has to die. Virginia says \u201cin order that the rest of us should value life more.\u201d Leonard asks who will die and Virginia says the \u201cpoet, the visionary.\u201d\n\n=== 1951 ===\nPregnant with her second child, Laura Brown spends her days in her [[Tract housing|tract home]] in Los Angeles with her young son, Richie, and escapes from her conventional life by reading ''Mrs Dalloway''. She married her husband, Dan, soon after [[World War II]]. On the surface they are living the [[American Dream]], but she is nonetheless deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty reveals that the procedure is related to the fact that she has been unable to conceive, and may portend permanent infertility, and that she really feels that a woman is not complete until she is a mother. Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her sadness and fear and boldly kisses her on the lips; Kitty acts as if it didn't happen. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with a babysitter, Mrs. Latch. Richie runs after his mother as she leaves, fearing that she will never come back. Laura checks into a hotel, where she intends to commit suicide. Laura removes several bottles of pills and ''Mrs Dalloway'' from her purse and begins to read it. She drifts off to sleep and dreams the hotel room is flooded. She awakens with a change of heart and caresses her belly. She picks up Richie, who fearfully tells his mother he loves her, and they return home to celebrate Dan's birthday.\n\n=== 2001 ===\nNew Yorker Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character. She spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] who is to receive a major literary award. Clarissa, who is bisexual and has been living with Sally Lester for 10 years, was in a relationship with Richard during their college years. She meets with Richard's ex-lover Louis Waters, who has returned for the festivities. Clarissa's daughter, Julia, comes home to help her prepare. Clarissa visits Richard and he tells Clarissa that he has stayed alive for her sake and that the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tries reassuring him. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \"Mrs. Dalloway\" \u2013 her namesake \u2013 because she distracts herself from her own life the way that the Woolf character does. Richard tells Clarissa that she is the most beautiful thing that he ever had in life, before he commits suicide in front of her. Later that night, Richard's mother, Laura Brown, arrives at Clarissa's apartment. Laura is aware that her abandonment of her family was deeply traumatic for Richard, but Laura reveals that it was a better decision for her to leave the family after the birth of her daughter than to commit suicide. She does not apologize for the hurt that she caused to her family and suggests that it's not possible to feel regret for something over which she had no choice. She acknowledges that no one will forgive her, but she offers an explanation: \"It was death. I chose life.\"\n\nThe film ends with Virginia's suicide by drowning with a voice-over in which Virginia thanks Leonard for loving her: \"Always the years between us. Always the years. Always the love. Always the hours.\"\n\n==Cast==\n;1923\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as [[Virginia Woolf]]\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as [[Leonard Woolf]]\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as [[Vanessa Bell]]\n* [[Lyndsey Marshal]] as Lottie Hope\n* [[Linda Bassett]] as Nelly Boxall\n*George Loftus as [[Quentin Bell]]\n*Charley Ramm as [[Julian Bell]]\n*Sophie Wyburd as [[Angelica Garnett|Angelica Bell]]\n\n;1951\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Laura Brown\n* [[John C.

Kidman's performance was widely acclaimed, and she won numerous awards for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf, including the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. ''The Hours'' has an 80% \"fresh\" rating on the film review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 193 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10. The consensus says that \"the movie may be a downer, but it packs an emotional wallop. Some fine acting on display here.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hours/|title=''The Hours''|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds an average score of 80 out of 100, based on 40 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/hours|title=''The Hours''|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' criticized the film's simplistic characterization, saying, \"Watching ''The Hours'', one finds oneself focusing excessively on the unfortunate prosthetic nose Kidman affects in order to look more like the novelist. And wondering why the screenwriter, David Hare, and the director, Stephen Daldry, turn Woolf, a woman of incisive mind, into a hapless ditherer.\" He also criticized its overt politicization: \"But this movie is in love with female victimization. Moore's Laura is trapped in the suburban flatlands of the '50s, while Streep's Clarissa is moored in a hopeless love for Laura's homosexual son (Ed Harris, in a truly ugly performance), an AIDS sufferer whose relentless anger is directly traceable to Mom's long-ago desertion of him. Somehow, despite the complexity of the film's structure, this all seems too simple-minded. Or should we perhaps say agenda driven? This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score \u2014 tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003931,00.html|title=Holiday Movie Preview: The Hours|author=RICHARD SCHICKEL|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=July 19, 2010|publisher=Time.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"deeply moving\" and \"an amazingly faithful screen adaptation\" and added, \"Although suicide eventually tempts three of the film's characters, ''The Hours'' is not an unduly morbid film. Clear eyed and austerely balanced would be a more accurate description, along with magnificently written and acted. Mr. Glass's surging minimalist score, with its air of cosmic abstraction, serves as ideal connective tissue for a film that breaks down temporal barriers.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/27HOUR.html |title=Who's Afraid Like Virginia Woolf? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 27, 2002 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204232423/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/27HOUR.html |archivedate=December 4, 2009}}</ref> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' observed, \"Director Stephen Daldry employs the wonderful things cinema can do in order to realize aspects of ''The Hours'' that Cunningham could only hint at or approximate on the page. The result is something rare, especially considering how fine the novel is, a film that's fuller and deeper than the book ... It's marvelous to watch the ways in which [David Hare] consistently dramatizes the original material without compromising its integrity or distorting its intent ... Cunningham's [novel] touched on notes of longing, middle-aged angst and the sense of being a small consciousness in the midst of a grand mystery. But Daldry and Hare's [film] sounds those notes and sends audiences out reverberating with them, exalted.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Mick |last=LaSalle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/12/27/DD114138.DTL |title=Film proves to be book's finest 'Hours' / Kidman, Moore, Streep lift story even higher |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=December 27, 2002 |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film, which he thought \"sometimes stumbles on literary pretensions,\" three out of four stars. He praised the performances, commenting, \"Kidman's acting is superlative, full of passion and feeling ... Moore is wrenching in her scenes with Laura's son (Jack Rovello, an exceptional child actor). And Streep is a miracle worker, building a character in the space between words and worlds.

The performances that Daldry elicits . . . are all strong: tightly managed, smoothly and dashingly juxtaposed under a plangent score . . . Part of the bracing experimental impact of the film was the absence of narrative connection between the three women.

[[Iroquois]] people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper [[Ohio River]] basin. The [[American Revolutionary War]] and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the [[eastern United States]] to the [[Indian Territory]] (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the [[Indian removal]] policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape reside in [[Oklahoma]], with some communities living also in [[Wisconsin]], [[Ontario]] (Canada), and in their traditional homelands.\n\nEuropeans came to the [[Delaware Valley]] in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built [[Fort Nassau (South River)|Fort Nassau]] on the Delaware River opposite the [[Schuylkill River]] in what is now [[Brooklawn, New Jersey]]. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1638, [[Sweden|Swedish]] settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of [[New Sweden]] at [[Fort Christina]] (present-day [[Wilmington, Delaware]]) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the [[Susquehannock]]s in their military defeat of the English colony of [[Maryland]]. In 1648, the Dutch built [[Fort Beversreede]] on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day [[Eastwick, Philadelphia|Eastwick]] neighborhood, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building [[New Sweden#Forts|Fort Nya Korsholm]], or New [[Korsholm]], named after a town in [[Finland]] with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682 when the area was included in [[William Penn]]'s charter for Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, [[Charles II of England]] granted Penn a [[charter]] for what would become the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania colony]]. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony.<ref>{{Cite book\n |last=Brookes\n |first=Karin\n |author2=John Gattuso, Lou Harry, Edward Jardim, Donald Kraybill, Susan Lewis, Dave Nelson and Carol Turkington\n |editor=Zo\u00eb Ross\n |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings\n |edition=Second Edition (Updated)\n |year=2005\n |publisher=APA Publications\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21 21]\n |isbn=1-58573-026-2\n |url=https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21\n }}</ref> Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief [[Tamanend|Tammany]] under an elm tree at [[Shackamaxon]], in what is now the city's [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]] neighborhood.<ref name=weigley>{{Cite book |author          = Weigley RF (eds)\n |title           = Philadelphia: A 300-Year History\n |publisher       = [[W.

Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and [[orchard]]s. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, as they crowded by the Delaware River port, and subdivided and resold their lots.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 7, 14 \u2013 16</ref> Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|Academy of Natural Sciences]] (1812), and the [[Franklin Institute]] (1824).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=35&chapter=2 |title=Explore PA History website |publisher=Explorepahistory.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> These societies developed and financed new industries, attracting skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n[[File:1752 ( 1850 ) Scull ^ Heap Map of Philadelphia ^ Environs (first view of Phillidelphia State House) - Geographicus - Philadelphia-sculllobach-1850.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 18th-century map of Philadelphia, circa 1752]]\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for [[American Revolution|America's revolutionaries]].

The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. [[New York City]] surpassed Philadelphia in population by 1790.

[[Iroquois]] people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper [[Ohio River]] basin. The [[American Revolutionary War]] and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the [[eastern United States]] to the [[Indian Territory]] (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the [[Indian removal]] policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape reside in [[Oklahoma]], with some communities living also in [[Wisconsin]], [[Ontario]] (Canada), and in their traditional homelands.\n\nEuropeans came to the [[Delaware Valley]] in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built [[Fort Nassau (South River)|Fort Nassau]] on the Delaware River opposite the [[Schuylkill River]] in what is now [[Brooklawn, New Jersey]]. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1638, [[Sweden|Swedish]] settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of [[New Sweden]] at [[Fort Christina]] (present-day [[Wilmington, Delaware]]) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the [[Susquehannock]]s in their military defeat of the English colony of [[Maryland]]. In 1648, the Dutch built [[Fort Beversreede]] on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day [[Eastwick, Philadelphia|Eastwick]] neighborhood, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building [[New Sweden#Forts|Fort Nya Korsholm]], or New [[Korsholm]], named after a town in [[Finland]] with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682 when the area was included in [[William Penn]]'s charter for Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, [[Charles II of England]] granted Penn a [[charter]] for what would become the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania colony]]. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony.<ref>{{Cite book\n |last=Brookes\n |first=Karin\n |author2=John Gattuso, Lou Harry, Edward Jardim, Donald Kraybill, Susan Lewis, Dave Nelson and Carol Turkington\n |editor=Zo\u00eb Ross\n |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings\n |edition=Second Edition (Updated)\n |year=2005\n |publisher=APA Publications\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21 21]\n |isbn=1-58573-026-2\n |url=https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21\n }}</ref> Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief [[Tamanend|Tammany]] under an elm tree at [[Shackamaxon]], in what is now the city's [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]] neighborhood.<ref name=weigley>{{Cite book |author          = Weigley RF (eds)\n |title           = Philadelphia: A 300-Year History\n |publisher       = [[W.

Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and [[orchard]]s. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, as they crowded by the Delaware River port, and subdivided and resold their lots.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 7, 14 \u2013 16</ref> Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|Academy of Natural Sciences]] (1812), and the [[Franklin Institute]] (1824).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=35&chapter=2 |title=Explore PA History website |publisher=Explorepahistory.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> These societies developed and financed new industries, attracting skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n[[File:1752 ( 1850 ) Scull ^ Heap Map of Philadelphia ^ Environs (first view of Phillidelphia State House) - Geographicus - Philadelphia-sculllobach-1850.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 18th-century map of Philadelphia, circa 1752]]\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for [[American Revolution|America's revolutionaries]].

The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. [[New York City]] surpassed Philadelphia in population by 1790.

It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) using the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system. [[Paul Flynn (politician)|Paul Flynn]], of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], was the MP from the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] until his death on 17 February 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-47274312|title=Veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn dies aged 84|date=2019-02-18|access-date=2019-02-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> Consequently a [[2019 Newport West by-election|by-election]] was held in the constituency on Thursday 4 April 2019. It is currently represented by [[Ruth Jones (politician)|Ruth Jones]].\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency comprises the electoral divisions of [[Allt-yr-yn]], [[Bettws, Newport|Bettws]], [[Caerleon]], [[Gaer, Newport|Gaer]], [[Graig, Newport|Graig]], [[Malpas, Newport|Malpas]], [[Marshfield, Newport|Marshfield]], [[Pillgwenlly]], [[Rogerstone]], [[Shaftesbury, Newport|Shaftesbury]], [[Stow Hill, Newport|Stow Hill]] and [[Tredegar Park (ward)|Tredegar Park]] in the city of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]. The western and northern boundaries are formed by the city boundary, the eastern boundary by the [[River Usk]], and the southern boundary by the [[Bristol Channel]].\n\n==History==\nNewport West was created when the former [[Newport (Monmouthshire) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport constituency]] was split into two seats in 1983. The seat was won on a narrow three-figure majority by the Conservatives. However, Labour's Paul Flynn gained the seat in 1987 and held it until his death in 2019.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{Rayment-hc|n|1|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n| [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]\n| [[Mark Robinson (Conservative politician)|Mark Robinson]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n| [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]]\n| [[Paul Flynn (politician)|Paul Flynn]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|[[2019 Newport West by-election|2019 by-election]]\n|[[Ruth Jones (politician)|Ruth Jones]]\n|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|}\n\n== Elections ==\n===Elections in the 2010s===\n\n{{Election box begin|title=[[2019 United Kingdom general election|General election 2019]]: Newport West<ref>{{cite web |title=General Election 2019 |url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/documents/Council-and-Democracy/Elections-and-voting/General-election-2019/Notice-of-Poll-West.pdf |website=Newport City Council |publisher=Newport City Council |accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Newport West parliamentary constituency - Election 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/W07000056 |website=BBC |accessdate=13 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=2019results>{{cite web |title=Election-Results/General-Election-2019|url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/en/Council-Democracy/Elections-and-voting/Election-results/General-Election-December-2019-results.aspx|website=Newport City Council |publisher=Newport City Council |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n  |party      = Welsh Labour\n  |candidate  = [[Ruth Jones (politician)|Ruth Jones]]\n  |votes      = 18,977\n  |percentage = 43.7\n  |change     = -8.6\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Welsh Conservative Party\n  |candidate  = Matthew Evans\n  |votes      = 18,075\n  |percentage = 41.6\n  |change     = +2.3\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Welsh Liberal Democrats\n  |candidate  = Ryan Jones\n  |votes      = 2,565\n  |percentage = 5.9\n  |change     = +3.7\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Brexit Party\n  |candidate  = Cameron Edwards\n  |votes      = 1,727\n  |percentage = 4.0\n  |change     = N/A\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n  |party      = Plaid Cymru\n  |candidate  = Jonathan Clark\n  |votes      = 1,187\n  |percentage = 2.7\n  |change     = +0.3\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Green Party of England and Wales\n  |candidate  = [[Amelia Womack]]\n  |votes      = 902\n  |percentage = 2.1\n  |change     = +0.9\n}}\n{{Election box rejected\n  |votes      = 130\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box majority\n  |votes      = 902\n  |percentage = 2.1\n  |change     = -10.9\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n  |votes      = 43,433\n  |percentage = 65.2\n  |change     = -2.3\n}}\n{{Election box registered electors\n  |reg. electors = 66,657\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n  |winner     = Labour Party (UK)\n  |swing      = -5.5\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\nOf the 130 rejected ballots:\n*98 were either unmarked or it was uncertain who the vote was for.<ref name=2019results/>\n*29 voted for more than one candidate.<ref name=2019results/>\n*3 had writing or mark by which the voter could be identified.<ref name=2019results/>\n\nA [[2019 Newport West by-election|by-election]] took place on 4 April 2019, following the death of standing MP Paul Flynn.

This pressure difference drives ventilation between platforms and the surface exits through the passenger foot network. This system depends on adequate cross sectional area of the airspace above the passengers\u2019 heads in the foot tunnels and escalators, where laminar airflow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, the Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation. It also depends on an absence of turbulence in the tunnel headspace. In many stations the ventilation system is now ineffective because of alterations that reduce tunnel diameters and increase turbulence. An example is Green Park tube station, where false ceiling panels attached to metal frames have been installed that reduce the above-head airspace diameter by more than half in many parts. This has the effect of reducing laminar airflow by 94%.\n\nOriginally air turbulence was kept to a minimum by keeping all signage flat to the tunnel walls. Now the ventilation space above head height is crowded with ducting, conduits, cameras, speakers and equipment acting as a baffle plates with predictable reductions in flow.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Demartini |first1=LC |last2=Vielmo |first2=HA |last3=M\u00f6ller |first3=SV |title=Numeric and experimental analysis of the turbulent flow through a channel with baffle plates |journal=Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=153\u2013159 |doi=10.1590/S1678-58782004000200006 |year=2004 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Often electronic signs have their flat surface at right angles to the main air flow, causing choked flow. Temporary sign boards that stand at the top of escalators also maximise turbulence. The alterations to the ventilation system are important, not only to heat exchange, but also the quality of the air at platform level, particularly given its asbestos content.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Croucher |first1=S |title=Deadly Asbestos 'All Over the Place' on London Underground |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/asbestos-london-underground-tube-rmt-295229 |accessdate=4 March 2016|date=8 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Lifts and escalators===\n{{see also|London Underground infrastructure#Lifts and escalators|label 1=London Underground infrastructure: Lifts and escalators}}\n[[File:Canary Wharf tube station night 2.jpg|thumb|left|Escalators at Canary Wharf station]]\nOriginally access to the deep-tube platforms was by a lift.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=26, 35, 39, 87\u201389}} Each lift was staffed, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=540}} The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=114, 542}} The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the top landing.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=114, 542}}{{sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=59}} In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers to stand on the right and signs followed in World War II.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=154, 546}} Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them would have a clear passage on the left side of the escalator.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article6883065.ece |title=Mystery over Tube escalator etiquette cleared up by restored film |last=Malvern |first=Jack |date=21 October 2009 |work=The Times |location=London}} {{Subscription required}}</ref> The first 'comb' type escalator was installed in 1924 at [[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]].{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=114, 542}} In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators.{{sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=93}} After the fatal 1987 [[King's Cross fire]], all wooden escalators were replaced with metal ones and the mechanisms are regularly degreased to lower the potential for fires.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/escape/pioneers.html |title=Pioneers of Survival: Fire |publisher=PBS}}</ref> The only wooden escalator not to be replaced was at [[Greenford station]], which remained until October 2015 when TfL replaced it with the first [[Incline elevator|incline lift]] on the UK transport network.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/uk-first-as-incline-lift-opens-at-greenford-tube-station |title=Incline lift at Greenford Tube station is UK first |publisher=Transport for London |date=20 October 2015 |access-date=21 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227132647/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/uk-first-as-incline-lift-opens-at-greenford-tube-station |archive-date=27 December 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThere are 426 escalators on the London Underground system and the longest, at {{convert|60|m}}, is at [[Angel tube station|Angel]].

London Underground is therefore extending their operational life by making major repairs to many of the trains to maintain reliability. The Bakerloo line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled [[articulated car|articulated trains]] and a new signalling system to allow [[Automatic Train Operation]]. The line is predicted to run a maximum of 27 trains per hour, a 25% increase from the current 21-trains-per-hour peak service.<ref name=\"New Tube for London Feasibility Report\">{{cite web |title=New Tube for London Feasibility Report |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/ntfl-feasibility-report.pdf |publisher=TfL |date=October 2014 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Bakerloo line 1972 stock train overhall\">{{cite web |title=Bakerloo Line Fleet Life Extension |date=11 March 2015 |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/fpc-20150311-part-1-item15-bakerloo-line.pdf |publisher=TfL |accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Central line''' \u2013 The Central line was the first line to be modernised in the 1990s, with 85 new 1992-stock trains and a new automatic signalling system installed to allow Automatic Train Operation. The line runs 34 trains per hour for half an hour in the morning peak but is unable to operate more frequently because of a lack of additional trains. The 85 existing 1992-stock trains are the most unreliable on the London Underground as they are equipped with the first generation of solid state direct current thyristor control traction equipment. The trains often break down, have to be withdrawn from service at short notice and at times are not available when required, leading to gaps in service at peak times. Although relatively modern and well within their design life, the trains need work in the medium term to ensure the continued reliability of the traction control equipment and maintain fleet serviceability until renewal, which is expected between 2028 and 2032. Major work is to be undertaken on the fleet to ensure their continued reliability with brakes, traction control systems, doors, automatic control systems being repaired or replaced among other components. The Central line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walkthrough trains and a new more up-to-date automatic signalling system. The line is predicted to run 36 trains per hour, a 25% increase compared to the present service of 34 trains for busiest 30 minutes in the morning and evening peaks and the 27\u201330 train per hour service for the rest of the peak.<ref name=\"New Tube for London Feasibility Report\"/><ref name=\"Report on Central Line train overhaul\">{{cite web |title=Central line train overhaul project |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/fpc-20150311-part-1-item16-central-line-overhaul.pdf |publisher=TfL |accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Central line timetable |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/wtt-67-central-15-september-2013.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140415231448/http://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/wtt-67-central-15-september-2013.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 15 April 2014 |publisher=TfL |accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Jubilee line''' \u2013 The signalling system on the Jubilee line has been replaced to increase capacity on the line by 20%\u2014the line now runs 30 trains per hour at peak times, compared to the previous 24 trains per hour.

To enable this up to 50 additional trains will be built in addition to the current 106 1995 stock.

The Piccadilly will be the first line to be upgraded as part of the New Tube for London Project as passenger usage has increased over recent years and is expected to increase further. This line is important in this project because it does not provide service that is as frequent a service as other lines.<ref name=\"New Tube for London Feasibility Report\"/>\n* '''Subsurface lines (District, Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City and Circle)''' \u2013 New S Stock trains have been introduced on the sub-surface (District, Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City and Circle)lines.

The track, electrical supply and signalling systems are also being upgraded in a programme to increase peak-hour capacity. The replacement of the signalling system and the introduction of Automatic Train Operation/Control is scheduled for 2019\u201322. A control room for the sub-surface network has been built in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system is to replace signalling equipment installed from the 1920s such as the signal box at Edgware Road, still manually operated.

The Hammersmith & City and Circle lines share stations and most of their track with each other, as well as with the Metropolitan and District lines. The [[Bakerloo line|Bakerloo]], [[Central line (London Underground)|Central]], [[Jubilee line|Jubilee]], [[Northern line|Northern]], [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]], [[Victoria line|Victoria]] and [[Waterloo & City line]]s are deep-level tubes, with smaller trains that run in two circular tunnels (''tubes'') with a diameter about {{convert|11|ft|8|in}}. These lines have the exclusive use of a pair of tracks, except for the Uxbridge branch of the Piccadilly line, which shares track with the District line between Acton Town and Hanger Lane Junction and with the Metropolitan line between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge; and the Bakerloo line, which shares track with [[London Overground]]'s [[Watford DC Line]] for its aboveground section north of Queen's Park.<ref name=\"map\">{{cite web |url=http://carto.metro.free.fr/cartes/metro-london/ |title=Detailed London Transport Map |accessdate=1 December 2012 |work=carto.metro.free.fr}}</ref>\n\nFifty-five per cent of the system runs on the surface.

The route was laid out by the LNWR in 1912\u201315 and is part of the [[Network Rail]] system.\n* Central line: The railway from just south of [[Leyton tube station|Leyton]] to just south of [[Loughton tube station|Loughton]] was built by [[Eastern Counties Railway]] in 1856 on the same alignment in use today.{{sfnp|Brown|2012}} The Underground also uses the line built in 1865 by the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER) between Loughton to [[Ongar tube station|Ongar]] via [[Epping tube station|Epping]]. The connection to the main line south of Leyton was closed in 1970 and removed in 1972. The line from Epping to Ongar was closed in 1994; most of the line is in use today by the heritage [[Epping Ongar Railway]].{{sfnp|Brown|2012}} The line between [[Newbury Park tube station|Newbury Park]] and Woodford junction (west of [[Roding Valley tube station|Roding Valley]]) via Hainault was built by the GER in 1903, the connections to the main line south of Newbury Park closing in 1947 (in the Ilford direction) and 1956 (in the Seven Kings direction).{{sfnp|Brown|2012}}\n* Central line: The line from just north of [[White City tube station|White City]] to [[Ealing Broadway tube station|Ealing Broadway]] was built in 1917 by the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) and passenger service introduced by the Underground in 1920. [[North Acton tube station|North Acton]] to [[West Ruislip tube station|West Ruislip]] was built by GWR on behalf of the Underground in 1947\u20138 alongside the pre-existing tracks from Old Oak Common junction towards {{rws|High Wycombe}} and beyond, which date from 1904.{{sfnp|Brown|2012}} {{As of|2013|5}}, the original Old Oak Common junction to {{rws|South Ruislip}} route has one main-line train a day to and from Paddington.<ref>{{NRtimes|May 13|115}}</ref>\n* District line: South of [[Kensington Olympia station|Kensington Olympia]] short sections of the 1862 [[West London Railway]] (WLR) and its 1863 West London Extension Railway (WLER) were used when District extended from Earl's Court in 1872. The District had its own bay platform at Olympia built in 1958 along with track on the bed of the 1862\u20133 WLR/WLER northbound. The southbound WLR/WLER became the new northbound main line at that time, and a new southbound main-line track was built through the site of former goods yard. The 1872 junction closed in 1958, and a further connection to the WLR just south of Olympia closed in 1992. The branch is now segregated.{{sfnp|Brown|2012}}\n* District line: The line between Campbell Road junction (now closed), near [[Bromley-by-Bow tube station|Bromley-by-Bow]], and [[Barking station|Barking]] was built by the [[London, Tilbury & Southend Railway]] (LTSR) in 1858. The slow tracks were built 1903\u201305, when District services were extended from [[Bow Road]] (though there were no District services east of [[East Ham tube station|East Ham]] from 1905 to 1932). The slow tracks were shared with LTSR stopping and goods trains until segregated by 1962, when main-line trains stopped serving intermediate stations.{{sfnp|Brown|2012}}\n* District line: The railway from Barking to [[Upminster tube station|Upminster]] was built by LTSR in 1885 and the District extended over the route in 1902. District withdrew between 1905 and 1932, when the route was quadrupled. Main-line trains ceased serving intermediate stations in 1962, and the District line today only uses the 1932 slow tracks.{{sfnp|Brown|2012}}\n* District line: The westbound track between east of [[Ravenscourt Park tube station|Ravenscourt Park]] and [[Turnham Green tube station|Turnham Green]] and Turnham Green to Richmond (also used by [[London Overground]]) follows the alignment of a railway built by the [[London & South Western Railway]] (LSWR) in 1869. The eastbound track between Turnham Green and east of Ravenscourt Park follows the alignment built in 1911; this was closed 1916 but was re-used when the Piccadilly line was extended in 1932.{{sfnp|Brown|2012}}\n* District line: The line between [[East Putney tube station|East Putney]] and [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] was built by the LSWR in 1889.

The Great Western main line opened in 1838, serving a temporary terminus the other side of Bishop's Road. When the current Paddington station opened in 1854, the line passed to the south of the old station.{{sfnp|Brown|2012}} On opening in 1864, the Hammersmith & City Railway (then part of the Metropolitan Railway) ran via the main line to a junction at Westbourne Park, until 1867 when two tracks opened to the south of the main line, with a crossing near Westbourne Bridge, Paddington. The current two tracks to the north of the main line and the subway east of Westbourne Park opened in 1878.{{sfnp|Peacock|1970|p=67}} The Hammersmith & City route is now completely segregated from the main line.\n* [[Jubilee line]]: The rail route between [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] and [[Stratford station|Stratford]] was built by the GER in 1846, with passenger services starting in 1847. The original alignment was quadrupled \"in stages between 1860 and 1892\" for freight services before the extra (western) tracks were lifted as traffic declined during the 20th century, and were re-laid for Jubilee line services that started in 1999.

This pressure difference drives ventilation between platforms and the surface exits through the passenger foot network. This system depends on adequate cross sectional area of the airspace above the passengers\u2019 heads in the foot tunnels and escalators, where laminar airflow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, the Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation. It also depends on an absence of turbulence in the tunnel headspace. In many stations the ventilation system is now ineffective because of alterations that reduce tunnel diameters and increase turbulence. An example is Green Park tube station, where false ceiling panels attached to metal frames have been installed that reduce the above-head airspace diameter by more than half in many parts. This has the effect of reducing laminar airflow by 94%.\n\nOriginally air turbulence was kept to a minimum by keeping all signage flat to the tunnel walls. Now the ventilation space above head height is crowded with ducting, conduits, cameras, speakers and equipment acting as a baffle plates with predictable reductions in flow.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Demartini |first1=LC |last2=Vielmo |first2=HA |last3=M\u00f6ller |first3=SV |title=Numeric and experimental analysis of the turbulent flow through a channel with baffle plates |journal=Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=153\u2013159 |doi=10.1590/S1678-58782004000200006 |year=2004 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Often electronic signs have their flat surface at right angles to the main air flow, causing choked flow. Temporary sign boards that stand at the top of escalators also maximise turbulence. The alterations to the ventilation system are important, not only to heat exchange, but also the quality of the air at platform level, particularly given its asbestos content.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Croucher |first1=S |title=Deadly Asbestos 'All Over the Place' on London Underground |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/asbestos-london-underground-tube-rmt-295229 |accessdate=4 March 2016|date=8 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Lifts and escalators===\n{{see also|London Underground infrastructure#Lifts and escalators|label 1=London Underground infrastructure: Lifts and escalators}}\n[[File:Canary Wharf tube station night 2.jpg|thumb|left|Escalators at Canary Wharf station]]\nOriginally access to the deep-tube platforms was by a lift.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=26, 35, 39, 87\u201389}} Each lift was staffed, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=540}} The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=114, 542}} The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the top landing.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=114, 542}}{{sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=59}} In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers to stand on the right and signs followed in World War II.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=154, 546}} Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them would have a clear passage on the left side of the escalator.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article6883065.ece |title=Mystery over Tube escalator etiquette cleared up by restored film |last=Malvern |first=Jack |date=21 October 2009 |work=The Times |location=London}} {{Subscription required}}</ref> The first 'comb' type escalator was installed in 1924 at [[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]].{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=114, 542}} In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators.{{sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=93}} After the fatal 1987 [[King's Cross fire]], all wooden escalators were replaced with metal ones and the mechanisms are regularly degreased to lower the potential for fires.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/escape/pioneers.html |title=Pioneers of Survival: Fire |publisher=PBS}}</ref> The only wooden escalator not to be replaced was at [[Greenford station]], which remained until October 2015 when TfL replaced it with the first [[Incline elevator|incline lift]] on the UK transport network.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/uk-first-as-incline-lift-opens-at-greenford-tube-station |title=Incline lift at Greenford Tube station is UK first |publisher=Transport for London |date=20 October 2015 |access-date=21 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227132647/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/uk-first-as-incline-lift-opens-at-greenford-tube-station |archive-date=27 December 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThere are 426 escalators on the London Underground system and the longest, at {{convert|60|m}}, is at [[Angel tube station|Angel]].

London Underground is therefore extending their operational life by making major repairs to many of the trains to maintain reliability. The Bakerloo line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled [[articulated car|articulated trains]] and a new signalling system to allow [[Automatic Train Operation]]. The line is predicted to run a maximum of 27 trains per hour, a 25% increase from the current 21-trains-per-hour peak service.<ref name=\"New Tube for London Feasibility Report\">{{cite web |title=New Tube for London Feasibility Report |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/ntfl-feasibility-report.pdf |publisher=TfL |date=October 2014 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Bakerloo line 1972 stock train overhall\">{{cite web |title=Bakerloo Line Fleet Life Extension |date=11 March 2015 |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/fpc-20150311-part-1-item15-bakerloo-line.pdf |publisher=TfL |accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Central line''' \u2013 The Central line was the first line to be modernised in the 1990s, with 85 new 1992-stock trains and a new automatic signalling system installed to allow Automatic Train Operation. The line runs 34 trains per hour for half an hour in the morning peak but is unable to operate more frequently because of a lack of additional trains. The 85 existing 1992-stock trains are the most unreliable on the London Underground as they are equipped with the first generation of solid state direct current thyristor control traction equipment. The trains often break down, have to be withdrawn from service at short notice and at times are not available when required, leading to gaps in service at peak times. Although relatively modern and well within their design life, the trains need work in the medium term to ensure the continued reliability of the traction control equipment and maintain fleet serviceability until renewal, which is expected between 2028 and 2032. Major work is to be undertaken on the fleet to ensure their continued reliability with brakes, traction control systems, doors, automatic control systems being repaired or replaced among other components. The Central line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walkthrough trains and a new more up-to-date automatic signalling system. The line is predicted to run 36 trains per hour, a 25% increase compared to the present service of 34 trains for busiest 30 minutes in the morning and evening peaks and the 27\u201330 train per hour service for the rest of the peak.<ref name=\"New Tube for London Feasibility Report\"/><ref name=\"Report on Central Line train overhaul\">{{cite web |title=Central line train overhaul project |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/fpc-20150311-part-1-item16-central-line-overhaul.pdf |publisher=TfL |accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Central line timetable |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/wtt-67-central-15-september-2013.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140415231448/http://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/wtt-67-central-15-september-2013.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 15 April 2014 |publisher=TfL |accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Jubilee line''' \u2013 The signalling system on the Jubilee line has been replaced to increase capacity on the line by 20%\u2014the line now runs 30 trains per hour at peak times, compared to the previous 24 trains per hour.

Capacity can be increased further if the operation of the Charing Cross and Bank branches are separated. To enable this up to 50 additional trains will be built in addition to the current 106 1995 stock. The five trains will be required for the proposed Northern line extension and 45 to increase frequencies on the rest of the line.

The trains have already exceeded their design life of around 40 years and are in need of replacement. The Piccadilly line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walkthrough trains and a new signalling system to allow Automatic Train Operation. The line is predicted to run 30\u201336 trains per hour up to a 60% increase compared to the 24/25 train per hour service provided today. The Piccadilly will be the first line to be upgraded as part of the New Tube for London Project as passenger usage has increased over recent years and is expected to increase further. This line is important in this project because it does not provide service that is as frequent a service as other lines.<ref name=\"New Tube for London Feasibility Report\"/>\n* '''Subsurface lines (District, Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City and Circle)''' \u2013 New S Stock trains have been introduced on the sub-surface (District, Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City and Circle)lines.  These were all delivered by 2017. 191 trains have been introduced or are being built: 58 for the Metropolitan line and 133 for the Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines. The track, electrical supply and signalling systems are also being upgraded in a programme to increase peak-hour capacity. The replacement of the signalling system and the introduction of Automatic Train Operation/Control is scheduled for 2019\u201322. A control room for the sub-surface network has been built in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system is to replace signalling equipment installed from the 1920s such as the signal box at Edgware Road, still manually operated.

In the [[philosophy of science]], it is the same, except that the observations used to show '''falsifiability''' (or '''refutability''') are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was emphasized by the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] in his book ''Logik der Forschung'' (1934, revised and translated into English in 1959 as ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), as an attempt to solve both the [[problem of induction]] and the [[demarcation problem]]. He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nPopper opposed falsifiability to '''verifiability'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]-->. For example, in order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of some philosophers of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], especially [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true, either in practice or in theory. Popper criticized the practical side of this verifiability criterion for demarcating science from non-science. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the attitude that he associated with [[verificationism]] originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper argued that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Another example is \"this angel does not have large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings<ref name=\"iftechnologyiswingsthentautology\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/> as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's two senses of number statements}}\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]].

In the [[philosophy of science]], it is the same, except that the observations used to show '''falsifiability''' (or '''refutability''') are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was emphasized by the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] in his book ''Logik der Forschung'' (1934, revised and translated into English in 1959 as ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), as an attempt to solve both the [[problem of induction]] and the [[demarcation problem]]. He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nPopper opposed falsifiability to '''verifiability'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]-->. For example, in order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of some philosophers of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], especially [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true, either in practice or in theory. Popper criticized the practical side of this verifiability criterion for demarcating science from non-science. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the attitude that he associated with [[verificationism]] originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper argued that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Another example is \"this angel does not have large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings<ref name=\"iftechnologyiswingsthentautology\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/> as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's two senses of number statements}}\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].
