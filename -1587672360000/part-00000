He was a member of the [[Australia Davis Cup team|Australian team]] that won the [[Davis Cup]] four times between 1952 and 1956. Hoad turned professional in July 1957 and won the [[Tournament of Champions (tennis)|Forest Hills Tournament of Champions]] event in 1959. He also won the Ampol Tournament of Champions at Kooyong in 1958, one of the richest tournaments of the era. He won the Ampol Open Trophy world series in 1959\u20131960. During his career his main competitors were his longtime amateur tennis teammate [[Ken Rosewall]] and, throughout his professional career, [[Pancho Gonzales]].\n\nHoad was ranked in the world top ten for amateurs from 1952 until 1957, reaching the world No. 1 spot in 1956. He was ranked the world No. 1 professional in Kramer's official 1959\u20131960 Ampol ranking of all the contract professionals. He was ranked the world No. 1 tennis player, professional or amateur, for 1962 in a poll of 85 U.S. sports editors. \n\nSerious back problems plagued Hoad throughout his career, probably caused by a weight-lifting exercise he devised in 1954, particularly after he turned professional, and led to his effective retirement from tennis in 1967 although he made sporadic comebacks, enticed by the advent of the open era in 1968.\n\nIn his autobiography, [[Jack Kramer]], the professional tennis promoter and former player, rated Hoad as one of the 21 best players of all time.{{efn|name=kramer|Kramer considered the best player ever to have been either [[Don Budge]] (for consistent play) or [[Ellsworth Vines]] (at the height of his game). The next four best were, chronologically, [[Bill Tilden]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Bobby Riggs]], and [[Pancho Gonzales]]. After these six came the \"second echelon\" of [[Rod Laver]], Lew Hoad, [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Gottfried von Cramm]], [[Ted Schroeder]], [[Jack Crawford (tennis)|Jack Crawford]], [[Pancho Segura]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Tony Trabert]], [[John Newcombe]], [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Stan Smith]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]], and [[Jimmy Connors]]. He felt unable to rank [[Henri Cochet]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Lacoste]] accurately but felt they were among the very best.}} [[Rod Laver]] in 2012 rated Hoad as the greatest player of the \"past champions\" era of tennis and stated that power, volleying and explosiveness were his strengths.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1972, Hoad and his wife [[Jenny Staley Hoad|Jenny]] operated a tennis resort, ''Lew Hoad's Campo de Tenis'' in [[Fuengirola]], Spain, near M\u00e1laga. Hoad died of leukemia on 3 July 1994.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Australian tennis player Lewis Hoad.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Hoad at age 15 competing at Kooyong in Inter State Tennis in 1949]]\nLewis Hoad{{efn|name=actor|Lewis Hoad was named after the American actor [[Lewis Stone]].{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}}}} was born on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]], the eldest of three sons of tramway electrician Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle Burbury.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}} Hoad started playing tennis at age five with a racket gifted by a local social club.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|pp=105,106|ps=}} As a young child, he would wake up at 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and garage door until the neighbours complained, and he was allowed to practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|pp=3,4|ps=}}{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=106|ps=}} At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] in the under 16 category.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17933284 |title=School for Tennis Juniors. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 December 1944 |accessdate=14 June 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn his youth, he often played with [[Ken Rosewall]], and they became known as the Sydney \"twins\", although they had very different physiques, personalities and playing styles. Their first match was in their early teens and was played as an opener of an exhibition match between Australia and America. Rosewall won 6\u20130, 6\u20130.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=107|ps=}} Hoad built up great physical strength, especially in his hands and arms, by training at a police boys' club, where he made a name as a boxer. Hoad was about 12 when he was introduced to [[Adrian Quist]], a former Australian tennis champion and then general manager of the [[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] sports goods company. Quist played a couple of sets with Hoad and was impressed by his natural ability. When Hoad was 14 he left school and joined the Dunlop payroll, following the pattern of that 'shamateur' era when most of Australia's brightest tennis prospects were employed by sporting goods companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: Lew Hoad|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lew-hoad-1411724.html|publisher=The Independent|date=5 July 1994}}</ref>\n\nHoad had just turned 15 when he and Rosewall were selected to play for [[New South Wales]] in an interstate contest against [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18128860 |title=Rosewall, Hoad in state team. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=25 November 1949 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In November 1949, Hoad won the junior title at the New South Wales Championships, and the same weekend, he also competed in the final of the junior [[table tennis]] championship in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48607374 |title=N.S.W.

He was a member of the [[Australia Davis Cup team|Australian team]] that won the [[Davis Cup]] four times between 1952 and 1956. Hoad turned professional in July 1957 and won the [[Tournament of Champions (tennis)|Forest Hills Tournament of Champions]] event in 1959. He also won the Ampol Tournament of Champions at Kooyong in 1958, one of the richest tournaments of the era. He won the Ampol Open Trophy world series in 1959\u20131960. During his career his main competitors were his longtime amateur tennis teammate [[Ken Rosewall]] and, throughout his professional career, [[Pancho Gonzales]].\n\nHoad was ranked in the world top ten for amateurs from 1952 until 1957, reaching the world No. 1 spot in 1956. He was ranked the world No. 1 professional in Kramer's official 1959\u20131960 Ampol ranking of all the contract professionals. He was ranked the world No. 1 tennis player, professional or amateur, for 1962 in a poll of 85 U.S. sports editors. \n\nSerious back problems plagued Hoad throughout his career, probably caused by a weight-lifting exercise he devised in 1954, particularly after he turned professional, and led to his effective retirement from tennis in 1967 although he made sporadic comebacks, enticed by the advent of the open era in 1968.\n\nIn his autobiography, [[Jack Kramer]], the professional tennis promoter and former player, rated Hoad as one of the 21 best players of all time.{{efn|name=kramer|Kramer considered the best player ever to have been either [[Don Budge]] (for consistent play) or [[Ellsworth Vines]] (at the height of his game). The next four best were, chronologically, [[Bill Tilden]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Bobby Riggs]], and [[Pancho Gonzales]]. After these six came the \"second echelon\" of [[Rod Laver]], Lew Hoad, [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Gottfried von Cramm]], [[Ted Schroeder]], [[Jack Crawford (tennis)|Jack Crawford]], [[Pancho Segura]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Tony Trabert]], [[John Newcombe]], [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Stan Smith]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]], and [[Jimmy Connors]]. He felt unable to rank [[Henri Cochet]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Lacoste]] accurately but felt they were among the very best.}} [[Rod Laver]] in 2012 rated Hoad as the greatest player of the \"past champions\" era of tennis and stated that power, volleying and explosiveness were his strengths.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1972, Hoad and his wife [[Jenny Staley Hoad|Jenny]] operated a tennis resort, ''Lew Hoad's Campo de Tenis'' in [[Fuengirola]], Spain, near M\u00e1laga. Hoad died of leukemia on 3 July 1994.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Australian tennis player Lewis Hoad.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Hoad at age 15 competing at Kooyong in Inter State Tennis in 1949]]\nLewis Hoad{{efn|name=actor|Lewis Hoad was named after the American actor [[Lewis Stone]].{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}}}} was born on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]], the eldest of three sons of tramway electrician Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle Burbury.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}} Hoad started playing tennis at age five with a racket gifted by a local social club.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|pp=105,106|ps=}} As a young child, he would wake up at 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and garage door until the neighbours complained, and he was allowed to practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|pp=3,4|ps=}}{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=106|ps=}} At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] in the under 16 category.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17933284 |title=School for Tennis Juniors. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 December 1944 |accessdate=14 June 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn his youth, he often played with [[Ken Rosewall]], and they became known as the Sydney \"twins\", although they had very different physiques, personalities and playing styles. Their first match was in their early teens and was played as an opener of an exhibition match between Australia and America. Rosewall won 6\u20130, 6\u20130.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=107|ps=}} Hoad built up great physical strength, especially in his hands and arms, by training at a police boys' club, where he made a name as a boxer. Hoad was about 12 when he was introduced to [[Adrian Quist]], a former Australian tennis champion and then general manager of the [[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] sports goods company. Quist played a couple of sets with Hoad and was impressed by his natural ability. When Hoad was 14 he left school and joined the Dunlop payroll, following the pattern of that 'shamateur' era when most of Australia's brightest tennis prospects were employed by sporting goods companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: Lew Hoad|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lew-hoad-1411724.html|publisher=The Independent|date=5 July 1994}}</ref>\n\nHoad had just turned 15 when he and Rosewall were selected to play for [[New South Wales]] in an interstate contest against [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18128860 |title=Rosewall, Hoad in state team. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=25 November 1949 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In November 1949, Hoad won the junior title at the New South Wales Championships, and the same weekend, he also competed in the final of the junior [[table tennis]] championship in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48607374 |title=N.S.W.

The military concerns over Iran's space program has been exacerbated over Safir rocket's advanced 2nd stage which Iran has kept secret by not releasing any technical information related to the second stage of the rocket, keeping outside observers guessing over the technicalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2006/issue3/jv10no3a2.html|title=Iran's Space Program: The Next Genie in a Bottle?|publisher=Meria.idc.ac.il|accessdate=6 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227052716/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2006/issue3/jv10no3a2.html|archivedate=27 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://biak-spaceport.blogspot.com/2010/02/emerging-iranian-space-program.html|title=Biak Spaceport: The Emerging Iranian Space Program|publisher=Biak-spaceport.blogspot.com|accessdate=6 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316094747/http://biak-spaceport.blogspot.com/2010/02/emerging-iranian-space-program.html|archive-date=16 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3934643{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Iranian_missiles_have_worldwide_reach_Russia_999.html|title=Iranian missiles have 'worldwide reach': Russia|publisher=Spacewar.com|accessdate=6 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207120524/http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Iranian_missiles_have_worldwide_reach_Russia_999.html|archive-date=7 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/03/world/main4771491.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_4771491|publisher=CBS News|title=Iran Launches First Homegrown Satellite|date=3 February 2009|access-date=30 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214055515/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/03/world/main4771491.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_4771491|archive-date=14 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asemangasht.com/travel_news/show.php?id=24|title=Travel News \u2013 Iran claims first launch of its own satellite|publisher=Asemangasht.com|accessdate=6 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317012937/http://www.asemangasht.com/travel_news/show.php?id=24|archive-date=17 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/2575063/Iran-launches-rocket-capable-of-carrying-satellite.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Our|last=Foreign|title=Iran launches rocket capable of carrying satellite|date=17 August 2008|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907182945/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/2575063/Iran-launches-rocket-capable-of-carrying-satellite.html|archive-date=7 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For Radio Free Europe, independent experts interviewed disagreed with assertion made by the U.S. and various European countries. [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|SIPRI's]] Tytti Er\u00e4st\u00f6 stated space launch vehicle program can contribute to missile development yet it isn't a shortcut for development of long range missiles such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, historically the ICBMs were converted to SLVs and never was in history SLV converted to ICBM. [[International Institute for Strategic Studies|IISS]] Michael Elleman stated that claims made by the U.S. such as [[Mike Pompeo]] are grossly exaggerating contribution of SLV program to ICBM program and that it is misguided to suggest that SLV program is cover for nuclear capable ICBMs as claims made are a political statement. ST Analytics Markus Schiller stated that there is no indication that Iran is trying to develop missiles with range longer than 2000 km as Iran has been working on improving accuracy of their existing short and medium range missiles.<ref>https://www.rferl.org/a/is-iran-converting-space-launchers-into-long-range-missiles-/30437113.html</ref>\n\n== See also

The military concerns over Iran's space program has been exacerbated over Safir rocket's advanced 2nd stage which Iran has kept secret by not releasing any technical information related to the second stage of the rocket, keeping outside observers guessing over the technicalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2006/issue3/jv10no3a2.html|title=Iran's Space Program: The Next Genie in a Bottle?|publisher=Meria.idc.ac.il|accessdate=6 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227052716/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2006/issue3/jv10no3a2.html|archivedate=27 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://biak-spaceport.blogspot.com/2010/02/emerging-iranian-space-program.html|title=Biak Spaceport: The Emerging Iranian Space Program|publisher=Biak-spaceport.blogspot.com|accessdate=6 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316094747/http://biak-spaceport.blogspot.com/2010/02/emerging-iranian-space-program.html|archive-date=16 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3934643{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Iranian_missiles_have_worldwide_reach_Russia_999.html|title=Iranian missiles have 'worldwide reach': Russia|publisher=Spacewar.com|accessdate=6 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207120524/http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Iranian_missiles_have_worldwide_reach_Russia_999.html|archive-date=7 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/03/world/main4771491.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_4771491|publisher=CBS News|title=Iran Launches First Homegrown Satellite|date=3 February 2009|access-date=30 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214055515/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/03/world/main4771491.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_4771491|archive-date=14 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asemangasht.com/travel_news/show.php?id=24|title=Travel News \u2013 Iran claims first launch of its own satellite|publisher=Asemangasht.com|accessdate=6 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317012937/http://www.asemangasht.com/travel_news/show.php?id=24|archive-date=17 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/2575063/Iran-launches-rocket-capable-of-carrying-satellite.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Our|last=Foreign|title=Iran launches rocket capable of carrying satellite|date=17 August 2008|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907182945/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/2575063/Iran-launches-rocket-capable-of-carrying-satellite.html|archive-date=7 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For Radio Free Europe, independent experts interviewed disagreed with assertion made by the U.S. and various European countries. [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|SIPRI's]] Tytti Er\u00e4st\u00f6 stated space launch vehicle program can contribute to missile development yet it isn't a shortcut for development of long range missiles such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, historically the ICBMs were converted to SLVs and never was in history SLV converted to ICBM. [[International Institute for Strategic Studies|IISS]] Michael Elleman stated that claims made by the U.S. such as [[Mike Pompeo]] are grossly exaggerating contribution of SLV program to ICBM program and that it is misguided to suggest that SLV program is cover for nuclear capable ICBMs as claims made are a political statement. ST Analytics Markus Schiller stated that there is no indication that Iran is trying to develop missiles with range longer than 2000 km as Iran has been working on improving accuracy of their existing short and medium range missiles.<ref>https://www.rferl.org/a/is-iran-converting-space-launchers-into-long-range-missiles-/30437113.html</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Iran|Science|Spaceflight}}\n\n* [[Aerospace Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]]\n* [[Anousheh Ansari]] \u2013 First [[Iranian-American]] cosmonaut\n* [[Colonization of Mars]]\n* [[Colonization of the Moon]]\n* [[Economy of Iran]]\n* [[International rankings of Iran#Science and technology|International rankings of Iran in science and technology]]\n* [[Iran Aviation Industries Organization]]\n* [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country#List of first orbital launches by country|List of first orbital launches by country]]\n* [[List of government space agencies]]\n* [[List of Iranian research centers]]\n* [[List of missions to the Moon]]\n* [[Human spaceflight#National spacefaring attempts|National spacefaring programs]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.isa.ir/ Iranian Space Agency]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070418150218/http://www.spacescience.ir/ Space Science]\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/iran/agency.htm Iranian Space Agencies (listing)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110406115504/http://www.astronautix.com/country/iran.htm Iran space program]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060615142503/http://astronautix.com/lvs/shaabslv.htm Shahab SLV]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090216100124/http://aio.ir/ Aerospace Industries Organization]\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/iran/index.html Iran in Space] Globalsecurity.org\n\n;Videos\n* [http://presstv.com/Detail/2016/11/16/493845/Iran-aerospace-achievements A glimpse of Iran\u2019s latest aerospace achievements] \u2013 [[PressTV]] (2016)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oSVX6mkmds Imam Khomeini Space Center \u2013 Iran] \u2013 [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] (2013)\n* {{YouTube|8OKu04fYgTk|Video on Iran Space Program}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/PressTVGlobalNews#p/u/8/JPKzGVGUVPw Iran's space technology program \u2013 Part I] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac8JPUXx640 Part II] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2FF0Cvb7J8 Part III] \u2013 [[PressTV]]\n\n{{Iranian Space Program}}\n{{Public sector space agencies}}\n{{Space exploration lists and timelines}}\n\n[[Category:Space program of Iran]]\n[[Category:Government agencies of Iran]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 2003]]\n[[Category:2003 establishments in Iran]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Iran]]\n[[Category:Scientific organisations based in Iran]]\n[[Category:Space agencies]]\n", "name_user": "1775sd", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added name and orbit type to 22 April 2020 successful satellite launch", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Space_Agency"}

Soon after, they achieved success in the US, starting with ''[[London Calling]]'' (1979), and peaking with 1982's ''[[Combat Rock]]'', reaching number 7 on the US charts and being certified 2\u00d7 platinum there. The Clash's explosive political lyrics, eclectic musical experimentation, and rebellious attitude had a far-reaching influence on rock music in general, and [[alternative rock]] in particular.<ref name=\"bbcco-Strummer\">{{cite news\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2600955.stm\n | title = Strummer's lasting culture Clash\n | accessdate =20 November 2007\n | date = 23 December 2002\n | format = STM\n | work=Entertainment\n | publisher=BBC News World Edition\n}}</ref> Their music incorporated [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[funk]], [[Hip hop music|rap]], and [[rockabilly]].\n\nStrummer's career included stints with [[the 101ers]], [[Latino Rockabilly War]], [[the Mescaleros]], and [[the Pogues]], in addition to his own solo music. His work as a musician allowed him to explore other interests, including acting, creating [[film score]]s for television and movies, songwriting, [[Broadcasting|radio broadcasting]], and as a radio host on the BBC Radio show ''London Calling''.\n\nStrummer and the Clash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 2003.

His family spent time in Ankara, Cairo, Mexico City & [[Bonn]], before Mellor returned to the UK to attend the City of London Freemen's School in Surrey. Mellor left school & enrolled at Central College of Art but left \"after about a week\", heading straight for the underground & squat culture. Mellor spent time living in Wales, playing in knock-about bands and using the nickname \"Woody\" inspired by Woody Guthrie's name.  <br /> b) The Vultures in time led to the 101ers, a group of West London-based squatters named after their squat address. The 101ers were eventually supported by a nascent Sex Pistols.  Mellor adopted the stage name of \"Joe Strummer\". Impressed by the power of the [[Sex Pistols]], the newly self-coined Strummer determined that the 101ers were \"yesterday's papers\" by comparison. It was time to strike out anew. And this led to the start of the Clash. <br /> c) \"This is my Indian summer ... I learnt that fame is an illusion & everything about it is just a joke.

For the next year he was the band's part-time singer and rhythm guitarist. During this time Strummer also worked as a [[gravedigger]] in [[St Woolos Cemetery]].<ref>Don J Whistance's Clash Site \u2013 [http://www.theclash.org.uk/joetheearlyyears.htm \"Joe the Early years\"] (Retrieved 7 February 2014)</ref><ref>JoeStrummer.org \u2013 [http://www.joestrummer.org/bio.php \"Bio\"] (Retrieved 7 February 2014)</ref> Whilst in Newport he wrote and recorded on an old reel to reel tape recorder \"Crumby Bum Blues\" which was later used in [[Julien Temple|Julien Temple's]] [[Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten|2007 film]]. In 1974, the band fell apart and he moved back to London where he met up again with [[Tymon Dogg]]. He was a street performer for a while and then decided to form another band with his West London roommates. The band was called [[the 101ers]],<ref name=\"bbcco-Strummer\" /> named after the address of their squat (101 Walterton Road, in [[Maida Vale]]).<ref name=\"trackMARX-Joe_Strummer\" />{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}\n\nThe band played many gigs in London pubs, playing covers of popular American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]] songs. In 1975 he stopped calling himself \"Woody\" Mellor and adopted the stage name of Joe Strummer, and insisted that his friends call him by that name. The name \"Strummer\" apparently referred to his role as rhythm guitarist, in a rather self-deprecating way. Strummer was the lead singer of the 101ers and began to write original songs for the group. One song he wrote was inspired by his girlfriend at the time, [[The Slits|Slits]] drummer [[Palmolive (musician)|Palmolive]]. The group liked the song \"Keys to Your Heart\", and picked it as their first single.{{sfn|Coon|1977}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===The Clash (1976\u20131986)===\n{{Main|The Clash}}\nOn 3 April 1976, the then-unknown [[Sex Pistols]] opened for the 101ers at a venue called the Nashville Rooms in London, and Strummer was impressed by them.<ref name=\"bbcco-Strummer\" /> Sometime after the show, Strummer was approached by [[Bernie Rhodes]] and [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]]. Jones was from the band [[London SS]] and wanted Strummer to join as lead singer. Strummer agreed to leave the 101ers and join Jones, bassist [[Paul Simonon]], drummer [[Terry Chimes]] and guitarist [[Keith Levene]].{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} The band was named [[the Clash]] by Simonon and made their debut on 4 July 1976 in [[Sheffield]], opening for the [[Sex Pistols]] at the Black Swan (also known as the Mucky Duck, now known as the [[Boardwalk (nightclub)|Boardwalk]]).{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}  On 25 January 1977, the band signed with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] as a three-piece after Levene was fired from the band and Chimes quit. [[Topper Headon]] later became the band's full-time drummer.\n\nDuring his time with the Clash, Strummer, along with his bandmates, became notorious for getting into trouble with the law. On 10 June 1977, he and Headon were arrested for spray-painting \"The Clash\" on a wall in a hotel. On 20 May 1980, he was arrested for hitting a violent member of the audience with his guitar during a performance in [[Hamburg]], Germany. This incident shocked Strummer, and had a lasting personal impact on him. Strummer said, \"It was a watershed\u2014violence had really controlled me for once\". He determined never again to fight violence with violence.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}\n\nBefore the album ''[[Combat Rock]]'' was released in 1982, Strummer went into hiding and the band's management said that he had \"disappeared\". Bernie Rhodes, the band's manager, pressured Joe to do so because tickets were selling slowly for the Scottish leg of an upcoming tour.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}  It was planned for Strummer to travel, in secret, to Texas and stay with his friend, musician [[Joe Ely]]. Uneasy with his decision, Strummer instead decided to genuinely disappear and \"dicked around\" in France. During this time, Strummer ran the [[Paris Marathon]] in April 1982. He claimed his training regimen consisted of 10 pints of beer the night before the race. For this period of time, Joe's whereabouts were not only a mystery to the public, but the band's management as well. Joe later said this was a huge mistake and you \"have to have some regrets\". This was in spite of the popular success of the single \"[[Rock the Casbah]]\". During this time band members began to argue a lot, and with tensions high, the group began to fall apart.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}\n\nIn September 1983, Strummer issued the infamous \"Clash Communique\", and fired Mick Jones.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} Topper Headon had earlier been kicked out of the band because of his heroin addiction, and Terry Chimes was brought back temporarily to fill his place until the permanent replacement, Pete Howard, could be found.  This left the band with only two of its original members, Strummer and Simonon.  Rhodes persuaded Strummer to carry on, adding two new guitarists.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}  Under this lineup, they released the album ''[[Cut the Crap]]'' in 1985. The album was panned by fans and critics alike and Strummer disbanded the Clash.\n\nAt the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Clash was said to be \"considered one of the most overtly political, explosive and exciting bands in rock and roll history\".<ref name=\"rockhall-The_Clash\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-clash\n|title=The Clash\n|accessdate=19 November 2007\n|date=10 March 2003\n|work=Induction\n|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum\n|quote=a) Quite simply, the Clash were among the most explosive and exciting bands in rock and roll history. <br />b, c) If not exactly a reunion, it was a rapprochement. On 15 November 2002, Jones and Strummer shared the stage for the first time in nearly 20&nbsp;years, performing three Clash songs during the encore of a London benefit show by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. This raised hopes for a Clash reunion, which were dashed when Strummer died of a heart attack on 22 December 2002.\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430132108/http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-clash\n|archive-date=30 April 2010\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Their songs tackled social decay, unemployment, racism, police brutality, political and social repression, and militarism in detail. Strummer was involved with the [[Anti-Nazi League]] and [[Rock Against Racism]] campaigns. He later also gave his support to the Rock Against the Rich series of concerts organised by the anarchist organisation [[Class War]]. The Clash's ''[[London Calling]]'' album was voted best album of the 1980s by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine (although it was released in late 1979 in the UK, it was not released until 1980 in the US).<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2600669.stm\n|title=Clash star Strummer dies\n|accessdate=20 November 2007\n|date=27 December 2002\n|format=STM\n|work=Entertainment\n|publisher=BBC News World Edition\n|quote=Rolling Stone voted London Calling, their classic 1980 album (released in 1979 in the UK) as the best album of the Eighties.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Solo career and soundtrack work (1986\u20131999)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:Joe-Strummer.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Strummer, backing with the Pogues in Japan]]\nA year later, Strummer worked on several songs for the 1986 film ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'', including \"Love Kills\" and \"Dum Dum Club\". Strummer also later worked with Mick Jones and his band [[Big Audio Dynamite]], contributing to the band's second studio album by co-writing most of the songs as well as producing the album along with Jones.\n\nIn 1987, he played a small part in the film ''[[Walker (film)|Walker]]'', directed by [[Alex Cox]], as a character named \"Faucet\" and wrote and performed on the film's [[Walker (album)|soundtrack]].  He starred in another Cox film that same year called ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'', as the character Simms. ''Straight to Hell'' also featured London-Irish folk/punk band [[the Pogues]], both as actors and contributors to the soundtrack. Strummer joined the Pogues for a tour in 1987/88, filling in for ailing guitarist [[Philip Chevron]], who wrote (in May 2008) on the band's online forum: \"When I was sick in late 1987, I taught Joe all the guitar parts in an afternoon and he was on tour in the US as deputy guitarist the next day. Joe wrote all the tabs in his meticulously neat hand on a long piece of paper which he taped to the top of the guitar so he could glance down occasionally when he was onstage.\" This tour would be the first of several collaborations with the band.\n\nIn 1989, Strummer appeared in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s film ''[[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]]'' as a drunken, short-tempered drifter named Johnny (whom most characters refer to as Elvis, much to Johnny's dismay). He made a cameo appearance in [[Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki]]'s 1990 film ''[[I Hired a Contract Killer]]'' as a guitarist in a pub, performing two songs (\"Burning Lights\" and \"Afro-Cuban Bebop\"). These were released as a promotional 7-inch single limited to a few hundred copies, credited to \"Joe Strummer & the Astro Physicians\". The \"Astro Physicians\" were in fact the Pogues (\"Afro-Cuban Bebop\" got a re-release on the Pogues' 2008 box set). During this time Strummer continued to act, write and produce soundtracks for various films, most notably the soundtrack for ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997).\n\nIn 1989 Strummer produced a solo record with the band the Latino Rockabilly War. The album ''[[Earthquake Weather (album)|Earthquake Weather]]'' was a critical and commercial flop, and resulted in the loss of his contract with [[Sony Records]].  He also did the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Permanent Record (film)|Permanent Record]]'' with this band.\n\nStrummer was asked by the Pogues, who were fracturing as a band, to help them produce their next album, released in 1990 as ''[[Hell's Ditch]]''. In 1991, he replaced [[Shane MacGowan]] as singer of the Pogues for a tour after MacGowan's departure from the band. One night of this tour was professionally recorded, and three tracks (\"I Fought the Law\", \"London Calling\", and \"Turkish Song of the Damned\") have seen release as b-sides and again on the Pogues' 2008 box set.\n\nOn 16 April 1994, Strummer joined Czech-American band Dirty Pictures on stage in Prague at the Repre Club in Obecni Dum at \"Rock for Refugees\", a benefit concert for people left displaced by the war in Bosnia. Although the set appeared impromptu, Strummer and the band had spent the days leading up to the event rehearsing and \"hanging out\" in Prague. The show began with \"London Calling\" and without pause went into \"Brand New Cadillac\". In the middle of the song, the power went out.  Once the power was back on, Strummer asked the audience whether or not they would mind if the band started over. They then began again with \"London Calling\" and continued on for another half-hour.\n\nAfter these self-described \"wilderness years\", Strummer began working with other bands; he played piano on the 1995 UK hit of [[The Levellers (band)|the Levellers]], \"Just the One\" and appeared on the [[Black Grape]] single \"England's Irie\" in 1996. In 1997, while in New York City, he worked with noted producer and engineer [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]] on remixed Clash and 101ers reissue dub material. In collaboration with percussionist Pablo Cook, Strummer wrote and performed the soundtrack to ''Tunnel of Love'' (Robert Wallace 1997) that was featured in the Cannes Film Festival in the same year.\n\nIn 1998, he made a guest appearance on the animated television show, ''[[South Park]]'' and appeared on the album ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]'' featuring songs from and inspired by the series.\n\nDuring this time, Strummer was engaged in a legal dispute with the Clash's record label, [[Epic Records]]. The disagreement lasted nearly eight years and ended with the label agreeing to let him record solo records with another label. If the Clash were to reunite though, they would have to record for Sony. During the nineties, Strummer was a DJ on the [[BBC World Service]] with his half-hour programme ''London Calling''. Samples from the series provide the vocals for \"Midnight Jam\" on Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros' final album ''[[Streetcore]]''.\n\n===The Mescaleros and other work (1999\u20132002)===\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Strummer gathered top-flight musicians into a backing band he called [[the Mescaleros]]. Strummer and the band signed with [[Mercury Records]], and released their first album in 1999, which was co-written with [[Antony Genn]], called ''[[Rock Art and the X-Ray Style]]''. A tour of England, Europe, and North America soon followed.\n\n{{quote|This is my Indian summer ... I learnt that fame is an illusion and everything about it is just a joke.

The album was supported with a 21-date tour of North America, Britain, and Ireland. Once again, these concerts featured Clash material (\"[[London's Burning (The Clash song)|London's Burning]]\", \"Rudie Can't Fail\", \"[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]\"), as well as covers of [[reggae]] and [[ska]] hits (\"[[The Harder They Come (song)|The Harder They Come]]\", \"A Message to You, Rudy\") and the band regularly closed the show by playing the [[Ramones]]' \"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]\". He covered [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[Redemption Song]]\" with [[Johnny Cash]].\n\nOn 15 November 2002, Strummer and the Mescaleros played a benefit show for striking fire fighters in London, at the Acton Town Hall. [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] was in the audience, and joined the band on stage during the Clash's \"Bankrobber\". An encore followed with Jones playing guitar and singing on \"White Riot\" and \"London's Burning\". This performance marked the first time since 1983 that Strummer and Jones had performed together on stage.<ref name=\"rockhall-The_Clash\" />\n\nStrummer's final regular gig was at Liverpool Academy on 22 November 2002, yet his final performance, just two weeks before his death, was in a small club venue 'The Palace' in Bridgwater, Somerset, near his home. Shortly before his death, Strummer and [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] co-wrote a song, \"[[46664]]\", for [[Nelson Mandela]] as part of a campaign against AIDS in Africa.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1975, after being offered \u00a3120 ({{Inflation|UK|120|1975|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}), Strummer [[marriage of convenience|married]] Pamela Moolman, a South African citizen, so she could obtain British citizenship (foreign wives of male Britons could obtain British nationality via marriage, until the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] came into force). He bought his signature [[Fender Telecaster]], later painted black, with the money. In 1978, Strummer started a relationship with Gaby Salter shortly after her 17th birthday.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} The couple remained together for 14 years and had two daughters, Jazz and Lola, but did not marry as Strummer had been unable to locate and divorce Moolman.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} During his relationship with Salter, he had multiple affairs spanning the 1980s.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}\n\nIn 1993, Strummer began an affair with Lucinda Tait, which finally ended his relationship with  Salter.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} Strummer and Tait married in 1995 and remained so until his death in 2002.\n\nStrummer described himself as a [[socialist]]. He stated about his socialist views, \"I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those arsehole businessmen with all the loot.

His work as a musician allowed him to explore other interests, including acting, creating [[film score]]s for television and movies, songwriting, [[Broadcasting|radio broadcasting]], and as a radio host on the BBC Radio show ''London Calling''.\n\nStrummer and the Clash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 2003.

His Scottish mother, Anna Mackenzie (1915\u20131986), a [[crofter]]'s daughter born and raised in [[Bonar Bridge]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]], was a nurse.

His family spent time in Ankara, Cairo, Mexico City & [[Bonn]], before Mellor returned to the UK to attend the City of London Freemen's School in Surrey. Mellor left school & enrolled at Central College of Art but left \"after about a week\", heading straight for the underground & squat culture. Mellor spent time living in Wales, playing in knock-about bands and using the nickname \"Woody\" inspired by Woody Guthrie's name.  <br /> b) The Vultures in time led to the 101ers, a group of West London-based squatters named after their squat address. The 101ers were eventually supported by a nascent Sex Pistols.  Mellor adopted the stage name of \"Joe Strummer\". Impressed by the power of the [[Sex Pistols]], the newly self-coined Strummer determined that the 101ers were \"yesterday's papers\" by comparison. It was time to strike out anew. And this led to the start of the Clash. <br /> c) \"This is my Indian summer ... I learnt that fame is an illusion & everything about it is just a joke.

For the next year he was the band's part-time singer and rhythm guitarist. During this time Strummer also worked as a [[gravedigger]] in [[St Woolos Cemetery]].<ref>Don J Whistance's Clash Site \u2013 [http://www.theclash.org.uk/joetheearlyyears.htm \"Joe the Early years\"] (Retrieved 7 February 2014)</ref><ref>JoeStrummer.org \u2013 [http://www.joestrummer.org/bio.php \"Bio\"] (Retrieved 7 February 2014)</ref> Whilst in Newport he wrote and recorded on an old reel to reel tape recorder \"Crumby Bum Blues\" which was later used in [[Julien Temple|Julien Temple's]] [[Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten|2007 film]]. In 1974, the band fell apart and he moved back to London where he met up again with [[Tymon Dogg]]. He was a street performer for a while and then decided to form another band with his West London roommates. The band was called [[the 101ers]],<ref name=\"bbcco-Strummer\" /> named after the address of their squat (101 Walterton Road, in [[Maida Vale]]).<ref name=\"trackMARX-Joe_Strummer\" />{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}\n\nThe band played many gigs in London pubs, playing covers of popular American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]] songs. In 1975 he stopped calling himself \"Woody\" Mellor and adopted the stage name of Joe Strummer, and insisted that his friends call him by that name. The name \"Strummer\" apparently referred to his role as rhythm guitarist, in a rather self-deprecating way. Strummer was the lead singer of the 101ers and began to write original songs for the group. One song he wrote was inspired by his girlfriend at the time, [[The Slits|Slits]] drummer [[Palmolive (musician)|Palmolive]]. The group liked the song \"Keys to Your Heart\", and picked it as their first single.{{sfn|Coon|1977}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===The Clash (1976\u20131986)===\n{{Main|The Clash}}\nOn 3 April 1976, the then-unknown [[Sex Pistols]] opened for the 101ers at a venue called the Nashville Rooms in London, and Strummer was impressed by them.<ref name=\"bbcco-Strummer\" /> Sometime after the show, Strummer was approached by [[Bernie Rhodes]] and [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]]. Jones was from the band [[London SS]] and wanted Strummer to join as lead singer. Strummer agreed to leave the 101ers and join Jones, bassist [[Paul Simonon]], drummer [[Terry Chimes]] and guitarist [[Keith Levene]].{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} The band was named [[the Clash]] by Simonon and made their debut on 4 July 1976 in [[Sheffield]], opening for the [[Sex Pistols]] at the Black Swan (also known as the Mucky Duck, now known as the [[Boardwalk (nightclub)|Boardwalk]]).{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}  On 25 January 1977, the band signed with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] as a three-piece after Levene was fired from the band and Chimes quit. [[Topper Headon]] later became the band's full-time drummer.\n\nDuring his time with the Clash, Strummer, along with his bandmates, became notorious for getting into trouble with the law. On 10 June 1977, he and Headon were arrested for spray-painting \"The Clash\" on a wall in a hotel. On 20 May 1980, he was arrested for hitting a violent member of the audience with his guitar during a performance in [[Hamburg]], Germany. This incident shocked Strummer, and had a lasting personal impact on him. Strummer said, \"It was a watershed\u2014violence had really controlled me for once\". He determined never again to fight violence with violence.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}\n\nBefore the album ''[[Combat Rock]]'' was released in 1982, Strummer went into hiding and the band's management said that he had \"disappeared\". Bernie Rhodes, the band's manager, pressured Joe to do so because tickets were selling slowly for the Scottish leg of an upcoming tour.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}  It was planned for Strummer to travel, in secret, to Texas and stay with his friend, musician [[Joe Ely]]. Uneasy with his decision, Strummer instead decided to genuinely disappear and \"dicked around\" in France. During this time, Strummer ran the [[Paris Marathon]] in April 1982. He claimed his training regimen consisted of 10 pints of beer the night before the race. For this period of time, Joe's whereabouts were not only a mystery to the public, but the band's management as well. Joe later said this was a huge mistake and you \"have to have some regrets\". This was in spite of the popular success of the single \"[[Rock the Casbah]]\". During this time band members began to argue a lot, and with tensions high, the group began to fall apart.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}\n\nIn September 1983, Strummer issued the infamous \"Clash Communique\", and fired Mick Jones.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} Topper Headon had earlier been kicked out of the band because of his heroin addiction, and Terry Chimes was brought back temporarily to fill his place until the permanent replacement, Pete Howard, could be found.  This left the band with only two of its original members, Strummer and Simonon.  Rhodes persuaded Strummer to carry on, adding two new guitarists.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}  Under this lineup, they released the album ''[[Cut the Crap]]'' in 1985. The album was panned by fans and critics alike and Strummer disbanded the Clash.\n\nAt the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Clash was said to be \"considered one of the most overtly political, explosive and exciting bands in rock and roll history\".<ref name=\"rockhall-The_Clash\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-clash\n|title=The Clash\n|accessdate=19 November 2007\n|date=10 March 2003\n|work=Induction\n|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum\n|quote=a) Quite simply, the Clash were among the most explosive and exciting bands in rock and roll history. <br />b, c) If not exactly a reunion, it was a rapprochement. On 15 November 2002, Jones and Strummer shared the stage for the first time in nearly 20&nbsp;years, performing three Clash songs during the encore of a London benefit show by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. This raised hopes for a Clash reunion, which were dashed when Strummer died of a heart attack on 22 December 2002.\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430132108/http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-clash\n|archive-date=30 April 2010\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Their songs tackled social decay, unemployment, racism, police brutality, political and social repression, and militarism in detail. Strummer was involved with the [[Anti-Nazi League]] and [[Rock Against Racism]] campaigns. He later also gave his support to the Rock Against the Rich series of concerts organised by the anarchist organisation [[Class War]]. The Clash's ''[[London Calling]]'' album was voted best album of the 1980s by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine (although it was released in late 1979 in the UK, it was not released until 1980 in the US).<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2600669.stm\n|title=Clash star Strummer dies\n|accessdate=20 November 2007\n|date=27 December 2002\n|format=STM\n|work=Entertainment\n|publisher=BBC News World Edition\n|quote=Rolling Stone voted London Calling, their classic 1980 album (released in 1979 in the UK) as the best album of the Eighties.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Solo career and soundtrack work (1986\u20131999)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:Joe-Strummer.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Strummer, backing with the Pogues in Japan]]\nA year later, Strummer worked on several songs for the 1986 film ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'', including \"Love Kills\" and \"Dum Dum Club\". Strummer also later worked with Mick Jones and his band [[Big Audio Dynamite]], contributing to the band's second studio album by co-writing most of the songs as well as producing the album along with Jones.\n\nIn 1987, he played a small part in the film ''[[Walker (film)|Walker]]'', directed by [[Alex Cox]], as a character named \"Faucet\" and wrote and performed on the film's [[Walker (album)|soundtrack]].  He starred in another Cox film that same year called ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'', as the character Simms. ''Straight to Hell'' also featured London-Irish folk/punk band [[the Pogues]], both as actors and contributors to the soundtrack. Strummer joined the Pogues for a tour in 1987/88, filling in for ailing guitarist [[Philip Chevron]], who wrote (in May 2008) on the band's online forum: \"When I was sick in late 1987, I taught Joe all the guitar parts in an afternoon and he was on tour in the US as deputy guitarist the next day. Joe wrote all the tabs in his meticulously neat hand on a long piece of paper which he taped to the top of the guitar so he could glance down occasionally when he was onstage.\" This tour would be the first of several collaborations with the band.\n\nIn 1989, Strummer appeared in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s film ''[[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]]'' as a drunken, short-tempered drifter named Johnny (whom most characters refer to as Elvis, much to Johnny's dismay). He made a cameo appearance in [[Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki]]'s 1990 film ''[[I Hired a Contract Killer]]'' as a guitarist in a pub, performing two songs (\"Burning Lights\" and \"Afro-Cuban Bebop\"). These were released as a promotional 7-inch single limited to a few hundred copies, credited to \"Joe Strummer & the Astro Physicians\". The \"Astro Physicians\" were in fact the Pogues (\"Afro-Cuban Bebop\" got a re-release on the Pogues' 2008 box set). During this time Strummer continued to act, write and produce soundtracks for various films, most notably the soundtrack for ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997).\n\nIn 1989 Strummer produced a solo record with the band the Latino Rockabilly War. The album ''[[Earthquake Weather (album)|Earthquake Weather]]'' was a critical and commercial flop, and resulted in the loss of his contract with [[Sony Records]].  He also did the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Permanent Record (film)|Permanent Record]]'' with this band.\n\nStrummer was asked by the Pogues, who were fracturing as a band, to help them produce their next album, released in 1990 as ''[[Hell's Ditch]]''. In 1991, he replaced [[Shane MacGowan]] as singer of the Pogues for a tour after MacGowan's departure from the band. One night of this tour was professionally recorded, and three tracks (\"I Fought the Law\", \"London Calling\", and \"Turkish Song of the Damned\") have seen release as b-sides and again on the Pogues' 2008 box set.\n\nOn 16 April 1994, Strummer joined Czech-American band Dirty Pictures on stage in Prague at the Repre Club in Obecni Dum at \"Rock for Refugees\", a benefit concert for people left displaced by the war in Bosnia. Although the set appeared impromptu, Strummer and the band had spent the days leading up to the event rehearsing and \"hanging out\" in Prague. The show began with \"London Calling\" and without pause went into \"Brand New Cadillac\". In the middle of the song, the power went out.  Once the power was back on, Strummer asked the audience whether or not they would mind if the band started over. They then began again with \"London Calling\" and continued on for another half-hour.\n\nAfter these self-described \"wilderness years\", Strummer began working with other bands; he played piano on the 1995 UK hit of [[The Levellers (band)|the Levellers]], \"Just the One\" and appeared on the [[Black Grape]] single \"England's Irie\" in 1996. In 1997, while in New York City, he worked with noted producer and engineer [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]] on remixed Clash and 101ers reissue dub material. In collaboration with percussionist Pablo Cook, Strummer wrote and performed the soundtrack to ''Tunnel of Love'' (Robert Wallace 1997) that was featured in the Cannes Film Festival in the same year.\n\nIn 1998, he made a guest appearance on the animated television show, ''[[South Park]]'' and appeared on the album ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]'' featuring songs from and inspired by the series.\n\nDuring this time, Strummer was engaged in a legal dispute with the Clash's record label, [[Epic Records]]. The disagreement lasted nearly eight years and ended with the label agreeing to let him record solo records with another label. If the Clash were to reunite though, they would have to record for Sony. During the nineties, Strummer was a DJ on the [[BBC World Service]] with his half-hour programme ''London Calling''. Samples from the series provide the vocals for \"Midnight Jam\" on Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros' final album ''[[Streetcore]]''.\n\n===The Mescaleros and other work (1999\u20132002)===\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Strummer gathered top-flight musicians into a backing band he called [[the Mescaleros]]. Strummer and the band signed with [[Mercury Records]], and released their first album in 1999, which was co-written with [[Antony Genn]], called ''[[Rock Art and the X-Ray Style]]''. A tour of England, Europe, and North America soon followed.\n\n{{quote|This is my Indian summer ... I learnt that fame is an illusion and everything about it is just a joke.

The album was supported with a 21-date tour of North America, Britain, and Ireland. Once again, these concerts featured Clash material (\"[[London's Burning (The Clash song)|London's Burning]]\", \"Rudie Can't Fail\", \"[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]\"), as well as covers of [[reggae]] and [[ska]] hits (\"[[The Harder They Come (song)|The Harder They Come]]\", \"A Message to You, Rudy\") and the band regularly closed the show by playing the [[Ramones]]' \"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]\". He covered [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[Redemption Song]]\" with [[Johnny Cash]].\n\nOn 15 November 2002, Strummer and the Mescaleros played a benefit show for striking fire fighters in London, at the Acton Town Hall. [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] was in the audience, and joined the band on stage during the Clash's \"Bankrobber\". An encore followed with Jones playing guitar and singing on \"White Riot\" and \"London's Burning\". This performance marked the first time since 1983 that Strummer and Jones had performed together on stage.<ref name=\"rockhall-The_Clash\" />\n\nStrummer's final regular gig was at Liverpool Academy on 22 November 2002, yet his final performance, just two weeks before his death, was in a small club venue 'The Palace' in Bridgwater, Somerset, near his home.

In 1978, Strummer started a relationship with Gaby Salter shortly after her 17th birthday.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} The couple remained together for 14 years and had two daughters, Jazz and Lola, but did not marry as Strummer had been unable to locate and divorce Moolman.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} During his relationship with Salter, he had multiple affairs spanning the 1980s.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}\n\nIn 1993, Strummer began an affair with Lucinda Tait, which finally ended his relationship with  Salter.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} Strummer and Tait married in 1995 and remained so until his death in 2002.\n\nStrummer described himself as a [[socialist]]. He stated about his socialist views, \"I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those arsehole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from.

After joining the Clash, the guitar's body and pickguard were refinished in grey auto primer and then painted black. Over the years, the guitar would see numerous sticker configurations, with the most prominent and longest-lasting one stating \"Ignore Alien Orders\". Years of heavy wear and taped on set lists remain on the guitar to this day, and the only known modifications to it included the installation of an individual, 6-saddle bridge, and Fender \"f-style\" tuning machines.\n\nIn 2012 modern artist [http://www.karlhaglund.com Karl Haglund] paid tribute to this guitar in one of his iconic guitar paintings.<ref>[http://www.karlhaglund.com/gallery/still-life-and-guitars/14586985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013233149/http://www.karlhaglund.com/gallery/still-life-and-guitars/14586985|date=13 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strummerguitar.com/evolutionofalegend.html |title=A tribute to Joe Strummers Fender Telecaster guitar |website=Strummerguitar.com |date=1976-04-10 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> The [[Fender Custom Shop]] created a Joe Strummer tribute Telecaster in 2007 with a reliced flat black finish and an exact replica of the neck profile of his '66 Telecaster.<ref name=\"fender-js\" />\n\nStrummer was naturally left-handed, but was taught to play guitar right-handed by his close friend [[Tymon Dogg]].
