{"title_page": "Interchangeable parts", "text_new": "{{short description|Components that are identical for practical purposes}}\n'''Interchangeable parts''' are parts ([[wikt:component#Noun|components]]) that are, for practical purposes, identical. They are made to [[specification]]s that ensure that they are so nearly identical that they will fit into any assembly of the same type. One such part can freely replace another, without any custom fitting, such as [[File (tool)|filing]]. This interchangeability allows easy assembly of new devices, and easier repair of existing devices, while minimizing both the time and skill required of the person doing the assembly or repair. fart nuggets were made with interchanable parts \n\nThe concept of interchangeability was crucial to the introduction of the [[assembly line]] at the beginning of the 20th century, and has become an important element of some modern manufacturing but is missing from other important industries.\n\nInterchangeability of parts was achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and the invention of several [[machine tool]]s, such as the [[Henry Maudslay#Lathe design|slide rest lathe]], [[screw-cutting lathe]], [[turret lathe]], [[milling machine]] and [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]].  Additional innovations included jigs for guiding the machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts.<ref name =Hounshell-1984>{{Hounshell1984}}</ref>  [[Electrification]] allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric motors, eliminating [[line shaft]] drives from steam engines or water power and allowing higher speeds, making modern large scale manufacturing possible.<ref>{{Citation |title=Edison as I Know Him |last1=Ford |first1=Henry |authorlink=Henry Ford |last2=Crowther |first2=Samuel |year=1930 |publisher=Cosmopolitan Book Company |location=New York |isbn= |pages=30 |url=http://www.atomicacreative.com/images/ACG_EdisonAsIKnowHim.pdf |access-date=2011-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011222306/http://www.atomicacreative.com/images/ACG_EdisonAsIKnowHim.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Modern machine tools often have [[numerical control]] (NC) which evolved into CNC (computerized numeric control) when microprocessors became available.\n\nMethods for industrial production of interchangeable parts in the United States were first developed in the nineteenth century. The term ''[[American system of manufacturing]]'' was sometimes applied to them at the time, in distinction from earlier methods. Within a few decades such methods were in use in various countries, so ''American system'' is now a term of historical reference rather than current industrial nomenclature.\n\n== First use ==\nEvidence of the use of interchangeable parts can be traced back over two thousand years to [[Carthage]] in the [[First Punic War]]. Carthaginian ships had standardized, interchangeable parts that even came with assembly instructions akin to \"tab a into slot b\" marked on them.<ref>[http://www.mmdtkw.org/ALRIAncRomUnit4Slides.html Rome, Carthage, and the Punic Wars]<br/>Meanwhile Carthage was mass producing warships. And that's not an exaggeration either about numbers or about shipbuilding methods; Carthaginian warships were built up of standard interchangeable parts. We know this not only from contemporary accounts, but also from recovered Carthaginian ships like the half of a Carthaginian ship shown in (c), above, that was recovered off the coast of Marsala at the western tip of Sicily; it was brand new when it was sunk by the Romans, and it still retains marks giving assembly instructions (\"tab a into slot b\", etc.) Other recovered ships had identical parts.</ref>\n\nIn [[East Asia]], during the [[Warring States]] period and later the [[Qin Dynasty]], bronze crossbow triggers and locking mechanisms were mass-produced and made to be interchangeable.\n\n==Origins of the modern concept==\nIn the late 18th century, French General [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]] promoted standardized weapons in what became known as the ''[[Gribeauval system|Syst\u00e8me Gribeauval]]'' after it was issued as a royal order in 1765. (Its focus at the time was [[artillery]] more than [[musket]]s or [[handgun]]s.) One of the accomplishments of the system was that solid cast cannons were bored to precise tolerances, which allowed the walls to be thinner than cannons poured with hollow cores.  However, because cores were often off center, the wall thickness determined the size of the bore.  Standardized boring allowed cannons to be shorter without sacrificing accuracy and range because of the tighter fit of the [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. It also allowed standardization of the shells.<ref name =Hounshell-1984/>\n\nBefore the 18th century, devices such as guns were made one at a time by [[gunsmith]]s in a unique manner.  If one single component of a firearm needed a replacement, the entire firearm either had to be sent to an expert gunsmith for custom repairs, or discarded and replaced by another firearm. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the idea of replacing these methods with a system of interchangeable manufacture was gradually developed.<ref name=\"Fitch1882p4\">{{Harvnb|Fitch|1882}}, [https://archive.org/details/reportonmanufac00fitcgoog/page/n21 p. 4].</ref><ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp25-46\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=25\u201346}}.</ref> The development took decades and involved many people.<ref name=\"Fitch1882p4\"/><ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp25-46\"/>\n\nGribeauval provided patronage to [[Honor\u00e9 Blanc]], who attempted to implement the ''[[Gribeauval system|Syst\u00e8me Gribeauval]]'' at the musket level. By around 1778, Honor\u00e9 Blanc began producing some of the first firearms with interchangeable flint locks, although they were carefully made by craftsmen. Blanc demonstrated in front of a committee of scientists that his muskets could be fitted with flint locks picked at random from a pile of parts.<ref name =Hounshell-1984/>\n\nMuskets with interchangeable locks caught the attention of [[Thomas Jefferson]] through the efforts of Honor\u00e9 Blanc when Jefferson was Ambassador to France in 1785. Jefferson tried to persuade Blanc to move to America, but was not successful, so he wrote to the American Secretary of War with the idea, and when he returned to the USA he worked to fund its development.  President [[George Washington]] approved of the idea, and by 1798 a contract was issued to [[Eli Whitney]] for 12,000 muskets built under the new system.<ref>[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]], ''Connections'' (Little, Brown and Co.), 1978/1995 {{ISBN|0-316-11672-6}}, p. 150</ref>\n\n[[Louis de Tousard]], who fled the French Revolution, joined the U.S. Corp of Artillerists in 1795 and wrote an influential artillerist's manual that stressed the importance of standardization.<ref name =Hounshell-1984/>\n\n== Implementation ==\nNumerous inventors began to try to implement the principle Blanc had described. The development of the machine tools and manufacturing practices required would be a great expense to the U.S. [[Ordnance Department]], and for some years while trying to achieve interchangeability, the firearms produced cost more to manufacture. By 1853, there was evidence that interchangeable parts, then perfected by the Federal Armories, led to savings.  The Ordnance Department freely shared the techniques used with outside suppliers.<ref name =Hounshell-1984/>\n\n=== Eli Whitney and an early attempt ===\nIn the US, [[Eli Whitney]] saw the potential benefit of developing \"interchangeable parts\" for the firearms of the United States military. In July 1801 he built ten guns, all containing the same exact parts and mechanisms, then disassembled them before the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]].  He placed the parts in a mixed pile and, with help, reassembled all of the firearms right in front of Congress, much like Blanc had done some years before.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Dusen|2003}}.</ref>\n\nThe Congress was captivated and ordered a standard for all United States equipment.  The use of interchangeable parts removed the problems of earlier eras concerning the difficulty or impossibility of producing new parts for old equipment. If one firearm part failed, another could be ordered, and the firearm would not have to be discarded. The catch was that Whitney's guns were costly and handmade by skilled workmen.\n\nCharles Fitch credited Whitney with successfully executing a firearms contract with interchangeable parts using the [[American system of manufacturing|American System]],<ref name=\"Fitch1882p4\"/> but historians [[Merritt Roe Smith]] and [[Robert B. Gordon]] have since determined that Whitney never actually achieved interchangeable parts manufacturing. His family's arms company, however, did so after his death.\n\n=== Brunel's sailing blocks ===\n[[File:PulleyShip.JPG|thumb|A pulley block for rigging on a sailing ship]]\n\nMass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in cooperation with [[Henry Maudslay]] and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (and with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir [[Samuel Bentham]], the Inspector General of Naval Works at [[Portsmouth Block Mills]], [[Portsmouth Dockyard]],  [[Hampshire]], England. At the time, the [[Napoleonic War]] was at its height, and the [[Royal Navy]] was in a state of expansion that required 100,000 [[Block (sailing)|pulley blocks]] to be manufactured a year. Bentham had already achieved remarkable efficiency at the docks by introducing power-driven machinery and reorganising the dockyard system.\n\nMarc Brunel, a pioneering engineer, and Maudslay, a founding father of [[machine tool]] technology who had developed the first industrially practical [[screw-cutting lathe]] in 1800 which standardized [[screw thread]] sizes for the first time,<ref>Quentin R. Skrabec, Jr. (2005). \"The Metallurgic Age: The Victorian Flowering of Invention and Industrial Science\". p. 169. McFarland</ref> collaborated on plans to manufacture block-making machinery; the proposal was submitted to the [[Admiralty]] who agreed to commission his services. By 1805, the dockyard had been fully updated with the revolutionary, purpose-built machinery at a time when products were still built individually with different components. A total of 45 machines were required to perform 22 processes on the blocks, which could be made in three different sizes. The machines were almost entirely made of metal thus improving their accuracy and durability. The machines would make markings and indentations on the blocks to ensure alignment throughout the process. One of the many advantages of this new method was the increase in labour [[productivity]] due to the less labour-intensive requirements of managing the machinery. Richard Beamish, assistant to Brunel's son and engineer, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], wrote:\n\n<blockquote>So that ten men, by the aid of this machinery, can accomplish with uniformity, celerity and ease, what formerly required the uncertain labour of one hundred and ten.</blockquote>\n\nBy 1808, annual production had reached 130,000 blocks and some of the equipment was still in operation as late as the mid-twentieth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/enlightenment_and_measurement/05.ST.02/?scene=3&tv=true|title=Making the Modern World \u2013 Rational manufacture|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm|title=PORTSMOUTH ROYAL DOCKYARD HISTOR|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/start.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924212638/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/start.asp |archivedate=2006-09-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gilbert1965\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1965}}.</ref><ref name=\"Cooper1982\">{{Harvnb|Cooper|1982}}.</ref><ref name=\"Cooper1984\">{{Harvnb|Cooper|1984}}.</ref><ref name=\"Coad1989\">{{Harvnb|Coad|1989}}.</ref><ref name=\"Coad2005\">{{Harvnb|Coad|2005}}.</ref><ref name=\"Wilkin1999\">{{Harvnb|Wilkin|1999}}.</ref><ref name=\"CantrellCookson2002\">{{Harvnb|Cantrell|Cookson|2002}}.</ref>\n\n=== Terry's clocks: success in wood ===\n[[File:Wooden Gear.jpg|thumb|A wooden gear from one of Terry's tall case clocks, showing the use of milled teeth.]]\n[[Eli Terry]] was using interchangeable parts using a milling machine as early as 1800. Ward Francillon, a horologist concluded in a study that Terry had already accomplished interchangeable parts as early as 1800. The study examined several of Terry's clocks produced between 1800\u20131807. The parts were labeled and interchanged as needed. The study concluded that all clock pieces were interchangeable.\nThe very first mass production using interchangeable parts in America was [[Eli Terry]]'s 1806 Porter Contract, which called for the production of 4000 clocks in three years.<ref>Eli Terry and the Connecticut Shelf Clock; Tect</ref> During this contract, Terry crafted four-thousand wooden gear tall case movements, at a time when the annual average was about a dozen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eli Terry and the Connecticut Shelf Clock; Text</ref> Unlike [[Eli Whitney]], Terry manufactured his products without government funding. Terry saw the potential of clocks becoming a household object. With the use of a milling machine, Terry was able to mass-produce clock wheels and plates a few dozen at the same time. Jigs and templates were used to make uniform pinions, so that all parts could be assembled using an [[assembly line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== North and Hall: success in metal ===\nThe crucial step toward interchangeability in metal parts was taken by [[Simeon North]], working only a few miles from [[Eli Terry]].  North created one of the world's first true [[milling machine]]s to do metal shaping that had been done by hand with a file. Diana Muir believes that North's milling machine was online around 1816.<ref name=\"Muir2000\">{{Harvnb|Muir|2000}}.</ref> Muir, Merritt Roe Smith, and [[Robert B. Gordon]] all agree that before 1832 both Simeon North and [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]] were able to mass-produce complex machines with moving parts (guns) using a system that entailed the use of rough-forged parts, with a milling machine that milled the parts to near-correct size, and that were then \"filed to gage by hand with the aid of filing jigs.\"<ref name=\"Gordon1989\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|1989}}.</ref>\n\nHistorians differ over the question of whether Hall or North made the crucial improvement.  Merrit Roe Smith believes that it was done by Hall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1973}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1977}}.</ref> Muir demonstrates the close personal ties and professional alliances between Simeon North and neighboring mechanics mass-producing wooden clocks to argue that the process for manufacturing guns with interchangeable parts was most probably devised by North in emulation of the successful methods used in mass-producing clocks.<ref name=\"Muir2000\"/> It may not be possible to resolve the question with absolute certainty unless documents now unknown should surface in the future.\n\n=== Late 19th and early 20th centuries: dissemination throughout manufacturing ===\nSkilled engineers and machinists, many with armory experience, spread interchangeable manufacturing techniques to other American industries including [[clockmaker]]s and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860.<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\" /><ref>\n{{cite book |title      = The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 1989\n |publisher  = University of North Carolina Press\n |location   = \n |isbn       = 978-0807818671\n |pages      = \n |postscript = <!--None-->\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/pathtomechanized00thom\n}}\n</ref>  Late to adopt the interchangeable system were\n[[Singer Corporation]] sewing machine (1870s), [[reaper]] manufacturer [[Cyrus McCormick|McCormick Harvesting Machine Company]] (1870s\u20131880s)<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\" /> and several large steam engine manufacturers such as [[Corliss steam engine|Corliss]] (mid-1880s)<ref name = \"Hunter 1985\">\n{{cite book\n|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 2: Steam Power\n |last=Hunter\t\t\n |first= Louis C. \n|authorlink= \n|year=1985 |publisher =University Press of Virginia \n|location= Charlottesville\n|isbn= |page=}}\n</ref> as well as locomotive makers.  Typewriters followed some years later. Then large scale production of bicycles in the 1880s began to use the interchangeable system.<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\" />\n\nDuring these decades, true interchangeability grew from a scarce and difficult achievement into an everyday capability throughout the manufacturing industries.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984}}.</ref> In the 1950s and 1960s, [[history of technology|historians of technology]] broadened the world's understanding of the history of the development. Few people outside that academic discipline knew much about the topic until as recently as the 1980s and 1990s, when the academic knowledge began finding wider audiences. As recently as the 1960s, when [[Alfred P. Sloan]] published his famous memoir and management treatise, ''My Years with General Motors'', even the longtime president and chair of the largest manufacturing enterprise that had ever existed knew very little about the history of the development, other than to say that\n\n<blockquote><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Henry M. Leland]] was], I believe, one of those mainly responsible for bringing the technique of interchangeable parts into automobile manufacturing. [\u2026] It has been called to my attention that Eli Whitney, long before, had started the development of interchangeable parts in connection with the manufacture of guns, a fact which suggests a line of descent from Whitney to Leland to the automobile industry.<ref name=\"Sloan1964pp20-21\">{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=20\u201321}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of the better-known books on the subject, which was first published in 1984 and has enjoyed a readership beyond academia, has been [[David A. Hounshell]]'s ''From the American System to Mass Production, 1800\u20131932: The Development of Manufacturing Technology in the United States''.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\n==Socioeconomic context==\n\nThe principle of interchangeable parts flourished and developed throughout the 19th century, and led to [[mass production]] in many industries. It was based on the use of templates and other [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], applied by semi-skilled labor using [[machine tool]]s to augment (and later largely replace) the traditional [[hand tool]]s. Throughout this century there was much development work to be done in creating [[Gauge (instrument)|gauges]], measuring tools (such as [[caliper]]s and [[micrometer]]s), standards (such as [[Screw thread#History of standardization|those for screw threads]]), and processes (such as [[scientific management]]), but the principle of interchangeability remained constant. With the introduction of the [[assembly line]] at the beginning of the 20th century, interchangeable parts became [[wikt:ubiquitous#Adjective|ubiquitous]] elements of manufacturing.\n\n==Selective assembly==\nInterchangeability relies on parts' dimensions falling within the tolerance range. The most common mode of assembly is to design and manufacture such that, as long as each part that reaches assembly is within tolerance, the mating of parts can be totally random. This has value for all the reasons already discussed earlier.\n\nThere is another mode of assembly, called \"selective assembly\", which gives up ''some'' of the randomness capability in trade-off for other [[value (economics)|value]]. There are two main areas of application that benefit economically from selective assembly: when tolerance ranges are so tight that they cannot quite be held reliably (making the total randomness unavailable); and when tolerance ranges can be reliably held, but the fit and finish of the final assembly is being maximized by voluntarily giving up some of the randomness (which makes it available but not ideally desirable). In either case the principle of selective assembly is the same: parts are ''selected'' for mating, rather than being mated at random. As the parts are [[inspection|inspected]], they are graded out into separate bins based on what end of the range they fall in (or violate). Falling within the high or low end of a range is usually called being ''heavy'' or ''light''; violating the high or low end of a range is usually called being ''oversize'' or ''undersize''. Examples are given below.\n\nFrench and Vierck<ref name=\"French_Vierck_1953_p374\">{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|et al|1953|p=374}}.</ref> provide a one-paragraph description of selective assembly that aptly summarizes the concept.\n\nOne might ask, if parts must be selected for mating, then what makes selective assembly any different from the oldest craft methods? But there is in fact a significant difference. Selective assembly merely grades the parts into several ''ranges''; within each range, there is still random interchangeability. This is quite different from the older method of fitting by a craftsman, where each mated set of parts is specifically filed to fit each part with a ''specific, unique'' counterpart.\n\n===Random assembly not available: oversize and undersize parts===\nIn contexts where the application requires extremely tight (narrow) tolerance ranges, the [[requirement]] may push slightly past the limit of the ability of the machining and other processes (stamping, rolling, bending, etc.) to stay within the range. In such cases, selective assembly is used to compensate for a lack of ''total'' interchangeability among the parts. Thus, for a pin that must have a sliding fit in its hole (free but not sloppy), the dimension may be spec'd as 12.00&nbsp;+0&nbsp;\u22120.01&nbsp;mm for the pin, and 12.00&nbsp;+.01&nbsp;\u22120 for the hole. Pins that came out oversize (say a pin at 12.003mm diameter) are not necessarily [[scrap]], ''but'' they can only be mated with counterparts that ''also'' came out oversize (say a hole at 12.013mm). The same is then true for matching ''under''size parts with ''under''size counterparts. Inherent in this example is that for this product's application, the 12&nbsp;mm dimension does not require extreme ''accuracy'', ''but'' the desired fit between the parts does require good ''precision'' (see the article on [[accuracy and precision]]). This allows the makers to \"cheat a little\" on ''total'' interchangeability in order to get more value out of the manufacturing effort by reducing the rejection rate (scrap rate). This is a sound engineering decision as long as the application and context support it. For example, for machines for which there is no intention for any future field service of a parts-replacing nature (but rather only simple replacement of the whole unit), this makes good economic sense. It lowers the [[unit cost]] of the products, and it does not impede future service work.\n\nAn example of a product that might benefit from this approach could be a car transmission where there is no expectation that the field service person will repair the old transmission; instead, he will simply swap in a new one. Therefore, total interchangeability was not absolutely required for the assemblies inside the transmissions. It would have been specified anyway, simply on general principle, except for a certain shaft that required precision so high as to cause great annoyance and high scrap rates in the grinding area, but for which only decent accuracy was required, as long as the fit with its hole was good in every case. Money could be saved by saving many shafts from the scrap bin.\n\n====Economic and commercial realities====\nExamples like the one above are not as common in real commerce as they conceivably could be, mostly because of [[separation of concerns]], where each part of a complex system is expected to give performance that does not make any limiting assumptions about other parts of the system. In the car transmission example, the separation of concerns is that individual firms and customers accept no lack of freedom or options from others in the supply chain. For example, in the car buyer's view, the car manufacturer is \"not within its rights\" to assume that no field-service mechanic will ever repair the old transmission instead of replacing it. The customer expects that that decision will be preserved for ''him'' to make later, at the repair shop, based on which option is less expensive for him at that time (figuring that replacing one shaft is cheaper than replacing a whole transmission). This logic is not always valid in reality; it might have been better for the customer's total ownership cost to pay a lower initial price for the car (especially if the transmission service is covered under the standard warranty for 10 years, and the buyer intends to replace the car before then anyway) than to pay a higher initial price for the car but preserve the option of total interchangeability of every last nut, bolt, and shaft throughout the car (when it is not going to be taken advantage of anyway). But commerce is generally too chaotically multivariate for this logic to prevail, so total interchangeability ends up being specified and achieved even when it adds expense that was \"needless\" from a holistic view of the commercial system. But this may be avoided to the extent that customers experience the ''overall'' value (which their minds can detect and appreciate) without having to understand its logical analysis. Thus buyers of an amazingly affordable car (surprisingly low initial price) will probably never complain that the transmission was not field-serviceable as long as ''they themselves'' never had to pay for transmission service in the lifespan of their ownership. This analysis can be important for the manufacturer to understand (even if it is lost on the customer), because he can carve for himself a competitive advantage in the marketplace if he can accurately predict where to \"cut corners\" in ways that the customer will never have to pay for. Thus he could give himself lower transmission unit cost. However, he must be sure when he does so that the transmissions he's using are reliable, because their replacement, being covered under a long warranty, will be at his expense.\n\n===Random assembly available but not ideally desirable: \"light\" and \"heavy\" parts===\nThe other main area of application for selective assembly is in contexts where total interchangeability is in fact achieved, but the \"fit and finish\" of the final products can be enhanced by minimizing the dimensional mismatch between mating parts. Consider another application similar to the one above with the 12&nbsp;mm pin. But say that in this example, not only is the ''precision'' important (to produce the desired fit), but the ''accuracy'' is also important (because the 12&nbsp;mm pin must interact with something else that will have to be accurately sized at 12&nbsp;mm). Some of the implications of this example are that the rejection rate cannot be lowered; all parts must fall within tolerance range or be scrapped. So there are no savings to be had from salvaging oversize or undersize parts from scrap, then. However, there ''is'' still one bit of value to be had from selective assembly: having all the mated pairs have as close to identical sliding fit as possible (as opposed to some tighter fits and some looser fits\u2014all sliding, but with varying resistance).\n\nAn example of a product that might benefit from this approach could be a [[toolroom]]-grade [[machine tool]], where not only is the accuracy highly important but also the fit and finish.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Allowance (engineering)]]\n*[[Engineering fit]]\n*[[Engineering tolerance]]\n*[[Fungibility]]\n*[[Just-in-time (business)]]\n*[[Louis de Tousard]]\n*[[Modular design]]\n*[[Preferred number]]s\n*[[Configuration management]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation | last = Cantrell | first = J. | last2 = Cookson | first2 = G.

They are made to [[specification]]s that ensure that they are so nearly identical that they will fit into any assembly of the same type. One such part can freely replace another, without any custom fitting, such as [[File (tool)|filing]]. This interchangeability allows easy assembly of new devices, and easier repair of existing devices, while minimizing both the time and skill required of the person doing the assembly or repair.\n\nThe concept of interchangeability was crucial to the introduction of the [[assembly line]] at the beginning of the 20th century, and has become an important element of some modern manufacturing but is missing from other important industries.\n\nInterchangeability of parts was achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and the invention of several [[machine tool]]s, such as the [[Henry Maudslay#Lathe design|slide rest lathe]], [[screw-cutting lathe]], [[turret lathe]], [[milling machine]] and [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]].  Additional innovations included jigs for guiding the machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts.<ref name =Hounshell-1984>{{Hounshell1984}}</ref>  [[Electrification]] allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric motors, eliminating [[line shaft]] drives from steam engines or water power and allowing higher speeds, making modern large scale manufacturing possible.<ref>{{Citation |title=Edison as I Know Him |last1=Ford |first1=Henry |authorlink=Henry Ford |last2=Crowther |first2=Samuel |year=1930 |publisher=Cosmopolitan Book Company |location=New York |isbn= |pages=30 |url=http://www.atomicacreative.com/images/ACG_EdisonAsIKnowHim.pdf |access-date=2011-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011222306/http://www.atomicacreative.com/images/ACG_EdisonAsIKnowHim.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Modern machine tools often have [[numerical control]] (NC) which evolved into CNC (computerized numeric control) when microprocessors became available.\n\nMethods for industrial production of interchangeable parts in the United States were first developed in the nineteenth century. The term ''[[American system of manufacturing]]'' was sometimes applied to them at the time, in distinction from earlier methods. Within a few decades such methods were in use in various countries, so ''American system'' is now a term of historical reference rather than current industrial nomenclature.\n\n== First use ==\nEvidence of the use of interchangeable parts can be traced back over two thousand years to [[Carthage]] in the [[First Punic War]]. Carthaginian ships had standardized, interchangeable parts that even came with assembly instructions akin to \"tab a into slot b\" marked on them.<ref>[http://www.mmdtkw.org/ALRIAncRomUnit4Slides.html Rome, Carthage, and the Punic Wars]<br/>Meanwhile Carthage was mass producing warships. And that's not an exaggeration either about numbers or about shipbuilding methods; Carthaginian warships were built up of standard interchangeable parts. We know this not only from contemporary accounts, but also from recovered Carthaginian ships like the half of a Carthaginian ship shown in (c), above, that was recovered off the coast of Marsala at the western tip of Sicily; it was brand new when it was sunk by the Romans, and it still retains marks giving assembly instructions (\"tab a into slot b\", etc.) Other recovered ships had identical parts.</ref>\n\nIn [[East Asia]], during the [[Warring States]] period and later the [[Qin Dynasty]], bronze crossbow triggers and locking mechanisms were mass-produced and made to be interchangeable.\n\n==Origins of the modern concept==\nIn the late 18th century, French General [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]] promoted standardized weapons in what became known as the ''[[Gribeauval system|Syst\u00e8me Gribeauval]]'' after it was issued as a royal order in 1765. (Its focus at the time was [[artillery]] more than [[musket]]s or [[handgun]]s.) One of the accomplishments of the system was that solid cast cannons were bored to precise tolerances, which allowed the walls to be thinner than cannons poured with hollow cores.  However, because cores were often off center, the wall thickness determined the size of the bore.  Standardized boring allowed cannons to be shorter without sacrificing accuracy and range because of the tighter fit of the [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. It also allowed standardization of the shells.<ref name =Hounshell-1984/>\n\nBefore the 18th century, devices such as guns were made one at a time by [[gunsmith]]s in a unique manner.  If one single component of a firearm needed a replacement, the entire firearm either had to be sent to an expert gunsmith for custom repairs, or discarded and replaced by another firearm. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the idea of replacing these methods with a system of interchangeable manufacture was gradually developed.<ref name=\"Fitch1882p4\">{{Harvnb|Fitch|1882}}, [https://archive.org/details/reportonmanufac00fitcgoog/page/n21 p. 4].</ref><ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp25-46\">{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=25\u201346}}.</ref> The development took decades and involved many people.<ref name=\"Fitch1882p4\"/><ref name=\"Hounshell1984pp25-46\"/>\n\nGribeauval provided patronage to [[Honor\u00e9 Blanc]], who attempted to implement the ''[[Gribeauval system|Syst\u00e8me Gribeauval]]'' at the musket level. By around 1778, Honor\u00e9 Blanc began producing some of the first firearms with interchangeable flint locks, although they were carefully made by craftsmen. Blanc demonstrated in front of a committee of scientists that his muskets could be fitted with flint locks picked at random from a pile of parts.<ref name =Hounshell-1984/>\n\nMuskets with interchangeable locks caught the attention of [[Thomas Jefferson]] through the efforts of Honor\u00e9 Blanc when Jefferson was Ambassador to France in 1785. Jefferson tried to persuade Blanc to move to America, but was not successful, so he wrote to the American Secretary of War with the idea, and when he returned to the USA he worked to fund its development.  President [[George Washington]] approved of the idea, and by 1798 a contract was issued to [[Eli Whitney]] for 12,000 muskets built under the new system.<ref>[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]], ''Connections'' (Little, Brown and Co.), 1978/1995 {{ISBN|0-316-11672-6}}, p. 150</ref>\n\n[[Louis de Tousard]], who fled the French Revolution, joined the U.S. Corp of Artillerists in 1795 and wrote an influential artillerist's manual that stressed the importance of standardization.<ref name =Hounshell-1984/>\n\n== Implementation ==\nNumerous inventors began to try to implement the principle Blanc had described. The development of the machine tools and manufacturing practices required would be a great expense to the U.S. [[Ordnance Department]], and for some years while trying to achieve interchangeability, the firearms produced cost more to manufacture. By 1853, there was evidence that interchangeable parts, then perfected by the Federal Armories, led to savings.  The Ordnance Department freely shared the techniques used with outside suppliers.<ref name =Hounshell-1984/>\n\n=== Eli Whitney and an early attempt ===\nIn the US, [[Eli Whitney]] saw the potential benefit of developing \"interchangeable parts\" for the firearms of the United States military. In July 1801 he built ten guns, all containing the same exact parts and mechanisms, then disassembled them before the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]].  He placed the parts in a mixed pile and, with help, reassembled all of the firearms right in front of Congress, much like Blanc had done some years before.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Dusen|2003}}.</ref>\n\nThe Congress was captivated and ordered a standard for all United States equipment.  The use of interchangeable parts removed the problems of earlier eras concerning the difficulty or impossibility of producing new parts for old equipment. If one firearm part failed, another could be ordered, and the firearm would not have to be discarded. The catch was that Whitney's guns were costly and handmade by skilled workmen.\n\nCharles Fitch credited Whitney with successfully executing a firearms contract with interchangeable parts using the [[American system of manufacturing|American System]],<ref name=\"Fitch1882p4\"/> but historians [[Merritt Roe Smith]] and [[Robert B. Gordon]] have since determined that Whitney never actually achieved interchangeable parts manufacturing. His family's arms company, however, did so after his death.\n\n=== Brunel's sailing blocks ===\n[[File:PulleyShip.JPG|thumb|A pulley block for rigging on a sailing ship]]\n\nMass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in cooperation with [[Henry Maudslay]] and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (and with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir [[Samuel Bentham]], the Inspector General of Naval Works at [[Portsmouth Block Mills]], [[Portsmouth Dockyard]],  [[Hampshire]], England. At the time, the [[Napoleonic War]] was at its height, and the [[Royal Navy]] was in a state of expansion that required 100,000 [[Block (sailing)|pulley blocks]] to be manufactured a year. Bentham had already achieved remarkable efficiency at the docks by introducing power-driven machinery and reorganising the dockyard system.\n\nMarc Brunel, a pioneering engineer, and Maudslay, a founding father of [[machine tool]] technology who had developed the first industrially practical [[screw-cutting lathe]] in 1800 which standardized [[screw thread]] sizes for the first time,<ref>Quentin R. Skrabec, Jr. (2005). \"The Metallurgic Age: The Victorian Flowering of Invention and Industrial Science\". p. 169. McFarland</ref> collaborated on plans to manufacture block-making machinery; the proposal was submitted to the [[Admiralty]] who agreed to commission his services. By 1805, the dockyard had been fully updated with the revolutionary, purpose-built machinery at a time when products were still built individually with different components. A total of 45 machines were required to perform 22 processes on the blocks, which could be made in three different sizes. The machines were almost entirely made of metal thus improving their accuracy and durability. The machines would make markings and indentations on the blocks to ensure alignment throughout the process. One of the many advantages of this new method was the increase in labour [[productivity]] due to the less labour-intensive requirements of managing the machinery. Richard Beamish, assistant to Brunel's son and engineer, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], wrote:\n\n<blockquote>So that ten men, by the aid of this machinery, can accomplish with uniformity, celerity and ease, what formerly required the uncertain labour of one hundred and ten.</blockquote>\n\nBy 1808, annual production had reached 130,000 blocks and some of the equipment was still in operation as late as the mid-twentieth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/enlightenment_and_measurement/05.ST.02/?scene=3&tv=true|title=Making the Modern World \u2013 Rational manufacture|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm|title=PORTSMOUTH ROYAL DOCKYARD HISTOR|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/start.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924212638/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/start.asp |archivedate=2006-09-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gilbert1965\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1965}}.</ref><ref name=\"Cooper1982\">{{Harvnb|Cooper|1982}}.</ref><ref name=\"Cooper1984\">{{Harvnb|Cooper|1984}}.</ref><ref name=\"Coad1989\">{{Harvnb|Coad|1989}}.</ref><ref name=\"Coad2005\">{{Harvnb|Coad|2005}}.</ref><ref name=\"Wilkin1999\">{{Harvnb|Wilkin|1999}}.</ref><ref name=\"CantrellCookson2002\">{{Harvnb|Cantrell|Cookson|2002}}.</ref>\n\n=== Terry's clocks: success in wood ===\n[[File:Wooden Gear.jpg|thumb|A wooden gear from one of Terry's tall case clocks, showing the use of milled teeth.]]\n[[Eli Terry]] was using interchangeable parts using a milling machine as early as 1800. Ward Francillon, a horologist concluded in a study that Terry had already accomplished interchangeable parts as early as 1800. The study examined several of Terry's clocks produced between 1800\u20131807. The parts were labeled and interchanged as needed. The study concluded that all clock pieces were interchangeable.\nThe very first mass production using interchangeable parts in America was [[Eli Terry]]'s 1806 Porter Contract, which called for the production of 4000 clocks in three years.<ref>Eli Terry and the Connecticut Shelf Clock; Tect</ref> During this contract, Terry crafted four-thousand wooden gear tall case movements, at a time when the annual average was about a dozen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eli Terry and the Connecticut Shelf Clock; Text</ref> Unlike [[Eli Whitney]], Terry manufactured his products without government funding. Terry saw the potential of clocks becoming a household object. With the use of a milling machine, Terry was able to mass-produce clock wheels and plates a few dozen at the same time. Jigs and templates were used to make uniform pinions, so that all parts could be assembled using an [[assembly line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== North and Hall: success in metal ===\nThe crucial step toward interchangeability in metal parts was taken by [[Simeon North]], working only a few miles from [[Eli Terry]].  North created one of the world's first true [[milling machine]]s to do metal shaping that had been done by hand with a file. Diana Muir believes that North's milling machine was online around 1816.<ref name=\"Muir2000\">{{Harvnb|Muir|2000}}.</ref> Muir, Merritt Roe Smith, and [[Robert B. Gordon]] all agree that before 1832 both Simeon North and [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]] were able to mass-produce complex machines with moving parts (guns) using a system that entailed the use of rough-forged parts, with a milling machine that milled the parts to near-correct size, and that were then \"filed to gage by hand with the aid of filing jigs.\"<ref name=\"Gordon1989\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|1989}}.</ref>\n\nHistorians differ over the question of whether Hall or North made the crucial improvement.  Merrit Roe Smith believes that it was done by Hall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1973}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1977}}.</ref> Muir demonstrates the close personal ties and professional alliances between Simeon North and neighboring mechanics mass-producing wooden clocks to argue that the process for manufacturing guns with interchangeable parts was most probably devised by North in emulation of the successful methods used in mass-producing clocks.<ref name=\"Muir2000\"/> It may not be possible to resolve the question with absolute certainty unless documents now unknown should surface in the future.\n\n=== Late 19th and early 20th centuries: dissemination throughout manufacturing ===\nSkilled engineers and machinists, many with armory experience, spread interchangeable manufacturing techniques to other American industries including [[clockmaker]]s and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860.<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\" /><ref>\n{{cite book |title      = The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 1989\n |publisher  = University of North Carolina Press\n |location   = \n |isbn       = 978-0807818671\n |pages      = \n |postscript = <!--None-->\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/pathtomechanized00thom\n}}\n</ref>  Late to adopt the interchangeable system were\n[[Singer Corporation]] sewing machine (1870s), [[reaper]] manufacturer [[Cyrus McCormick|McCormick Harvesting Machine Company]] (1870s\u20131880s)<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\" /> and several large steam engine manufacturers such as [[Corliss steam engine|Corliss]] (mid-1880s)<ref name = \"Hunter 1985\">\n{{cite book\n|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 2: Steam Power\n |last=Hunter\t\t\n |first= Louis C. \n|authorlink= \n|year=1985 |publisher =University Press of Virginia \n|location= Charlottesville\n|isbn= |page=}}\n</ref> as well as locomotive makers.

As recently as the 1960s, when [[Alfred P. Sloan]] published his famous memoir and management treatise, ''My Years with General Motors'', even the longtime president and chair of the largest manufacturing enterprise that had ever existed knew very little about the history of the development, other than to say that\n\n<blockquote><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Henry M. Leland]] was], I believe, one of those mainly responsible for bringing the technique of interchangeable parts into automobile manufacturing. [\u2026] It has been called to my attention that Eli Whitney, long before, had started the development of interchangeable parts in connection with the manufacture of guns, a fact which suggests a line of descent from Whitney to Leland to the automobile industry.<ref name=\"Sloan1964pp20-21\">{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=20\u201321}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of the better-known books on the subject, which was first published in 1984 and has enjoyed a readership beyond academia, has been [[David A. Hounshell]]'s ''From the American System to Mass Production, 1800\u20131932: The Development of Manufacturing Technology in the United States''.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\n==Socioeconomic context==\n\nThe principle of interchangeable parts flourished and developed throughout the 19th century, and led to [[mass production]] in many industries. It was based on the use of templates and other [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], applied by semi-skilled labor using [[machine tool]]s to augment (and later largely replace) the traditional [[hand tool]]s. Throughout this century there was much development work to be done in creating [[Gauge (instrument)|gauges]], measuring tools (such as [[caliper]]s and [[micrometer]]s), standards (such as [[Screw thread#History of standardization|those for screw threads]]), and processes (such as [[scientific management]]), but the principle of interchangeability remained constant. With the introduction of the [[assembly line]] at the beginning of the 20th century, interchangeable parts became [[wikt:ubiquitous#Adjective|ubiquitous]] elements of manufacturing.\n\n==Selective assembly==\nInterchangeability relies on parts' dimensions falling within the tolerance range. The most common mode of assembly is to design and manufacture such that, as long as each part that reaches assembly is within tolerance, the mating of parts can be totally random. This has value for all the reasons already discussed earlier.\n\nThere is another mode of assembly, called \"selective assembly\", which gives up ''some'' of the randomness capability in trade-off for other [[value (economics)|value]]. There are two main areas of application that benefit economically from selective assembly: when tolerance ranges are so tight that they cannot quite be held reliably (making the total randomness unavailable); and when tolerance ranges can be reliably held, but the fit and finish of the final assembly is being maximized by voluntarily giving up some of the randomness (which makes it available but not ideally desirable). In either case the principle of selective assembly is the same: parts are ''selected'' for mating, rather than being mated at random. As the parts are [[inspection|inspected]], they are graded out into separate bins based on what end of the range they fall in (or violate). Falling within the high or low end of a range is usually called being ''heavy'' or ''light''; violating the high or low end of a range is usually called being ''oversize'' or ''undersize''. Examples are given below.\n\nFrench and Vierck<ref name=\"French_Vierck_1953_p374\">{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|et al|1953|p=374}}.</ref> provide a one-paragraph description of selective assembly that aptly summarizes the concept.\n\nOne might ask, if parts must be selected for mating, then what makes selective assembly any different from the oldest craft methods? But there is in fact a significant difference. Selective assembly merely grades the parts into several ''ranges''; within each range, there is still random interchangeability. This is quite different from the older method of fitting by a craftsman, where each mated set of parts is specifically filed to fit each part with a ''specific, unique'' counterpart.\n\n===Random assembly not available: oversize and undersize parts===\nIn contexts where the application requires extremely tight (narrow) tolerance ranges, the [[requirement]] may push slightly past the limit of the ability of the machining and other processes (stamping, rolling, bending, etc.) to stay within the range. In such cases, selective assembly is used to compensate for a lack of ''total'' interchangeability among the parts. Thus, for a pin that must have a sliding fit in its hole (free but not sloppy), the dimension may be spec'd as 12.00&nbsp;+0&nbsp;\u22120.01&nbsp;mm for the pin, and 12.00&nbsp;+.01&nbsp;\u22120 for the hole. Pins that came out oversize (say a pin at 12.003mm diameter) are not necessarily [[scrap]], ''but'' they can only be mated with counterparts that ''also'' came out oversize (say a hole at 12.013mm). The same is then true for matching ''under''size parts with ''under''size counterparts. Inherent in this example is that for this product's application, the 12&nbsp;mm dimension does not require extreme ''accuracy'', ''but'' the desired fit between the parts does require good ''precision'' (see the article on [[accuracy and precision]]). This allows the makers to \"cheat a little\" on ''total'' interchangeability in order to get more value out of the manufacturing effort by reducing the rejection rate (scrap rate). This is a sound engineering decision as long as the application and context support it. For example, for machines for which there is no intention for any future field service of a parts-replacing nature (but rather only simple replacement of the whole unit), this makes good economic sense. It lowers the [[unit cost]] of the products, and it does not impede future service work.\n\nAn example of a product that might benefit from this approach could be a car transmission where there is no expectation that the field service person will repair the old transmission; instead, he will simply swap in a new one. Therefore, total interchangeability was not absolutely required for the assemblies inside the transmissions. It would have been specified anyway, simply on general principle, except for a certain shaft that required precision so high as to cause great annoyance and high scrap rates in the grinding area, but for which only decent accuracy was required, as long as the fit with its hole was good in every case. Money could be saved by saving many shafts from the scrap bin.\n\n====Economic and commercial realities====\nExamples like the one above are not as common in real commerce as they conceivably could be, mostly because of [[separation of concerns]], where each part of a complex system is expected to give performance that does not make any limiting assumptions about other parts of the system. In the car transmission example, the separation of concerns is that individual firms and customers accept no lack of freedom or options from others in the supply chain. For example, in the car buyer's view, the car manufacturer is \"not within its rights\" to assume that no field-service mechanic will ever repair the old transmission instead of replacing it. The customer expects that that decision will be preserved for ''him'' to make later, at the repair shop, based on which option is less expensive for him at that time (figuring that replacing one shaft is cheaper than replacing a whole transmission). This logic is not always valid in reality; it might have been better for the customer's total ownership cost to pay a lower initial price for the car (especially if the transmission service is covered under the standard warranty for 10 years, and the buyer intends to replace the car before then anyway) than to pay a higher initial price for the car but preserve the option of total interchangeability of every last nut, bolt, and shaft throughout the car (when it is not going to be taken advantage of anyway). But commerce is generally too chaotically multivariate for this logic to prevail, so total interchangeability ends up being specified and achieved even when it adds expense that was \"needless\" from a holistic view of the commercial system. But this may be avoided to the extent that customers experience the ''overall'' value (which their minds can detect and appreciate) without having to understand its logical analysis. Thus buyers of an amazingly affordable car (surprisingly low initial price) will probably never complain that the transmission was not field-serviceable as long as ''they themselves'' never had to pay for transmission service in the lifespan of their ownership. This analysis can be important for the manufacturer to understand (even if it is lost on the customer), because he can carve for himself a competitive advantage in the marketplace if he can accurately predict where to \"cut corners\" in ways that the customer will never have to pay for. Thus he could give himself lower transmission unit cost. However, he must be sure when he does so that the transmissions he's using are reliable, because their replacement, being covered under a long warranty, will be at his expense.\n\n===Random assembly available but not ideally desirable: \"light\" and \"heavy\" parts===\nThe other main area of application for selective assembly is in contexts where total interchangeability is in fact achieved, but the \"fit and finish\" of the final products can be enhanced by minimizing the dimensional mismatch between mating parts. Consider another application similar to the one above with the 12&nbsp;mm pin. But say that in this example, not only is the ''precision'' important (to produce the desired fit), but the ''accuracy'' is also important (because the 12&nbsp;mm pin must interact with something else that will have to be accurately sized at 12&nbsp;mm). Some of the implications of this example are that the rejection rate cannot be lowered; all parts must fall within tolerance range or be scrapped. So there are no savings to be had from salvaging oversize or undersize parts from scrap, then. However, there ''is'' still one bit of value to be had from selective assembly: having all the mated pairs have as close to identical sliding fit as possible (as opposed to some tighter fits and some looser fits\u2014all sliding, but with varying resistance).\n\nAn example of a product that might benefit from this approach could be a [[toolroom]]-grade [[machine tool]], where not only is the accuracy highly important but also the fit and finish.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Allowance (engineering)]]\n*[[Engineering fit]]\n*[[Engineering tolerance]]\n*[[Fungibility]]\n*[[Just-in-time (business)]]\n*[[Louis de Tousard]]\n*[[Modular design]]\n*[[Preferred number]]s\n*[[Configuration management]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation | last = Cantrell | first = J. | last2 = Cookson | first2 = G.

He is at work with Alice, but when Julie asks him he lies and says he is alone. Julie responds that he pisses her off. Later that night, Isma\u00ebl runs into Julie on his way home. They discuss Julie's frustrations about their relationship and eventually, already in their apartment, reconcile. Shortly afterwards Alice arrives; they all get into bed together, read a different book each and fight about each one's place in bed.\n\nThe next day Julie and Isma\u00ebl have breakfast with Julie's family; Julie gets frustrated and leaves for the kitchen, followed by her older sister, Jeanne. Julie tells Jeanne and later her mother about Alice and the [[threesome]]. In the night, after Isma\u00ebl, Julie and Alice leave a bar where they were eating, Julie starts complaining about Isma\u00ebl's relationship with Alice; Isma\u00ebl responds that her jealousy is ironic considering she also has a sexual relationship with Alice, but that she is truly the only one he loves. Alice tells them that she is only there to bring them together. They go to a concert where Alice befriends a guy named Gwendal. Julie starts feeling bad, so she and Isma\u00ebl decide to leave. Outside, Julie collapses and suddenly dies.\n\n=== ''The Absence'' ===\nGoing to work, Isma\u00ebl runs into Jeanne on her way to his and Julie's apartment. At work, he confronts Alice about his constant breakdowns since Julie's death and she comforts him. Since Jeanne is staying in Isma\u00ebl's apartment, he doesn't want to spend the night there, so Alice takes him to Gwendal's apartment.\n\nIsma\u00ebl spends the entire night awake; in the morning he meets Erwann, Gwendal's younger brother who also lives there, and who before leaving for school offers Isma\u00ebl his room so he can finally get some sleep. Erwann returns and wakes Isma\u00ebl up, who borrows some clean clothes from Erwann and leaves for work. Later that night, he discovers Erwann has been following him. Erwann asks to go home with Isma\u00ebl, who rejects him. Isma\u00ebl gets to his apartment to find Jeanne still there, so he goes to Erwann's apartment to spend the night again.\n\nThe next day, Isma\u00ebl visits Julie's family. Later, upset over Julie, he spends the night with a bartender called Maud. Jeanne discovers the two of them in the apartment the next morning, but Isma\u00ebl dresses quickly and sneaks out as Jeanne and Maud chat.\n\n=== ''The Return'' ===\nIsma\u00ebl goes to work to find Erwann waiting for him; he tells Erwann that he is flattered by his attention but is neither interested nor in need of him. Alice, having broken up with Gwendal, thinks Erwan had been sent by his brother to pick up the set of keys she had; she gives them to Isma\u00ebl to pass them on to Erwann. Leaving work, Isma\u00ebl finds Erwann waiting for him again. He returns the keys but then takes them back, and the two of them go to Isma\u00ebl's apartment. \n\nMeanwhile, Alice receives a phone call from Julie's mother and the two of them meet at a restaurant, where Julie's mother asks her to take care of Isma\u00ebl. Jasmine, Julie's other sister, comes to tell her mother that her father is upset that she is still out so late at night, so she leaves. Alice and Jasmine briefly discuss their grief.\n\nIsma\u00ebl and Erwann sleep together that night. Jeanne lets herself into Isma\u00ebl's apartment, discovers Erwann there, and leaves. He follows her into the street where they walk and she explains that she is trying to understand his process of grief, and admits his disinterest in children and threesome arrangement with Julie and Alice can finally be explained by his homosexuality. He neither confirms nor denies this, and the two part unreconciled and upset.\n\nErwann goes to Isma\u00ebl's office only to find Alice. He confirms that he and Isma\u00ebl are in the midst of a fling he hopes will develop further. Meanwhile, Isma\u00ebl, upset, visits Julie's grave and battles with his guilt over both not visiting sooner and his many sexual exploits since her death as a means of coping. Alice eventually finds him drunk at a bar and takes him to Erwann's, who invites him to stay. Isma\u00ebl explains that he will continue their affair as long as Erwann is comfortable not hearing that Isma\u00ebl loves him, and Erwann says Isma\u00ebl can stay as long as he is okay hearing he is loved.

He is at work with Alice, but when Julie asks him he lies and says he is alone. Julie responds that he pisses her off. Later that night, Isma\u00ebl runs into Julie on his way home. They discuss Julie\u2019s frustrations about their relationship and eventually, already in their apartment, reconcile. Shortly afterwards Alice arrives; they all get into bed together, read a different book each and fight about each one's place in bed.\n\nThe next day Julie and Isma\u00ebl have breakfast with Julie\u2019s family; Julie gets frustrated and leaves for the kitchen, followed by her older sister, Jeanne. Julie tells Jeanne and later her mother about Alice and the [[threesome]]. In the night, after Isma\u00ebl, Julie and Alice leave a bar where they were eating, Julie starts complaining about Isma\u00ebl's relationship with Alice; Isma\u00ebl responds that her jealousy is ironic considering she also has a sexual relationship with Alice, but that she is truly the only one he loves. Alice tells them that she is only there to bring them together. They go to a concert where Alice befriends a guy named Gwendal. Julie starts feeling bad, so she and Isma\u00ebl decide to leave. Outside, Julie collapses and suddenly dies.\n\n=== ''The Absence'' ===\nGoing to work, Isma\u00ebl runs into Jeanne on her way to his and Julie's apartment. At work, he confronts Alice about his constant breakdowns since Julie's death and she comforts him. Since Jeanne is staying in Isma\u00ebl\u2019s apartment, he doesn't want to spend the night there, so Alice takes him to Gwendal\u2019s apartment.\n\nIsma\u00ebl spends the entire night awake; in the morning he meets Erwann, Gwendal\u2019s younger brother who also lives there, and who before leaving for school offers Isma\u00ebl his room so he can finally get some sleep. Erwann returns and wakes Isma\u00ebl up, who borrows some clean clothes from Erwann and leaves for work. Later that night, he discovers Erwann has been following him. Erwann asks to go home with Isma\u00ebl, who rejects him. Isma\u00ebl gets to his apartment to find Jeanne still there, so he goes to Erwann\u2019s apartment to spend the night again.\n\nThe next day, Isma\u00ebl visits Julie's family. Later, upset over Julie, he spends the night with a bartender called Maud. Jeanne discovers the two of them in the apartment the next morning, but Isma\u00ebl dresses quickly and sneaks out as Jeanne and Maud chat.\n\n=== ''The Return'' ===\nIsma\u00ebl goes to work to find Erwann waiting for him; he tells Erwann that he is flattered by his attention but is neither interested nor in need of him. Alice, having broken up with Gwendal, thinks Erwan had been sent by his brother to pick up the set of keys she had; she gives them to Isma\u00ebl to pass them on to Erwann. Leaving work, Isma\u00ebl finds Erwann waiting for him again. He returns the keys but then takes them back, and the two of them go to Isma\u00ebl\u2019s apartment. \n\nMeanwhile, Alice receives a phone call from Julie\u2019s mother and the two of them meet at a restaurant, where Julie\u2019s mother asks her to take care of Isma\u00ebl. Jasmine, Julie\u2019s other sister, comes to tell her mother that her father is upset that she is still out so late at night, so she leaves. Alice and Jasmine briefly discuss their grief.\n\nIsma\u00ebl and Erwann sleep together that night. Jeanne lets herself into Isma\u00ebl's apartment, discovers Erwann there, and leaves. He follows her into the street where they walk and she explains that she is trying to understand his process of grief, and admits his disinterest in children and threesome arrangement with Julie and Alice can finally be explained by his homosexuality. He neither confirms nor denies this, and the two part unreconciled and upset.\n\nErwann goes to Isma\u00ebl's office only to find Alice. He confirms that he and Isma\u00ebl are in the midst of a fling he hopes will develop further. Meanwhile, Isma\u00ebl, upset, visits Julie's grave and battles with his guilt over both not visiting sooner and his many sexual exploits since her death as a means of coping. Alice eventually finds him drunk at a bar and takes him to Erwann's, who invites him to stay. Isma\u00ebl explains that he will continue their affair as long as Erwann is comfortable not hearing that Isma\u00ebl loves him, and Erwann says Isma\u00ebl can stay as long as he is okay hearing he is loved. On the roof, Isma\u00ebl tells Erwann to \"love him less but love him for a long time\" and they kiss as Alice looks on from below.\n\n== References to Jacques Demy's work ==\nThis film refers to many other cinematographic works but the most obvious one is to [[Jacques Demy]]'s film ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' and, more widely, to Demy's work.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-30|title=Les Chansons d'amour|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Les_Chansons_d%27amour&oldid=131249470|journal=Wikip\u00e9dia|language=fr}}</ref>{{User generated-inline|date=September 2018}}\n\n=== ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' ===\n[[File:Chiarra Mastroianni 2.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Catherine-deneuveHija.jpg|thumb]]\nThe layout of both films is divided into three parts: The Departure, The Absence, and The Return.

For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], thanks to a long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]] which ended with the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the 1939\u20131945 [[German occupation of Poland]] and the ensuing [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Since the [[fall of communism in Poland]], there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture, featuring an annual [[Jewish Culture Festival]], new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities, and [[Warsaw]]'s [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].\n\nFrom the founding of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 through to the early years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]], [[Poland]] was the most tolerant country in Europe.<ref name=\"Hugh\"/> Historians have used the label ''[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradisus iudaeorum]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"[[Paradise]] of the Jews\").<ref name=\"Engel2009\">Engel, David. \"On Reconciling the Histories of Two Chosen Peoples.\" The American Historical Review 114.4 (2009): 914-929.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polin.pl/en/wystawy-wystawa-glowna-galerie/paradisus-iudaeorum|title=Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569\u20131648)|website=POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews|date=13 May 2013}}</ref> The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time.

Still, as Poland regained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]], it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million. [[Antisemitism]] was a growing problem throughout Europe in those years, from both the political establishment and the general population.<ref name=\"Hagen-1\"/> Throughout the [[interwar period]], Poland supported Jewish emigration from Poland and, on the international arena, the creation of a Jewish state in [[Palestine]]. The Polish state also supported Jewish paramilitary groups such as the [[Haganah]], [[Betar]], and [[Irgun]], providing them with weapons and training.<ref>\"In 1937, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs viewed the [[League of Nations]] as the right place for manifesting its support for the cause of developing a Jewish state in Palestine.

For example, they could define their neighborhoods and economic competitors and set up monopolies. This made it very attractive for Jewish communities to pick up and move to Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://henryabramson.com/2013/12/05/origins-of-polish-jewry-this-week-in-jewish-history/|title=Origins of Polish Jewry (This Week in Jewish History)|date=5 December 2013|website=Henry Abramson}}</ref>\n\nThe first mention of Jewish settlers in [[P\u0142ock]] dates from 1237, in Kalisz from 1287 and a \u017bydowska (Jewish) street in Krak\u00f3w in 1304.<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n\nThe tolerant situation was gradually altered by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on the one hand, and by the neighboring German states on the other.<ref name=\"Dubnow-1\"/> There were, however, among the reigning princes some determined protectors of the Jewish inhabitants, who considered the presence of the latter most desirable as far as the economic development of the country was concerned. Prominent among such rulers was [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]] of [[Kalisz]], Prince of [[Great Poland]]. With the consent of the class representatives and higher officials, in 1264 he issued a General Charter of Jewish Liberties, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which granted all Jews the freedom of worship, trade and travel. Similar privileges were granted to the Silesian Jews by the local princes, Prince Henry Probus of Wroc\u0142aw in 1273\u201390, Henry of Glogow in 1274 and 1299, Henry of Legnica in 1290 \u2013 95 and Bolko of Legnica and Wroc\u0142aw in 1295.<ref name=polishjews.org/> Article 31 of the Prince Boles\u0142aw of Kalisz's ''privilegium'' tried to rein in the Catholic Church from disseminating [[blood libel]]s against the Jews, by stating: \u201cAccusing Jews of drinking Christian blood is expressly prohibited.

Under his reign, streams of Jewish immigrants headed east to Poland and Jewish settlements are first mentioned as existing in [[Lviv|Lvov]] (1356), [[Sandomierz]] (1367), and [[Kazimierz]] near Krak\u00f3w (1386).<ref name=polishjews.org/> Casimir, who according to a legend had a Jewish lover named [[Esterka]] from [[Opoczno]]<ref name=\"opoczno-1\"/> was especially friendly to the Jews, and his reign is regarded as an era of great prosperity for Polish Jewry, and was nicknamed by his contemporaries \"King of the [[serf]]s and Jews.\" Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]]. Nevertheless, while for the greater part of Casimir\u2019s reign the Jews of Poland enjoyed tranquility, toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the [[Black Death]]. In 1348, the first [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libel]] accusation against Jews in Poland was recorded, and in 1367 the first pogrom took place in [[Pozna\u0144]] (Posen).<ref name=\"Poznan-1\"/><!-- 2008 {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} edited out --> Compared with the pitiless destruction of their co-religionists in [[Western Europe]], however, the Polish Jews did not fare badly; and the Jewish masses of Germany fled to the more hospitable cities in Poland.\n\n===The early Jagiellon era: 1385\u20131505===\n{{main|History of Poland (1385\u20131569)}}\nAs a result of the marriage of [[Jogaila|Wladislaus II]] (Jagie\u0142\u0142o) to [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], daughter of [[Louis I of Hungary]], Lithuania was [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Union|united with the kingdom of Poland]].

However, religious persecution gradually increased, as the dogmatic clergy pushed for less official tolerance, pressured by the [[Jan Hus#Council of Constance|Synod of Constance]]. In 1349 pogroms took place in many towns in Silesia.<ref name=polishjews.org/> There were accusations of [[blood libel]] by the priests, and new riots against the Jews in Pozna\u0144 in 1399. Accusations of blood libel by another fanatic priest led to the riots in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1407, although the royal guard hastened to the rescue.<ref name=\"Dubnow-3\"/> Hysteria caused by Black Death led to additional 14th-century outbreaks of violence against the Jews in [[Kalisz]], Krak\u00f3w and [[Bochnia]]. Traders and artisans jealous of Jewish prosperity, and fearing their rivalry, supported the harassment. In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.<ref name=polishjews.org/> In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls. The most famous of them were Jordan and his son Lewko of Krak\u00f3w in the 14th century and Jakub Slomkowicz of Luck, Wolczko of Drohobycz, Natko of Lvov, Samson of Zydaczow, Josko of Hrubieszow and Szania of Belz in the 15th century. For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soltys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families. More important were crafts for the needs of both their fellow Jews and the Christian population (fur making, tanning, tailoring).<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n[[File:Casimir IV Jagiellon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] confirmed and extended Jewish charters in the second half of the 15th century]]\n\nIn 1454 anti-Jewish riots flared up in [[Bohemia]]'s ethnically-German [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and other [[Silesia]]n cities, inspired by a Franciscan friar, [[John of Capistrano]], who accused Jews of profaning the Christian religion. As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Krak\u00f3w and several other cities, to lesser effect. In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Krak\u00f3w and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz. In the same year, Alexander Jagiellon, following the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|1492 example of Spanish rulers]], banished the Jews from Lithuania.

The latter decreed in 1495 to expel the Jews from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] when he was the Grand Duke of Lithuania but reversed his decision eight years later in 1503 after becoming King of Poland.

Indeed, with the expulsion of the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.\n\nThe most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506\u20131548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548\u20131572), mainly followed his father's tolerant policy and also granted communal-administration autonomy to the Jews and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a \"heaven for the Jews\". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=Sanford/><ref name=EJC/><ref name=\"relations\"/> In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection. In this period Poland-Lithuania became the main center for Ashkenazi Jewry and its ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' achieved fame from the early 16th century.\n\n[[Moses Isserles]] (1520\u20131572), an eminent [[Talmud]]ist of the 16th century, established his [[yeshiva]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. In addition to being a renowned Talmudic and [[halakha|legal scholar]], Isserles was also learned in [[Kabbalah]], and studied history, astronomy, and philosophy. The [[Remuh Synagogue]] was built for him in 1557.

The Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these large-scale atrocities was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], in which [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s Ukrainian [[Cossack]]s massacred tens of thousands of Jews and Catholic Poles in the eastern and southern areas of Polish-occupied Ukraine.<ref>Herman Rosenthal, [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=469&letter=C \"Chmielnicki, Bogdan Zinovi\"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' 1901.</ref> The precise number of dead is not known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during this period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and ''[[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|jasyr]]'' (captivity in the [[Ottoman Empire]]). The Jewish community suffered greatly during the 1648 Ukrainian Cossack uprising which had been directed primarily against the Polish nobility and landlords. The Jews, perceived as allies of the Poles, were also victims of the revolt, during which about 20% of them were killed.\n\n[[File:Neu-er\u00f6ffnete Welt-Galleria Polnischer Jude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Polish Jew in an engraving from 1703]]\n\nRuled by the elected kings of the [[House of Vasa]] since 1587, the embattled Commonwealth was invaded by the [[Swedish Empire]] in 1655 in what became known as [[Deluge (history)|the Deluge]]. The kingdom of Poland which had already suffered from the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] and from the recurring invasions of the Russians, [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], became the scene of even more atrocities. [[Charles X of Sweden]], at the head of his victorious army, overran the cities of Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw. The amount of destruction, pillage and methodical plunder during the [[Siege of Krak\u00f3w (1657)]] was so enormous that parts the city never again recovered.

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. Although Jewish losses in those events were high, the Commonwealth lost one third of its population \u2014 approximately three million of its citizens.\n\nThe environment of the Polish Commonwealth, according to Hundert, profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy. There was no isolation.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} The Jewish dress resembled that of their Polish neighbor. \"Reports of romances, of drinking together in taverns, and of intellectual conversations are quite abundant.\" Wealthy Jews had Polish noblemen at their table, and served meals on silver plates.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} By 1764, there were about 750,000 Jews in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as ''Polania'' or ''Polin'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and as [[transliteration|transliterated]] into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as \"good omens\" because ''Polania'' can be broken down into three Hebrew words: ''po'' (\"here\"), ''lan'' (\"dwells\"), ''ya'' (\"[[Names of God in Judaism|God]]\"), and ''Polin'' into two words of: ''po'' (\"here\") ''lin'' (\"[you should] dwell\"). The \"message\" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu\u2019el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where \"most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel\" (''Divre David;'' 1689).<ref>[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], \"Divre \u0304 David Ture \u0304 Zahav\" (1689) in Hebrew. Published in: Bi-defus Y. Goldman, Warsaw: 1882. Quoted by the YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.</ref>\n\n===Jewish learning===\n[[File:Synagoga Zamo\u015b\u0107 VIII 2010.jpg|thumb|Late-[[Renaissance]] [[Zamo\u015b\u0107 Synagogue|synagogue]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], Poland, 1610\u201320]]\n''[[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]]'' were established, under the direction of the rabbis, in the more prominent communities. Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Krak\u00f3w; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' (\"sharp reasoning\"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500\u20131558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520\u20131572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the \"Code of Jewish Law\"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510\u20131573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].\n\n===The rise of Hasidism===\n[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]\n{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}\nThe decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648\u20131658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false \"Messianic\" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].\n\nIn this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698\u20131760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.\n\n==The Partitions of Poland==\n[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]\nIn 1742 most of Silesia was lost to [[Prussia]]. Further disorder and anarchy reigned supreme in Poland during the second half of the 18th century, from the accession to the throne of its last king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski]] in 1764.

The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' (\"Commission of National Education\"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.\n[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764\u20131809)]]\nA second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on 17 July 1793. Jews, in a Jewish regiment led by [[Berek Joselewicz]], took part in the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] the following year, when the Poles tried to again achieve independence, but were brutally put down. Following the revolt, the third and final partition of Poland took place in 1795. The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815\u20131831).\n\nUnder foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence.

The lands that had once been Poland were to remain the home of many Jews, as, in 1772, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], the ''Tzarina'' of Russia, instituted the [[Pale of Settlement]], restricting Jews to the western parts of the empire, which would eventually include much of Poland, although it excluded some areas in which Jews had previously lived. By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.\n\nTsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion.

The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support. Their living conditions in [[Pale of Settlement|the Pale]] began to dramatically worsen.<ref name=\"Alexander_I\"/>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicolas I]], known by the Jews as \"[[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the Second\", hundreds of new anti-Jewish measures were enacted.<ref name=\"Nicholas_I\"/> The 1827 decree by Nicolas \u2013 while lifting the traditional double taxation on Jews in lieu of army service \u2013 made Jews subject to general military recruitment laws that required Jewish communities to provide 7 recruits per each 1000 \"souls\" every 4 years. Unlike the general population that had to provide recruits between the ages of 18 and 35, Jews had to provide recruits between the ages of 12 and 25, at the [[qahal]]'s discretion.

It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the western Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and with [[Austria-Hungary]].\nThe archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.\n\nWith its large Catholic and Jewish populations, the Pale was acquired by the Russian Empire (which was a majority [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]) in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers between 1791 and 1835, and lasted until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].\n\nFrom 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from  outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.\n\nAlthough the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession.

They included the [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]] of 1906 in the [[Grodno Governorate]] of Russian Poland, in which at least 75 Jews were murdered by marauding soldiers and many more Jews were wounded.

Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] (\"rabbis's law\") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.\n\n===Politics in Polish territory===\n[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]\nBy the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.\n\nMany Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Ko\u015bciuszko Insurrection]] (1794), [[November Insurrection]] (1830\u201331), [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.\n\nDuring the [[Second Polish Republic]] period, there were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.\n\nIn addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.\n\nIn 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as the [[League of East European States]], soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]].

Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from the [[Kresy|eastern part of the country]] are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers.<ref>Samuel D.

A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. As a result of these factors they found it easy after 1939 to participate in the Soviet occupation administration in Eastern Poland, and briefly occupied prominent positions in industry, schools, local government, police and other Soviet-installed institutions.

Initially, almost 140,000 Jews were moved into the ghetto from all parts of Warsaw. At the same time approximately 110,000 Poles had been forcibly evicted from the area.

However, the size of the Ghetto was only about 2.4% of the size of the city. The Germans closed off the Ghetto from the outside world, building a wall around it by 16 November 1940. During the next year and a half, Jews from smaller cities and villages were brought into the Warsaw Ghetto, while diseases (especially [[typhoid]]) and starvation kept the inhabitants at about the same number. Average food rations in 1941 for Jews in Warsaw were limited to 253 kcal, and 669 kcal for Poles, as opposed to 2,613 kcal for Germans. On 22 July 1942, [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|the mass deportation]] of the Warsaw Ghetto inhabitants began.{{sfn|Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs|2014|pp=10\u201314}} During the next fifty-two days (until 12 September 1942) about 300,000 people were transported by freight train to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].

The German forces, which included 2,842 Nazi soldiers and 7,000 security personnel, were not capable of crushing the Jewish resistance in open street combat and after several days, decided to switch strategy by setting buildings on fire in which the Jewish fighters hid. The commander of the \u017bOB, [[Mordechai Anielewicz]], died fighting on 8 May 1943 at the organization's command centre on 18 Mila Street.\n[[File:Gesiowka commemorative plaque at 34 Anielewicza Street.JPG|thumb|left|34 [[Mordechaj Anielewicz]] Street, Warsaw, Poland]]\n\nIt took the Germans twenty-seven days to put down the uprising, after some very heavy fighting. The German general [[J\u00fcrgen Stroop]] in his report stated that his troops had killed 6,065 Jewish fighters during the battle. After the uprising was already over, [[Heinrich Himmler]] had the Great Synagogue on T\u0142omackie Square (outside the ghetto) destroyed as a celebration of German victory and a symbol that the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw was no longer.\n\nA group of fighters escaped from the ghetto through the sewers and reached the Lomianki forest. About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish \"People's Guard\" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto. They hid other Jews, forged necessary documents and were active in the [[Polish underground]] in other parts of Warsaw and surrounding area.\n[[File:Gesiowka.jpg|thumb|right|Freed prisoners of [[G\u0119si\u00f3wka]] and the ''[[Szare Szeregi]]'' fighters after the liberation of the camp in August 1944]]\n\nWarsaw Ghetto Uprising, was followed by other [[Ghetto uprising]]s in many smaller towns and cities across German occupied Poland.

With the decision of [[Nazi Germany]] to begin the [[Final Solution]], the destruction of the Jews of Europe, [[Aktion Reinhard]] began in 1942, with the opening of the extermination camps of Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka, followed by Auschwitz-Birkenau where people were killed in gas chambers and mass executions (death wall).<ref name=\"Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp - Advice from a Tour Guide\"/> Many died from hunger, starvation, disease, torture or by pseudo-medical experiments. The mass deportation of Jews from ghettos to these camps, such as happened at the Warsaw Ghetto, soon followed, and more than 1.7 million Jews were killed at the Aktion Reinhard camps by October 1943 alone.\n\n====The Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto and its uprising====\n{{main|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto}}\n{{further|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising}}\nIn August 1941, the Germans ordered the establishment of a [[ghetto]] in Bia\u0142ystok. About 50,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were confined in a small area of Bia\u0142ystok. The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Bia\u0142a River (Supra\u015bl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.\n\nIn February 1943, approximately 10,000 Bia\u0142ystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.\n\nOn 15 August 1943, the [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie bia\u0142ostockim.

The fighting in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly. As with the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of April 1943, the Bia\u0142ystok uprising had no chances for military success, but it was the second largest [[ghetto uprising]], after the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].

However, the campaign did not resonate well with the Polish public, as most Poles saw similarities between Israel's fight for survival and Poland's past struggles for independence.

At the same time there was an ongoing power struggle within the party itself and the antisemitic campaign was used by one faction against another.

Many historical issues, especially related to World War II and the 1944\u201389 period, suppressed by Communist censorship, have been re-evaluated and publicly discussed (like the Jedwabne pogrom, the [[Koniuchy massacre]], the [[Kielce pogrom]], the [[Auschwitz cross]], and Polish-Jewish wartime relations in general).\n[[File:Rabin Polski.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief Rabbi of Poland \u2013 [[Michael Schudrich]]]]\n\n[[File:Synagoga lesko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lesko Synagogue]], Poland]]\n[[File:Beit Warszawa synagogue interior2006.jpg|thumb|left|Reform [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue]]]]\n\nJewish religious life has been revived with the help of the [[Ronald Lauder Foundation]] and the [[Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture]]. There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]]. The [[Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Poland]] was founded in 1993. Its purpose is the promotion and organization of Jewish religious and cultural activities in Polish communities.\n\nA large number of cities with synagogues include Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], [[Tykocin]], [[Rzesz\u00f3w]], [[Kielce]], or [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria]] although not many of them are still active in their original religious role. Stara Synagoga (\"Old Synagogue\") in Krak\u00f3w, which hosts a Jewish museum, was built in the early 15th century and is the oldest synagogue in Poland. Before the war, the Yeshiva Chachmei in Lublin was Europe's largest. In 2007 it was renovated, dedicated and reopened thanks to the efforts and endowments by Polish Jewry. Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.\n\nThere are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and \"Sztendlach\" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Krak\u00f3w has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience. With funds from the city of Warsaw and the Polish government ($26 million total) a [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] is being built in Warsaw.

At Auschwitz the O\u015bwi\u0119cim State Museum currently houses exhibitions on Nazi crimes with a special section (Block Number 27) specifically focused on Jewish victims and martyrs. At Treblinka there is a monument built out of many shards of broken stone, as well as a mausoluem dedicated to those who perished there. A small mound of human ashes commemorates the 350,000 victims of the Majdanek camp who were killed there by the Nazis. [[Jewish Cemetery, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] is one of the largest Jewish burial grounds in Europe, and preserved historic sites include those located in G\u00f3ra Kalwaria and [[Le\u017cajsk]] ([[Elimelech of Lizhensk|Elimelech's of Lizhensk]] [[ohel (grave)|ohel]]).<ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\nThe Great Synagogue in [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] was excavated after testimony by a Holocaust survivor suggested that many Jewish relics and ritual objects had been buried there, just before Nazis took over the town.

It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].\n\nA memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006. The funds for the memorial came from the city itself and from the [[U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad]].\n\nPolish authors and scholars have published many works about history of Jews in Poland.

For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], thanks to a long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]] which ended with the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the 1939\u20131945 [[German occupation of Poland]] and the ensuing [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]].

Prominent among such rulers was [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]] of [[Kalisz]], Prince of [[Great Poland]]. With the consent of the class representatives and higher officials, in 1264 he issued a General Charter of Jewish Liberties, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which granted all Jews the freedom of worship, trade and travel.

In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.<ref name=polishjews.org/> In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls.

For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soltys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families.

As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Krak\u00f3w and several other cities, to lesser effect. In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Krak\u00f3w and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz.

His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548\u20131572), mainly followed his father's tolerant policy and also granted communal-administration autonomy to the Jews and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community.

According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=Sanford/><ref name=EJC/><ref name=\"relations\"/> In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection.

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. Although Jewish losses in those events were high, the Commonwealth lost one third of its population \u2014 approximately three million of its citizens.\n\nThe environment of the Polish Commonwealth, according to Hundert, profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy. There was no isolation.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} The Jewish dress resembled that of their Polish neighbor. \"Reports of romances, of drinking together in taverns, and of intellectual conversations are quite abundant.\" Wealthy Jews had Polish noblemen at their table, and served meals on silver plates.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} By 1764, there were about 750,000 Jews in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as ''Polania'' or ''Polin'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and as [[transliteration|transliterated]] into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as \"good omens\" because ''Polania'' can be broken down into three Hebrew words: ''po'' (\"here\"), ''lan'' (\"dwells\"), ''ya'' (\"[[Names of God in Judaism|God]]\"), and ''Polin'' into two words of: ''po'' (\"here\") ''lin'' (\"[you should] dwell\"). The \"message\" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu\u2019el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where \"most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel\" (''Divre David;'' 1689).<ref>[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], \"Divre \u0304 David Ture \u0304 Zahav\" (1689) in Hebrew.

Quoted by the YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.</ref>\n\n===Jewish learning===\n[[File:Synagoga Zamo\u015b\u0107 VIII 2010.jpg|thumb|Late-[[Renaissance]] [[Zamo\u015b\u0107 Synagogue|synagogue]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], Poland, 1610\u201320]]\n''[[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]]'' were established, under the direction of the rabbis, in the more prominent communities. Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Krak\u00f3w; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' (\"sharp reasoning\"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500\u20131558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520\u20131572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the \"Code of Jewish Law\"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510\u20131573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].\n\n===The rise of Hasidism===\n[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]\n{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}\nThe decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648\u20131658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false \"Messianic\" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].\n\nIn this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698\u20131760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.\n\n==The Partitions of Poland==\n[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]\nIn 1742 most of Silesia was lost to [[Prussia]]. Further disorder and anarchy reigned supreme in Poland during the second half of the 18th century, from the accession to the throne of its last king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski]] in 1764.

The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' (\"Commission of National Education\"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.\n[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764\u20131809)]]\nA second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on 17 July 1793. Jews, in a Jewish regiment led by [[Berek Joselewicz]], took part in the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] the following year, when the Poles tried to again achieve independence, but were brutally put down. Following the revolt, the third and final partition of Poland took place in 1795. The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815\u20131831).\n\nUnder foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence.

The lands that had once been Poland were to remain the home of many Jews, as, in 1772, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], the ''Tzarina'' of Russia, instituted the [[Pale of Settlement]], restricting Jews to the western parts of the empire, which would eventually include much of Poland, although it excluded some areas in which Jews had previously lived. By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.\n\nTsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion. In 1804, [[Alexander I of Russia]] issued a \"Statute Concerning Jews\",<ref name=\"Alexander_I\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LzFd2W-C6BAC&pg=PA11&dq=%22Alexander+issued+a%22+%22Statute+Concerning+Jews%22#v=onepage&q=%22Alexander%20issued%20a%22%20%22Statute%20Concerning%20Jews%22&f=false |title= The Cantonists: the Jewish children's army of the Tsar |publisher=Devora Publishing |year=2003 |accessdate=11 March 2012 |first=Larry |last=Domnitch |page=11 |isbn=1-930143-85-0}}</ref> meant to accelerate the process of assimilation of the Empire's new Jewish population. The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support. Their living conditions in [[Pale of Settlement|the Pale]] began to dramatically worsen.<ref name=\"Alexander_I\"/>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicolas I]], known by the Jews as \"[[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the Second\", hundreds of new anti-Jewish measures were enacted.<ref name=\"Nicholas_I\"/> The 1827 decree by Nicolas \u2013 while lifting the traditional double taxation on Jews in lieu of army service \u2013 made Jews subject to general military recruitment laws that required Jewish communities to provide 7 recruits per each 1000 \"souls\" every 4 years. Unlike the general population that had to provide recruits between the ages of 18 and 35, Jews had to provide recruits between the ages of 12 and 25, at the [[qahal]]'s discretion. Thus between 1827 and 1857 over 30,000 children were placed in the so-called [[Cantonist]] schools, where they were pressured to convert.<ref>{{cite book |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Jews_In_The_Russian_Army_1827_1917.html?id=9NoMdyNVtBYC |title=Jews in the Russian Army, 1827\u20131917: Drafted Into Modernity |author=\u012cokhanan Petrovski\u012d-Shtern |publisher=Cambridge University Press |via=Books.google.com |accessdate=26 March 2013|isbn = 9780521515733}}</ref> \"Many children were smuggled to Poland, where the conscription of Jews did not take effect until 1844.\"<ref name=\"Nicholas_I\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzFd2W-C6BAC&lpg=PA13&dq=%22Tsar%20Nicholas%20enacted%20hundreds%20of%20anti-Jewish%20measures.%22&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q=%22Tsar%20Nicholas%20enacted%20hundreds%20of%20anti-Jewish%20measures.%22&f=false |title=''The Cantonists: the Jewish children's army of the Tsar'' |year=2003 |accessdate=11 March 2012 |first=Larry |last=Domnitch |pages=12\u201315|isbn=9781930143852 }}</ref>\n{{details|topic=the Garrison schools for male children|Cantonist}}\n\n===Pale of Settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Map showing the percentage of Jews in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland, The Jewish Encyclopedia (1905).jpg|thumb|Map of [[Pale of Settlement]], showing Jewish population densities]]\nThe ''[[Pale of Settlement]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0301 \u043e\u0441\u0435\u0301\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438}}, {{transl|ru|chert\u00e1 os\u00e9dlosti}}, {{lang-yi|\u05ea\u05bc\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd-\u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05bf}}, {{transl|yi|tkhum-ha-moysh\u0259v}}, {{lang-he|\u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05d7\u05d5\u05bc\u05dd \u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05b8\u05d1}}, {{transl|he|t\u1e25\u00f9m ha-mosh\u00e1v}}) was the term given to a region of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in which permanent residency by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews]] was allowed and beyond which Jewish permanent residency was generally prohibited.  It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the western Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and with [[Austria-Hungary]].\nThe archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.\n\nWith its large Catholic and Jewish populations, the Pale was acquired by the Russian Empire (which was a majority [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]) in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers between 1791 and 1835, and lasted until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].\n\nFrom 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from  outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.\n\nAlthough the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession. The existing [[status quo]] was shattered with the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Alexander]] in 1881 \u2013 an act falsely blamed upon the Jews.\n\n===Pogroms in the Russian Empire===\n[[File:Pogrom bialystok.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Russian Army]] assailant in 1906 [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]]]]\nThe assassination prompted a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called ''[[pogroms]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0301\u043c}};) throughout 1881\u20131884.

In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates [[Katowice Conference|met in Katowice]], forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement.

Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] (\"rabbis's law\") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.\n\n===Politics in Polish territory===\n[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]\nBy the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.\n\nMany Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Ko\u015bciuszko Insurrection]] (1794), [[November Insurrection]] (1830\u201331), [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.\n\nDuring the [[Second Polish Republic]] period, there were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.\n\nIn addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.\n\nIn 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression.

The [[YIVO]] (Jidiszer Wissenszaftlecher Institute) Scientific Institute was based in Wilno before transferring to New York during the war. In Warsaw, important centers of Judaic scholarship, such the [[Main Judaic Library]] and the Institute of Judaic Studies were located, along with numerous Talmudic Schools (Jeszybots), religious centers and synagogues, many of which were of high architectural quality. [[Yiddish theatre]] also flourished; Poland had fifteen Yiddish theatres and theatrical groups. Warsaw was home to the most important Yiddish theater troupe of the time, the [[Vilna Troupe]], which staged the first performance of ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' in 1920 at the Elyseum Theatre. Some future Israeli leaders studied at [[University of Warsaw]], including [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]].\n\nThere also were several Jewish sports clubs, with some of them, such as [[Hasmonea Lwow]] and [[Jutrzenka Krak\u00f3w]], winning promotion to the [[Ekstraklasa|Polish First Football League]]. A Polish-Jewish footballer, [[J\u00f3zef Klotz]], scored the first ever goal for the [[Poland national football team]].

This had been declared  at the League by Foreign Minister J\u00f3zef Beck.11 He also supported the idea of an international conference and campaign for organizing and facilitating Jewish emigration.12 Talks were held with British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], and in the US, with President Franklin D.

Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from the [[Kresy|eastern part of the country]] are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers.<ref>Samuel D.

A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. As a result of these factors they found it easy after 1939 to participate in the Soviet occupation administration in Eastern Poland, and briefly occupied prominent positions in industry, schools, local government, police and other Soviet-installed institutions.

Initially, almost 140,000 Jews were moved into the ghetto from all parts of Warsaw. At the same time approximately 110,000 Poles had been forcibly evicted from the area.

However, the size of the Ghetto was only about 2.4% of the size of the city. The Germans closed off the Ghetto from the outside world, building a wall around it by 16 November 1940. During the next year and a half, Jews from smaller cities and villages were brought into the Warsaw Ghetto, while diseases (especially [[typhoid]]) and starvation kept the inhabitants at about the same number. Average food rations in 1941 for Jews in Warsaw were limited to 253 kcal, and 669 kcal for Poles, as opposed to 2,613 kcal for Germans. On 22 July 1942, [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|the mass deportation]] of the Warsaw Ghetto inhabitants began.{{sfn|Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs|2014|pp=10\u201314}} During the next fifty-two days (until 12 September 1942) about 300,000 people were transported by freight train to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].

The German forces, which included 2,842 Nazi soldiers and 7,000 security personnel, were not capable of crushing the Jewish resistance in open street combat and after several days, decided to switch strategy by setting buildings on fire in which the Jewish fighters hid. The commander of the \u017bOB, [[Mordechai Anielewicz]], died fighting on 8 May 1943 at the organization's command centre on 18 Mila Street.\n[[File:Gesiowka commemorative plaque at 34 Anielewicza Street.JPG|thumb|left|34 [[Mordechaj Anielewicz]] Street, Warsaw, Poland]]\n\nIt took the Germans twenty-seven days to put down the uprising, after some very heavy fighting. The German general [[J\u00fcrgen Stroop]] in his report stated that his troops had killed 6,065 Jewish fighters during the battle. After the uprising was already over, [[Heinrich Himmler]] had the Great Synagogue on T\u0142omackie Square (outside the ghetto) destroyed as a celebration of German victory and a symbol that the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw was no longer.\n\nA group of fighters escaped from the ghetto through the sewers and reached the Lomianki forest. About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish \"People's Guard\" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto. They hid other Jews, forged necessary documents and were active in the [[Polish underground]] in other parts of Warsaw and surrounding area.\n[[File:Gesiowka.jpg|thumb|right|Freed prisoners of [[G\u0119si\u00f3wka]] and the ''[[Szare Szeregi]]'' fighters after the liberation of the camp in August 1944]]\n\nWarsaw Ghetto Uprising, was followed by other [[Ghetto uprising]]s in many smaller towns and cities across German occupied Poland.

Warsaw was razed to the ground by the Germans and more than 150,000 Poles were sent to labor or concentration camps. On 17 January 1945, the [[Soviet Army]] entered a destroyed and nearly uninhabited Warsaw. Some 300 Jews were found hiding in the ruins in the Polish part of the city (''see:'' [[Wladyslaw Szpilman]]).\n[[File:Ghetto Uprising Warsaw2.jpg|thumb|The [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943 saw the destruction of what remained of the Ghetto]]\n\nThe fate of the Warsaw Ghetto was similar to that of the other ghettos in which Jews were concentrated. With the decision of [[Nazi Germany]] to begin the [[Final Solution]], the destruction of the Jews of Europe, [[Aktion Reinhard]] began in 1942, with the opening of the extermination camps of Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka, followed by Auschwitz-Birkenau where people were killed in gas chambers and mass executions (death wall).<ref name=\"Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp - Advice from a Tour Guide\"/> Many died from hunger, starvation, disease, torture or by pseudo-medical experiments. The mass deportation of Jews from ghettos to these camps, such as happened at the Warsaw Ghetto, soon followed, and more than 1.7 million Jews were killed at the Aktion Reinhard camps by October 1943 alone.\n\n====The Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto and its uprising====\n{{main|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto}}\n{{further|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising}}\nIn August 1941, the Germans ordered the establishment of a [[ghetto]] in Bia\u0142ystok. About 50,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were confined in a small area of Bia\u0142ystok. The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Bia\u0142a River (Supra\u015bl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.\n\nIn February 1943, approximately 10,000 Bia\u0142ystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.\n\nOn 15 August 1943, the [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie bia\u0142ostockim.

The fighting in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly. As with the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of April 1943, the Bia\u0142ystok uprising had no chances for military success, but it was the second largest [[ghetto uprising]], after the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. Several dozen guerrillas managed to break through to the forests surrounding Bia\u0142ystok where they joined the partisan units of [[Armia Krajowa]] and other organisations and survived the war.\n\n==Communist rule: 1945\u20131989==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n\n===Number of Holocaust survivors===\nThe estimates of Polish Jews before the war vary from slightly under 3 million to almost 3.5 million ([[Polish census of 1931|the last nationwide census was conducted in 1931]]).<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nThe number of Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust is difficult to ascertain.

Many Poles also felt pride in the success of the Israeli military, which was dominated by Polish Jews. The slogan \"our Jews beat the Soviet Arabs\" (Nasi \u017bydzi pobili sowieckich Arab\u00f3w) became popular in Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wprost.pl/tygodnik/13189/Wojna-zastepcza.html|title=Wojna zast\u0119pcza|first=\u0141ukasz|last=Kami\u0144ski|date=9 June 2002|website=WPROST.pl}}</ref><ref>[http://prawy.pl/r2_index.php?dz=felietony&id=37395&subdz=] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602202347/http://prawy.pl/r2_index.php?dz=felietony&id=37395&subdz=|date=2 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of the 40,000 Jews in Poland by the late 1960s were completely assimilated into the broader society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} However, this did not prevent them from becoming victims of a campaign, centrally organized by the Polish Communist Party, with Soviet backing, which equated Jewish origins with \"Zionism\" and disloyalty to a Socialist Poland.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kunicki|first=Mikolaj|date=1 May 2015|title=The Red and the Brown: Boles\u0142aw Piasecki, the Polish Communists, and the Anti-Zionist Campaign in Poland, 1967-68|url=|journal=East European Politics and Societies|volume=19|issue=2|pages=185\u2013225|via=SAGE|doi=10.1177/0888325404270673}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1968 student-led demonstrations in Warsaw (''see [[Polish 1968 political crisis]]'') gave Gomu\u0142ka's government an excuse to try and channel public anti-government sentiment into another avenue. Thus his security chief, [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]], used the situation as a pretext to launch an antisemitic press campaign (although the expression \"Zionist\" was officially used). The state-sponsored \"anti-Zionist\" campaign resulted in the removal of Jews from the [[Polish United Worker's Party]] and from teaching positions in schools and universities. In 1967\u20131971 under economic, political and secret police pressure, over 14,000 Polish Jews chose to leave Poland and relinquish their Polish citizenship.<ref name=\"Steinman2013\">{{cite book|author=Louise Steinman|title=The Crooked Mirror: A Memoir of Polish-Jewish Reconciliation|url=https://archive.org/details/crookedmirrormem0000stei|url-access=registration|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-5056-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/crookedmirrormem0000stei/page/134 134]}}</ref> Officially, it was said that they chose to go to Israel. However, only about 4,000 actually went there; most settled throughout [[Europe]] and in the [[United States]]. The leaders of the Communist party tried to stifle the ongoing protests and unrest by scapegoating the Jews. At the same time there was an ongoing power struggle within the party itself and the antisemitic campaign was used by one faction against another. The so-called \"Partisan\" faction blamed the Jews who had held office during the Stalinist period for the excesses that had occurred, but the end result was that most of the remaining Polish Jews, regardless of their background or political affiliation, were targeted by the communist authorities.<ref>AP Online, \"Some Jewish exiles to have Polish citizenship restored this week\", 3 October 1998, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110812044919/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19804342.html]</ref>\n\nThere were several outcomes of the ''[[March 1968 events]]''. The campaign damaged Poland's reputation abroad, particularly in the U.S. Many Polish intellectuals, however, were disgusted at the promotion of official antisemitism and opposed the campaign. Some of the people who emigrated to the West at this time founded organizations which encouraged anti-Communist opposition inside Poland.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nFirst attempts to improve Polish-Israeli relations began in the mid-1970s. Poland was the first of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries to restore diplomatic relations with Israel after these have been broken off right after the Six-Day's War.<ref name=\"relations\"/> In 1986 [[Israel\u2013Poland relations|partial diplomatic relations with Israel]] were restored,<ref name=relations/> and full relations were restored in 1990 as soon as communism fell.\n\nDuring the late 1970s some Jewish activists were engaged in the anti-Communist opposition groups. Most prominent among them, [[Adam Michnik]] (founder of ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'') was one of the founders of the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (KOR). By the time of the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989, only 5,000\u201310,000 Jews remained in the country, many of them preferring to conceal their Jewish origin.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Since 1989==\n{{main|History of Poland (1989\u2013present)}}\n{{Details|Jewish Polish history (1989\u2013present)}}\nWith the fall of communism in Poland, Jewish cultural, social, and religious life has been undergoing a revival. Many historical issues, especially related to World War II and the 1944\u201389 period, suppressed by Communist censorship, have been re-evaluated and publicly discussed (like the Jedwabne pogrom, the [[Koniuchy massacre]], the [[Kielce pogrom]], the [[Auschwitz cross]], and Polish-Jewish wartime relations in general).\n[[File:Rabin Polski.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief Rabbi of Poland \u2013 [[Michael Schudrich]]]]\n\n[[File:Synagoga lesko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lesko Synagogue]], Poland]]\n[[File:Beit Warszawa synagogue interior2006.jpg|thumb|left|Reform [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue]]]]\n\nJewish religious life has been revived with the help of the [[Ronald Lauder Foundation]] and the [[Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture]]. There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]]. The [[Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Poland]] was founded in 1993. Its purpose is the promotion and organization of Jewish religious and cultural activities in Polish communities.\n\nA large number of cities with synagogues include Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], [[Tykocin]], [[Rzesz\u00f3w]], [[Kielce]], or [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria]] although not many of them are still active in their original religious role. Stara Synagoga (\"Old Synagogue\") in Krak\u00f3w, which hosts a Jewish museum, was built in the early 15th century and is the oldest synagogue in Poland. Before the war, the Yeshiva Chachmei in Lublin was Europe's largest. In 2007 it was renovated, dedicated and reopened thanks to the efforts and endowments by Polish Jewry. Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.\n\nThere are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and \"Sztendlach\" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Krak\u00f3w has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience. With funds from the city of Warsaw and the Polish government ($26 million total) a [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] is being built in Warsaw. The building was designed by the Finnish architect Rainer Mahlam\u00e4ki.<ref name=\"JVL\" />\n\n[[File:March of the living-in-auschwitz.jpg|thumb|upright|2005 [[March of the Living]]]]\n\nFormer extermination camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek and Treblinka are open to visitors. At Auschwitz the O\u015bwi\u0119cim State Museum currently houses exhibitions on Nazi crimes with a special section (Block Number 27) specifically focused on Jewish victims and martyrs. At Treblinka there is a monument built out of many shards of broken stone, as well as a mausoluem dedicated to those who perished there. A small mound of human ashes commemorates the 350,000 victims of the Majdanek camp who were killed there by the Nazis. [[Jewish Cemetery, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] is one of the largest Jewish burial grounds in Europe, and preserved historic sites include those located in G\u00f3ra Kalwaria and [[Le\u017cajsk]] ([[Elimelech of Lizhensk|Elimelech's of Lizhensk]] [[ohel (grave)|ohel]]).<ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\nThe Great Synagogue in [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] was excavated after testimony by a Holocaust survivor suggested that many Jewish relics and ritual objects had been buried there, just before Nazis took over the town. Candelabras, chandeliers, a menorah and a [[Ner Tamid|ner tamid]] were found and can now be seen at the Auschwitz Jewish Center.<ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\nThe [[Warsaw Ghetto Memorial]] was unveiled on 19 April 1948\u2014the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw ghetto Uprising. It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].\n\nA memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006. The funds for the memorial came from the city itself and from the [[U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad]].\n\nPolish authors and scholars have published many works about history of Jews in Poland. Notable among them are the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]'s [[Holocaust studies]] journal {{ill|Zag\u0142ada \u017byd\u00f3w. Studia i Materia\u0142y|pl|Zag\u0142ada \u017byd\u00f3w.

The synagogue, the sole synagogue in O\u015bwi\u0119cim to survive World War II and an adjacent Jewish cultural and educational center, provide visitors a place to pray and to learn about the active pre\u2013World War II Jewish community that existed in O\u015bwi\u0119cim. The synagogue was the first communal property in the country to be returned to the Jewish community under the 1997 law allowing for restitution of Jewish communal property.<ref name=\"Poland, International Religious Freedom Report\"/></blockquote>\nThe [[March of the Living]] is an annual event in April held since 1988 to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust.

While acting out the scene, Moomin spots Mymble struggling to swim ashore and dives into the ocean to save her from drowning. Spotting the shipwreck, the Moomins decide to go and salvage what they can, taking a mirror, books, a chest of tropical seeds and several crates of fireworks, but leaving the chest of gold. Little My (who stayed in the ship's crows nest) eventually follows the family home from the ship on the back of a shark. The pirates follow the family back to Moominhouse upon spotting them with their cargo, but leave after discovering their gold is still on the ship, which has begun to sink.\n\nAt night, Snorkmaiden suggests going to the Riviera after reading a magazine with her idol, Audrey Glamour. The Moomins, Snorkmaiden and Little My set sail, but get lost in a storm and wind up on a deserted island. A box floats ashore containing thousands of bugs uttering insults and bad language, which the group gathers into a bag to take with them. At night, Snorkmaiden notices the lights of the Riviera not too far away from their location, and the family arrive on the shores the next morning.\n\nWhile exploring the town, the family arrive at The Grand, the Riviera's resort hotel. Moominpappa introduces the family as \"DeMoomin of Moominvalley\", and are offered the Royal Suite to stay in. The family struggles to fit in among the affluent residents, however Moominpappa soon becomes friends with Marquis Mongaga, an artist whom admires his bohemian eccentricity, and Snorkmaiden begins to spend her time with Audrey Glamour, and playboy Clark Tresco, much to Moomin's dislike. Moomin and Moominmamma, both feeling that they don't fit into the rich lifestyle, decide to go and live under their boat on the beach. \n\nMongaga invites Moominpappa to his mansion where he shows him his art, consisting of walking elephant sculptures, and admits to him that he would gladly give up his rich lifestyle to live a bohemian lifestyle like Moominpappa. After pushing the statue of the town governor into the river and replacing it with one of the elephant statues, Mongaga comes to temporarily live with the Moomin family at the beach, where he carves more of his sculptures, and inspires Moomin to create a sculpture of his own. After sleeping rough and being attacked by a resident's dogs, Mongaga decides to depart back to his home, thanking the Moomins' for their hospitality and leaving his statues as a parting gift.\n\nMoomin, fed up with seeing Clark with Snorkmaiden, challenges him to a duel the next morning for Snorkmaiden's love. While not adept with the sword, Moomin ultimately triumphs after bashing Clark on the head with the hilt. The directors of the hotel decide to evict the Moomin family as their eccentricity has made the reputation of the hotel suffer. Ordered to pay for their stay with a hefty bill, the family try to pay with Mongaga's elephant states, which are deemed worthless due to how many of them exist. Snork Maiden decides to use her stashed casino winnings in order to pay their bill. Her money greatly exceeds that of the bill, but she allows the hotel to keep the money. That evening, Snorkmaiden finds Moomin's statue, a sculpture of her as a mermaid, and the two embrace.\n\nMoominpappa decides to give homes to Mongaga's elephant statues, and Moominmamma makes her tropical rock garden open to the public. Upon arriving at the town hall with a statue, the Mayor realises that Moominpappa was responsible for pushing the Governor's statue into the river and orders his arrest. After being chased through the town by the police, Moominpappa and the rest of the family quickly set sail. Moominmomma releases the bugs from the bag to halt the officers, which quickly swarm over the town with a plague of insults and bad language, causing fights among the residents.\n\nThe Moomin family get caught in a storm on their way back to Moominvalley, and decide to jetson some of their pots of tropical plants to lighten the load, inadvertently including Moomin's statue. Lost in the fog, with the plants still on board having overgrown into full trees, the family are eventually found and brought back to land by Snufkin.

While acting out the scene, Moomin spots Mymble struggling to swim ashore and dives into the ocean to save her from drowning. Spotting the shipwreck, the Moomins decide to go and salvage what they can, taking a mirror, books, a chest of tropical seeds and several crates of fireworks, but leaving the chest of gold. Little My (who stayed in the ship's crows nest) eventually follows the family home from the ship on the back of a shark. The pirates follow the family back to Moominhouse upon spotting them with their cargo, but leave after discovering their gold is still on the ship, which has begun to sink.\n\nAt night, Snorkmaiden suggests going to the Riviera after reading a magazine with her idol, Audrey Glamour. The Moomins, Snorkmaiden and Little My set sail, but get lost in a storm and wind up on a deserted island. A box floats ashore containing thousands of bugs uttering insults and bad language, which the group gathers into a bag to take with them. At night, Snorkmaiden notices the lights of the Riviera not too far away from their location, and the family arrive on the shores the next morning.\n\nWhile exploring the town, the family arrive at The Grand, the Riviera's resort hotel. Moominpappa introduces the family as \"DeMoomin of Moominvalley\", and are offered the Royal Suite to stay in. The family struggles to fit in among the affluent residents, however Moominpappa soon becomes friends with Marquis Mongaga, an artist whom admires his bohemian eccentricity, and Snorkmaiden begins to spend her time with Audrey Glamour, and playboy Clark Tresco, much to Moomin's dislike. Moomin and Moominmamma, both feeling that they don\u2019t fit into the rich lifestyle, decide to go and live under their boat on the beach. \n\nMongaga invites Moominpappa to his mansion where he shows him his art, consisting of walking elephant sculptures, and admits to him that he would gladly give up his rich lifestyle to live a bohemian lifestyle like Moominpappa. After pushing the statue of the town governor into the river and replacing it with one of the elephant statues, Mongaga comes to temporarily live with the Moomin family at the beach, where he carves more of his sculptures, and inspires Moomin to create a sculpture of his own. After sleeping rough and being attacked by a resident\u2019s dogs, Mongaga decides to depart back to his home, thanking the Moomins' for their hospitality and leaving his statues as a parting gift.\n\nMoomin, fed up with seeing Clark with Snorkmaiden, challenges him to a duel the next morning for Snorkmaiden\u2019s love. While not adept with the sword, Moomin ultimately triumphs after bashing Clark on the head with the hilt. The directors of the hotel decide to evict the Moomin family as their eccentricity has made the reputation of the hotel suffer. Ordered to pay for their stay with a hefty bill, the family try to pay with Mongaga\u2019s elephant states, which are deemed worthless due to how many of them exist. Snork Maiden decides to use her stashed casino winnings in order to pay their bill. Her money greatly exceeds that of the bill, but she allows the hotel to keep the money. That evening, Snorkmaiden finds Moomin\u2019s statue, a sculpture of her as a mermaid, and the two embrace.\n\nMoominpappa decides to give homes to Mongaga\u2019s elephant statues, and Moominmamma makes her tropical rock garden open to the public. Upon arriving at the town hall with a statue, the Mayor realises that Moominpappa was responsible for pushing the Governor\u2019s statue into the river and orders his arrest. After being chased through the town by the police, Moominpappa and the rest of the family quickly set sail. Moominmomma releases the bugs from the bag to halt the officers, which quickly swarm over the town with a plague of insults and bad language, causing fights among the residents.\n\nThe Moomin family get caught in a storm on their way back to Moominvalley, and decide to jetson some of their pots of tropical plants to lighten the load, inadvertently including Moomin\u2019s statue. Lost in the fog, with the plants still on board having overgrown into full trees, the family are eventually found and brought back to land by Snufkin. The family go back to their peaceful lives in Moominvalley, and Moomin and Snorkmaiden embrace on the cliffside while flying kites with Mymble and Little My.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Role\n!English version\n!Finnish and Swedish version\n|-\n| [[Moomintroll|Moomin]] || [[Russell Tovey]] || [[Kris Gummerus]]\n|-\n| [[Moominpappa]] || [[Nathaniel Parker]] || [[Mats L\u00e5ngbacka]]\n|-\n| [[Moominmamma]] || [[Tracy Ann Oberman]] || [[Maria Sid]]\n|-\n| [[Snorkmaiden]] || [[Stephanie Winiecki]] || [[Alma P\u00f6ysti]]\n|-\n| [[Little My]] || [[Ruth Gibson]] || [[Ragni Gr\u00f6nblom]]\n|-\n| Marquis Mongaga || [[Philippe Smolikowski]] || [[Carl-Kristian Rundman]]\n|-\n| Clark Tresco || Dave Browne || [[Christoffer Strandberg]]\n|-\n| Audrey Glamour || [[Shelley Blond]] || [[Irina Bj\u00f6rklund]]\n|-\n| [[Snufkin]] || [[Dominic Frisby]] || [[CG Wentzel]]\n|-\n| [[The Mymble's Daughter]] || Alison O'Donnell || [[Beata Harju]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional roles from the English version of the film are played by [[Dominic Frisby]], who also co-directed the English dialogue,<ref>* {{IMDb title|2371399|Moomins on the Riviera}}</ref> Ian Conningham, Alison O\u2019Donnell, [[Bernard Alane]], Bruno Magnes, Andy Turvey, Kris Gummerus, Glyn Welden Banks, Lee Willis, [[Sanna-June Hyde]], Christopher Sloan and Leslie Hyde.

It was a decisive victory for the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the Persians consequently lost the surrounding cities including Spahan (renamed [[Isfahan]]).\n\nThe former [[Sassanid]] provinces, in alliance with [[Parthia]]n and [[Hephthalite|White Hun]] nobles, resisted for a few more years in the region south of the [[Caspian Sea]], even as the Rashidun Caliphate was replaced by the [[Umayyad]]s, thus perpetuating the Sassanid court styles, Zoroastrian religion, and Persian speech.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the time of the death of the Islamic [[Prophet Muhammad]] in 632, the religion that he led dominated the [[Hejaz]] (western Arabia). Under the first two caliphs [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], Islam expanded into Palestine and Mesopotamia where it respectively confronted the East Roman and Persian (S\u0101s\u0101nian) empires. Both were exhausted by warfare and internal dissent. With the East Roman defeat at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] (636), the Muslim Arabs were free to turn east to the Euphrates and the Persian heartland.<ref>{{cite book|first=Geoffrey|last=Barraclough|pages=104-105|title=The Times Atlas of World History|ISBN=0-7230-0161-8}}</ref> In November 636 a S\u0101s\u0101nian army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Qadisiya]], resulting in the loss of Iraq to the Muslims.\n\n== Number of Arab and Sasanian forces ==\nFollowing defeat by the Arabs in 639, the \"King of Kings\" [[Yazdgerd III]] was forced to abandon his capital at [[Ctesiphon]]. From [[Mesopotamia]] he withdrew into the S\u0101s\u0101nian homeland in what is now the southern plateau of Iran. There he was able to assemble an army to replace that lost at Qadisiya.<ref>Khodadad Rezakhani \"Arab Conquests and Sasanian Iran\", pages 35-36 ''History Today'' April 2007</ref>\n\nAt Nah\u0101vand an estimated 30,000 Arab warriors, under the command of Nu\u02bfm\u0101n, attacked a S\u0101s\u0101nian army reportedly of ca. 100,000 men. The S\u0101s\u0101nian troops, commanded by F\u012br\u016bzan, were entrenched in a strong fortified position. After an indecisive skirmish, Nu\u02bfm\u0101n pretended to be defeated and withdrew from the battlefield. F\u012br\u016bzan then abandoned his position and pursued his foe. The pursuit proved to be a major tactical error because the S\u0101s\u0101nians were forced to fight on unfavourable ground; the S\u0101s\u0101nian army, caught between two mountain defiles, was massacred by the Arabs. Both Nu\u02bfm\u0101n and F\u012br\u016bzan died in the battle, and Persian casualties were said to have numbered about 38,000.\n\n== Battle ==\nVarious accounts are told about Nah\u0101vand and the early stages of the battle. According to some versions the [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]] managed to deceive the Persians through the ruse of spreading a false report that Caliph [[Umar|Omar]] had died. The Persian cavalry mounted an ill-prepared pursuit of the [[Rashidun army|Arabs]] who retreated to a more secure location. The Arabs then rallied, before surrounding and trapping the Persian force. Finally the Muslim warriors assaulted the S\u0101s\u0101nian host from all sides and decisively defeated it.\n\nAccording to a different version the Arab commander [[An-Numan ibn Muqarrin|Nu\u02bfm\u0101n]] was able to outmaneuver his S\u0101s\u0101nian counterpart [[Piruz Khosrow|F\u012br\u016bzan]] through the use of superior tactics rather than misleading rumors. The numerically superior Persians had been deployed in a strong defensive position. This would not normally have been a strategy favored by the loosely disciplined S\u0101s\u0101nian forces; drawn from decentralized sources and led by an alliance of feudal nobles. Nu\u02bfm\u0101n was accordingly able to draw out the Persians from their vantage point by skirmishing advances and then a general but cohesive retreat. During the S\u0101s\u0101nian pursuit F\u012br\u016bzan found his horsemen caught in extended order across a rough landscape and narrow passes. The highly motivated and well-mounted Muslims then rallied and counterattacked, inflicting very heavy losses on the disorganized Persians. Both Nu\u02bfm\u0101n and F\u012br\u016bzan were reportedly killed in the final melee but the S\u0101s\u0101nian defeat was total.\n\nAs the historian Tabari notes, the Persians were never again able to unite their forces in such numbers. Many of the S\u0101s\u0101nian nobles were already considering deserting the Empire even before the battle commenced. Many of Yazdegerd's military and civilian officials had already abandoned him.<ref>Iranian History and Politics: The Dialectic of State and Society By Homa Katouzian, pg. 25</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nNah\u0101vand marked the dissolution of the Sasanian Imperial army, with the fall of the last of the grand marshals of the army and the rise of [[warlord]]ism among the Persians. The Emperor Yazdegerd III attempted to raise troops by appealing to other neighbouring areas such as the princes of Tukharistan and [[Sogdia]] and eventually sent his son [[Peroz III]] to the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] court, but without any success.\n\nYezdegerd hurriedly fled towards the east where he was ill-treated by several Marzban (provincial governors) in the north as well as in [[Merv]], where the governor Mahoye openly showed his hostility to the Emperor.

It was a decisive victory for the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the Persians consequently lost the surrounding cities including Spahan (renamed [[Isfahan]]).\n\nThe former [[Sassanid]] provinces, in alliance with [[Parthia]]n and [[Hephthalite|White Hun]] nobles, resisted for a few more years in the region south of the [[Caspian Sea]], even as the Rashidun Caliphate was replaced by the [[Umayyad]]s, thus perpetuating the Sassanid court styles, Zoroastrian religion, and Persian speech.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the time of the death of the Islamic [[Prophet Muhammad]] in 632, the religion that he led dominated the [[Hejaz]] (western Arabia). Under the first two caliphs [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], Islam expanded into Palestine and Mesopotamia where it respectively confronted the East Roman and Persian (S\u0101s\u0101nian) empires. Both were exhausted by warfare and internal dissent. With the East Roman defeat at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] (636), the Muslim Arabs were free to turn east to the Euphrates and the Persian heartland.<ref>{{cite book|first=Geoffrey|last=Barraclough|pages=104-105|title=The Times Atlas of World History|ISBN=0-7230-0161-8}}</ref> In November 636 a S\u0101s\u0101nian army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Qadisiya]], resulting in the loss of Iraq to the Muslims.\n\n== Number of Arab and Sasanian forces ==\nFollowing defeat by the Arabs in 639, the \"King of Kings\" [[Yazdgerd III]] was forced to abandon his capital at [[Ctesiphon]]. From [[Mesopotamia]] he withdrew into the S\u0101s\u0101nian homeland in what is now the southern plateau of Iran. There he was able to assemble an army to replace that lost at Qadisiya.<ref>Khodadad Rezakhani \"Arab Conquests and Sasanian Iran\", pages 35-36 ''History Today'' April 2007</ref>\n\nAt Nah\u0101vand an estimated 30,000 Arab warriors, under the command of Nu\u02bfm\u0101n, attacked a S\u0101s\u0101nian army reportedly of ca. 100,000 men. The S\u0101s\u0101nian troops, commanded by F\u012br\u016bzan, were entrenched in a strong fortified position. After an indecisive skirmish, Nu\u02bfm\u0101n pretended to be defeated and withdrew from the battlefield. F\u012br\u016bzan then abandoned his position and pursued his foe. The pursuit proved to be a major tactical error because the S\u0101s\u0101nians were forced to fight on unfavourable ground; the S\u0101s\u0101nian army, caught between two mountain defiles, was massacred by the Arabs. Both Nu\u02bfm\u0101n and F\u012br\u016bzan died in the battle, and Persian casualties were said to have numbered about 38,000.\n\n== Battle ==\nVarious accounts are told about Nah\u0101vand and the early stages of the battle. According to some versions the [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]] managed to deceive the Persians through the ruse of spreading a false report that Caliph [[Umar|Omar]] had died. The Persian cavalry mounted an ill-prepared pursuit of the [[Rashidun army|Arabs]] who retreated to a more secure location. The Arabs then rallied, before surrounding and trapping the Persian force. Finally the Muslim warriors assaulted the S\u0101s\u0101nian host from all sides and decisively defeated it.\n\nAccording to a different version the Arab commander [[An-Numan ibn Muqarrin|Nu\u02bfm\u0101n]] was able to outmaneuver his S\u0101s\u0101nian counterpart [[Piruz Khosrow|F\u012br\u016bzan]] through the use of superior tactics rather than misleading rumors. The numerically superior Persians had been deployed in a strong defensive position. This would not normally have been a strategy favored by the loosely disciplined S\u0101s\u0101nian forces; drawn from decentralized sources and led by an alliance of feudal nobles. Nu\u02bfm\u0101n was accordingly able to draw out the Persians from their vantage point by skirmishing advances and then a general but cohesive retreat. During the S\u0101s\u0101nian pursuit F\u012br\u016bzan found his horsemen caught in extended order across a rough landscape and narrow passes. The highly motivated and well-mounted Muslims then rallied and counterattacked, inflicting very heavy losses on the disorganized Persians. Both Nu\u02bfm\u0101n and F\u012br\u016bzan were reportedly killed in the final melee but the S\u0101s\u0101nian defeat was total.\n\nAs the historian Tabari notes, the Persians were never again able to unite their forces in such numbers. Many of the S\u0101s\u0101nian nobles were already considering deserting the Empire even before the battle commenced. Many of Yazdegerd's military and civilian officials had already abandoned him.<ref>Iranian History and Politics: The Dialectic of State and Society By Homa Katouzian, pg. 25</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nNah\u0101vand marked the dissolution of the Sasanian Imperial army, with the fall of the last of the grand marshals of the army and the rise of [[warlord]]ism among the Persians. The Emperor Yazdegerd III attempted to raise troops by appealing to other neighbouring areas such as the princes of Tukharistan and [[Sogdia]] and eventually sent his son [[Peroz III]] to the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] court, but without any success.\n\nYezdegerd hurriedly fled towards the east where he was ill-treated by several Marzban (provincial governors) in the north as well as in [[Merv]], where the governor Mahoye openly showed his hostility to the Emperor. According to non-Muslim sources, Yazdegerd failed to rally enough support in Eastern Persia where the Sasanians were unpopular with the locals.<ref name=\"Elton L.

Our Muslim civilisation is a product of the cross-fertilization of the Semitic and the Aryan ideas. It is a child who inherits the softness and refinement of his Aryan mother, and the sterling character of his Semitic father. But for the conquest of Persia, the civilisation of Islam would have been one-sided. The conquest of Persia gave us what the conquest of Greece gave to the Romans.\"<ref>''Stray  Reflections: The Private Notebook of Muhammad Iqbal'', Ed.

The general election in November is <!-- R: put Trump first, he received more electoral votes (in the first column) -->also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/provisions|title=Legal Provisions Relevant to the Electoral College Process|date=2019-09-05|website=National Archives|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Barack Obama]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Illinois]], was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the restrictions of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]]; in accordance with Section{{nbsp}}1 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], his term expired at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|eastern standard time]] on January 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stout|first=Christopher Timothy|last2=Le|first2=Danvy|date=2012-10-08|title=Living the Dream: Barack Obama and Blacks\u2019 Changing Perceptions of the American Dream|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2012.00915.x|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1338\u20131359|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2012.00915.x|issn=0038-4941}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=Inaugural Address of PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41069357|journal=The Black Scholar|volume=38|issue=4|pages=2\u20135|issn=0006-4246}}</ref>\n\nAlso ineligible to run for additional terms as president were past two-term presidents [[George W.

The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe Mueller Report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, \"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\".<ref name=\"GlobeGraphic\">{{Cite web |last1=Ostriker |first1=Rebecca |last2=Puzzanghera |first2=Jim |last3=Finucane |first3=Martin |last4=Datar |first4=Saurabh |last5=Uraizee |first5=Irfan |last6=Garvin |first6=Patrick |title=What the Mueller report says about Trump and more |url=https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/graphics/2019/03/mueller-report/ |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"TIMErelease\">{{cite magazine |last1=Law |first1=Tara |title=Here Are the Biggest Takeaways From the Mueller Report |url=http://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHowever, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony, as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.

The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe Mueller Report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, \"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\".<ref name=\"GlobeGraphic\">{{Cite web |last1=Ostriker |first1=Rebecca |last2=Puzzanghera |first2=Jim |last3=Finucane |first3=Martin |last4=Datar |first4=Saurabh |last5=Uraizee |first5=Irfan |last6=Garvin |first6=Patrick |title=What the Mueller report says about Trump and more |url=https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/graphics/2019/03/mueller-report/ |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"TIMErelease\">{{cite magazine |last1=Law |first1=Tara |title=Here Are the Biggest Takeaways From the Mueller Report |url=http://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHowever, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony, as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.
