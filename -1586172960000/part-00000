It was released on April 4, 1995, through the [[Record label|label]] Phantom Hill. After playing [[Marcia Brady]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', she was offered a solo record deal in the mid-1970s but rejected the offer to attend school. McCormick had previously recorded four albums as part of ''The Brady Bunch'' and a duet album with her co-star [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]. In 1994, she signed with her brother's record label, Phantom Hill, and recorded ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]]. Barry Coffing was the [[executive producer]] and arranged and produced all the songs. McCormick wanted to fuse genres into the album's overall [[Country music|country]] sound.\n\nThe album received mainly negative reviews; some reviewers were critical of McCormick's choice to record country music. She promoted it through live performances and [[Compact disc|CD]] signings. Its title track and \"Tell Mama\" were released as singles. ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' was re-released in 2008 as a [[Circuit City]] exclusive. Since the album's release, McCormick has continued to perform country music and has participated in the [[reality television]] show [[Gone Country (TV series)|''Gone Country'']]. In a 2008 interview, McCormick said she was disappointed by restrictions to the recording process and wished she had written at least one song for it. ''When You Get A Little Lonely'' is her only album as a solo artist.\n\n== Background and recording ==\n[[File:Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.png|thumb|left|McCormick in a 1971 ''The Brady Bunch'' promotional photo|alt=A 1971 photograph of Maureen McCormick as part of a 1971 ''The Brady Bunch'' promotional campaign.]]\n\n[[Maureen McCormick]] first rose to prominence while playing [[Marcia Brady]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''.

It was released on April 4, 1995, through the [[Record label|label]] Phantom Hill. After playing [[Marcia Brady]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', she was offered a solo record deal in the mid-1970s but rejected the offer to attend school. McCormick had previously recorded four albums as part of ''The Brady Bunch'' and a duet album with her co-star [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]. In 1994, she signed with her brother's record label, Phantom Hill, and recorded ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]]. Barry Coffing was the [[executive producer]] and arranged and produced all the songs. McCormick wanted to fuse genres into the album's overall [[Country music|country]] sound.\n\nThe album received mainly negative reviews; some reviewers were critical of McCormick's choice to record country music. She promoted it through live performances and [[Compact disc|CD]] signings. Its title track and \"Tell Mama\" were released as singles. ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' was re-released in 2008 as a [[Circuit City]] exclusive. Since the album's release, McCormick has continued to perform country music and has participated in the [[reality television]] show [[Gone Country (TV series)|''Gone Country'']]. In a 2008 interview, McCormick said she was disappointed by restrictions to the recording process and wished she had written at least one song for it. ''When You Get A Little Lonely'' is her only album as a solo artist.\n\n== Background and recording ==\n[[File:Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.png|thumb|left|McCormick in a 1971 ''The Brady Bunch'' promotional photo|alt=A 1971 photograph of Maureen McCormick as part of a 1971 ''The Brady Bunch'' promotional campaign.]]\n\n[[Maureen McCormick]] first rose to prominence while playing [[Marcia Brady]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''.

The western half of the reservoir lies in [[Derbyshire]], whereas the eastern half is in [[Sheffield]], South Yorkshire. The county border runs through the middle of the reservoir, following the original path of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]]. The longest arm is around 1.25 miles (2&nbsp;km) in length. The reservoir is bounded at the southern end by Howden Dam; below this, the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] flows immediately into [[Derwent Reservoir, Derbyshire|Derwent Reservoir]] and subsequently the [[Ladybower Reservoir]].   Other tributaries include the [[River Westend]], [[Howden Clough]] and [[Linch Clough]].\n\nWork commenced on the dams construction on 16 July 1901 and completed in July 1912.  The chief engineer was <nowiki>Mr Edward Sandeman</nowiki>. He was also in charge of building nearby Derwent dam and he was awarded the [[Telford Medal]] in 1918 for his work \u2018Derwent Valley Waterworks\u2019. The works involved constructing a temporary village at [[Birchinlee]], or \"Tin Town\", for the workers, a temporary railway line from the main line at [[Bamford]], construction of a link aqueduct to the Derwent Dam. The dam is of solid masonry construction, and {{convert|117|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|tall}}, {{convert|1080|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}, and impounds {{convert|1,900,000|impgal|kl}} of water, from a catchment area of {{convert|5155|acre|km2}}. The workers who died during the construction of the dam were buried in [[Bamford Church]].\n\nTo the east of the reservoir stands Featherbed Moss, one of the highest tops in the area at 545 m, and one of several tops of that name in the area.

The western half of the reservoir lies in [[Derbyshire]], whereas the eastern half is in [[Sheffield]], South Yorkshire. The county border runs through the middle of the reservoir, following the original path of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]]. The longest arm is around 1.25 miles (2&nbsp;km) in length. The reservoir is bounded at the southern end by Howden Dam; below this, the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] flows immediately into [[Derwent Reservoir, Derbyshire|Derwent Reservoir]] and subsequently the [[Ladybower Reservoir]].   Other tributaries include the [[River Westend]], [[Howden Clough]] and [[Linch Clough]].\n\nWork commenced on the dams construction on 16 July 1901 and completed in July 1912.  The chief engineer was <nowiki>Mr Edward Sandeman</nowiki>. He was also in charge of building nearby Derwent dam and he was awarded the [[Telford Medal]] in 1918. The works involved constructing a temporary village at [[Birchinlee]], or \"Tin Town\", for the workers, a temporary railway line from the main line at [[Bamford]], construction of a link aqueduct to the Derwent Dam. The dam is of solid masonry construction, and {{convert|117|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|tall}}, {{convert|1080|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}, and impounds {{convert|1,900,000|impgal|kl}} of water, from a catchment area of {{convert|5155|acre|km2}}.
