Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]]'s First Corps began an attack ordered by General [[Robert E. Lee]] that was intended to drive northeast up the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of Cemetery Hill, rolling up the Union left flank.<ref>Pfanz, p. 153.</ref> [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[John Bell Hood]]'s division was assigned to attack up the eastern side of the road, Maj. Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]]'s division the western side. Hood's division stepped off first, but instead of guiding on the road, elements began to swing directly to the east in the direction of the Round Tops. Instead of driving the entire division up the spine of Houck's Ridge (the boulder-strewn area known to the soldiers as the [[Devil's Den]]), parts of Hood's division detoured over Round Top and approached the southern slope of Little Round Top.<ref name=\"auto1\">Harman, pp. 55&ndash;56; Eicher, p. 526.</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Round Top Edwin Forbes.jpg|thumb|left|''Attack on Little Round Top held by the 5th Corps commanded by General Sykes'', painting by [[Edwin Forbes]]. Forbes has incorrectly depicted [Big] Round Top with two peaks.]]\nThere were four probable reasons for the deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the [[III Corps (Union Army)|Union III Corps]] were unexpectedly in the [[Devil's Den]] area and they would threaten Hood's right flank if they were not dealt with; second, fire from the [[2nd United States Volunteer Sharpshooter Regiment|2nd U.S. Sharpshooters]] at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]]'s brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain was rough and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, General Law, was unaware that Hood had been wounded and he was now in command of the division, so he did not exercise control.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, Little Round Top was undefended by Union troops. Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]], commander of the [[Army of the Potomac]], had ordered Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Sickles]]' [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] to defend the southern end of Cemetery Ridge, which would have just included Little Round Top. Sickles, defying Meade's orders, moved his corps a few hundred yards west to the Emmitsburg Road and the Peach Orchard. This caused a large [[Salient (military)|salient]] in the line, which was also too long to defend properly. His left flank was anchored in Devil's Den.<ref name=\"auto2\">Desjardin, p. 36; Pfanz, p. 5.</ref>\n\nWhen Meade discovered this situation, he dispatched his chief engineer, Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], to attempt to deal with the situation south of Sickles' position. Climbing Little Round Top, Warren found only a small [[United States Army Signal Corps|Signal Corps]] station there. He saw the glint of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers, including [[Washington Roebling]], to find help from any available units in the vicinity.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nThe response to this request for help came from Maj. Gen. [[George Sykes]], commander of the [[V Corps (Union Army)|Union V Corps]]. Sykes quickly dispatched a messenger to order his 1st Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[James Barnes (general)|James Barnes]], to Little Round Top. Before the messenger could reach Barnes, he encountered Col. [[Strong Vincent]], commander of the third brigade, who seized the initiative and directed his four regiments to Little Round Top without waiting for permission from Barnes. He and Oliver W. Norton, the brigade bugler, galloped ahead to [[reconnaissance|reconnoiter]] and guide his four regiments into position.<ref>Norton, p. 167. Norton was a member of the 83rd Pennsylvania, which Vincent commanded before becoming its brigade commander.</ref>\n\nUpon arrival on Little Round Top, Vincent and Norton received fire from Confederate batteries almost immediately. On the western slope he placed the [[16th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment|16th Michigan]], and then proceeding counterclockwise were the [[44th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|44th New York]], the [[83rd Pennsylvania Infantry|83rd Pennsylvania]], and finally, at the end of the line on the southern slope, the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|20th Maine]]. Arriving only ten minutes before the Confederates, Vincent ordered his brigade to take cover and wait, and he ordered Col. [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]], commander of the 20th Maine, to hold his position, the extreme left of the Army of the Potomac, at all costs. Chamberlain and his 385 men<ref>Pfanz, p. 232. The 20th Maine had 28 officers and 358 enlisted men.</ref> waited for what was to come.<ref>Desjardin, p. 36; Pfanz, pp. 208, 216.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Little Round Top===\n[[File:Little Round Top1.png|thumb|350px|Battle of Little Round Top, initial assault\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nThe approaching Confederates were the [[Alabama]] Brigade of Hood's Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]]. (As the battle progressed and Law realized he was in command of the division, Col. James L. Sheffield was eventually notified to assume brigade command.) Dispatching the 4th, 15th, and 47th Alabama, and the [[4th Texas Infantry Regiment|4th]] and [[5th Texas Infantry Regiment|5th Texas]] to Little Round Top, Law ordered his men to take the hill. The men were exhausted, having marched more than 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) that day to reach this point. The day was hot and their canteens were empty; Law's order to move out reached them before they could refill their water.<ref>Pfanz, p. 162.</ref> Approaching the Union line on the crest of the hill, Law's men were thrown back by the first Union volley and withdrew briefly to regroup. The [[15th Regiment Alabama Infantry|15th Alabama]], commanded by Col. [[William C. Oates]], repositioned further right and attempted to find the Union left flank.<ref>Desjardin, pp. 51&ndash;55; Pfanz, p. 216.</ref>\n\nThe left flank consisted of the 386 officers and men of the 20th Maine regiment and the 83rd Pennsylvania. Seeing the Confederates shifting around his flank, Chamberlain first stretched his line to the point where his men were in a single-file line, then ordered the southernmost half of his line to swing back during a lull following another Confederate charge. It was there that they \"refused the line\"&mdash;formed an angle to the main line in an attempt to prevent the Confederate flanking maneuver. Despite heavy losses, the 20th Maine held through two subsequent charges by the 15th Alabama and other Confederate regiments for a total of ninety minutes.<ref>Pfanz, p. 232; {{Cite web |last=Cross |first=David F. |date=June 12, 2006 |title=Battle of Gettysburg: Fighting at Little Round Top |url=http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-gettysburg-fighting-at-little-round-top.htm |publisher=HistoryNet.com |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref><!-- It is widely accepted that Melcher, was the first to engage, and  Chamberlain ordered it. Please stop adding that Melcher did it all first or vice-versa.  Picture right above picture of Joshua Chamberlain of Thomas Chamberlain incorrectly identified as Holman Melcher -->\n\nChamberlain (knowing that his men were out of ammunition, his numbers were being depleted, and his men would not be able to repulse another Confederate charge) ordered his men to equip bayonets and counterattack. He ordered his left flank, which had been pulled back, to advance in a 'right-wheel forward' maneuver. As soon as they were in line with the rest of the regiment, the remainder of the regiment would charge akin to a door swinging shut. This simultaneous [[frontal assault]] and [[flanking maneuver]] halted and captured a good portion of the 15th Alabama.<ref name=\"D6971\">Desjardin, pp. 69&ndash;71.</ref> While Chamberlain ordered the advance, Lieutenant [[Holman S. Melcher|Holman Melcher]] spontaneously and separate to Chamberlain's command initiated a charge from the center of the line that further aided the regiment's efforts.<ref>Desjardin, p. 69.</ref><ref>Melcher, p. 61.</ref>\n[[File:Governor William Calvin Oates.jpg|200px|thumb|left|LTC [[William C.

Morrill]], and a few of the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters, who had been placed by Chamberlain behind a stone wall 150 yards to the east, hoping to guard against an envelopment. This group, who had been hidden from sight, caused considerable confusion in the Confederate ranks.<ref name=\"D6971\"/>\n\nThirty years later, Chamberlain received a [[Medal of Honor]] for his conduct in the defense of Little Round Top. The citation read that it was awarded for \"daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and ordering the advance position on the Great Round Top.\"<ref>Desjardin, p. 148. During the Civil War, only enlisted men were eligible to receive the Medal of Honor. In 1893, [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized awards to officers, and numerous medals were granted long after the feats of heroism.</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Round Top2.png|thumb|350px|Battle of Little Round Top: final assault]]\nDespite this victory, the rest of the Union regiments on the hill were in dire straits. While the Alabamians had pressed their attacks on the Union left, the 4th and 5th Texas were attacking Vincent's 16th Michigan, on the Union right. Rallying the crumbling regiment (the smallest in his brigade, with only 263 men) several times, Vincent was mortally wounded during one Texas charge and was succeeded by Colonel [[James C. Rice]]. Vincent died on July 7, but not before receiving a deathbed promotion to brigadier general.<ref>Pfanz, pp. 227&ndash;28.</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Michigan]]ders could be demoralized, [[reinforcements]] summoned by Warren&mdash;who had continued on to find more troops to defend the hill&mdash;had arrived in the form of the [[140th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|140th New York]] and a battery of four guns&mdash;[[5th U.S. Light Artillery, Battery D|Battery D, 5th U.S. Artillery]], commanded by Lt. [[Charles E. Hazlett]]. (Simply maneuvering these guns by hand up the steep and rocky slope of the hill was an amazing achievement. However, this effort had little effect on the action of July 2. The artillerymen were exposed to constant [[sniper]] fire and could not work effectively. More significantly, however, they could not depress their barrels sufficiently to defend against incoming infantry attacks.)<ref>Pfanz, pp. 223&ndash;24.</ref>\n\nThe 140th charged into the fray of the battle, driving the Texans back and securing victory for the Union forces on the hill. Col. [[Patrick O'Rorke|Patrick \"Paddy\" O'Rorke]], who personally led his regiment in the charge, was killed. Reinforced further by Stephen Weed's brigade of the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]], Union forces held the hill throughout the rest of the battle, enduring persistent fire from Confederate sharpshooters stationed around Devil's Den. General Weed was among the victims, and as his old friend Charles Hazlett leaned over to comfort Weed, the artilleryman was also shot dead.<ref>Pfanz, pp. 225&ndash;28, 239&ndash;40.</ref>\n\n===Evening and July 3===\n[[File:Views from the battle field of Gettysburg, July 1st, 2d, and... (3110018913).jpg|thumb|right|Little Round Top aka \"Granite Hill\" Tyson picture taken about 1863]]\nLater that day, Little Round Top was the site of constant [[Skirmisher|skirmishing]]. It was fortified by Weed's brigade, five regiments of the Pennsylvania Reserves, and an [[Ohio]] [[artillery|battery]] of six guns. Most of the stone breastworks that are currently visible on the hill were constructed by these troops after the fighting stopped. Troops of the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II]], [[V Corps (Union Army)|V]], [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI]], and [[XII Corps (Union Army)|XII]] Corps passed through the area and also occupied Round Top.<ref name=\"A15\">Adelman, ''Little Round Top'', p. 15.</ref>\n\nLittle Round Top was the starting point for a Union counterattack at dusk on July 2, conducted by the 3rd Division of the V Corps (the Pennsylvania Reserves) under Brig. Gen. [[Samuel W. Crawford]], launched to the west in the direction of the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield|Wheatfield]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 391&ndash;92.</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Round Top 101215.jpg|thumb|Little Round Top viewed from near [[Devil's Den]]]]\n\nOn July 3, Hazlett's battery (six [[10-pounder Parrott rifle]]s, now under the command of Lt. [[Benjamin F. Rittenhouse]])<ref>Hall, p. 314.</ref> fired into the flank of the Confederate assault known as [[Pickett's Charge]]. Near the end of that engagement, General Meade observed from Little Round Top and contemplated his options for a possible counterattack against Lee.<ref name=\"A15\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nOf the 2,996 Union troops engaged at Little Round Top, there were 565 casualties (134 killed, 402 wounded, 29 missing); Confederate losses of 4,864 engaged were 1,185 (279 killed, 868 wounded, 219 missing).<ref>Adelman, ''Little Round Top'', pp. 61&ndash;62.</ref>\n\nWhile agreeing that the fighting on Little Round Top was extremely fierce and soldiers on both sides fought valiantly, historians disagree as to the impact of this particular engagement on the overall outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg.<ref>Compare, for instance, Pfanz, p. 205, Sears, p. 269, and Coddington, p. 388 with Harman, pp. 7&ndash;8, 35&ndash;47.</ref> The traditional view&mdash;one that emerged in the 1880s<ref>Adelman, ''Myth of Little Round Top'', p. 37.</ref>&mdash;is that the left flank of the Union Army was a crucial position. An example of this view is from 1900: \"If the Confederates had seized [Little Round Top] and dragged some of their artillery up there, as they easily could have done, they would have enfiladed Meade's entire line and made it too unhealthy for him to remain there.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=January 20, 1900 |title=The Battle of Gettysburg: Extracts of the minutes of the meeting of Sterling Price Camp) |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/HistArchive/?p_product=EANX&p_theme=ahnp&p_nbid=J6ET57FVMTI5NTg5MTA0Ny45MzQzMTA6MToxNToxMzguMjM0LjIyMC4xMzU&p_action=doc&s_lastnonissuequeryname=11&d_viewref=search&p_queryname=11&p_docnum=13&p_docref=v2:0F99DDB671832188@EANX-1070B6E914F5C4B8@2415076-1070B6EA2F3D75C8@14-1070B6ED9240B6D8@The+Battle+of+Gettysburg |format=America's Historical Newspaper image |publisher=Dallas Morning News (February 25) |page=15 |accessdate=2011-01-24}} (Major Robbins' letter)</ref>\n\nAn alternative claim is that the hill's terrain offered a poor platform for artillery, and that had Longstreet secured the hill, the Union army would have been forced back to a better defensive position, making the attack on the hill a distraction from the Confederates' true objective. This latter theory is supported by General Lee's writings, in which he appears to have considered Little Round Top irrelevant. In Lee's report after the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], he stated in part, \"General Longstreet was delayed by a force occupying the high, rocky hills on the enemy's extreme left, from which his troops could be attacked in reverse as they advanced\", suggesting Longstreet was ordered on a course intended to bypass Little Round Top&mdash;had the hill been a key objective of the assault, Lee would not have used the phrase \"delayed by\" in describing the effects of the engagement.<ref>Harman, p. 36: \"How could this Union force, located on the 'high, rocky hills' (a clear reference to the Round Tops), have attacked Longstreet's troops 'in reverse' (from behind) unless the Confederate plans were to march north, staying just west of and passing by these 'rocky hills'?\"</ref>\n\nGarry Adelman has countered the argument that a Confederate capture of Little Round Top would have badly hurt the Union effort. Examining the number of troops available in the vicinity in the late afternoon, he determined that at most 2,650 Confederates could have been available to defend the hill after capturing it, and that these men would have been exhausted from combat and short on ammunition. In contrast, 11,600 fresh Union reinforcements were available within a mile, primarily from Maj. Gen. [[John Sedgwick]]'s [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]]. In addition, the value of Little Round Top as an artillery position has been overstated&mdash;the shape of the crest of the hill forces guns to be placed one behind the other, limiting their effectiveness when engaging targets directly to the north, such as the Union line on Cemetery Ridge.<ref>Adelman, ''Myth of Little Round Top'', pp. 61&ndash;64, 69-73.</ref>\n\nWhile Chamberlain and the 20th Maine have gained popularity in the American national consciousness, other historical figures such as Strong Vincent, [[Patrick O'Rourke]], and Charles Hazlett arguably played equal roles in the Union success at Little Round Top. Their deaths at the scene, however, did not allow their personal stories to be told.\n\n==Postbellum history==\nDuring visits by 13 generals in 1865, points were identified on Little Round Top at which markers were subsequently erected,<ref name=nytimes>{{Cite news |date=Oct 31, 1865 |title=The Field of Gettysburgh: Interest Concerning the Great Battle Ground -- Thirteen Generals Revisit the Scene of their Struggle \u2026 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C13F93C58137A93C1A9178AD95F418684F9  |format=Google News Archive |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> and a {{Convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} observatory was built by 1886,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wert |first=J.

Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]]'s First Corps began an attack ordered by General [[Robert E. Lee]] that was intended to drive northeast up the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of Cemetery Hill, rolling up the Union left flank.<ref>Pfanz, p. 153.</ref> [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[John Bell Hood]]'s division was assigned to attack up the eastern side of the road, Maj. Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]]'s division the western side. Hood's division stepped off first, but instead of guiding on the road, elements began to swing directly to the east in the direction of the Round Tops. Instead of driving the entire division up the spine of Houck's Ridge (the boulder-strewn area known to the soldiers as the [[Devil's Den]]), parts of Hood's division detoured over Round Top and approached the southern slope of Little Round Top.<ref name=\"auto1\">Harman, pp. 55&ndash;56; Eicher, p. 526.</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Round Top Edwin Forbes.jpg|thumb|left|''Attack on Little Round Top held by the 5th Corps commanded by General Sykes'', painting by [[Edwin Forbes]]. Forbes has incorrectly depicted [Big] Round Top with two peaks.]]\nThere were four probable reasons for the deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the [[III Corps (Union Army)|Union III Corps]] were unexpectedly in the [[Devil's Den]] area and they would threaten Hood's right flank if they were not dealt with; second, fire from the [[2nd United States Volunteer Sharpshooter Regiment|2nd U.S. Sharpshooters]] at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]]'s brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain was rough and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, General Law, was unaware that Hood had been wounded and he was now in command of the division, so he did not exercise control.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, Little Round Top was undefended by Union troops. Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]], commander of the [[Army of the Potomac]], had ordered Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Sickles]]' [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] to defend the southern end of Cemetery Ridge, which would have just included Little Round Top. Sickles, defying Meade's orders, moved his corps a few hundred yards west to the Emmitsburg Road and the Peach Orchard. This caused a large [[Salient (military)|salient]] in the line, which was also too long to defend properly. His left flank was anchored in Devil's Den.<ref name=\"auto2\">Desjardin, p. 36; Pfanz, p. 5.</ref>\n\nWhen Meade discovered this situation, he dispatched his chief engineer, Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], to attempt to deal with the situation south of Sickles' position. Climbing Little Round Top, Warren found only a small [[United States Army Signal Corps|Signal Corps]] station there. He saw the glint of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers, including [[Washington Roebling]], to find help from any available units in the vicinity.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nThe response to this request for help came from Maj. Gen. [[George Sykes]], commander of the [[V Corps (Union Army)|Union V Corps]]. Sykes quickly dispatched a messenger to order his 1st Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[James Barnes (general)|James Barnes]], to Little Round Top. Before the messenger could reach Barnes, he encountered Col. [[Strong Vincent]], commander of the third brigade, who seized the initiative and directed his four regiments to Little Round Top without waiting for permission from Barnes. He and Oliver W. Norton, the brigade bugler, galloped ahead to [[reconnaissance|reconnoiter]] and guide his four regiments into position.<ref>Norton, p. 167. Norton was a member of the 83rd Pennsylvania, which Vincent commanded before becoming its brigade commander.</ref>\n\nUpon arrival on Little Round Top, Vincent and Norton received fire from Confederate batteries almost immediately. On the western slope he placed the [[16th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment|16th Michigan]], and then proceeding counterclockwise were the [[44th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|44th New York]], the [[83rd Pennsylvania Infantry|83rd Pennsylvania]], and finally, at the end of the line on the southern slope, the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|20th Maine]]. Arriving only ten minutes before the Confederates, Vincent ordered his brigade to take cover and wait, and he ordered Col. [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]], commander of the 20th Maine, to hold his position, the extreme left of the Army of the Potomac, at all costs. Chamberlain and his 385 men<ref>Pfanz, p. 232. The 20th Maine had 28 officers and 358 enlisted men.</ref> waited for what was to come.<ref>Desjardin, p. 36; Pfanz, pp. 208, 216.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Little Round Top===\n[[File:Little Round Top1.png|thumb|350px|Battle of Little Round Top, initial assault\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nThe approaching Confederates were the [[Alabama]] Brigade of Hood's Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]]. (As the battle progressed and Law realized he was in command of the division, Col. James L. Sheffield was eventually notified to assume brigade command.) Dispatching the 4th, 15th, and 47th Alabama, and the [[4th Texas Infantry Regiment|4th]] and [[5th Texas Infantry Regiment|5th Texas]] to Little Round Top, Law ordered his men to take the hill. The men were exhausted, having marched more than 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) that day to reach this point. The day was hot and their canteens were empty; Law's order to move out reached them before they could refill their water.<ref>Pfanz, p. 162.</ref> Approaching the Union line on the crest of the hill, Law's men were thrown back by the first Union volley and withdrew briefly to regroup. The [[15th Regiment Alabama Infantry|15th Alabama]], commanded by Col. [[William C. Oates]], repositioned further right and attempted to find the Union left flank.<ref>Desjardin, pp. 51&ndash;55; Pfanz, p. 216.</ref>\n\nThe left flank consisted of the 386 officers and men of the 20th Maine regiment and the 83rd Pennsylvania. Seeing the Confederates shifting around his flank, Chamberlain first stretched his line to the point where his men were in a single-file line, then ordered the southernmost half of his line to swing back during a lull following another Confederate charge. It was there that they \"refused the line\"&mdash;formed an angle to the main line in an attempt to prevent the Confederate flanking maneuver. Despite heavy losses, the 20th Maine held through two subsequent charges by the 15th Alabama and other Confederate regiments for a total of ninety minutes.<ref>Pfanz, p. 232; {{Cite web |last=Cross |first=David F. |date=June 12, 2006 |title=Battle of Gettysburg: Fighting at Little Round Top |url=http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-gettysburg-fighting-at-little-round-top.htm |publisher=HistoryNet.com |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref><!-- It is widely accepted that Melcher, was the first to engage, and  Chamberlain ordered it.

Picture right above picture of Joshua Chamberlain of Thomas Chamberlain incorrectly identified as Holman Melcher -->\n\nChamberlain (knowing that his men were out of ammunition, his numbers were being depleted, and his men would not be able to repulse another Confederate charge) ordered his men to equip bayonets and counterattack. He ordered his left flank, which had been pulled back, to advance in a 'right-wheel forward' maneuver. As soon as they were in line with the rest of the regiment, the remainder of the regiment would charge akin to a door swinging shut. This simultaneous [[frontal assault]] and [[flanking maneuver]] halted and captured a good portion of the 15th Alabama.<ref name=\"D6971\">Desjardin, pp. 69&ndash;71.</ref> While Chamberlain ordered the advance, Lieutenant [[Holman S.

Morrill]], and a few of the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters, who had been placed by Chamberlain behind a stone wall 150 yards to the east, hoping to guard against an envelopment. This group, who had been hidden from sight, caused considerable confusion in the Confederate ranks.<ref name=\"D6971\"/>\n\nThirty years later, Chamberlain received a [[Medal of Honor]] for his conduct in the defense of Little Round Top. The citation read that it was awarded for \"daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and ordering the advance position on the Great Round Top.\"<ref>Desjardin, p. 148. During the Civil War, only enlisted men were eligible to receive the Medal of Honor. In 1893, [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized awards to officers, and numerous medals were granted long after the feats of heroism.</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Round Top2.png|thumb|350px|Battle of Little Round Top: final assault]]\nDespite this victory, the rest of the Union regiments on the hill were in dire straits. While the Alabamians had pressed their attacks on the Union left, the 4th and 5th Texas were attacking Vincent's 16th Michigan, on the Union right. Rallying the crumbling regiment (the smallest in his brigade, with only 263 men) several times, Vincent was mortally wounded during one Texas charge and was succeeded by Colonel [[James C. Rice]]. Vincent died on July 7, but not before receiving a deathbed promotion to brigadier general.<ref>Pfanz, pp. 227&ndash;28.</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Michigan]]ders could be demoralized, [[reinforcements]] summoned by Warren&mdash;who had continued on to find more troops to defend the hill&mdash;had arrived in the form of the [[140th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|140th New York]] and a battery of four guns&mdash;[[5th U.S. Light Artillery, Battery D|Battery D, 5th U.S. Artillery]], commanded by Lt. [[Charles E. Hazlett]]. (Simply maneuvering these guns by hand up the steep and rocky slope of the hill was an amazing achievement. However, this effort had little effect on the action of July 2. The artillerymen were exposed to constant [[sniper]] fire and could not work effectively. More significantly, however, they could not depress their barrels sufficiently to defend against incoming infantry attacks.)<ref>Pfanz, pp. 223&ndash;24.</ref>\n\nThe 140th charged into the fray of the battle, driving the Texans back and securing victory for the Union forces on the hill. Col. [[Patrick O'Rorke|Patrick \"Paddy\" O'Rorke]], who personally led his regiment in the charge, was killed. Reinforced further by Stephen Weed's brigade of the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]], Union forces held the hill throughout the rest of the battle, enduring persistent fire from Confederate sharpshooters stationed around Devil's Den. General Weed was among the victims, and as his old friend Charles Hazlett leaned over to comfort Weed, the artilleryman was also shot dead.<ref>Pfanz, pp. 225&ndash;28, 239&ndash;40.</ref>\n\n===Evening and July 3===\n[[File:Views from the battle field of Gettysburg, July 1st, 2d, and...

It was fortified by Weed's brigade, five regiments of the Pennsylvania Reserves, and an [[Ohio]] [[artillery|battery]] of six guns. Most of the stone breastworks that are currently visible on the hill were constructed by these troops after the fighting stopped. Troops of the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II]], [[V Corps (Union Army)|V]], [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI]], and [[XII Corps (Union Army)|XII]] Corps passed through the area and also occupied Round Top.<ref name=\"A15\">Adelman, ''Little Round Top'', p. 15.</ref>\n\nLittle Round Top was the starting point for a Union counterattack at dusk on July 2, conducted by the 3rd Division of the V Corps (the Pennsylvania Reserves) under Brig. Gen. [[Samuel W. Crawford]], launched to the west in the direction of the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield|Wheatfield]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 391&ndash;92.</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Round Top 101215.jpg|thumb|Little Round Top viewed from near [[Devil's Den]]]]\n\nOn July 3, Hazlett's battery (six [[10-pounder Parrott rifle]]s, now under the command of Lt. [[Benjamin F. Rittenhouse]])<ref>Hall, p. 314.</ref> fired into the flank of the Confederate assault known as [[Pickett's Charge]]. Near the end of that engagement, General Meade observed from Little Round Top and contemplated his options for a possible counterattack against Lee.<ref name=\"A15\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nOf the 2,996 Union troops engaged at Little Round Top, there were 565 casualties (134 killed, 402 wounded, 29 missing); Confederate losses of 4,864 engaged were 1,185 (279 killed, 868 wounded, 219 missing).<ref>Adelman, ''Little Round Top'', pp. 61&ndash;62.</ref>\n\nWhile agreeing that the fighting on Little Round Top was extremely fierce and soldiers on both sides fought valiantly, historians disagree as to the impact of this particular engagement on the overall outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg.<ref>Compare, for instance, Pfanz, p. 205, Sears, p. 269, and Coddington, p. 388 with Harman, pp. 7&ndash;8, 35&ndash;47.</ref> The traditional view&mdash;one that emerged in the 1880s<ref>Adelman, ''Myth of Little Round Top'', p. 37.</ref>&mdash;is that the left flank of the Union Army was a crucial position. An example of this view is from 1900: \"If the Confederates had seized [Little Round Top] and dragged some of their artillery up there, as they easily could have done, they would have enfiladed Meade's entire line and made it too unhealthy for him to remain there.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=January 20, 1900 |title=The Battle of Gettysburg: Extracts of the minutes of the meeting of Sterling Price Camp) |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/HistArchive/?p_product=EANX&p_theme=ahnp&p_nbid=J6ET57FVMTI5NTg5MTA0Ny45MzQzMTA6MToxNToxMzguMjM0LjIyMC4xMzU&p_action=doc&s_lastnonissuequeryname=11&d_viewref=search&p_queryname=11&p_docnum=13&p_docref=v2:0F99DDB671832188@EANX-1070B6E914F5C4B8@2415076-1070B6EA2F3D75C8@14-1070B6ED9240B6D8@The+Battle+of+Gettysburg |format=America's Historical Newspaper image |publisher=Dallas Morning News (February 25) |page=15 |accessdate=2011-01-24}} (Major Robbins' letter)</ref>\n\nAn alternative claim is that the hill's terrain offered a poor platform for artillery, and that had Longstreet secured the hill, the Union army would have been forced back to a better defensive position, making the attack on the hill a distraction from the Confederates' true objective. This latter theory is supported by General Lee's writings, in which he appears to have considered Little Round Top irrelevant. In Lee's report after the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], he stated in part, \"General Longstreet was delayed by a force occupying the high, rocky hills on the enemy's extreme left, from which his troops could be attacked in reverse as they advanced\", suggesting Longstreet was ordered on a course intended to bypass Little Round Top&mdash;had the hill been a key objective of the assault, Lee would not have used the phrase \"delayed by\" in describing the effects of the engagement.<ref>Harman, p. 36: \"How could this Union force, located on the 'high, rocky hills' (a clear reference to the Round Tops), have attacked Longstreet's troops 'in reverse' (from behind) unless the Confederate plans were to march north, staying just west of and passing by these 'rocky hills'?\"</ref>\n\nGarry Adelman has countered the argument that a Confederate capture of Little Round Top would have badly hurt the Union effort. Examining the number of troops available in the vicinity in the late afternoon, he determined that at most 2,650 Confederates could have been available to defend the hill after capturing it, and that these men would have been exhausted from combat and short on ammunition. In contrast, 11,600 fresh Union reinforcements were available within a mile, primarily from Maj. Gen. [[John Sedgwick]]'s [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]]. In addition, the value of Little Round Top as an artillery position has been overstated&mdash;the shape of the crest of the hill forces guns to be placed one behind the other, limiting their effectiveness when engaging targets directly to the north, such as the Union line on Cemetery Ridge.<ref>Adelman, ''Myth of Little Round Top'', pp. 61&ndash;64, 69-73.</ref>\n\nWhile Chamberlain and the 20th Maine have gained popularity in the American national consciousness, other historical figures such as Strong Vincent, [[Patrick O'Rourke]], and Charles Hazlett arguably played equal roles in the Union success at Little Round Top.

During the war years, Webber moved to the office of [[Vincent Harris]], a prolific designer of public buildings, and from whom he drew much inspiration.

The plans never went ahead, but it brought him much attention from his peers. His first major municipal design was the [[Southampton Civic Centre|Guildhall Civic Centre]] in Southampton, which was built over a ten-year period.  Other civic centres followed, including the Civic Centres at [[Civic Centre, Dagenham|Dagenham]] (1936\u201337), and [[Hammersmith Town Hall|Hammersmith]] (1939\u201340).

During the war years, Webber moved to the office of [[Vincent Harris]], a prolific designer of public buildings, and from whom he drew much inspiration.

The plans never went ahead, but it brought him much attention from his peers. His first major municipal design was the [[Southampton Civic Centre|Guildhall Civic Centre]] in Southampton, which was built over a ten-year period.  Other civic centres followed, including the Civic Centres at [[Civic Centre, Dagenham|Dagenham]] (1936\u20137), and [[Hammersmith Town Hall|Hammersmith]] (1939\u201340).

The toy was originally produced as separate plastic parts with pushpins that could be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable. However, due to complaints regarding rotting vegetables and new government safety regulations, Hasbro began including a plastic potato body within the toy set in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Adventures of MR.

The Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters appeared in the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' franchise, voiced by [[Don Rickles]] and [[Estelle Harris]], respectively. Additionally, in 1998 ''[[The Mr. Potato Head Show]]'' aired but was short-lived, with only one season being produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315688/ |title=The Mr. Potato Head Show |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref> As one of the prominent marks of Hasbro, a Mr. Potato Head balloon has also joined others in the annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1862565,00.html |work=Time |first=Claire |last=Suddath |title=Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade |date=November 27, 2008}}</ref> Today, Mr. Potato Head can still be seen adorning hats, shirts, and ties.

Some speculate he got the idea from his wife's nephew Aaron Bradley, who was seen placing sticks inside of potatoes in the family garden.<ref name=WTToys>{{cite book |last=Walsh |first=Tim |title=Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Made Them |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=0-7407-5571-4}}</ref> Lerner would often take potatoes from his mother's garden and, using various other fruits and vegetables as facial features, he would make dolls with which his younger sisters could play. The grape-eyed, carrot-nosed, potato-headed dolls became the principal idea behind the plastic toy which would later be manufactured.\n\nIn the beginning, Lerner's toy proved controversial. With [[World War II]] and food rationing a recent memory for most Americans, the use of fruits and vegetables to make toys was considered irresponsible and wasteful. Toy companies rejected Lerner's creation.<ref name=WTToys /> After several years of trying to sell the toy, Lerner finally convinced a food company to distribute the plastic parts as premiums in [[breakfast cereal]] boxes. He sold the idea for $5,000. But in 1951, Lerner showed the idea to Henry and Merrill Hassenfeld, who conducted a small school supply and toy business called Hassenfeld Brothers (later changed to [[Hasbro]]). Realizing the toy was quite unlike anything in their line, they paid the cereal company $2,000 to stop production and bought the rights for $5,000. Lerner was offered an advance of $500 and a 5% royalty on every kit sold. The toy was dubbed Mr. Potato Head and went into production.<ref name=WTToys />\n\nMr. Potato Head was \"born\" on May 1, 1952. The original toy cost $0.98, and contained hands, feet, ears, two mouths, two pairs of eyes, four noses, three hats, eyeglasses, a pipe, and eight felt pieces resembling facial hair. The original Mr. Potato Head kit did not come with a potato \"body\", so parents had to provide their own potato into which children could stick the different pieces. Shortly after the toy's initial release, an order form for 50 additional pieces was enclosed in every kit.<ref name=WTToys />\n\nOn April 30, 1952, Mr. Potato Head became the first toy advertised on television. The [[advertising campaign|campaign]] was also the first to be aimed directly at children; before this, commercials were only targeted at adults, so toy adverts had always been pitched to parents.<ref>{{cite news|title=Is Mr Potato Head to blame for 'pester power' ads?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17871107|accessdate=May 1, 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> This commercial revolutionized marketing, and caused an industrial boom. Over one million kits were sold in the first year.<ref name=WTToys /> In 1953, Mrs. Potato Head was added, and soon after, Brother Spud and Sister Yam completed the Potato Head family with accessories reflecting the affluence of the 1950s that included a car, a boat trailer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGrjmJouWA |title=Vintage Original Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head commercial 1960s |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> a kitchen set, a stroller, and pets called Spud-ettes. Although originally produced as separate plastic parts to be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable, a plastic potato was added to the kit in 1964.<ref name=\"VAC\"/>\n\nIn the 1960s, government regulations forced the Potato Head parts to be less sharp, leaving them unable to prick vegetables easily. By 1964, the company was therefore forced to include a plastic potato \"body\" in its kit. Small children were also choking on the small pieces and cutting themselves with the sharp pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpotatohead.net/1960/1960.htm|title=The 1960s|website=Mrpotatohead.net|date= |accessdate=2011-05-23 |url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528001857/http://www.mrpotatohead.net/1960/1960.htm|archive-date=2011-05-28}}</ref> About this time, Hasbro introduced Oscar the Orange and Pete the Pepper, a plastic orange and green pepper with attachable face parts similar to Mr. Potato Head's. Each came with Mr. Potato Head in a separate kit. Female characters Katie the Carrot and Cooky the Cucumber also made an appearance. Hasbro also made a fast food based line called Mr. Potato Head's Picnic Pals. Some characters were Mr. Soda Pop Head and Frankie Frank. The friends and pals were later discontinued, but [[Funko]] revived Oscar and Pete as [[bobbleheads]] (along with a Mr. Potato Head bobblehead) in 2002.\n\nIn 1975, the main potato part of the toy doubled in size and the dimensions of its accessories were similarly increased. This was done mainly because of new toy child safety regulations that were introduced by the U.S. government. This change in size also increased the market to younger children, enabling them to play and attach the facial pieces easily. Hasbro also replaced the holes with flat slats, which made it impossible for users to put the face pieces and other body parts the wrong way around. In the 1980s, Hasbro reduced the range of accessories for Mr. Potato Head to one set of parts. The company did, however, reintroduce round holes in the main potato body, and once again parts were able to go onto the toy in the wrong locations.\n\nIn 1985, Mr. Potato Head received four postal votes in the run for mayor of [[Boise, Idaho]] in the \"most votes for Mr. Potato Head in a political campaign\" as verified by [[Guinness World Records]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn 1987, Mr. Potato Head became \"Spokespud\" for the annual [[Great American Smokeout]] and surrendered his pipe to Surgeon General [[C. Everett Koop]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"VAC\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Mr. Potato Head made his film debut with a leading role in the Disney/Pixar CGI-animated feature ''[[Toy Story]]'',<ref name=\"VAC\"/> with the voice provided by comedian [[Don Rickles]].\n\nIn 2000, Mr. Potato Head was inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, NY]].\n\nIn 2006, Hasbro also began selling sets of pieces without bodies for customers to add to their collections. Some of these themed sets included Chef, Construction Worker, Firefighter, Halloween, King, Mermaid, Police Officer, Pirate, Princess, Rockstar, and Santa Claus. In the same year, Hasbro introduced a line called \"Sports Spuds\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-spuds.com/ |title=PPW Toys |publisher=Sports-spuds.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> with a generic plastic potato (smaller than the standard size) customized to a wide variety of professional and collegiate teams.\n\n==Versions==\nIn recent years, Hasbro has produced Potato Head sets based on media properties that Hasbro produces toys for under license.

From Hasbro, there will be a [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] release as well.\n\nSince 2011, new models of the Mr. Potato Head toys, commonly referred to as Jason, have been produced. The [[Mrs. Potato Head]] version of the toy was also brought out in early 2012, commonly known as Rachel, and has a [[baked bean]]-like head. In 2012, Hasbro and PPW Toys released Mr. Potato Head in Batman form for the movie ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''. The model, known as \"The Dark Spud\", features Mr. Potato Head dressed up as the Caped Crusader. Before the release, the model was unveiled at the 2012 New York Toy Fair. In 2014, to celebrate ''[[The Simpsons]]'' 25th anniversary, there will be a [[Homer Simpson]] Mr. Potato Head.\n\nIn 2019, ''[[Toy Story 4]]''-themed Mr. and Mrs. Potato Heads were released. These versions feature the \"Jason\" model of the spuds with a mix of various parts, including the classic versions of the arms and shoes, movie-accurate facial features and the newer designs of the parts.\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Mr. Potato Head Celebrates a Birthday in Lima, Peru.jpg|thumb|Mr. Potato Head Celebrates a Birthday in Lima, Peru]]\nMr. Potato Head's popularity has led to some appearances in films and television. In 1985, Mr. Potato Head was based on the shape of Kat\u2019s head. He played a supporting role in ''[[Potato Head Kids]]'', his first dramatic television appearance. In 1998\u20131999, he had his own short-lived [[Fox Kids]] series, ''[[The Mr. Potato Head Show]]''. In addition to film and television, the character has been the subject of a comic strip created by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]. Cartoonist [[Gary Larson]] included the character in several of his ''[[The Far Side]]'' cartoons. In commercial for [[Bridgestone]] tires during [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, Mr. Potato Head is driving a car and Mrs. Potato Head is nagging him.\n\nMr. Potato Head has also acted as spokesman for several causes. In 1987, Mr. Potato Head surrendered his pipe to become the spokesperson for the American Cancer Society's annual \"Great American Smokeout\" campaign. He performed the role for several years. In 1992, he received a special award from the President's Council for Physical Fitness. In 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head joined the [[League of Women Voters]] and their \"Get Out to Vote\" campaign. Mr. Potato Head is also the inspiration/main character of an upcoming fan film, Potato Headed.\n\nLarger-than-life versions of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head are \"guests\" in the 1980s section of [[Pop Century Resort]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in Florida.\n\nMr. and Mrs Potato Head also star in commercials for other brands starting in the 2000s. An example is an ad for [[Lay's|Lay's Potato Chips]] where Mr. Potato Head comes home to see Mrs. Potato Head eating them despite being a potato herself. At the end Mr. Potato Head joins in and tells her to keep it their \"little secret\".\n\nA spoof, Mr. Zucchini Head, appears as a proposed new toy in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[The King Is Dead (Family Guy)|The King Is Dead]]\". Another spoof, Mr. Carrot Head, appears in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Angry Dad: The Movie]]\".\n\nPop singer [[Melanie Martinez (singer)|Melanie Martinez]] released a song called \"[[Mrs. Potato Head]]\" on her debut album ''[[Cry Baby (Melanie Martinez album)|Cry Baby]]''.\n\n===''Toy Story'' series===\nMr. Potato Head is also in the Disney/[[Pixar]] [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' films]], voiced by [[Don Rickles]]. He was one of Andy's toys before being given to Bonnie.\n\nIn the first film, ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), Mr. Potato Head is shown to be very moody towards Andy's other toys, although he is good friends with [[Hamm (Toy Story)|Hamm]] the [[piggy bank]] ([[John Ratzenberger]]). When [[Sheriff Woody]] ([[Tom Hanks]]) accidentally pushes [[Buzz Lightyear]] ([[Tim Allen]]) out of a window, Potato Head accuses Woody of doing it on purpose. At the end of the movie, he is overjoyed to hear Andy's sister Molly getting a Mrs. Potato Head on Christmas.\n\nIn the second film, ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999), Mr. Potato Head goes with Andy's other toys to rescue Woody, who has been stolen by [[Al McWhiggin]] ([[Wayne Knight]]).

The toy was originally produced as separate plastic parts with pushpins that could be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable. However, due to complaints regarding rotting vegetables and new government safety regulations, Hasbro began including a plastic potato body within the toy set in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Adventures of MR.

The Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters appeared in the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' franchise, voiced by [[Don Rickles]] and [[Estelle Harris]], respectively. Additionally, in 1998 ''[[The Mr. Potato Head Show]]'' aired but was short-lived, with only one season being produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315688/ |title=The Mr. Potato Head Show |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref> As one of the prominent marks of Hasbro, a Mr. Potato Head balloon has also joined others in the annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1862565,00.html |work=Time |first=Claire |last=Suddath |title=Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade |date=November 27, 2008}}</ref> Today, Mr. Potato Head can still be seen adorning hats, shirts, and ties.

Some speculate he got the idea from his wife's nephew Aaron Bradley, who was seen placing sticks inside of potatoes in the family garden.<ref name=WTToys>{{cite book |last=Walsh |first=Tim |title=Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Made Them |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=0-7407-5571-4}}</ref> Lerner would often take potatoes from his mother's garden and, using various other fruits and vegetables as facial features, he would make dolls with which his younger sisters could play. The grape-eyed, carrot-nosed, potato-headed dolls became the principal idea behind the plastic toy which would later be manufactured.\n\nIn the beginning, Lerner's toy proved controversial. With [[World War II]] and food rationing a recent memory for most Americans, the use of fruits and vegetables to make toys was considered irresponsible and wasteful. Toy companies rejected Lerner's creation.<ref name=WTToys /> After several years of trying to sell the toy, Lerner finally convinced a food company to distribute the plastic parts as premiums in [[breakfast cereal]] boxes. He sold the idea for $5,000. But in 1951, Lerner showed the idea to Henry and Merrill Hassenfeld, who conducted a small school supply and toy business called Hassenfeld Brothers (later changed to [[Hasbro]]). Realizing the toy was quite unlike anything in their line, they paid the cereal company $2,000 to stop production and bought the rights for $5,000. Lerner was offered an advance of $500 and a 5% royalty on every kit sold. The toy was dubbed Mr. Potato Head and went into production.<ref name=WTToys />\n\nMr. Potato Head was \"born\" on May 1, 1952. The original toy cost $0.98, and contained hands, feet, ears, two mouths, two pairs of eyes, four noses, three hats, eyeglasses, a pipe, and eight felt pieces resembling facial hair. The original Mr. Potato Head kit did not come with a potato \"body\", so parents had to provide their own potato into which children could stick the different pieces. Shortly after the toy's initial release, an order form for 50 additional pieces was enclosed in every kit.<ref name=WTToys />\n\nOn April 30, 1952, Mr. Potato Head became the first toy advertised on television. The [[advertising campaign|campaign]] was also the first to be aimed directly at children; before this, commercials were only targeted at adults, so toy adverts had always been pitched to parents.<ref>{{cite news|title=Is Mr Potato Head to blame for 'pester power' ads?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17871107|accessdate=May 1, 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> This commercial revolutionized marketing, and caused an industrial boom. Over one million kits were sold in the first year.<ref name=WTToys /> In 1953, Mrs. Potato Head was added, and soon after, Brother Spud and Sister Yam completed the Potato Head family with accessories reflecting the affluence of the 1950s that included a car, a boat trailer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGrjmJouWA |title=Vintage Original Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head commercial 1960s |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> a kitchen set, a stroller, and pets called Spud-ettes. Although originally produced as separate plastic parts to be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable, a plastic potato was added to the kit in 1964.<ref name=\"VAC\"/>\n\nIn the 1960s, government regulations forced the Potato Head parts to be less sharp, leaving them unable to prick vegetables easily. By 1964, the company was therefore forced to include a plastic potato \"body\" in its kit. Small children were also choking on the small pieces and cutting themselves with the sharp pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpotatohead.net/1960/1960.htm|title=The 1960s|website=Mrpotatohead.net|date= |accessdate=2011-05-23 |url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528001857/http://www.mrpotatohead.net/1960/1960.htm|archive-date=2011-05-28}}</ref> About this time, Hasbro introduced Oscar the Orange and Pete the Pepper, a plastic orange and green pepper with attachable face parts similar to Mr. Potato Head's. Each came with Mr. Potato Head in a separate kit. Female characters Katie the Carrot and Cooky the Cucumber also made an appearance. Hasbro also made a fast food based line called Mr. Potato Head's Picnic Pals. Some characters were Mr. Soda Pop Head and Frankie Frank. The friends and pals were later discontinued, but [[Funko]] revived Oscar and Pete as [[bobbleheads]] (along with a Mr. Potato Head bobblehead) in 2002.\n\nIn 1975, the main potato part of the toy doubled in size and the dimensions of its accessories were similarly increased. This was done mainly because of new toy child safety regulations that were introduced by the U.S. government. This change in size also increased the market to younger children, enabling them to play and attach the facial pieces easily. Hasbro also replaced the holes with flat slats, which made it impossible for users to put the face pieces and other body parts the wrong way around. In the 1980s, Hasbro reduced the range of accessories for Mr. Potato Head to one set of parts. The company did, however, reintroduce round holes in the main potato body, and once again parts were able to go onto the toy in the wrong locations.\n\nIn 1985, Mr. Potato Head received four postal votes in the run for mayor of [[Boise, Idaho]] in the \"most votes for Mr. Potato Head in a political campaign\" as verified by [[Guinness World Records]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn 1987, Mr. Potato Head became \"Spokespud\" for the annual [[Great American Smokeout]] and surrendered his pipe to Surgeon General [[C. Everett Koop]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"VAC\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Mr. Potato Head made his film debut with a leading role in the Disney/Pixar CGI-animated feature ''[[Toy Story]]'',<ref name=\"VAC\"/> with the voice provided by comedian [[Don Rickles]].\n\nIn 2000, Mr. Potato Head was inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, NY]].\n\nIn 2006, Hasbro also began selling sets of pieces without bodies for customers to add to their collections. Some of these themed sets included Chef, Construction Worker, Firefighter, Halloween, King, Mermaid, Police Officer, Pirate, Princess, Rockstar, and Santa Claus. In the same year, Hasbro introduced a line called \"Sports Spuds\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-spuds.com/ |title=PPW Toys |publisher=Sports-spuds.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> with a generic plastic potato (smaller than the standard size) customized to a wide variety of professional and collegiate teams.\n\n==Versions==\nIn recent years, Hasbro has produced Potato Head sets based on media properties that Hasbro produces toys for under license.

From Hasbro, there will be a [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] release as well.\n\nSince 2011, new models of the Mr. Potato Head toys, commonly referred to as Jason, have been produced. The [[Mrs. Potato Head]] version of the toy was also brought out in early 2012, commonly known as Rachel, and has a [[baked bean]]-like head. In 2012, Hasbro and PPW Toys released Mr. Potato Head in Batman form for the movie ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''. The model, known as \"The Dark Spud\", features Mr. Potato Head dressed up as the Caped Crusader. Before the release, the model was unveiled at the 2012 New York Toy Fair. In 2014, to celebrate ''[[The Simpsons]]'' 25th anniversary, there will be a [[Homer Simpson]] Mr. Potato Head.\n\nIn 2019, ''[[Toy Story 4]]''-themed Mr. and Mrs. Potato Heads were released. These versions feature the \"Jason\" model of the spuds with a mix of various parts, including the classic versions of the arms and shoes, movie-accurate facial features and the newer designs of the parts.\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Mr. Potato Head Celebrates a Birthday in Lima, Peru.jpg|thumb|Mr. Potato Head Celebrates a Birthday in Lima, Peru]]\nMr. Potato Head's popularity has led to some appearances in films and television. In 1985, Mr. Potato Head played a supporting role in ''[[Potato Head Kids]]'', his first dramatic television appearance. In 1998\u20131999, he had his own short-lived [[Fox Kids]] series, ''[[The Mr. Potato Head Show]]''. In addition to film and television, the character has been the subject of a comic strip created by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]. Cartoonist [[Gary Larson]] included the character in several of his ''[[The Far Side]]'' cartoons. In commercial for [[Bridgestone]] tires during [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, Mr. Potato Head is driving a car and Mrs. Potato Head is nagging him.\n\nMr. Potato Head has also acted as spokesman for several causes. In 1987, Mr. Potato Head surrendered his pipe to become the spokesperson for the American Cancer Society's annual \"Great American Smokeout\" campaign. He performed the role for several years. In 1992, he received a special award from the President's Council for Physical Fitness. In 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head joined the [[League of Women Voters]] and their \"Get Out to Vote\" campaign. Mr. Potato Head is also the inspiration/main character of an upcoming fan film, Potato Headed.\n\nLarger-than-life versions of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head are \"guests\" in the 1980s section of [[Pop Century Resort]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in Florida.\n\nMr. and Mrs Potato Head also star in commercials for other brands starting in the 2000s. An example is an ad for [[Lay's|Lay's Potato Chips]] where Mr. Potato Head comes home to see Mrs. Potato Head eating them despite being a potato herself. At the end Mr. Potato Head joins in and tells her to keep it their \"little secret\".\n\nA spoof, Mr. Zucchini Head, appears as a proposed new toy in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[The King Is Dead (Family Guy)|The King Is Dead]]\". Another spoof, Mr. Carrot Head, appears in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Angry Dad: The Movie]]\".\n\nPop singer [[Melanie Martinez (singer)|Melanie Martinez]] released a song called \"[[Mrs. Potato Head]]\" on her debut album ''[[Cry Baby (Melanie Martinez album)|Cry Baby]]''.\n\n===''Toy Story'' series===\nMr. Potato Head is also in the Disney/[[Pixar]] [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' films]], voiced by [[Don Rickles]]. He was one of Andy's toys before being given to Bonnie.\n\nIn the first film, ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), Mr. Potato Head is shown to be very moody towards Andy's other toys, although he is good friends with [[Hamm (Toy Story)|Hamm]] the [[piggy bank]] ([[John Ratzenberger]]). When [[Sheriff Woody]] ([[Tom Hanks]]) accidentally pushes [[Buzz Lightyear]] ([[Tim Allen]]) out of a window, Potato Head accuses Woody of doing it on purpose. At the end of the movie, he is overjoyed to hear Andy's sister Molly getting a Mrs. Potato Head on Christmas.\n\nIn the second film, ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999), Mr. Potato Head goes with Andy's other toys to rescue Woody, who has been stolen by [[Al McWhiggin]] ([[Wayne Knight]]). After Mr. Potato Head saves three [[List of Toy Story characters#Aliens / Little Green Men|Alien]] toys ([[Jeff Pidgeon]]) from falling out of a [[Pizza Planet truck]], only for them to continually pester him, his wife, [[Mrs. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mrs. Potato Head]] ([[Estelle Harris]]) decides to adopt them, horrifying her husband.\n\nIn the third film, ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010), Mr. Potato Head is one of Andy's remaining toys, alongside his wife, the Aliens, and others. The toys are donated to a daycare center and are later almost killed in a landfill incinerator. When the Aliens rescue the toys with a giant crane, Mr. Potato Head finally accepts them as his sons.

{"title_page": "Star cluster", "text_new": "[[File:M92 arp 750pix.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Messier 92]] in the [[Hercules constellation]].]]\n\n'''Star clusters''' are very large groups of [[star]]s. Two types of star clusters can be distinguished: [[globular cluster]]s are tight groups of hundreds to millions of old stars which are [[gravitation]]ally bound, while [[open cluster]]s, more loosely clustered groups of stars, generally contain fewer than a few hundred members, and are often very young. Open clusters become disrupted over time by the gravitational influence of [[giant molecular cloud]]s as they move through the [[Galaxy]], but cluster members will continue to move in broadly the same direction through space even though they are no longer gravitationally bound; they are then known as a [[stellar association]], sometimes also referred to as a ''moving group''. \n\nStar clusters visible to the naked eye include the [[Pleiades]] ([[Messier object|M45]]), [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], and the [[Beehive Cluster]] ([[Messier object|M44]]).\n\n==Globular cluster==\n{{Main|Globular cluster}}\n[[File:New_Hubble_image_of_star_cluster_Messier_15.jpg|thumb|The globular cluster [[Messier 15]] photographed by [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]].]]\n\nGlobular clusters are roughly spherical groupings of from 10,000 to several million stars packed into regions of from 10 to 30 [[light-year]]s across. They commonly consist of very old [[stellar populations|Population II]] stars\u2014just a few hundred million years younger than the universe itself\u2014which are mostly yellow and red, with masses less than two [[solar mass]]es.<ref name=snp>{{cite book|title=Nature Guide: Stars and Planets|date=2012|author=Robert Dinwiddie|author2=Will Gater|author3=Giles Sparrow|author4=Carole Stott|publisher=DK|isbn=978-0-7566-9040-3|pages=14,134\u2013137}}</ref> Such stars predominate within clusters because hotter and more massive stars have exploded as [[supernova]]e, or evolved through [[planetary nebula]] phases to end as [[white dwarf]]s. Yet a few rare blue stars exist in globulars, thought to be formed by stellar mergers in their dense inner regions; these stars are known as [[blue straggler]]s.\n\nIn our Galaxy, globular clusters are distributed roughly spherically in the [[galactic halo]], around the [[Galactic Centre]], orbiting the centre in highly elliptical [[orbit]]s. In 1917, the astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] made the first reliable estimate of the Sun's distance from the galactic centre based on the distribution of globular clusters.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s, globular clusters were the cause of a great mystery in astronomy, as theories of [[stellar evolution]] gave ages for the oldest members of globular clusters that were greater than the estimated age of the universe. However, greatly improved distance measurements to globular clusters using the [[Hipparcos]] satellite and increasingly accurate measurements of the [[Hubble constant]] resolved the paradox, giving an age for the universe of about 13 billion years and an age for the oldest stars of a few hundred million years less.\n\nOur Galaxy has about 150 globular clusters,<ref name=snp/> some of which may have been captured from small galaxies disrupted by the Milky Way, as seems to be the case for the [[globular cluster M79]]. Some galaxies are much richer in globulars: the giant [[elliptical galaxy]] [[Messier 87|M87]] contains over a thousand.\n\nA few of the brightest globular clusters are visible to the [[naked eye]], with the brightest, [[Omega Centauri]], having been known since antiquity and catalogued as a star before the telescopic age. The brightest globular cluster in the northern hemisphere is [[Messier 13]] in the constellation of [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]].\n\n===Super star cluster===\n{{Main|Super star cluster}}\n[[Super star cluster]]s are very large regions of recent star formation, and are thought to be the precursors of globular clusters. Examples include [[Westerlund 1]] in the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite news|date=2005-03-22|publisher=ESO|title=Young and Exotic Stellar Zoo: ESO's Telescopes Uncover Super Star Cluster in the Milky Way|url=https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/news/eso0510/|access-date=2017-11-27|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042434/https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/news/eso0510/|archive-date=2017-12-01|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Open clusters==\n{{Main|Open cluster}}\n[[Image:M45 filip.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Pleiades]], an open cluster dominated by hot blue stars surrounded by reflection nebulosity.]]\nOpen clusters are very different from globular clusters. Unlike the spherically distributed globulars, they are confined to the [[galactic plane]], and are almost always found within [[spiral arm]]s. They are generally young objects, up to a few tens of millions of years old, with a few rare exceptions as old as a few billion years, such as [[Messier 67]] (the closest and most observed old open cluster) for example.<ref>Archinal, Brent A., Hynes, Steven J. 2003. ''Star Clusters'', Willmann-Bell, Richmond, VA</ref> They form [[H II region]]s such as the [[Orion Nebula]].\n\nOpen clusters usually contain up to a few hundred members, within a region up to about 30 light-years across. Being much less densely populated than globular clusters, they are much less tightly gravitationally bound, and over time, are disrupted by the gravity of [[giant molecular cloud]]s and other clusters. Close encounters between cluster members can also result in the ejection of stars, a process known as 'evaporation'.\n\nThe most prominent open clusters are the [[Pleiades]] and [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. The [[Double Cluster]] of [[NGC 869|h]]+[[NGC 884|Chi Persei]] can also be prominent under dark skies. Open clusters are often dominated by hot young blue stars, because although such stars are short-lived in stellar terms, only lasting a few tens of millions of years, open clusters tend to have dispersed before these stars die.\n\nEstablishing precise distances to open clusters enables the calibration of the period-luminosity relationship shown by [[Cepheids]] [[variable stars]], which are then used as [[standard candle]]s. Cepheids are luminous and can be used to establish both the distances to remote galaxies and the expansion rate of the Universe ([[Hubble constant]]). Indeed, the open cluster NGC 7790 hosts three [[classical Cepheids]] which are critical for such efforts.<ref name=sa1958>Sandage, Allan (1958).

Embedded clusters form in [[molecular clouds]], when the clouds begin to collapse and [[star formation|form stars]]. There is often ongoing star formation in these clusters, so embedded clusters may be home to various types of [[young stellar object]]s including [[protostar]]s and [[pre-main-sequence star]]s. An example of an embedded cluster is the [[Trapezium Cluster]] in the [[Orion Nebula]]. In [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex|\u03c1 Ophiuchi cloud]] (L1688) core region there is an embedded cluster.<ref>{{cite journal|bibcode=1995ApJ...450..233G|title=An Infrared Spectroscopic Survey of the rho Ophiuchi Young Stellar Cluster: Masses and Ages from the H-R Diagram|journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=450|pages=233|author1=Greene|first1=Thomas P|last2=Meyer|first2=Michael R|year=1995|doi=10.1086/176134}}</ref>\n\nThe embedded cluster phase may last for several million years, after which gas in the cloud is depleted by star formation or dispersed through [[radiation pressure]], [[stellar wind]]s and [[astrophysical jet|outflows]], or [[supernova explosion]]s.

Two types of star clusters can be distinguished: [[globular cluster]]s are tight groups of hundreds to millions of old stars which are [[gravitation]]ally bound, while [[open cluster]]s, more loosely clustered groups of stars, generally contain fewer than a few hundred members, and are often very young. Open clusters become disrupted over time by the gravitational influence of [[giant molecular cloud]]s as they move through the [[Galaxy]], but cluster members will continue to move in broadly the same direction through space even though they are no longer gravitationally bound; they are then known as a [[stellar association]], sometimes also referred to as a ''moving group''. \n\nStar clusters visible to the naked eye include the [[Pleiades]] ([[Messier object|M45]]), [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], and the [[Beehive Cluster]] ([[Messier object|M44]]).\n\n==Globular cluster==\n{{Main|Globular cluster}}\n[[File:New_Hubble_image_of_star_cluster_Messier_15.jpg|thumb|The globular cluster [[Messier 15]] photographed by [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]].]]\n\nGlobular clusters are roughly spherical groupings of from 10,000 to several million stars packed into regions of from 10 to 30 [[light-year]]s across. They commonly consist of very old [[stellar populations|Population II]] stars\u2014just a few hundred million years younger than the universe itself\u2014which are mostly yellow and red, with masses less than two [[solar mass]]es.<ref name=snp>{{cite book|title=Nature Guide: Stars and Planets|date=2012|author=Robert Dinwiddie|author2=Will Gater|author3=Giles Sparrow|author4=Carole Stott|publisher=DK|isbn=978-0-7566-9040-3|pages=14,134\u2013137}}</ref> Such stars predominate within clusters because hotter and more massive stars have exploded as [[supernova]]e, or evolved through [[planetary nebula]] phases to end as [[white dwarf]]s. Yet a few rare blue stars exist in globulars, thought to be formed by stellar mergers in their dense inner regions; these stars are known as [[blue straggler]]s.\n\nIn our Galaxy, globular clusters are distributed roughly spherically in the [[galactic halo]], around the [[Galactic Centre]], orbiting the centre in highly elliptical [[orbit]]s. In 1917, the astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] made the first reliable estimate of the Sun's distance from the galactic center based on the distribution of globular clusters.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s, globular clusters were the cause of a great mystery in astronomy, as theories of [[stellar evolution]] gave ages for the oldest members of globular clusters that were greater than the estimated age of the universe. However, greatly improved distance measurements to globular clusters using the [[Hipparcos]] satellite and increasingly accurate measurements of the [[Hubble constant]] resolved the paradox, giving an age for the universe of about 13 billion years and an age for the oldest stars of a few hundred million years less.\n\nOur Galaxy has about 150 globular clusters,<ref name=snp/> some of which may have been captured from small galaxies disrupted by the Milky Way, as seems to be the case for the [[globular cluster M79]]. Some galaxies are much richer in globulars: the giant [[elliptical galaxy]] [[Messier 87|M87]] contains over a thousand.\n\nA few of the brightest globular clusters are visible to the [[naked eye]], with the brightest, [[Omega Centauri]], having been known since antiquity and catalogued as a star before the telescopic age. The brightest globular cluster in the northern hemisphere is [[Messier 13]] in the constellation of [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]].\n\n===Super star cluster===\n{{Main|Super star cluster}}\n[[Super star cluster]]s are very large regions of recent star formation, and are thought to be the precursors of globular clusters. Examples include [[Westerlund 1]] in the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite news|date=2005-03-22|publisher=ESO|title=Young and Exotic Stellar Zoo: ESO's Telescopes Uncover Super Star Cluster in the Milky Way|url=https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/news/eso0510/|access-date=2017-11-27|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042434/https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/news/eso0510/|archive-date=2017-12-01|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Open clusters==\n{{Main|Open cluster}}\n[[Image:M45 filip.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Pleiades]], an open cluster dominated by hot blue stars surrounded by reflection nebulosity.]]\nOpen clusters are very different from globular clusters. Unlike the spherically distributed globulars, they are confined to the [[galactic plane]], and are almost always found within [[spiral arm]]s. They are generally young objects, up to a few tens of millions of years old, with a few rare exceptions as old as a few billion years, such as [[Messier 67]] (the closest and most observed old open cluster) for example.<ref>Archinal, Brent A., Hynes, Steven J. 2003. ''Star Clusters'', Willmann-Bell, Richmond, VA</ref> They form [[H II region]]s such as the [[Orion Nebula]].\n\nOpen clusters usually contain up to a few hundred members, within a region up to about 30 light-years across. Being much less densely populated than globular clusters, they are much less tightly gravitationally bound, and over time, are disrupted by the gravity of [[giant molecular cloud]]s and other clusters. Close encounters between cluster members can also result in the ejection of stars, a process known as 'evaporation'.\n\nThe most prominent open clusters are the [[Pleiades]] and [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. The [[Double Cluster]] of [[NGC 869|h]]+[[NGC 884|Chi Persei]] can also be prominent under dark skies. Open clusters are often dominated by hot young blue stars, because although such stars are short-lived in stellar terms, only lasting a few tens of millions of years, open clusters tend to have dispersed before these stars die.\n\nEstablishing precise distances to open clusters enables the calibration of the period-luminosity relationship shown by [[Cepheids]] [[variable stars]], which are then used as [[standard candle]]s. Cepheids are luminous and can be used to establish both the distances to remote galaxies and the expansion rate of the Universe ([[Hubble constant]]). Indeed, the open cluster NGC 7790 hosts three [[classical Cepheids]] which are critical for such efforts.<ref name=sa1958>Sandage, Allan (1958).

Embedded clusters form in [[molecular clouds]], when the clouds begin to collapse and [[star formation|form stars]]. There is often ongoing star formation in these clusters, so embedded clusters may be home to various types of [[young stellar object]]s including [[protostar]]s and [[pre-main-sequence star]]s. An example of an embedded cluster is the [[Trapezium Cluster]] in the [[Orion Nebula]].

The designation, once assigned, is not to change, even if subsequent measurements improve on the location of the cluster center.<ref name=\"IAU 17GA 1979\">{{cite conference\n |url         = https://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1979_French.pdf\n |title       = XVIIth General Assembly\n |date        = Summer 1979\n |type        = 14\u201323 August 1979\n |publisher   = [[International Astronomical Union]]\n |page        = 13\n |location    = Montreal, Canada\n |access-date  = 18 December 2014\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150118133621/http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1979_French.pdf\n |archive-date = 18 January 2015\n |df          = \n}}</ref> The first of such designations were assigned by [[Gosta Lynga]] in 1982.<ref name=\"Lynga\">{{cite journal\n| last       = Lynga\n| first      = G.\n| date       = October 1982\n| title      = IAU numbers for some recently discovered clusters\n| bibcode        = 1982BICDS..23...89L\n| journal    = Bulletin d'Information du Centre de Donn\u00e9es Stellaires\n| volume     = 23\n| page       = 89\n}}<!--| accessdate = 18 December 2014\n--></ref><ref name=\"simbad\">{{cite web |url=http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/Dic-Simbad?C |title=Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects |date=1 December 2014<!-- last update as of 21 December 2014 --> |website=Simbad |publisher=Centre de donn\u00e9es astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate=21 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008193320/http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/Dic-Simbad?C |archivedate=8 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n{{Commons and category|Star cluster|Star clusters}}\n*[[Hypercompact stellar system]]\n*[[Open cluster]] and [[globular cluster]]\n*[[Protostar]]\n*[[Robust associations of massive baryonic objects|Robust associations of massive baryonic objects (RAMBOs)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=NB}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.univie.ac.at/webda/ WEBDA open cluster database]\n*[http://www.sky-map.org/?ra=7.6357&de=38.882&zoom=11&img_source=IMG_all NGC 2419] -Globular Cluster on SKY-MAP.ORG\n*[http://messier.seds.org/cluster.html Star Clusters], SEDS Messier pages\n*[http://www2.cfa.harvard.edu/rg/star_and_planet_formation/embedded_clusters.html RG Research: Embedded Clusters]\n*[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110473/star-cluster Star cluster - full article] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'',\n*[http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/super_star_cluster.html Super Star Cluster Discovered in Our Own Milky Way]\n*[http://de.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0506507 Probing the Birth of Super Star Clusters: Implications for Massive Star Formation], Kelsey E.
