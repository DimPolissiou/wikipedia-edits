To separate the judiciary from the executive, the Sapru committee suggested that judges should have fixed salaries and tenures, and that they could only be removed for gross misbehaviour. Judges were to be appointed by the president, in consultation with the CJI.  The committee appointed to deal with judicial questions as part of the Constituent Assembly in 1946 was influenced by the Sapru report, though there was concern over the degree of power given to presidential will. Nehru However supported the Sapru Committee's suggestions. In 1949, Nehru told the Constituent Assembly judges ought to be to be individuals of \u201cthe highest integrity,\u201d who could \u201cstand up against the executive government, and whoever may come in their way.\u201d BR Ambedkar emphasized the need for judicial independence as well, saying that:  \u201cThere can be no difference of opinion in the House that our judiciary must both be independent of the executive and must also be competent in itself.\u201d Finally, the constitution stated that  \u201cEvery Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose,\u201d given that \u201cin the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/law/what-judiciary-done-itself|title=What the Indian judiciary has done to itself|last=Dev|first=Atul|website=The Caravan|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n\n== Career Progression ==\n\nThe Career Progression of Judicial Officer is maximum up to the Chief Justice of India and act as Guardian of Judicial Institution of India. The Judicial Officer starts their career as Judicial Magistrate IInd Class in the cadre of Civil Judge (Junior Division). The candidates are also appointed as lateral entry on the post of District Judge (Entry level) directly from bar through the same competitive exam but must have more than 7 year of experience in the court. However, in India the JM-IInd Class post is considered as probation or training post and after completing the training period they posted as '''Judicial Magistrate-Ist Class''' cadre of Civil Judge (Junior Division). In their initial role they did not place on deputation but after few years experience if High Court require then go for deputation. After spending more than 5 year in junior division they are eligible to promote in the rank of Civil Judge (Senior Divison). \n\nIf it is late in the promotion then after 5 years of service they are entitled to draw Ist stage of '''annual career progression (ACP)''' pay scale for next 5 year and subsequently followed IInd ACP if another 5 year lapse crosses. The same methodology applied in the Senior Division. After few years in senior division, the High Court with the consent of Governor of respective state promote them into the cadre of District Judge (Entry level) i.e., Additional District & Session Judge as per the vacancy. When the judges in the rank of DJ with the administrative power then they known as (Principle) District & Session Judge of respective district. The officer of Jr. & Senior division are general control & subordinate to District & Session Judges and also to CJMs. ADJs are general control of respective high courts. \n\nThey are also vested with special power as Special Judge / Magistrate to deal with particular or specific matters like to deal with railway magistrate, CBI Judge / Magistrate, etc.Generally Judicial Officer who started their career as JM-Ist Class, have low chance to promote into the High Court Judge cadre. However, there were few Judges who also promoted to the Supreme Court of India like Prafulla Chandra Pant. The most of the Judicial officer appointed directly from bar in the cadre of higher judicial service have high probability to reach up to the Supreme Court & chance to raise up to the level of CJI, if service remain till their seniority. \n\nWith the purpose of enhancing the skills and experience of judges they also deputed the other sides other than court by High Courts like state & union ministries, high court & supreme court. There is post of '''Secretary General for Supreme Court, Union Law Secretary''' and other at union level equivalent in the rank of Secretary to the Government of India. District Judge rank officers are appointed on these post for temporary period. At state level they deputed on the post whose rank generally equivalent to the Principal Secretary of states.

After enactment, this word was substituted with the word \"District & Session Judge / Additional District & Session Judge\" respectively. Before separation of Judiciary from Executive, the post of Judicial Commissioner & Additional Judicial Commissioner were held by the senior members of Indian Civil Services i.e., IAS (SAG level or above). But after separation, the judicial member of the higher judicial services are being filled up on these posts. Currently, Ranchi and one or two districts have still recognized this position, however, it is occupied by Judicial member of Higher Judicial Services. \n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe district court or additional district court exercises jurisdiction both on [[original side]] and [[appellate side]] in civil and criminal matters arising in the district. The territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction in civil matters is usually set in concerned state enactments on the subject of civil courts. On the criminal side, jurisdiction is exclusively derived from the [[criminal procedure code]]. As per this code the maximum sentence a sessions judge of district court may award to a convict is [[capital punishment]].\n\nThe district court has appellate jurisdiction over all subordinate court or courts situated in the district on both civil and criminal matters. Subordinate courts, on the civil side (in ascending order) are, Junior Civil Judge Court,<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/JCJ-selection-plea-seeking-review-of-HC-order-dismissed/article13974437.ece</ref> Principal Junior Civil Judge Court, Senior Civil Judge Court (also called sub-court). Subordinate courts, on the criminal side, in ascending order, are Second Class Judicial Magistrate Court, First Class Judicial Magistrate Court, Chief Judicial Magistrate Court.\n\nCertain matters on criminal side or civil side cannot be tried by a lower court than a district court. This gives the district court original jurisdiction in such matters. \n\nAppeals from the district courts lie to the High Court of the concerned state.\n\n==See also==\n* [[District Munsiff Court]]\n* [[Sessions Court]]\n* [[Delhi District Courts]]\n* [[Nyaya Panchayat]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721165801/http://www.indiancourts.nic.in/sitesmain.htm District Court websites]\n* [http://districts.ecourts.gov.in/index.php District E-courts India]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130122225727/http://indiancourts.nic.in/districtcourt.html District Courts of India, official website]\n*[http://www.delhidistrictcourts.nic.in/ Delhi District Courts, official website]\n* [http://court.mah.nic.in/ Maharashtra District Courts, official website]\n\n{{Judiciary of India}}\n\n[[Category:Judiciary of India]]\n[[Category:District Courts of India]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Judicial wing of India}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=April 2019}}\n{{Infobox\n| title = INDIAN JUDICIARY<br>(\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u092a\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u093e)\n| subheaderstyle = background:#800080; color:white;\n| subheader1 = Service overview\n| image = [[File:Judiciary of India.png|225 \u00d7 224 pixelspx|frameless|center]]\n| caption = '''Motto:''' [[Yato Dharma Tato Jaya|\u092f\u0924\u094b \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094b \u091c\u092f\u0903\u0965]] ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: {{IAST|Yato Dharmastato Jaya\u1e25}})<br />Where there is righteousness (dharma), there is victory (jayah)\n| label3 = Formerly known as\n| data3 = [[Indian Judiciary|Federal Judiciary]]\n| label4 = [[Date of establishment|Founded]]\n| data4 = Regulating Act of 1773 (In 1774)\n| label5 = Country\n| data5 = [[India]]\n| label6 = Training Institute \n| data6 = National Judicial Academy (Bhopal)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nja.nic.in|title=National Judicial Academy|last=|first=|date=24 March 2020|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 March 2020}}</ref><br>State Judicial Academy  \n| label7 = Controlling authority\n| data7 =  Supreme Court<br>High Courts\n| label8 = Legal personality\n| data8 = [[Judiciary]]; [[Judicial service]]\n| label9 = Duties\n| data9 = Provide Justice to Victim<br>Punish the Offenders \n| label10 = Hierarchy of Courts in India \n| data10 = Supreme Court<br>High Courts<br>Subordinate Courts - Civil & Criminal<br>Executive / Revenue Court  \n| label11 = Post Designation \n| data11 = Justice<br>Judge<br>Magistrate - Judicial & Executive \n| label12 = [[En cadre|Cadre strength]]\n| data12 =  23,790 Judges strength (34 in Supreme Court, 1079 for High Court, 22677 for Subordinate Court)\n| label13 = Selection / Appointment \n| data13 = President of India for SC & HC Judges<br>State Public Commission for Subordinate Court Judges\n| label14 = [[Chief Justice of India]]\n| data14 = '''Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde''', '''CJI'''\n}}\n{{expert-subject|India|ex2=Politics|date=February 2009}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}\n{{Courts of India}}\nThe '''District Courts''' of [[India]] are the [[district court]]s of the [[State governments in India]] for every district or for one or more districts together taking into account of the number of cases, population distribution in the district.

In 1949, Nehru told the Constituent Assembly judges ought to be to be individuals of \u201cthe highest integrity,\u201d who could \u201cstand up against the executive government, and whoever may come in their way.\u201d BR Ambedkar emphasized the need for judicial independence as well, saying that:  \u201cThere can be no difference of opinion in the House that our judiciary must both be independent of the executive and must also be competent in itself.\u201d Finally, the constitution stated that  \u201cEvery Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose,\u201d given that \u201cin the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/law/what-judiciary-done-itself|title=What the Indian judiciary has done to itself|last=Dev|first=Atul|website=The Caravan|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n\n== Career Progression ==\n\nThe Career Progression of Judicial Officer is maximum upto the Chief Justice of India and act as Guardian of Judicial Institution of India. The Judicial Officer starts their career as Judicial Magistrate IInd Class in the cadre of Civil Judge (Junior Division). The candidates are also appointed as lateral entry on the post of District Judge (Entry level) directly from bar through the same competitive exam but must have more than 7 year of experience in the court. However, in India the JM-IInd Class post is considered as probation or training post and after completing the training period they posted as '''Judicial Magistrate-Ist Class''' cadre of Civil Judge (Junior Division). In their initial role they didn't place on deputation but after few year experiences if High Court require then go for deputation. After spending more than 5 year in junior division they are eligible to promote in the rank of Civil Judge (Senior Divison). \n\nIf there is late in the promotion then after 5 year of service they are entitled to draw Ist stage of '''annual career progression (ACP)''' pay scale for next 5 year and subsequently followed IInd ACP if another 5 year lapse crosses. The same methodology applied in the Senior Division. After few year in senior division the High Court with the consent of Governor of respective state promote them into the cadre of District Judge (Entry level) i.e., Additional District & Session Judge as per the vacancy. When the judges in the rank of DJ with the administrative power then they known as (Principle) District & Session Judge of respective district.

After enactment, this word was substituted with the word \"District & Session Judge / Additional District & Session Judge\" respectively. Before separation of Judiciary from Executive, the post of Judicial Commissioner & Additional Judicial Commissioner were held by the senior members of Indian Civil Services i.e., IAS (SAG level or above). But after separation, the judicial member of the higher judicial services are being filled up on these posts. Currently, Ranchi and one or two districts have still recognized this position, however, it is occupied by Judicial member of Higher Judicial Services. \n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe district court or additional district court exercises jurisdiction both on [[original side]] and [[appellate side]] in civil and criminal matters arising in the district. The territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction in civil matters is usually set in concerned state enactments on the subject of civil courts. On the criminal side, jurisdiction is exclusively derived from the [[criminal procedure code]]. As per this code the maximum sentence a sessions judge of district court may award to a convict is [[capital punishment]].\n\nThe district court has appellate jurisdiction over all subordinate court or courts situated in the district on both civil and criminal matters. Subordinate courts, on the civil side (in ascending order) are, Junior Civil Judge Court,<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/JCJ-selection-plea-seeking-review-of-HC-order-dismissed/article13974437.ece</ref> Principal Junior Civil Judge Court, Senior Civil Judge Court (also called sub-court). Subordinate courts, on the criminal side, in ascending order, are Second Class Judicial Magistrate Court, First Class Judicial Magistrate Court, Chief Judicial Magistrate Court.\n\nCertain matters on criminal side or civil side cannot be tried by a lower court than a district court. This gives the district court original jurisdiction in such matters. \n\nAppeals from the district courts lie to the High Court of the concerned state.\n\n==See also==\n* [[District Munsiff Court]]\n* [[Sessions Court]]\n* [[Delhi District Courts]]\n* [[Nyaya Panchayat]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721165801/http://www.indiancourts.nic.in/sitesmain.htm District Court websites]\n* [http://districts.ecourts.gov.in/index.php District E-courts India]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130122225727/http://indiancourts.nic.in/districtcourt.html District Courts of India, official website]\n*[http://www.delhidistrictcourts.nic.in/ Delhi District Courts, official website]\n* [http://court.mah.nic.in/ Maharashtra District Courts, official website]\n\n{{Judiciary of India}}\n\n[[Category:Judiciary of India]]\n[[Category:District Courts of India]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "their\u2192there; some cleanup", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_courts_of_India"}

The objectives of the policy included creating a more responsive system that would simplify and incentivise a return to work, pay benefits in a monthly cycle more akin to salaries, reduce the high [[marginal deduction rate]] that accumulates from the withdrawal of more than one means-tested benefit simultaneously improving incentives, ensure that taking on even a small or varying amount of work would be financially rewarding, and reduce the proportion of children growing up in homes where no one worked. Universal Credit would merge out-of-work benefits and in-work support to improve return to work incentives.
