It entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985, and was registered by the PRC and UK governments at the [[United Nations]] on 12 June 1985. In the Joint Declaration, the PRC Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including the perpetual British territories of [[Hong Kong Island]] and [[Kowloon Peninsula|Kowloon]], and the leased [[New Territories]]) with effect from 1 July 1997, and the UK Government declared that it would hand over Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. The PRC Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong in the document.\n\nIn accordance with the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle agreed between the UK and the PRC, the socialist system of PRC would not be practised in the Hong Kong [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years until 2047. The Joint Declaration provides that these basic policies should be stipulated in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and that the socialist system and socialist policies shall not be practised in HKSAR. \n\nDuring the [[Umbrella Revolution]] in 2014, a campaign against the perceived infringements in the HKSAR by mainland China, Chinese officials said, for the first time, that China considered the Joint Declaration \"void\", a position dismissed as \"clearly wrong\" by a senior Hong Kong legal scholar and rejected by the British foreign secretary, who noted that the document was a legally binding agreement that must be honoured.<ref name=\"scmp-void\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3017318/explainer-what-sino-british-joint-declaration-and-what-does/ |title=Explainer: What is the Sino-British Joint Declaration and what does it have to do with Hong Kong\u2019s extradition crisis?| |last= Cheung|first=Gary| work = South China Morning Post | date = 4 July 2019 | accessdate = 15 April 2020 }}</ref> [[Rita Fan]], then Hong Kong\u2019s only representative to the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing, asserted that Britain\u2019s supervisory responsibility had lapsed and, furthermore, that the Joint Declaration does not stipulate universal suffrage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/18/does-china-think-the-sino-british-joint-declaration-is-void/|title=Does China Think the Sino-British Joint Declaration Is Void?|date=December 18, 2014|newspaper=Foreign Policy}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Acquisition of Hong Kong.svg|thumb|left|200px|Great Britain acquired [[Hong Kong Island]] in 1842, [[Kowloon Peninsula]] in 1860, and leased the [[New Territories]] in 1898 for 99 years.]]\nThe background of the Sino-British Joint Declaration was the pending expiration of the lease of the New Territories on 1 July 1997.<ref name=hearings>{{Cite book | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | isbn = 0160556651 | last = United States | title = Hong Kong's reversion to the People's Republic of China: hearing before the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, One Hundred Fifth Congress, first session, February 13, 1997 | location = Washington | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3VFXMorS0uUC }}</ref> The lease was negotiated between the UK and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] of China, and was for a period of 99 years starting from 1 July 1898 under the [[Second Convention of Peking]]. At the time of the lease signing, Hong Kong Island had already been ceded to the UK in perpetuity under the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] in 1842 after the [[First Opium War]], and the southern part of the Kowloon Peninsula as well as the Stonecutters Island had also been ceded to the UK in perpetuity under the [[Convention of Beijing]] in 1860 after the [[Second Opium War]].\n\nThe prospect of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule \u2013 by negotiation or by force \u2013 had been a concern throughout British rule. These concerns briefly subsided after 1967 as mainland China was thrown into disarray with the [[Cultural Revolution]], while the corresponding [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots]] resulted in a loss of native Hong Kong support for returning to PRC rule, and brought international sympathy to the side of the British colonial government. By 1979, China had restored its political order and became more assertive in neighboring affairs, notably [[Sino-Vietnamese War|intervening in Vietnam]] in 1979. Throughout the early 1980s the territory and its business community grew concerned about the future of Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 9780191533082 | pages = 168\u2012185 | editors = Andrew Simpson (ed.) | last = Simpson | first = Andrew | title = Language and National Identity in Asia | chapter = Hong Kong | location = Oxford; New York | year = 2007 }}</ref> These concerns, regarding the status of property rights and contracts, were spurred by political uncertainty surrounding the scheduled reversion of the New Territories to the PRC.<ref name=\"tsang\" /> In March 1979, the [[Governor of Hong Kong]], [[Murray MacLehose]], visited Beijing.  During this visit, informal talks about the future of Hong Kong began. Upon his return, MacLehose attempted to allay investors' worries about the scheduled reversion, but reiterated that the PRC asserted its intention to regain sovereignty over Hong Kong.<ref name=\"tsang\" /> The first formal negotiations began with chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] during the visit of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, to China in September 1982.<ref name=tsang>{{Cite book | publisher = I.B.

It shall maintain the capitalist economic and trade systems previously practised in Hong Kong.\nThe third paragraph lists the PRC's basic policies regarding Hong Kong:\n* National unity and territorial integrity shall be upheld and a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall be established.<ref>[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.1</ref>\n* \"The [HKSAR] will be directly under the authority of the Central People's Government of the [PRC and] will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs.\" \"<ref>[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.2</ref>\n* \"The [HKSAR] will be vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. The laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged.\"<ref>[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.3</ref>\n* \"The Government of the [HKSAR] will be composed of local inhabitants. The chief executive will be appointed by the Central People's Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally. Principal officials will be nominated by the chief executive of the [HKSAR] for appointment by the Central People's Government. Chinese and foreign nationals previously working in the public and police services in the government departments of Hong Kong may remain in employment. British and other foreign nationals may also be employed to serve as advisers or hold certain public posts in government departments of the [HKSAR].\"<ref>[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.4</ref>\n* \"The current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the life-style. Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief will be ensured by law in the [HKSAR]. Private property, ownership of enterprises, legitimate right of inheritance and foreign investment will be protected by law.\"<ref>[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.5</ref>\n* \"The [HKSAR] will retain the status of a free port and a separate customs territory.

The HKSAR may authorise designated banks to issue or continue to issue Hong Kong currency under statutory authority.<ref>[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.7</ref>\n* It will have independent finances with its own budgets and final accounts, but reporting it to the Central People's Government.

In doing so it may maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and agreements with states, regions and relevant international organisations on its own and it may issue travel documents for Hong Kong. International agreements to which the PRC is not a party but Hong Kong is may remain implemented in the HKSAR.\n* The government of the HKSAR is responsible for the maintenance of public order. Military forces sent by the Central People's Government, stationed in HKSAR, for the purpose of defence shall not interfere in the internal affairs in the HKSAR.\n* Those basic policies will be stipulated in a Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the PRC by the [[National People's Congress]] and will remain unchanged for 50 years.\n\nThe Government of the United Kingdom will be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong with the object of maintaining and preserving its economic prosperity and social stability until 30 June 1997 and the Government of the PRC will give its co-operation in this connection.\n\nFurthermore, this declaration regulates the right of abode, those of passports and immigration. All Chinese nationals who were born or who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of seven years or more are qualified to obtain permanent identity cards. Those cardholders can also get a passport of the HKSAR, which is valid for all states and regions. But the entry into the HKSAR of persons from other parts of China shall continue to be regulated in accordance with the present practice.\n\n===PRC's basic policies regarding Hong Kong (Annex I)===\nThis annexe is called the ''Elaboration by the government of the People's Republic of China of its basic policies regarding Hong Kong''. It is partly mentioned in the summary above and deals in detail with the way Hong Kong will work after 1 July 1997. The annexe consist of following sections:\n:(I) Constitutional arrangements and government structure;\n:(II) the laws;\n:(III) the judicial system;\n:(IV) the public service;\n:(V) the financial system;\n:(VI) the economic system and external economic relations;\n:(VII) the monetary system;\n:(VIII) shipping;\n:(IX) civil aviation;\n:(X) education;\n:(XI) foreign affairs;\n:(XII) defence, security and public order;\n:(XIII) basic rights and freedoms;\n:(XIV) right of abode, travel and immigration.\n\n===Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (Annex II)===\nAnnex II set up the Sino\u2013British Joint Liaison Group. That group came into force at 1 July 1988 and continued its work until 1 January 2000. Its functions were\n:a) to conduct consultations on the implementation of the Joint Declaration\n:b) to discuss matters relating to the smooth transfer of government in 1997\n:c) to exchange information and conduct consultations on such subjects as may be agreed by the two sides.<ref>Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, The Government of the HKSAR. [http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/joint2.htm#3 \"The Joint Declaration and its Implementation], 1 July 2007.</ref>\n\nThis Group was an organ for liaison and not of power, where each side could send up to 20 supporting staff members. It should meet at least once in each of the three locations (Beijing, London and Hong Kong) in each year. From 1 July 1988 onwards it was based in Hong Kong. It should also assist the HKSAR to maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and conclude agreements on these matters with states, regions and relevant international organisations and could therefore set up specialist sub-groups. Between 1985 and 2000 the Joint Liaison Group held 47 plenary meetings whereof 18 were held in Hong Kong, 15 in London and 14 in Beijing.\n\nOne of the main achievements had been to ensure the continuity of the independent judiciary in Hong Kong, including agreements in the areas of law of Merchant Shipping, Civil Aviation, Nuclear Material, Whale Fisheries, Submarine Telegraph, Outer Space and many others. Furthermore, it agreed to a network of bilateral agreements between Hong Kong and other countries. Within those agreements were reached on the continued application of about 200 international conventions to the HKSAR after 30 June 1997. Hong Kong should also continue to participate in various international organisations after the handover.\n\n===Land Leases (Annex III)===\nAccording to the Land Leases annexe, all leased lands granted by the British Hong Kong Government which extend beyond 30 June 1997, and all rights in relation to such leases, shall continue to be recognised and protected under the law of the HKSAR for a period expiring not longer than 30 June 2047. Furthermore, a Land Commission shall be established with equal number of officials from the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the PRC which was dissolved on 30 June 1997. This commission was established in 1985 and met in Hong Kong for 35 formal meetings and agreed on 26 legal documents, within the granting of the land required for the new airport at [[Chek Lap Kok]] in 1994.\n\n===United Kingdom Memorandum===\nIn this memorandum the Government of the United Kingdom declared that all persons who hold [[British Dependent Territories citizen]]ship (BDTCs) through an affiliation with Hong Kong would cease to be BDTCs on 1 July 1997.  After the declaration, the [[Hong Kong Act 1985]] and the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986 created the category [[British National (Overseas)]]. BDTCs were allowed to apply for British National (Overseas) status until July 1997, but this status does not in of itself grant the [[right of abode]] anywhere, including the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.  After the handover, most former BDTCs became citizens of the People's Republic of China.  Any who were ineligible for PRC citizenship and who had not applied for BN(O) status automatically became [[British Overseas citizen]]s.\n\n{{see also|British nationality law and Hong Kong|British nationality law}}\n\n===Chinese Memorandum===\n''\"Under the National Law of the PRC, all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether they are holders of the 'British Dependent Territories Citizens' Passport' or not, are Chinese nationals.\"''  Those people who use travel documents issued by the Government of the United Kingdom are permitted to use them for the purpose of travelling to other states and regions, but they will not be entitled to British consular protection in the HKSAR and other parts of the PRC.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Early years===\nAfter signing of the declaration, the [[Sino\u2013British Joint Liaison Group]] was set up according to the Annex II of the declaration.\n\nThe transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong (referred to as the \"return\" or \"handover\" by the Chinese and British press respectively) occurred as scheduled on 1 July 1997. Since the return just a few things changed, such as the flag of Hong Kong and the [[Prince of Wales Building]] being renamed the People's Liberation Army Building. Post boxes were repainted green, as per the practice in China. Street names have remained unchanged and the [[Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club]] has kept its \"Royal\" prefix, although the [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]] and other institutions have given up this title.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/1996/0610/061096.intl.intl.2.html A Battle Royal Rocks Imperial Yacht Club], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 10 June 1996</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1997 the Hong Kong measures were taken with the full co-operation of the Central Chinese government. This did not mean that the Chinese government dictated what to do and therefore still follows the points of the declaration.<ref name=\"Mc\">McLaren, Robin. [http://www.hkjournal.org/PDF/2007_fall/5.pdf  \"Hong Kong 1997\u20132007: a personal perspective\"], retrieved at 17 April 2010.</ref> \n \nDespite this autonomy, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region sometimes sought interference from the Central Chinese government. For example, in 1999 the government of the HKSAR asked China's State Council to seek an interpretation by the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] on a provision in the Basic Law. The original decision reached by the [[Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal]] was seen as problematic by the HKSAR government as it would have allowed up to 1.6&nbsp;million mainland immigrants to enter Hong Kong. The Chinese authorities obliged and the Hong Kong court's judgment was overturned, stopping the potential immigration.<ref name=\"Frank\">Ching, Frank.

Another senior official advised businessmen not to do business with pro-independence Taiwanese.<ref name=\"Frank\" />\n\nWith this and other changes,<ref name=\"Frank\" /> ten years after the return, in 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that on the one hand, \"nothing has changed since the handover to China 10 years ago\", but this was in comparison to the situation before the last governor [[Chris Patten]] had introduced [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|democratic reforms]] three years before the handover. A chance for democracy had been lost as Hong Kong had just begun to develop three vital elements for a western-style democracy (the [[rule of law]], official accountability and a political class outside the one-party system) but the Sino\u2013British deal had prevented any of these changes to continue according to Jonathan Fenby of ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{cite news|date= 1 July 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/01/thepriceofthestatusquo |title=Hong Kong's business as usual|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}.</ref>{{Opinion|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[Wu Bangguo]], the chairman of the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] stated in a conference in Beijing 2007, that \"Hong Kong had considerable autonomy only because the central government had chosen to authorize that autonomy\".<ref>Keith Bradsher, 7 June 2007, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E2D61E30F934A35755C0A9619C8B63&scp=9&sq=sino-british%20joint%20declaration&st=cse \"World Briefing.

It entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985, and was registered by the PRC and UK governments at the [[United Nations]] on 12 June 1985. In the Joint Declaration, the PRC Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including the perpetual British territories of [[Hong Kong Island]] and [[Kowloon Peninsula|Kowloon]], and the leased [[New Territories]]) with effect from 1 July 1997, and the UK Government declared that it would hand over Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. The PRC Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong in the document.\n\nIn accordance with the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle agreed between the UK and the PRC, the socialist system of PRC would not be practised in the Hong Kong [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years until 2047. The Joint Declaration provides that these basic policies should be stipulated in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and that the socialist system and socialist policies shall not be practised in HKSAR. \n\nDuring the [[Umbrella Revolution]] in 2014, a campaign against the perceived infringements in the HKSAR by mainland China, Chinese officials said, for the first time, that China considered the Joint Declaration \"void\", a position dismissed as \"clearly wrong\" by a senior Hong Kong legal scholar and rejected by the the British foreign secretary, who noted that the document was a legally binding agreement that must be honoured.<ref name=\"scmp-void\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3017318/explainer-what-sino-british-joint-declaration-and-what-does/ |title=Explainer: What is the Sino-British Joint Declaration and what does it have to do with Hong Kong\u2019s extradition crisis?| |last= Cheung|first=Gary| work = South China Morning Post | date = 4 July 2019 | accessdate = 15 April 2020 }}</ref> [[Rita Fan]], then Hong Kong\u2019s only representative to the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing, asserted that Britain\u2019s supervisory responsibility had lapsed and, furthermore, that the Joint Declaration does not stipulate universal suffrage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/18/does-china-think-the-sino-british-joint-declaration-is-void/|title=Does China Think the Sino-British Joint Declaration Is Void?|date=December 18, 2014|newspaper=Foreign Policy}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Acquisition of Hong Kong.svg|thumb|left|200px|Great Britain acquired [[Hong Kong Island]] in 1842, [[Kowloon Peninsula]] in 1860, and leased the [[New Territories]] in 1898 for 99 years.]]\nThe background of the Sino-British Joint Declaration was the pending expiration of the lease of the New Territories on 1 July 1997.<ref name=hearings>{{Cite book | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | isbn = 0160556651 | last = United States | title = Hong Kong's reversion to the People's Republic of China: hearing before the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, One Hundred Fifth Congress, first session, February 13, 1997 | location = Washington | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3VFXMorS0uUC }}</ref> The lease was negotiated between the UK and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] of China, and was for a period of 99 years starting from 1 July 1898 under the [[Second Convention of Peking]]. At the time of the lease signing, Hong Kong Island had already been ceded to the UK in perpetuity under the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] in 1842 after the [[First Opium War]], and the southern part of the Kowloon Peninsula as well as the Stonecutters Island had also been ceded to the UK in perpetuity under the [[Convention of Beijing]] in 1860 after the [[Second Opium War]].\n\nThe prospect of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule \u2013 by negotiation or by force \u2013 had been a concern throughout British rule. These concerns briefly subsided after 1967 as mainland China was thrown into disarray with the [[Cultural Revolution]], while the corresponding [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots]] resulted in a loss of native Hong Kong support for returning to PRC rule, and brought international sympathy to the side of the British colonial government. By 1979, China had restored its political order and became more assertive in neighboring affairs, notably [[Sino-Vietnamese War|intervening in Vietnam]] in 1979. Throughout the early 1980s the territory and its business community grew concerned about the future of Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 9780191533082 | pages = 168\u2012185 | editors = Andrew Simpson (ed.) | last = Simpson | first = Andrew | title = Language and National Identity in Asia | chapter = Hong Kong | location = Oxford; New York | year = 2007 }}</ref> These concerns, regarding the status of property rights and contracts, were spurred by political uncertainty surrounding the scheduled reversion of the New Territories to the PRC.<ref name=\"tsang\" /> In March 1979, the [[Governor of Hong Kong]], [[Murray MacLehose]], visited Beijing.  During this visit, informal talks about the future of Hong Kong began. Upon his return, MacLehose attempted to allay investors' worries about the scheduled reversion, but reiterated that the PRC asserted its intention to regain sovereignty over Hong Kong.<ref name=\"tsang\" /> The first formal negotiations began with chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] during the visit of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, to China in September 1982.<ref name=tsang>{{Cite book | publisher = I.B.

In April 1984, the two sides concluded the initial discussion of these matters, and arranged that Hong Kong would retain a 'high' degree of autonomy under Chinese sovereignty with the preservation of the maintained lifestyle in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"tucker\" /> By 18 September 1984, both sides had approved the English and Chinese texts of the documents and the associated Exchange of [[Memoranda]].\n\nThe signing of the Joint Declaration caused some controversy in Britain because UK's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] was agreeing with the [[Communist Party of China|China's Communist government]] represented by [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref name=\"name\"/> In the White Paper that contained the Joint Declaration, it was declared by [[Her Majesty's Government]] that \"the alternative to acceptance of the present agreement is to have no agreement\", a statement meant as a rebuttal to criticisms that the declaration had made too many concessions to China, and hinting at China's significant leverage during the negotiations.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~pchksar/JD/jd-full1.htm|title=Sino\u2013British Joint Declaration|publisher=[[Hong Kong Baptist University]]|page=29|accessdate=8 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031208081141/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~pchksar/JD/jd-full1.htm|archivedate=8 December 2003}}</ref>\n\nSome political analysts thought that there was an urgency to make an agreement because there were fears that without a treaty the [[Economy of Hong Kong|economy in Hong Kong]] would collapse in the 1980s. Concerns about land ownership in the leased New Territories also added to the problem. Although discussions on the future of Hong Kong had started in the late 1970s, the final timing of the Joint Declaration was more affected by property and economic factors rather than geopolitical necessities.<ref name=\"name\"/>\n\n==Announcement contents==\n\n===Joint Declaration===\nThe Sino\u2013British Joint Declaration consists of eight paragraphs, three Annexes about the Basic Policies regarding Hong Kong, the [[Sino\u2013British Joint Liaison Group]] and the Land Leases as well as the two Memoranda of the two sides.

It shall be allowed to have executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. The Basic Law explains that in addition to Chinese, English may also be used in organs of government and that apart from the national flag and national emblem of the PRC the HKSAR may use a regional flag and emblem of its own. It shall maintain the capitalist economic and trade systems previously practised in Hong Kong.\nThe third paragraph lists the PRC's basic policies regarding Hong Kong:\n* National unity and territorial integrity shall be upheld and a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall be established.<ref>[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.1</ref>\n* \"The [HKSAR] will be directly under the authority of the Central People's Government of the [PRC and] will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs.\" \"<ref>[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.2</ref>\n* \"The [HKSAR] will be vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication.

In doing so it may maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and agreements with states, regions and relevant international organisations on its own and it may issue travel documents for Hong Kong. International agreements to which the PRC is not a party but Hong Kong is may remain implemented in the HKSAR.\n* The government of the HKSAR is responsible for the maintenance of public order. Military forces sent by the Central People's Government, stationed in HKSAR, for the purpose of defence shall not interfere in the internal affairs in the HKSAR.\n* Those basic policies will be stipulated in a Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the PRC by the [[National People's Congress]] and will remain unchanged for 50 years.\n\nThe Government of the United Kingdom will be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong with the object of maintaining and preserving its economic prosperity and social stability until 30 June 1997 and the Government of the PRC will give its co-operation in this connection.\n\nFurthermore, this declaration regulates the right of abode, those of passports and immigration. All Chinese nationals who were born or who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of seven years or more are qualified to obtain permanent identity cards. Those cardholders can also get a passport of the HKSAR, which is valid for all states and regions. But the entry into the HKSAR of persons from other parts of China shall continue to be regulated in accordance with the present practice.\n\n===PRC's basic policies regarding Hong Kong (Annex I)===\nThis annexe is called the ''Elaboration by the government of the People's Republic of China of its basic policies regarding Hong Kong''. It is partly mentioned in the summary above and deals in detail with the way Hong Kong will work after 1 July 1997. The annexe consist of following sections:\n:(I) Constitutional arrangements and government structure;\n:(II) the laws;\n:(III) the judicial system;\n:(IV) the public service;\n:(V) the financial system;\n:(VI) the economic system and external economic relations;\n:(VII) the monetary system;\n:(VIII) shipping;\n:(IX) civil aviation;\n:(X) education;\n:(XI) foreign affairs;\n:(XII) defence, security and public order;\n:(XIII) basic rights and freedoms;\n:(XIV) right of abode, travel and immigration.\n\n===Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (Annex II)===\nAnnex II set up the Sino\u2013British Joint Liaison Group. That group came into force at 1 July 1988 and continued its work until 1 January 2000. Its functions were\n:a) to conduct consultations on the implementation of the Joint Declaration\n:b) to discuss matters relating to the smooth transfer of government in 1997\n:c) to exchange information and conduct consultations on such subjects as may be agreed by the two sides.<ref>Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, The Government of the HKSAR. [http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/joint2.htm#3 \"The Joint Declaration and its Implementation], 1 July 2007.</ref>\n\nThis Group was an organ for liaison and not of power, where each side could send up to 20 supporting staff members. It should meet at least once in each of the three locations (Beijing, London and Hong Kong) in each year. From 1 July 1988 onwards it was based in Hong Kong. It should also assist the HKSAR to maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and conclude agreements on these matters with states, regions and relevant international organisations and could therefore set up specialist sub-groups. Between 1985 and 2000 the Joint Liaison Group held 47 plenary meetings whereof 18 were held in Hong Kong, 15 in London and 14 in Beijing.\n\nOne of the main achievements had been to ensure the continuity of the independent judiciary in Hong Kong, including agreements in the areas of law of Merchant Shipping, Civil Aviation, Nuclear Material, Whale Fisheries, Submarine Telegraph, Outer Space and many others. Furthermore, it agreed to a network of bilateral agreements between Hong Kong and other countries. Within those agreements were reached on the continued application of about 200 international conventions to the HKSAR after 30 June 1997. Hong Kong should also continue to participate in various international organisations after the handover.\n\n===Land Leases (Annex III)===\nAccording to the Land Leases annexe, all leased lands granted by the British Hong Kong Government which extend beyond 30 June 1997, and all rights in relation to such leases, shall continue to be recognised and protected under the law of the HKSAR for a period expiring not longer than 30 June 2047. Furthermore, a Land Commission shall be established with equal number of officials from the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the PRC which was dissolved on 30 June 1997. This commission was established in 1985 and met in Hong Kong for 35 formal meetings and agreed on 26 legal documents, within the granting of the land required for the new airport at [[Chek Lap Kok]] in 1994.\n\n===United Kingdom Memorandum===\nIn this memorandum the Government of the United Kingdom declared that all persons who hold [[British Dependent Territories citizen]]ship (BDTCs) through an affiliation with Hong Kong would cease to be BDTCs on 1 July 1997.  After the declaration, the [[Hong Kong Act 1985]] and the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986 created the category [[British National (Overseas)]]. BDTCs were allowed to apply for British National (Overseas) status until July 1997, but this status does not in of itself grant the [[right of abode]] anywhere, including the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.  After the handover, most former BDTCs became citizens of the People's Republic of China.  Any who were ineligible for PRC citizenship and who had not applied for BN(O) status automatically became [[British Overseas citizen]]s.\n\n{{see also|British nationality law and Hong Kong|British nationality law}}\n\n===Chinese Memorandum===\n''\"Under the National Law of the PRC, all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether they are holders of the 'British Dependent Territories Citizens' Passport' or not, are Chinese nationals.\"''  Those people who use travel documents issued by the Government of the United Kingdom are permitted to use them for the purpose of travelling to other states and regions, but they will not be entitled to British consular protection in the HKSAR and other parts of the PRC.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Early years===\nAfter signing of the declaration, the [[Sino\u2013British Joint Liaison Group]] was set up according to the Annex II of the declaration.\n\nThe transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong (referred to as the \"return\" or \"handover\" by the Chinese and British press respectively) occurred as scheduled on 1 July 1997. Since the return just a few things changed, such as the flag of Hong Kong and the [[Prince of Wales Building]] being renamed the People's Liberation Army Building. Post boxes were repainted green, as per the practice in China. Street names have remained unchanged and the [[Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club]] has kept its \"Royal\" prefix, although the [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]] and other institutions have given up this title.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/1996/0610/061096.intl.intl.2.html A Battle Royal Rocks Imperial Yacht Club], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 10 June 1996</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1997 the Hong Kong measures were taken with the full co-operation of the Central Chinese government.

For example, in early 1845, Young convened a conference at the Norwegian colony at [[Norway, Illinois]], and announced a plan to build a Latter-day Saint town there with a temple for the use of the Norwegian Latter Day Saints.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haslam |first1=Gerald M. |title=The Illinois Milieu of the First Norwegian Converts to Mormonism in the Early 1840s |journal=BYU Family Historian |date=2007 |volume=6 |url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&context=byufamilyhistorian |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Young urged the Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo to redouble their efforts to finish the temple. By the end of 1845, the building was sufficiently finished to allow [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|temple ordinances]] to be performed. Ordinances continued to be performed in early 1846 as the Mormons were forced to abandon the city.

The [[St. George Utah Temple|St. George Temple]] was the first to be completed in 1877, followed by [[Logan Utah Temple|Logan]] (1884) and [[Manti Utah Temple|Manti]] (1888). The [[Salt Lake Temple]] took 40 years to complete because of various setbacks and delays. It was dedicated in 1893.\n\nLatter-day Saint temple building halted until the presidency of [[Joseph F. Smith]], who announced two additional temples: [[Cardston Alberta Temple|Cardston, Alberta]] (1913), and [[Laie Hawaii Temple|L\u0101{{okina}}{{Not a typo|ie}}, Hawai{{okina}}i]] (1915). Cardston became the first Latter-day Saint temple dedicated outside of the United States. Smith broke with the previous tradition (established since Kirtland) of building temples with upper and lower courts. Temples previously had been ever larger, but the Laie Hawaii Temple was smaller than the Nauvoo Temple had been.\n\nBoth Cardston and Laie were dedicated under church president [[Heber J. Grant]], as was a temple in [[Mesa Arizona Temple|Mesa, Arizona]]. [[George Albert Smith]] dedicated the next temple in [[Idaho Falls Idaho Temple|Idaho Falls, Idaho]]. [[David O. McKay]] dedicated five additional temples including one in [[Bern Switzerland Temple|Bern, Switzerland]]\u2014which was the first temple dedicated in Europe and the first temple to use film recording of the endowment rather than live actors. [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] dedicated a temple in [[Ogden Utah Temple|Ogden, Utah]] and [[Harold B. Lee]] dedicated its twin in [[Provo Utah Temple|Provo, Utah]].\n\n[[File:Logan Utah Temple.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Logan Utah Temple]]]]\n\n[[Spencer W. Kimball]] began a plan to build many more smaller temples according to standardized plans. Twenty-one temples were dedicated during his presidency, including the tiny [[Papeete Tahiti Temple]]\u2014which has a floorspace of less than 10,000 square feet (900 m\u00b2). This trend has continued. Nine additional temples were dedicated in the presidency of [[Ezra Taft Benson]] and two in the brief presidency of [[Howard W. Hunter]].\n\n{{anchor|Small_temples}}Under church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], the church dedicated 77 temples. In 1997, Hinckley introduced a standardized, smaller temple plan designed to bring temple services to smaller or remote congregations at a reduced cost. The first of this new generation of temples was completed in 1998 with the [[Monticello Utah Temple]]. The original plan called for {{convert|6800|sqft}}, later increased to {{convert|10700|sqft}}. Subsequent revisions to the standard design further increased the size and complexity of the temples. The majority of the temples dedicated under Hinckley's tenure were of the smaller design, but one particularly noteworthy achievement was the rebuilding of the temple in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], known as the [[Nauvoo Illinois Temple]].\n\nHinckely's successor, [[Thomas S. Monson]], dedicated 26 temples during his time as church president.  His counselors in the First Presidency also dedicated a number of temples during Monson's administration.\n\nAs of October 2018, Monson's successor and current church president, [[Russell M.

They are taught that temple ordinances are essential to achieving the condition of [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] after the [[final judgment]]. They are also taught that a vast number of dead souls exist in a condition termed as [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]], and that a dead individual upon whom the temple ordinances are completed will have a chance to be freed of this imprisoning condition. In this framework ordinances are said to be completed on behalf of either the participant, or a dead individual the same sex as the participant (\"on behalf of the dead\" or \"by proxy\").\n\nOrdinances performed in the temple include:\n* [[Baptism for the dead|Baptism]] and [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]] on behalf of the dead\n* [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] [[ordination]] on behalf of the dead\n* [[Washing and anointing]] (also known as the \"Initiatory\" ordinances)\n* The [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]]\n* [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]] ordinances (for opposite-sex couples and for parents and their children)\n\nMost ordinances are performed by proxy only on participants who have already completed the ordinance. Similarly, most ordinances are completed only one time for a participant in a lifetime and all subsequent temple ordinance participation is seen as acting for a dead individual. Baptism, confirmation, and priesthood ordination are usually performed in temples only when on behalf of the dead. The initiatory, endowment, and sealing ceremonies are today performed only within a temple.\n\nThe sealing ordinance can be performed on behalf of dead couples; so long as the two living participants are of opposite sex they need not be married. It is also performed on behalf of living couples who wish to be legally married. In this manner, the ordinance is typically performed as a [[celestial marriage]], with the idea the marriage bond lasts after their death, or for \"time and all eternity\". A \"time only\" modification can be made to the ordinance, such as when the surviving widow of a celestial marriage wishes to legally remarry.<ref>{{citation |title= [[Church Handbook of Instructions]], Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= LDS Church |page= 71 |year= 2010}}</ref> If children were born to the couple prior to the couple's sealing ceremony, the parents and the children may also be sealed together to form an eternal family unit. Children born to a couple after the sealing ceremony are considered to be automatically sealed to the parents, or \"born in the covenant\".\n\nIn addition to the ordinances listed above, 19th century temples were host to other ordinances that are no longer practiced such as the baptism for health and baptism for renewal of covenants.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stapley|first1=Jonathan|last2=Wright|first2=Kristine|title=\u2018They Shall Be Made Whole\u2019: A History of Baptism for Health|journal=Journal of Mormon History|date=2008|ssrn=1664180|accessdate=}}</ref> In 1922, [[Heber J.

Temples are considered by church members to be the most sacred structures on earth.\n\nUpon completion, temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time (an \"open house\"). During the open house, the church conducts tours of the temple with [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] and members from the local area serving as tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. The temple is then dedicated as a \"House of the Lord\", after which only members who are deemed worthy are permitted entrance.\n\nThey are not churches or [[meeting house|meetinghouses]] designated for public weekly worship services, but rather are places of worship open only to the faithful where certain [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|rites]] of the church must be performed.<ref name=\"Of Chapels and Temples\">{{citation |contribution= Of Chapels and Temples: Explaining Mormon Worship Services |title= News Release |series= Newsroom |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/of-chapels-and-temples-explaining-mormon-worship-services |date= 15 November 2007 |accessdate= 2012-10-10 }}</ref>\n\n{{LDS Temple status}}  At present, there are temples in many U.S. states, as well as in many countries across the world. Several temples are at historical sites of the LDS Church, such as [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo, Illinois]], [[Palmyra New York Temple|Palmyra, New York]], and [[Salt Lake Temple|Salt Lake City, Utah]]. The importance of temples is often emphasized in weekly meetings, and regular participation in \"temple work\" is strongly encouraged for all Latter-day Saints (LDS).\n\nWithin temples, members of the church make [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]]s, receive instructions, and perform sacred ceremonies and [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]], such as [[baptism for the dead]], [[washing and anointing]] (or \"initiatory\" ordinances), the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]], and  [[Celestial marriage|eternal marriage]] [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealings]]. Ordinances are a vital part of the theology of the church, which teaches that they were practiced by the Lord's covenant people in all [[Dispensationalist theology|dispensations]]. Additionally, members consider the temple a place to [[direct revelation|commune with God]], seek God's aid, understand the will of God, and receive [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)#Personal revelation|personal revelation]].\n\n[[File:LDS Temples Construction Timeline.svg|thumb|right|LDS temple construction reached an all-time high in 2000.

Kirtland ordinances included washings and anointings (differing in many ways from the modern portion) and the washing of the feet ordinance. For nearly four years, beginning in 1842, Smith's Red Brick Store functioned as a de facto temple\u2014the site of the first washings, anointings, endowments, and sealings. In contrast, the grand edifice known as the Nauvoo Temple was in operation for only two months before the Latter Day Saints left Illinois for the West.\n\nPreparations to initiate the first members of Smith's [[Anointed Quorum|Quorum of the Anointed]],<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last= Anderson |editor1-first= Devery S. |editor2-last= Bergera |editor2-first= James |year= 2005 |title= Joseph Smith's Quorum of the Anointed, 1842-1845: A Documentary History |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Signature Books]] |isbn= 1-56085-186-4 |oclc= 57965858 |url= http://signaturebooks.com/2010/02/quorum-of-the-anointed/ |page= {{page needed|date=March 2014}} |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://archive.today/20130202091515/http://signaturebooks.com/2010/02/quorum-of-the-anointed/ |archivedate= 2013-02-02 }}</ref> or Holy Order, as it was also known, were made on May 3, 1842. The walls of the second level of the Red Brick Store were painted with garden-themed murals, the rooms fitted with carpets, potted plants, and a veil hung from the ceiling. All the while, the ground level continued to operate as Smith\u2019s general mercantile.\n\nAfter the early events of the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]], [[Brigham Young]] assumed control of the church's headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois. While he and the rest of the [[Quorum of the Twelve]] made contingency plans for abandoning the city, he may have hoped that it would not prove necessary. For example, in early 1845, Young convened a conference at the Norwegian colony at [[Norway, Illinois]], and announced a plan to build a Latter-day Saint town there with a temple for the use of the Norwegian Latter Day Saints.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haslam |first1=Gerald M. |title=The Illinois Milieu of the First Norwegian Converts to Mormonism in the Early 1840s |journal=BYU Family Historian |date=2007 |volume=6 |url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&context=byufamilyhistorian |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Young urged the Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo to redouble their efforts to finish the temple. By the end of 1845, the building was sufficiently finished to allow [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|temple ordinances]] to be performed. Ordinances continued to be performed in early 1846 as the Mormons were forced to abandon the city.

The [[St. George Utah Temple|St. George Temple]] was the first to be completed in 1877, followed by [[Logan Utah Temple|Logan]] (1884) and [[Manti Utah Temple|Manti]] (1888). The [[Salt Lake Temple]] took 40 years to complete because of various setbacks and delays. It was dedicated in 1893.\n\nLatter-day Saint temple building halted until the presidency of [[Joseph F. Smith]], who announced two additional temples: [[Cardston Alberta Temple|Cardston, Alberta]] (1913), and [[Laie Hawaii Temple|L\u0101{{okina}}{{Not a typo|ie}}, Hawai{{okina}}i]] (1915). Cardston became the first Latter-day Saint temple dedicated outside of the United States. Smith broke with the previous tradition (established since Kirtland) of building temples with upper and lower courts. Temples previously had been ever larger, but the Laie Hawaii Temple was smaller than the Nauvoo Temple had been.\n\nBoth Cardston and Laie were dedicated under church president [[Heber J. Grant]], as was a temple in [[Mesa Arizona Temple|Mesa, Arizona]]. [[George Albert Smith]] dedicated the next temple in [[Idaho Falls Idaho Temple|Idaho Falls, Idaho]]. [[David O. McKay]] dedicated five additional temples including one in [[Bern Switzerland Temple|Bern, Switzerland]]\u2014which was the first temple dedicated in Europe and the first temple to use film recording of the endowment rather than live actors. [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] dedicated a temple in [[Ogden Utah Temple|Ogden, Utah]] and [[Harold B. Lee]] dedicated its twin in [[Provo Utah Temple|Provo, Utah]].\n\n[[File:Logan Utah Temple.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Logan Utah Temple]]]]\n\n[[Spencer W. Kimball]] began a plan to build many more smaller temples according to standardized plans. Twenty-one temples were dedicated during his presidency, including the tiny [[Papeete Tahiti Temple]]\u2014which has a floorspace of less than 10,000 square feet (900 m\u00b2). This trend has continued. Nine additional temples were dedicated in the presidency of [[Ezra Taft Benson]] and two in the brief presidency of [[Howard W. Hunter]].\n\n{{anchor|Small_temples}}Under church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], the church dedicated 77 temples. In 1997, Hinckley introduced a standardized, smaller temple plan designed to bring temple services to smaller or remote congregations at a reduced cost. The first of this new generation of temples was completed in 1998 with the [[Monticello Utah Temple]]. The original plan called for {{convert|6800|sqft}}, later increased to {{convert|10700|sqft}}. Subsequent revisions to the standard design further increased the size and complexity of the temples. The majority of the temples dedicated under Hinckley's tenure were of the smaller design, but one particularly noteworthy achievement was the rebuilding of the temple in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], known as the [[Nauvoo Illinois Temple]].\n\nHinckely's successor, [[Thomas S. Monson]], dedicated 26 temples during his time as church president.  His counselors in the First Presidency also dedicated a number of temples during Monson's administration.\n\nAs of October 2018, Monson's successor and current church president, [[Russell M.

They are taught that temple ordinances are essential to achieving the condition of [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] after the [[final judgment]]. They are also taught that a vast number of dead souls exist in a condition termed as [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]], and that a dead individual upon whom the temple ordinances are completed will have a chance to be freed of this imprisoning condition. In this framework ordinances are said to be completed on behalf of either the participant, or a dead individual the same sex as the participant (\"on behalf of the dead\" or \"by proxy\").\n\nOrdinances performed in the temple include:\n* [[Baptism for the dead|Baptism]] and [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]] on behalf of the dead\n* [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] [[ordination]] on behalf of the dead\n* [[Washing and anointing]] (also known as the \"Initiatory\" ordinances)\n* The [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]]\n* [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]] ordinances (for opposite-sex couples and for parents and their children)\n\nMost ordinances are performed by proxy only on participants who have already completed the ordinance. Similarly, most ordinances are completed only one time for a participant in a lifetime and all subsequent temple ordinance participation is seen as acting for a dead individual. Baptism, confirmation, and priesthood ordination are usually performed in temples only when on behalf of the dead. The initiatory, endowment, and sealing ceremonies are today performed only within a temple.\n\nThe sealing ordinance can be performed on behalf of dead couples; so long as the two living participants are of opposite sex they need not be married. It is also performed on behalf of living couples who wish to be legally married. In this manner, the ordinance is typically performed as a [[celestial marriage]], with the idea the marriage bond lasts after their death, or for \"time and all eternity\". A \"time only\" modification can be made to the ordinance, such as when the surviving widow of a celestial marriage wishes to legally remarry.<ref>{{citation |title= [[Church Handbook of Instructions]], Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= LDS Church |page= 71 |year= 2010}}</ref> If children were born to the couple prior to the couple's sealing ceremony, the parents and the children may also be sealed together to form an eternal family unit.

A second question was modified to ask if the member sustained the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve as prophets, seers, and revelators. The question about wearing the garments was qualified, added a clause about wearing them as instructed in the temple.<ref>{{citation |title= Church Makes Subtle Changes in Temple Recommend Interview |type= News |date=September 1996 |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/103-87-95.pdf |journal= [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] |issue= 104 |page= 87 |accessdate= 2012-02-16 }}</ref> \n* In 1999, a simplified question about financial obligations was asked of all members, not just divorced members.<ref>{{citation |title= Changes Made to Recommend Interview |url= http://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/117-73-79.pdf |type= Update |date=February 2000 |journal= [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] |issue= 117 |pages= 73\u201374 |accessdate= 2012-02-16 }}</ref> \n* In 2012, the question about wearing the garments was slightly modified to clarify that the garments should not be worn separately.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n* In October 2019's general conference, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Russell M.

It may only be used in conjunction with a standard Temple Recommend.<ref name=\"handbook2\">{{citation |title= [[Church Handbook of Instructions]], Book 1 |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2006 |page= {{Page needed|date=February 2012}}}}.</ref>\n\nA ''Limited-use Recommend'' is available to members who have not yet received their endowment or who have not been a member for one year. These may also be issued to a group for a single visit to the temple.<ref name=handbook2/> These can be issued to youth 12 and older who will take part in specific temple ordinances, to single members age 8\u201320 who are preparing to be sealed to their parents, or for individuals, not endowed, who wish to observe specific ordinances. The church member must meet the same worthiness standards as a standard temple recommend in an interview with the member's bishop. Unlike the standard temple recommend, a limited-use recommend does not require a year's membership nor an interview with a stake president. A limited-use recommend is only valid for [[Baptism for the dead|proxy baptisms]] and confirmation ordinances.\n\n===Emergency access===\nThose without recommends occasionally need to enter temples after dedication during fires, medical emergencies, or building inspections. They are escorted by temple personnel during such visits. Temples may offer introductory tours to new local firefighters and emergency medical technicians during regularly scheduled maintenance periods.<ref name=\"federico20120525\">{{cite news | url=http://www.courant.com/community/farmington/hc-mormon-temple-belmont-20120524,0,4146137,full.story | title=Mormon Temple, Massachusetts Neighbors Live In Peace | work=Hartford Courant | date=2012-05-25 | accessdate=May 25, 2012 | author=Federico, Hillary}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter Quarters Temple.JPG|thumbnail|An LDS Temple in [[Winter Quarters Nebraska Temple|Omaha, Nebraska]]]]\n\n==Temple weddings==\n{{Main|Sealing (Mormonism)|Sealing room}}\nThe LDS temple wedding is a process which culminates in the participation by the couple in a ritual called the sealing ordinance; which involves pronouncing the couple as having a permanent marriage bond which persists even beyond death. This ceremony, among others, is taught as being vital to an individual's and family's [[exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] status, following the [[final judgment]].\n\nWith the sealing ordinance being held inside a temple, only church members in good standing who have a valid  [[temple recommend]] are permitted to attend the ceremony. In many nations outside the United States, a civil ceremony, where required by the law of the land, has been immediately followed by a temple sealing.  However, in the United States, a one-year waiting period between the civil ceremony and a temple sealing was required.\n\nIn May 2019, to standardize sealing policies on a global scale, church leaders announced an end to the one-year waiting period in most cases, except in relation to converts to the church, who are still required to wait a year after their own confirmation before entering the temple.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/couples-married-civilly-authorized-for-immediate-temple-marriage Couples Married Civily Now Authorized for Immediate Temple Marriage], ''Mormon Newsroom'', 6 May 2019.

Over 880 pupils attend Haileybury, of whom more than 550 [[Boarding school|board]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Haileybury College.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Terrace'', Haileybury]]\n\nThe previous institution at Haileybury was the [[East India Company College|East India College]] (EIC), the training establishment founded in 1806 for administrators of the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]]. The EIC was initially based at [[Hertford Castle]], but substantial grounds in Hertford Heath were acquired for future development. [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], the architect of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London, was appointed principal architect. The buildings comprise four ranges which enclose an area known as ''Quad'', the second largest academic [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in Britain after [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Country Life, Volume 203|year=2009|page=28}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the East India Company was nationalised, and its College closed in January 1858.  In 1862, a public school opened on the site that retained many connections with the EIC, with [[Royal charter]] being received in 1864. Many of the houses were named after Old Boys or Principals of the EIC, and Haileybury's primary purpose during the second half of the 19th century was to provide soldiers and administrators for the [[British Empire]], in particular, [[British India]].\n\nThe Chapel dome was added by [[Arthur Blomfield|Sir Arthur Blomfield]] and completed in 1877. Further Victorian additions were designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John William Simpson]]. The ''Memorial Hall'', the school's dining hall, was opened by the future [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and acts as a monument to former pupils who gave their lives in the [[First World War]]. During the past 40&nbsp;years, its use has been extended to commemorate deaths of OHs in all military conflicts.\n\nThe dining hall contains one of the largest unsupported domes in Europe. Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass [[howitzer]] shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during the [[First World War]] and then converted into a [[gong]]. A gilded plaster boss in the centre of this dome represents an oak tree being struck by lightning. Known as ''Little Lightning Oak,'' this decoration represents the massive oak tree that stands on the lawn in front of ''Terrace'', the promenade visible in this photograph. This tree was struck by lightning and all but destroyed, re-sprouted.\n\nAs well as the wooden tablets surrounding the exterior of the dining hall, there are other memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. In memory of Haileyburians who died in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], a war memorial [[obelisk]], of portland stone with bronze decorations, was erected on the main axis of the school's entrance front in 1903. It is known in the school as ''Obelisk'' and was designed by former pupil, [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]. The memorial on ''Terrace'', originally built to commemorate those lost in the First World War, was also designed by Sir Reginald; it was unveiled by [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|{{Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George}}]] on 7 July 1923. Known as the ''[[Cross of Sacrifice]]'', this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth War Cemetery]] and other war memorials around the world.\n\nSeventeen former pupils of Haileybury and its antecedents have received the [[Victoria Cross]], and three the [[George Cross]]. Amongst independent schools whose pupils have been awarded the Victoria Cross, Haileybury is in the top three, alongside [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].\n\nIn 1942, Haileybury and the [[Imperial Service College]] (which had itself subsumed the [[United Services College]]) merged to become '''Haileybury and Imperial Service College''', now often referred to simply as Haileybury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|title=The story of Haileybury|website=Haileybury|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812041706/http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|archive-date=12 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, reforming headmaster [[David Jewell]] took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold War austerity.

Girls' houses comprise [[John Russell Colvin|Colvin]], [[James Cosmo Melvill|Melvill]], [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], Alban's, and Hailey. The seven boys' houses consist of [[George Frederick Edmonstone|Edmonstone]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Lawrence]], [[Henry Bartle Frere|Bartle Frere]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Joseph Batten|Batten]], [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|Thomason]], and [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]]. There is also a boarding house for the Lower School (Years 7 and 8) called Highfield. The [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] Theatre functions as a modern auditorium with a fully equipped stage and back-stage. In 1997, the college chapel [[Pipe organ|organ]] was re-built by the German organ builder [[Klais Orgelbau|Klais]].\n\n==Sport==\nHaileybury is traditionally strong in [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]] and retains honours boards with every rugby and cricket first team since 1863. Sports for girls include hockey, netball, lacrosse, tennis and cricket, with newly developed teams in football and rugby union. In addition to rugby and cricket, boys play hockey, football and tennis. Boys and girls represent the school in athletics, squash, swimming, [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]], cross country, badminton, biathlon, basketball, rowing and sailing. The school previously contained [[fives]] courts, although this ceases to be the case.\n\n==Related schools==\n=== Haileybury Almaty ===\n{{main|Haileybury Almaty}}\nIn 2006/2007, Haileybury advised on the building of a Haileybury in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] where all English GCSEs are taught and the curriculum is taught similarly under the guidance of Haileybury. The school, opened in September 2008, is known as Haileybury Almaty.\n\nThe pupils are made up mostly of Kazakhstan citizens. They are all required to speak English. Academic year 2010\u201311 saw the first batch of pupils pass their IGCSE exams. Since August 2011, Haileybury Almaty has opened a [[Sixth form|6th form]]. In 2016, 11 pupils graduated from the 6th form with one getting admission to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College, Cambridge University]], and 6 securing places in [[University College London|University College, London]] (UCL).

Haileybury Astana provides education for boys and girls from the two to eighteen years of age under the leadership of Jonathan Ullmer MBE. It is an [[IB World School]] and also operates the [[International Primary Curriculum]] (IPC).\n\nThe School has grown rapidly since it was opened by the [[President of Kazakhstan]]. In 2017, the new IB Centre was opened by the Minister of Education. By 2018, the school had close to 650 pupils.\n\n=== Haileybury Turnford ===\n{{main|Haileybury Turnford}}\nIn September 2015, Turnford School in [[Turnford, Hertfordshire|Turnford]], Hertfordshire converted to [[Academy (English school)|academy status]] and was renamed Haileybury Turnford. Haileybury acts as the main sponsor of the school, and this is the first state-funded school to have links with Haileybury.\n\n== Model United Nations ==\n[[Model United Nations]] (MUN) is a popular extracurricular activity amongst pupils in the senior school. Throughout the year, groups of pupils are chosen to form delegations which meet two times per week outside of school hours to practise writing and debating resolutions. These pupils then travel to several MUN conferences in the UK and mainland Europe to debate their resolutions.\n\nHaileybury hosts their own Model United Nations Conferences conference every year (HMUN)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileyburymun.co.uk/|title=Haileybury MUN|website=haileyburymun.co.uk}}</ref> for nearly 900 pupils, making it largest MUN conference in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/news/uks-largest-model-united-nations-conference-to-be-held-at-haileybury|title=UK's largest Model United Nations conference to be held at Haileybury|date=14 March 2012}}</ref> The conference is typically held the weekend before the Easter holiday.\n\n== Notable former pupils ==\nPast pupils are known as [[:Category:People educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Old Haileyburians]].\n\nFor details of notable alumni, see [[List of people educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Victoria Crosses by school]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.haileybury.com/ Haileybury web site]\n\n{{Schools in Hertfordshire|independent}}\n{{Listed buildings in Hertfordshire}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haileybury and Imperial Service College}}\n[[Category:1862 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Arthur Blomfield buildings]]\n[[Category:Boarding schools in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1862]]\n[[Category:Independent schools in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:International Baccalaureate schools in England]]\n[[Category:Member schools of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]\n[[Category:Racquets venues]]\n[[Category:Schools cricket]]\n[[Category:Schools with a Royal Charter]]\n[[Category:Church of England independent schools in the Diocese of St Albans]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the school in England|the institution which occupied the same site from 1809 to 1858|East India Company College|the College's Australian counterpart|Haileybury, Melbourne}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=December 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox school\n | name                    = Haileybury and Imperial Service College\n | image                   = [[File:Haileybury crest.png]]\n | coordinates             = {{coord|51.7787|-0.0333|type:edu_region:GB_dim:100|format=dec|display=inline,title}}\n | motto                   = [[Latin]]: ''Sursum Corda''\n | motto_translation       = Lift up your Hearts\n | established             = 1862<br>Predecessor colleges were founded as follows:{{Plainlist|\n* [[East India Company College]] (1806)\n* [[Imperial Service College]] (1845)\n* [[United Services College]] (1874)\n}}\n | closed                  = \n | type                    = [[Public school (United Kingdom)#Twentieth century | Public school (UK)]]<br>[[Independent school (UK)|Independent school]]<br>[[Boarding school | Boarding]] and day school\n | religion                = [[Church of England]]\n | president               = [[Bishop of St Albans]]\n | head_label              = Master\n | head                    = Martin Collier\n | r_head_label            = \n | r_head                  = \n | chair_label             = [[Visitor]]\n | chair                   = [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]\n | chairman_label          = Chairman of the Council\n | chairman                = Alan Pilgrim\n | founder                 = [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]]\n | specialist              = \n | address                 = \n | city                    = [[Hertford Heath]]\n | county                  = [[Hertfordshire]]\n | country                 = England, United Kingdom\n | postcode                = SG13 7NU\n | local_authority         = \n | urn                     = 117607\n | ofsted                  = \n | staff                   = \n | enrolment               = c. 880 pupils\n | gender                  = [[Mixed-sex education | Co-educational]] (previously boys only)\n | lower_age               = 11\n | upper_age               = 18\n | houses                  = 13\n | slogan                  = Fear God, Honour the King\n | publication             = ''The Haileyburian''<br>''Hearts & Wings''\n | free_label_1            = Alumni\n | free_1                  = [[:Category:People educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Old Haileyburians (OHs)]]\n | free_label_2            = School hymn\n | free_2                  = \"[[Lift Up Your Hearts!]]\"\n | free_label_3            = School colour\n | free_3                  = Magenta {{color box | #8B008B}}\n | website                 = {{url|haileybury.com}}\n}}\n\n'''Haileybury''' is an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] near [[Hertford]] in England.

His friend Ludmila Shtern wrote that many Russian intellectuals in both Russia and America assumed his influence was unlimited, that a nod from him could secure them a book contract, a teaching post or a grant, that it was in his gift to assure a glittering career. A helping hand or a rejection of a petition for help could create a storm in Russian literary circles, which Shtern suggests became very personal at times.

Auden, [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Robert Frost]], sketches of his own life, and those of contemporaries such as Akhmatova, [[Nadezhda Mandelshtam]], and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref name=\"OCEL\"/>\n\nA recurring theme in Brodsky's writing is the relationship between the poet and society. In particular, Brodsky emphasized the power of literature to affect its audience positively and to develop the language and culture in which it is situated. He suggested that the Western literary tradition was in part responsible for the world having overcome the catastrophes of the twentieth century, such as [[Nazism]], [[Communism]], and two [[World Wars]]. During his term as [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate]], Brodsky promoted the idea of bringing the Anglo-American poetic heritage to a wider American audience by distributing free poetry anthologies to the public through a government-sponsored program. Librarian of Congress [[James H. Billington|James Billington]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Joseph had difficulty understanding why poetry did not draw the large audiences in the United States that it did in Russia. He was proud of becoming an American citizen in 1977 (the Soviets having made him stateless upon his expulsion in 1972) and valued the freedoms that life in the United States provided. But he regarded poetry as \"language's highest degree of maturity\", and wanted everyone to be susceptible to it. As Poet Laureate, he suggested that inexpensive anthologies of the best American poets be made available in hotels and airports, hospitals and supermarkets. He thought that people who are restless or fearful or lonely or weary might pick up poetry and discover unexpectedly that others had experienced these emotions before and had used them to celebrate life rather than escape from it. Joseph's idea was picked up, and thousands of such books have in fact been placed where people may come across them out of need or curiosity.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis passion for promoting the seriousness and importance of poetry comes through in Brodsky's opening remarks as the U.S. Poet Laureate in October 1991. He said, \"By failing to read or listen to poets, society dooms itself to inferior modes of articulation, those of the politician, the salesman or the charlatan. ... In other words, it forfeits its own evolutionary potential. For what distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom is precisely the gift of speech. ... Poetry is not a form of entertainment and in a certain sense not even a form of art, but it is our anthropological, genetic goal, our evolutionary, linguistic beacon.\"<ref Name=\"LOC\"/> This sentiment is echoed throughout his work. In interview with [[Sven Birkerts]] in 1979, Brodsky reflected:\n\n<blockquote>In the works of the better poets you get the sensation that they're not talking to people any more, or to some seraphical creature. What they're doing is simply talking back to the language itself, as beauty, sensuality, wisdom, irony, those aspects of language of which the poet is a clear mirror. Poetry is not an art or a branch of art, it's something more. If what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological, indeed genetic, goal. Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as \"a read\", commits an anthropological crime, in the first place, against himself.<ref>Dingle, Carol (2003) ''Memorable Quotations: Jewish Writers of the Past'' p.&nbsp;22 {{ISBN|978-0-595-27245-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Influences===\nLibrarian of Congress Dr James Billington, wrote\n\n<blockquote>He was the favored prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the great lady of Petersburg, Anna Akhmatova, and to hear him read her poems in Russian in the [[Library of Congress]] was an experience to make one's hair stand on end even if one did not understand the Russian language. Joseph Brodsky was the embodiment of the hopes not only of Anna Akhmatova, the last of the great Petersburg poets from the beginning of the century, but also [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]], the widow of another great martyred poet [[Osip Mandelstam]]. Both of them saw Joseph as part of the guiding light that might some day lead Russia back to her own deep roots.<ref Name=\"LOC\">[https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9603/brodsky.html 19 February 1996 \"Death of a Poet Laureate: Joseph Brodsky Turned Exile into Inspiration\"] [[Library of Congress]], obituary</ref><ref>[http://www.caxtonclub.org/reading/2007/apr07.pdf Martin, Eden (2007)  ''Collecting Anna Akhmatova''.

Many works were dedicated to other writers such as [[Tomas Venclova]], [[Octavio Paz]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Derek Walcott]], and Benedetta Craveri.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nBrodsky's work is seen to have been vitally enhanced by the work of renowned translators. ''A Part of Speech'' (New York and Oxford, 1980), his second major collection in English, includes translations by [[Anthony Hecht]], [[Howard Moss]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Richard Wilbur]]. Critic and poet [[Henri Cole]] notes that Brodsky's \"own translations have been criticized for turgidness, lacking a native sense of musicality.\"<ref Name=\"Oxford\"/>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*1978 \u2013 Honorary degree of [[Doctor of Letters]], [[Yale University]]\n*1979 \u2013 Fellowship of [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]]\n*1981 \u2013 [[John D. and Catherine T.

Proffer, of the [[University of Michigan]] and one of the co-founders of [[Ardis Publishers]], became Brodsky's Russian publisher from this point on. Recalling his landing in Vienna, Brodsky commented,\n\n<blockquote>I knew I was leaving my country for good, but for where, I had no idea whatsoever. One thing which was quite clear was that I didn't want to go to Israel... I never even believed that they'd allow me to go. I never believed they would put me on a plane, and when they did I didn't know whether the plane would go east or west... I didn't want to be hounded by what was left of the Soviet Security Service in England.

He was the [[Andrew W.

He moved to New York's Greenwich Village in 1980 and in 1981 received the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] \"genius\" award.<ref Name=\"Oxford\"/> He was also a recipient of The International Center in New York Award of Excellence.

In an interview he was asked: \"You are an American citizen who is receiving the Prize for Russian-language poetry. Who are you, an American or a Russian?\" \"I'm Jewish; a Russian poet, an English essayist \u2013 and, of course, an American citizen\", he responded.<ref>Gross, Irena. \"A Jewish Boy with a Head Full of Russian Rhymes\".

It also called his writing \"rich and intensely vital\", characterized by \"great breadth in time and space\". It was \"a big step for me, a small step for mankind\", he joked.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> The prize coincided with the first legal publication in Russia of Brodsky's poetry as an exil\u00e9.\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0418. \u0411\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0412\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0438.jpg|thumb|Plaque in honour of Brodsky in Venice]]\nIn 1991, Brodsky became [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate of the United States]]. The [[Librarian of Congress]] said that Brodsky had \"the open-ended interest of American life that immigrants have. This is a reminder that so much of American creativity is from people not born in America.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/> His inauguration address was printed in ''Poetry Review''. Brodsky held an honorary degree from the [[University of Silesia]] in Poland and was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science. In 1995, Gleb Uspensky, a senior editor at the Russian publishing house, Vagrius, asked Brodsky to return to Russia for a tour, but he could not agree.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> For the last ten years of his life, Brodsky was under considerable pressure from those that regarded him as a \"fortune maker\". He was a greatly honored professor, was on first name terms with the heads of many large publishing houses, and connected to the significant figures of American literary life. His friend Ludmila Shtern wrote that many Russian intellectuals in both Russia and America assumed his influence was unlimited, that a nod from him could secure them a book contract, a teaching post or a grant, that it was in his gift to assure a glittering career. A helping hand or a rejection of a petition for help could create a storm in Russian literary circles, which Shtern suggests became very personal at times. His position as a lauded \u00e9migr\u00e9 and Nobel Prize winner won him enemies and stoked resentment, the politics of which, she writes, made him feel \"deathly tired\" of it all toward the end.<ref>Stern (2004) p. 305</ref>\n\n[[Image:brodskygrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Brodsky in the Protestant section of the [[Isola di San Michele#history|Cimitero di San Michele]], Venice, Veneto, Italy]] \nIn 1990, while teaching literature in France, Brodsky married a young student, Maria Sozzani, who has a Russian-Italian background; they had one daughter, Anna Brodsky, born in 1993.\n\nMarina Basmanova lived in fear of the Soviet authorities until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991; only after this was their son Andrei Basmanov allowed to join his father in New York.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In the 1990s, Brodsky invited Andrei to visit him in New York for three months and they maintained a father-son relationship until Brodsky's death.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Andrei married in the 1990s and had three children, all of whom were recognized and supported by Brodsky as his grandchildren; Marina Basmanova, Andrei, and Brodsky's grandchildren all live in Saint Petersburg.

He was buried in a non-Catholic section of the [[Isola di San Michele]] cemetery in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], also the resting place of [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref name=\"NYT\"/> In 1997, a plaque was placed on his former house in St. Petersburg, with his portrait in relief and the words \"In this house from 1940 to 1972 lived the great Russian poet, Iosif Aleksandrovich Brodsky\".<ref>Stern (2004) p. 330</ref> Brodsky's close friend, the Nobel laureate [[Derek Walcott]], memorialized him in his collection ''The Prodigal'', in 2004.\n\n==Work==\n{{quote box |width=320px |align=right  |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nI was born and grew up in the Baltic marshland\nby zinc-gray breakers that always marched on\nin twos.</poem>\n |source = \u2014From the title poem in ''A Part of Speech'' (1977)\n}}\n\nBrodsky is perhaps most known for his poetry collections, ''A Part of Speech'' (1977) and ''To Urania'' (1988), and the essay collection ,''Less Than One'' (1986), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. Other notable works include the play, ''Marbles'' (1989), and ''Watermark'', a prose collection (1992).<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Throughout his career he wrote in Russian and English, self-translating and working with eminent poet-translators.\n\n===Themes and forms===\nIn his introduction to Brodsky's ''Selected Poems'' (New York and Harmondsworth, 1973), W.&nbsp;H. Auden described Brodsky as a traditionalist lyric poet fascinated by \"encounters with nature, ... reflections upon the human condition, death, and the meaning of existence\".<ref Name=\"Oxford\"/> He drew on wide-ranging themes, from Mexican and Caribbean literature to Roman poetry, mixing \"the physical and the metaphysical, place and ideas about place, now and the past and the future\".<ref Name=\"LOC\"/> Critic Dinah Birch suggests that Brodsky's \" first volume of poetry in English, ''Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems (1973)'', shows that although his strength was a distinctive kind of dry, meditative soliloquy, he was immensely versatile and technically accomplished in a number of forms.\"<ref name=\"OCEL\">\"Brodsky, Joseph\" ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n''To Urania: Selected Poems 1965\u20131985'' collected translations of older work with new work written during his American exile and reflect on themes of memory, home, and loss.<ref name=\"OCEL\"/> His two essay collections consist of critical studies of such poets as [[Osip Mandelshtam]], W.&nbsp;H. Auden, [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Robert Frost]], sketches of his own life, and those of contemporaries such as Akhmatova, [[Nadezhda Mandelshtam]], and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref name=\"OCEL\"/>\n\nA recurring theme in Brodsky's writing is the relationship between the poet and society. In particular, Brodsky emphasized the power of literature to affect its audience positively and to develop the language and culture in which it is situated. He suggested that the Western literary tradition was in part responsible for the world having overcome the catastrophes of the twentieth century, such as [[Nazism]], [[Communism]], and the [[World Wars]]. During his term as [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate]], Brodsky promoted the idea of bringing the Anglo-American poetic heritage to a wider American audience by distributing free poetry anthologies to the public through a government-sponsored program. Billington wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Joseph had difficulty understanding why poetry did not draw the large audiences in the United States that it did in Russia. He was proud of becoming an American citizen in 1977 (the Soviets having made him stateless upon his expulsion in 1972) and valued the freedoms that life in the United States provided. But he regarded poetry as \"language's highest degree of maturity\", and wanted everyone to be susceptible to it. As Poet Laureate, he suggested that inexpensive anthologies of the best American poets be made available in hotels and airports, hospitals and supermarkets. He thought that people who are restless or fearful or lonely or weary might pick up poetry and discover unexpectedly that others had experienced these emotions before and had used them to celebrate life rather than escape from it. Joseph's idea was picked up, and thousands of such books have in fact been placed where people may come across them out of need or curiosity.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis passion for promoting the seriousness and importance of poetry comes through in Brodsky's opening remarks as the U.S. Poet Laureate in October 1991. He said, \"By failing to read or listen to poets, society dooms itself to inferior modes of articulation, those of the politician, the salesman or the charlatan. ... In other words, it forfeits its own evolutionary potential. For what distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom is precisely the gift of speech. ... Poetry is not a form of entertainment and in a certain sense not even a form of art, but it is our anthropological, genetic goal, our evolutionary, linguistic beacon.\"<ref Name=\"LOC\"/> This sentiment is echoed throughout his work. In interview with [[Sven Birkerts]] in 1979 Brodsky reflected:\n\n<blockquote>In the works of the better poets you get the sensation that they're not talking to people any more, or to some seraphical creature. What they're doing is simply talking back to the language itself, as beauty, sensuality, wisdom, irony, those aspects of language of which the poet is a clear mirror. Poetry is not an art or a branch of art, it's something more. If what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological, indeed genetic, goal. Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as \"a read\", commits an anthropological crime, in the first place, against himself.<ref>Dingle, Carol (2003) ''Memorable Quotations: Jewish Writers of the Past'' p.&nbsp;22 {{ISBN|978-0-595-27245-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Influences===\nLibrarian of Congress [[James H. Billington|Dr James Billington]], wrote\n\n<blockquote>He was the favored prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the great lady of Petersburg, Anna Akhmatova, and to hear him read her poems in Russian in the [[Library of Congress]] was an experience to make one's hair stand on end even if one did not understand the Russian language. Joseph Brodsky was the embodiment of the hopes not only of Anna Akhmatova, the last of the great Petersburg poets from the beginning of the century, but also [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]], the widow of another great martyred poet [[Osip Mandelstam]]. Both of them saw Joseph as part of the guiding light that might some day lead Russia back to her own deep roots.<ref Name=\"LOC\">[https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9603/brodsky.html 19 February 1996 \"Death of a Poet Laureate: Joseph Brodsky Turned Exile into Inspiration\"] [[Library of Congress]], obituary</ref><ref>[http://www.caxtonclub.org/reading/2007/apr07.pdf Martin, Eden (2007)  ''Collecting Anna Akhmatova''.

Many works were dedicated to other writers such as [[Tomas Venclova]], [[Octavio Paz]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Derek Walcott]], and Benedetta Craveri.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nBrodsky's work is seen to have been vitally enhanced by the work of renowned translators. ''A Part of Speech'' (New York and Oxford, 1980), his second major collection in English, includes translations by [[Anthony Hecht]], [[Howard Moss]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Richard Wilbur]]. Critic and poet [[Henri Cole]] notes that Brodsky's \"own translations have been criticized for turgidness, lacking a native sense of musicality.\"<ref Name=\"Oxford\"/>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*1978 \u2013 Honorary degree of [[Doctor of Letters]], [[Yale University]]\n*1979 \u2013 Fellowship of [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]]\n*1981 \u2013 [[John D. and Catherine T.
