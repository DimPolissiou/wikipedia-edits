It was held on March 16, 2003, before a crowd of 55,000, in [[Darlington, South Carolina]], at [[Darlington Raceway]]. The 293-lap race, the 100th NASCAR Cup Series event at Darlington Raceway, was won by [[PPI Motorsports]] driver [[Ricky Craven]] after he started from the 32nd position. [[Kurt Busch]] of the [[Roush Fenway Racing|Roush Racing]] squad finished in second place and [[Dave Blaney]] third for the [[Jasper Motorsports]] team.\n\n[[Elliott Sadler]] won the pole position by recording the fastest lap in qualifying. He and [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] traded the lead for the first two laps. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] assumed the lead on lap 17. Earnhardt went on to lead for 91 laps, more than any other driver. On lap 197, [[Jeff Gordon]] led at a [[Rolling start|rolling restart]] after a [[Racing flags#Yellow flag|yellow caution flag]], ahead of Sadler. His hold on first place was relinquished when Busch passed him on the 269th lap. Afterward, Busch had a [[power steering]] failure, which led Craven to gradually lower his lead. By lap 291, Craven drew close enough to challenge Busch; after two attempts at a pass failed, he overtook Busch on the final lap, and won by two-thousands of a second, the joint-closest finish in series history.\n\nIt was Craven's second and final win of his career. The result advanced him from sixteenth to fifth in the [[List of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champions|Drivers' Championship]], 143 [[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|points]] behind [[Matt Kenseth]], who maintained the championship lead from [[Tony Stewart]] with an eighth-place result. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] maintained its lead in the [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|Manufacturers' Championship]], five points in front of [[Chevrolet]] in second. [[Pontiac]] overtook [[Dodge]] for third with 31 races remaining in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:DarlingtonRacewayDodgeCharger500.JPG|left|thumb|[[Darlington Raceway]] ''(pictured in 2008)'', where the race was held.]]\nThe 2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 was the 5th of the 36 [[Stock car racing|stock car races]] in the [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]].

The 293-lap race, the 100th NASCAR Cup Series event at Darlington Raceway, was won by [[PPI Motorsports]] driver [[Ricky Craven]] after he started from the 32nd position. [[Kurt Busch]] of the [[Roush Fenway Racing|Roush Racing]] squad finished in second place and [[Dave Blaney]] third for the [[Jasper Motorsports]] team.\n\n[[Elliott Sadler]] won the pole position by recording the fastest lap in qualifying. He and [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] traded the lead for the first two laps. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] assumed the lead on lap 17. Earnhardt went on to lead for 91 laps, more than any other driver. On lap 197, [[Jeff Gordon]] led at a [[Rolling start|rolling restart]] after a [[Racing flags#Yellow flag|yellow caution flag]], ahead of Sadler. His hold on first place was relinquished when Busch passed him on the 269th lap. Afterward, Busch had a [[power steering]] failure, which led Craven to gradually lower his lead. By lap 291, Craven drew close enough to challenge Busch; after two attempts at a pass failed, he overtook Busch on the final lap, and won by two-thousands of a second, the joint-closest finish in series history.\n\nIt was Craven's second and final win of his career. The result advanced him from sixteenth to fifth in the [[List of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champions|Drivers' Championship]], 143 [[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|points]] behind [[Matt Kenseth]], who maintained the championship lead from [[Tony Stewart]] with an eighth-place result. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] maintained its lead in the [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|Manufacturers' Championship]], five points in front of [[Chevrolet]] in second.

By the Late Eocene (46&nbsp;million years ago), the three modern suborders had already developed: [[Suina]] (the [[pig]] group); [[Tylopoda]] (the [[camel]] group); and [[Ruminantia]] (the [[goat]] and [[cattle]] group). Nevertheless, artiodactyls were far from dominant at that time: the perissodactyls were much more successful and far more numerous. Artiodactyls survived in niche roles, usually occupying marginal [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], and it is presumably at that time that they developed their complex [[digestive system]]s, which allowed them to survive on lower-grade food. While most artiodactyls were taking over the niches left behind by several extinct perissodactyls, one lineage of artiodactyls began to venture out into the seas.\n\n====Cetacean evolution====\n{{See also|Evolution of cetaceans}}\n[[File:Ambulocetus natans.jpg|thumb|Skeleton of ''[[Ambulocetus natans]]'', a stem whale]]\nThe traditional theory of cetacean evolution was that cetaceans were related to the [[mesonychid]]s. These animals had unusual triangular teeth very similar to those of primitive cetaceans.  This is why scientists long believed that cetaceans evolved from a form of mesonychid. Today many scientists believe cetaceans evolved from the same stock that gave rise to hippopotamuses.

However, there are exceptions to this as pigs, peccaries, hippos and [[duiker]]s are known to have an omnivorous diet. Some cetaceans are the only modern ungulates that are carnivores; baleen whales consume significantly smaller animals in relation to their body size, such as small species of fish and [[krill]]; toothed whales, depending on the species, can consume a wide range of species: [[squid]], fish, [[shark]]s, and other species of mammals such as [[Pinniped|seals]] and other whales. In terms of ecosystem ungulates have colonized all corners of the planet, from [[mountain]]s to the [[ocean depths]]; [[grassland]]s to [[desert]]s and some have been domesticated by [[human]]s.\n\n===Anatomy===\nUngulates have developed specialized adaptations, especially in the areas of cranial appendages, dentition, and leg morphology including the modification of the [[talus bone|astragalus]] (one of the ankle bones at the end of the lower leg) with a short, robust head.\n\n====Hooves====\n{{See also|Hoof}}\n[[Image:Capreolus capreolus cloven hoof.jpg|right|thumbnail|Cloven hooves of [[Roe Deer]] (''Capreolus capreolus''), with dew claws]] \nThe hoof is the tip of a [[toe]] of an ungulate [[mammal]], strengthened by a thick horny ([[keratin]]) covering. The hoof consists of a hard or rubbery sole, and a hard wall formed by a thick [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] rolled around the tip of the toe. The weight of the animal is normally borne by both the sole and the edge of the hoof wall. Hooves grow continuously, and are constantly worn down by use. In most modern ungulates, the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] are fused along the length of the forelimb; early ungulates, such as the [[Arctocyonidae|arctocyonids]], did not share this unique skeletal structure.<ref>Christine M. Janis, Kathleen M. Scott, and Louis L. Jacobs, ''Evolution of Tertiary Mammals of North America'', Volume 1. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 322-23.</ref> The fusion of the radius and ulna prevents an ungulate from rotating its forelimb. Since this skeletal structure has no specific function in ungulates, it is considered a homologous characteristic that ungulates share with other mammals. This trait would have been passed down from a common ancestor. While the two orders of ungulates colloquial names are based on the number of toes of their members (\"odd-toed\" for the perissodactyls and \"even-toed\" for the terrestrial artiodactyls), it is not an accurate reason they are grouped. Tapirs have four toes in the front, yet they are members of the \"odd-toed\" order; peccaries and modern cetaceans are members of the \"even-toed\" order, yet peccaries have three toes in the front and whales are an extreme example as they have flippers instead of hooves. Scientists had classified them according to the distribution of their weight to their toes.\n\nPerissodactyls have a mesaxonic foot meaning that the weight is distributed on the third toe on all legs thanks to the plane symmetry of their feet. There has been reduction of toes from the common ancestor, with the classic example being horses with their single hooves. In consequence, there was an alternative name for the perissodactyls the nearly obsolete Mesaxonia. Perissodactyls are not the only lineage of mammals to have evolved this trait; the [[Meridiungulata|meridiungulates]] have evolved mesaxonic feet numerous times.\n\nTerrestrial artiodactyls have a paraxonic foot meaning that the weight is distributed on the third and the fourth toe on all legs. The majority of these mammals have cloven hooves, with two smaller ones known as the dewclaws that are located further up on the leg. The earliest cetaceans (the [[archaeocetes]]), also have this characteristic in the addition of also having both an [[Astragalus (bone)|astragalus]] and [[cuboid bone]] in the ankle, which are further diagnostic traits of artiodactyls.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1126/science.1063902 \n|date=Sep 2001 \n|author1=Gingerich, Pd |author2=Haq, Mu |author3=Zalmout, Is |author4=Khan, Ih |author5=Malkani, Ms | title = Origin of whales from early artiodactyls: hands and feet of Eocene Protocetidae from Pakistan \n| volume = 293 \n| issue = 5538 \n| pages = 2239\u201342 \n| issn = 0036-8075 \n| pmid = 11567134 \n| journal = Science\n| bibcode=2001Sci...293.2239G\n|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ff5bf2c390b4459db41334360a92b8eaae1dfc4 \n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:White-sided dolphin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pacific white-sided dolphin]] skeleton (missing [[pelvic bones]]), on exhibit at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]]]\nIn modern cetaceans, the front limbs have become [[pectoral fins]] and the hind parts are internal and reduced. Occasionally, the genes that code for longer extremities cause a modern cetacean to develop miniature legs (known as [[atavism]]). The main method of moving is an up-and-down motion with the tail fin, called the [[:wiktionary:fluke|fluke]], which is used for [[Animal locomotion|propulsion]], while the pectoral fins together with the entire tail section provide directional control. All modern cetaceans still retain their digits despite the external appearance suggesting otherwise.\n\n====Teeth====\nMost ungulates have developed reduced [[canine teeth]] and specialized [[molar (tooth)|molars]], including bunodont (low, rounded cusps) and [[hypsodont]] (high crowned) teeth. The development of hypsodonty has been of particular interest as this adaptation was strongly associated with the spread of grasslands during the [[Miocene]] about 25 million years. As forest biomes declined, grasslands spread, opening new [[Ecological niche|niches]] for mammals. Many ungulates switched from browsing diets to grazing diets, and possibly driven by abrasive silica in grass, hypsodonty became common. However, recent evidence ties the evolution of hypsodonty to open, gritty habitats and not the grass itself. This is termed the [[Grit, not grass hypothesis]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jardine | first1 = Phillip E. | last2 = Janis | first2 = Christine M. | last3 = Sahney | first3 = Sarda | last4 = Benton | first4 = Michael J. | year = 2012 | title = Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires | doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.09.001 | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume = 365\u2013366 | issue = | pages = 1\u201310 }}</ref>\n\nSome ungulates completely lack upper incisors and instead have a [[dental pad]] to assist in browsing.<ref name=\"2001Rouge\">{{cite web | title = Dental Anatomy of Ruminants | last = Rouge | first = Melissa | year = 2001 | publisher = Colorado State University | url = http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/pregastric/cowpage.html | accessdate = 5 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"WonderQuest\">{{cite web | publisher = WonderQuest | title = Toothless cud chewers, To see ourselves as others see us... | url = http://www.wonderquest.com/cows-teeth-mirrors.htm | accessdate = 5 May 2010}}</ref> It can be found in camels, ruminants, and some toothed whales; modern baleen whales are remarkable in that they have [[baleen]] instead to filter out the krill from the water.

Nevertheless, artiodactyls were far from dominant at that time: the perissodactyls were much more successful and far more numerous. Artiodactyls survived in niche roles, usually occupying marginal [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], and it is presumably at that time that they developed their complex [[digestive system]]s, which allowed them to survive on lower-grade food. While most artiodactyls were taking over the niches left behind by several extinct perissodactyls, one lineage of artiodactyls began to venture out into the seas.\n\n====Cetacean evolution====\n{{See also|Evolution of cetaceans}}\n[[File:Ambulocetus natans.jpg|thumb|Skeleton of ''[[Ambulocetus natans]]'', a stem whale]]\nThe traditional theory of cetacean evolution was that cetaceans were related to the [[mesonychid]]s.

However, there are exceptions to this as pigs, peccaries, hippos and [[duiker]]s are known to have an omnivorous diet. Some cetaceans are the only modern ungulates that are carnivores; baleen whales consume significantly smaller animals in relation to their body size, such as small species of fish and [[krill]]; toothed whales, depending on the species, can consume a wide range of species: [[squid]], fish, [[shark]]s, and other species of mammals such as [[Pinniped|seals]] and other whales. In terms of ecosystem ungulates have colonized all corners of the planet, from [[mountain]]s to the [[ocean depths]]; [[grassland]]s to [[desert]]s and some have been domesticated by [[human]]s.\n\n===Anatomy===\nUngulates have developed specialized adaptations, especially in the areas of cranial appendages, dentition, and leg morphology including the modification of the [[talus bone|astragalus]] (one of the ankle bones at the end of the lower leg) with a short, robust head.\n\n====Hooves====\n{{See also|Hoof}}\n[[Image:Capreolus capreolus cloven hoof.jpg|right|thumbnail|Cloven hooves of [[Roe Deer]] (''Capreolus capreolus''), with dew claws]] \nThe hoof is the tip of a [[toe]] of an ungulate [[mammal]], strengthened by a thick horny ([[keratin]]) covering. The hoof consists of a hard or rubbery sole, and a hard wall formed by a thick [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] rolled around the tip of the toe. The weight of the animal is normally borne by both the sole and the edge of the hoof wall. Hooves grow continuously, and are constantly worn down by use. In most modern ungulates, the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] are fused along the length of the forelimb; early ungulates, such as the [[Arctocyonidae|arctocyonids]], did not share this unique skeletal structure.<ref>Christine M. Janis, Kathleen M. Scott, and Louis L. Jacobs, ''Evolution of Tertiary Mammals of North America'', Volume 1. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 322-23.</ref> The fusion of the radius and ulna prevents an ungulate from rotating its forelimb. Since this skeletal structure has no specific function in ungulates, it is considered a homologous characteristic that ungulates share with other mammals. This trait would have been passed down from a common ancestor. While the two orders of ungulates colloquial names are based on the number of toes of their members (\"odd-toed\" for the perissodactyls and \"even-toed\" for the terrestrial artiodactyls), it is not an accurate reason they are grouped. Tapirs have four toes in the front, yet they are members of the \"odd-toed\" order; peccaries and modern cetaceans are members of the \"even-toed\" order, yet peccaries have three toes in the front and whales are an extreme example as they have flippers instead of hooves. Scientists had classified them according to the distribution of their weight to their toes.\n\nPerissodactyls have a mesaxonic foot meaning that the weight is distributed on the third toe on all legs thanks to the plane symmetry of their feet. There has been reduction of toes from the common ancestor, with the classic example being horses with their single hooves. In consequence, there was an alternative name for the perissodactyls the nearly obsolete Mesaxonia. Perissodactyls are not the only lineage of mammals to have evolved this trait; the [[Meridiungulata|meridiungulates]] have evolved mesaxonic feet numerous times.\n\nTerrestrial artiodactyls have a paraxonic foot meaning that the weight is distributed on the third and the fourth toe on all legs. The majority of these mammals have cloven hooves, with two smaller ones known as the dewclaws that are located further up on the leg. The earliest cetaceans (the [[archaeocetes]]), also have this characteristic in the addition of also having both an [[Astragalus (bone)|astragalus]] and [[cuboid bone]] in the ankle, which are further diagnostic traits of artiodactyls.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1126/science.1063902 \n|date=Sep 2001 \n|author1=Gingerich, Pd |author2=Haq, Mu |author3=Zalmout, Is |author4=Khan, Ih |author5=Malkani, Ms | title = Origin of whales from early artiodactyls: hands and feet of Eocene Protocetidae from Pakistan \n| volume = 293 \n| issue = 5538 \n| pages = 2239\u201342 \n| issn = 0036-8075 \n| pmid = 11567134 \n| journal = Science\n| bibcode=2001Sci...293.2239G\n|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ff5bf2c390b4459db41334360a92b8eaae1dfc4 \n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:White-sided dolphin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pacific white-sided dolphin]] skeleton (missing [[pelvic bones]]), on exhibit at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]]]\nIn modern cetaceans, the front limbs have become [[pectoral fins]] and the hind parts are internal and reduced.

The development of hypsodonty has been of particular interest as this adaptation was strongly associated with the spread of grasslands during the [[Miocene]] about 25 million years. As forest biomes declined, grasslands spread, opening new [[Ecological niche|niches]] for mammals. Many ungulates switched from browsing diets to grazing diets, and possibly driven by abrasive silica in grass, hypsodonty became common. However, recent evidence ties the evolution of hypsodonty to open, gritty habitats and not the grass itself.

In most cases, the bone at the base is destroyed by [[osteoclast]]s and the antlers fall off at some point.<ref name=Hall/> As a result of their fast growth rate, antlers are considered a handicap since there is an incredible nutritional demand on deer to re-grow antlers annually, and thus can be honest signals of metabolic efficiency and food gathering capability.<ref name=\"Ditchkoff\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ditchkoff | first1 = S.

Antlers (such as on [[deer]]) are derived from bone tissue: when mature, the skin and fur covering of the antlers, termed \"velvet\", is sloughed and scraped off to expose the bone of the antlers.\n\n[[Pronghorn]] are unique when compared to their relatives. Each \"horn\" of the pronghorn is composed of a slender, laterally flattened blade of bone that grows from the frontal bones of the skull, forming a permanent core. As in the Giraffidae, skin covers the bony cores, but in the pronghorn it develops into a [[keratin]]ous sheath which is shed and regrown on an annual basis. Unlike the horns of the family Bovidae, the horn sheaths of the pronghorn are branched, each sheath possessing a forward-pointing tine (hence the name pronghorn). The horns of males are well developed.\n\n==Inbreeding in small populations==\nMany of the world\u2019s ungulate species exist only in relatively small populations in which some degree of inbreeding inevitably occurs.
