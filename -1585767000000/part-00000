It is considered miraculous because the Giants were ahead and could easily have run out the final seconds; they had the ball and the Eagles had no [[Sport time-out|timeouts]] left. Everyone watching expected [[quarterback]] [[Joe Pisarcik]] to take one more [[Snap (football)|snap]] and [[quarterback kneel|kneel with the ball]], thus [[running out the clock]] and preserving a 17\u201312 Giants upset. Instead, he botched an attempt to hand off the football to [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Larry Csonka]]. Edwards  picked up the dropped ball and ran 26 yards for the winning score.\n\nThe term is primarily used by Eagles fans and sportscasters. Giants fans refer to the play simply as \"'''The Fumble'''\", though that name is generally used outside of New York for [[The Fumble|a play in the 1987 AFC Championship Game]] between the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Denver Broncos]].\n\nFor the Eagles, the victory snatched from the jaws of certain defeat served as a [[morale]] boost, leading that season to a [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] berth and, two seasons later, [[Super Bowl XV|the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance]]. To Giants fans, it was the [[nadir]] of a long era of mediocrity, but the aftermath would lead to major changes that proved beneficial for the franchise in the long run. The play played a major role in persuading players, coaches and fans at all levels of the game to accept the heretofore controversial quarterback kneel as an acceptable and sportsmanlike means for a winning team to end the game while in possession of the ball.\n\n==Background==\nIt was the first meeting between the divisional rivals that season. The Eagles were in third place in the [[NFC East]], behind the [[1978 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and [[1978 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]; the Giants were in fourth. The teams went into the game in similar situations, but heading in different directions. They had playoff hopes, especially since this was the first 16-game NFL season, but likely would have to settle for a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] berth due to the solid lead the powerful Dallas Cowboys had in the division. Given the similarity of their records, it was likely the outcome would have playoff implications, since the first tie-breaker for a wild card spot is the head-to-head record.\n\n===Giants===\nGoing into the game, the Giants were 5\u20136. A three-game losing streak on the road had made the team's playoff prospects much dimmer since midseason. However, a win at home against the favored Eagles could, the team hoped, reverse the trend and keep an outside shot at a playoff spot alive. Despite the team's [[History of the New York Giants|storied past]], the Giants had not played in the postseason since 1963 and had managed only two winning seasons since then. Although they were the league's fourth oldest franchise, they were almost a non-entity in the post-[[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] NFL. The move to [[New Jersey]] in 1976 had alienated some longtime fans, even if it made more seats available. Fans had never gone this long without a contender, but while they were growing restless, they were still forgiving.\n\nHowever, there was little pressure they could bring to bear on the people who could ultimately make changes, longtime team owners [[Wellington Mara]] and his nephew [[Timothy J. Mara|Tim]], who inherited his father [[Jack Mara|Jack's]] stake in the team after Jack Mara died in 1965. The two managed team operations closely, but feuded so bitterly with each other that at one point a partition had to be erected between their seats in the owners' box. The effects of this uncertainty and instability at the highest managerial level affected the team's play, most significantly when it came to some apparently inexplicable personnel decisions. It was not lost on fans that players ([[Craig Morton]] and [[Fran Tarkenton]]) and coaches ([[Tom Landry]] and [[Vince Lombardi]]) who had once been in the Giants' fold were now enjoying or had enjoyed great success elsewhere. The team also had passed over future stars for less able players in the annual [[NFL draft|draft]].\n\nBut all this was for naught. With far more demand for tickets than there were available, the team was financially healthy no matter how poorly it performed on the field, and the Maras were widely viewed as complacent by observers who didn't know the depth of the ownership schism.\n\n====Friction between offensive players and assistant coaches====\nThe week before the game, players, particularly on offense, had complained to reporters about the team's assistant coaches. Head coach [[John McVay]] was popular with them. He had taken over the team in the middle of the 1976 season after [[Bill Arnsparger]] was fired and improved morale while adding talented players to the team. However, the players were not so enthusiastic about many of the longtime friends he had hired as assistants. The players felt the assistant coaches were uninterested in helping younger players develop, at least compared to their counterparts on other teams. As an example, they pointed out that the season before, none of the team's three quarterbacks had had any previous NFL experience, yet no quarterback coach had been hired. They also noted that one of the few coaches who seemed to care, Jerry Wampfler, coached the [[lineman (football)|offensive line]], one of the Giants' most improved units that season.<ref name=\"Times pregame\">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Giants Voice Mutual Animosity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/19/archives/giants-voice-mutual-animosity-a-natural-leader-third-and-long-run.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 19, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Offensive coordinator]] [[Bob Gibson (football coach)|Bob Gibson]] was the most frequent target of complaints. He had taken to the relatively nascent practice (now quite common) of calling all the plays from the upstairs press box. Pisarcik had often challenged Gibson about this, sometimes openly, over the past two seasons.<ref name=\"Times pregame\" /> The players felt that Gibson should let Pisarcik call plays. They pointed out that during the previous week's loss to Washington, the team had attempted only three passes on several third-and-long situations during the game. They also felt insulted that on a third-and-7 in [[overtime (sport)|overtime]], the coaches had called a run play.<ref name=\"Times pregame\" /> Gibson for his part had limited confidence in Pisarcik's passing ability, an opinion widely shared (the media in New York referred to him as \"[[off-Broadway]] Joe\", a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] reference to former [[New York Jets]]' quarterback, [[Joe Namath|\"Broadway Joe\" Namath]]). He and other coaches pointed out that the three passing attempts the players pointed to had resulted in two [[interception]]s and a [[Quarterback sack|sack]].<ref name=\"Times pregame\" />\n\nThe team's general philosophy at the time was to concentrate on its improving defense and play conservatively on offense until it could be made more competitive. Players on the Giants' offense became frustrated over this decision and wanted more chances to prove themselves.<ref name=\"Times pregame\" />\n\n===Eagles===\nAt 6\u20135, things looked a little more promising for the visitors. The two-game win streak they took into the game had gotten them over a .500 first half. Momentum clearly was on their side, and the Giants had not beaten the Eagles since the opening game of [[1975 NFL season|the 1975 season]], three years prior. Still, the Giants were a decent team, and the Eagles knew they could not relax.\n\nThey, too, were an old-line NFL franchise coming off [[History of the Philadelphia Eagles|many years]] in the doldrums.  They had not been to the playoffs since winning their third NFL title in [[1960 NFL Championship Game|1960]], and had only notched two winning seasons in the 17 years since then.  However, their fans were less inclined to be forgiving than Giants' fans. A loss to the slumping Giants would have dealt a severe blow to the confidence the team needed to maintain over the last quarter of its schedule, in which it would face not only the Cowboys, but the equally formidable [[Minnesota Vikings]] as well as the Giants again in Philadelphia. 1978 was also viewed as an important season for head coach [[Dick Vermeil]], as there was little doubt the Eagles were playing much better under his watch, but there was also a great deal of local impatience for concrete results.\n\n==The game==\n{{Americanfootballbox\n| titlestyle = {{NFLPrimaryColor|New York Giants}}; {{NFLSecondaryColor|New York Giants}};text-align:center;\n| state = autocollapse\n| title = 1978 Week Twelve: Philadelphia Eagles at New York Giants\n| date = November 19\n| time = 1:00 p.m. EST\n| road = '''Eagles'''\n| R1 = 0 | R2 = 6 | R3 = 0 | R4 = 13\n| home = Giants\n| H1 = 14 |H2 = 0 | H3 = 3 | H4 = 0\n| stadium = [[Giants Stadium]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n| attendance = 70,318\n| weather = 49\u00b0F, Clear\n| Vegas line = Philadelphia Eagles \u22122 (from RJ Bell of Pregame)\n| referee = [[Cal Lepore]]\n| TV = [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n| TVAnnouncers = [[Don Criqui]] and [[Sonny Jurgensen]]\n| reference =\n| scoring =\n;First quarter\n* NYG [[Bobby Hammond]] 19-yard pass from Pisarcik ([[Joe Danelo]] kick)\n* NYG [[Johnny Perkins]] 30-yard pass from Pisarcik (Danelo kick)\n;Second quarter\n* PHI Montgomery 8-yard rush (kick failed)\n;Third quarter\n* NYG Danelo 37-yard FG\n;Fourth quarter\n* PHI [[Mike Hogan (American football)|Mike Hogan]] 1-yard rush (kick failed)\n* PHI [[Herman Edwards]] 26-yard fumble return ([[Mike Michel]] kick)\n| stats =\n;Top passers\n* PHI \u2013 [[Ron Jaworski]] \u2013 15/31, 164 YDS, 0 TD, 3 INT\n* NYG \u2013 [[Joe Pisarcik]] \u2013 13/23, 181 YDS, 2 TD, INT\n;Top rushers\n* PHI \u2013 [[Wilbert Montgomery]] \u2013 22 CAR, 88 YDS, TD\n* NYG \u2013 [[Doug Kotar]] \u2013 13 CAR, 36 YDS\n;Top receivers\n* PHI \u2013 [[Harold Carmichael]] \u2013 5 REC, 105 YDS\n* NYG \u2013 [[Jimmy Robinson]] \u2013 4 REC, 73 YDS\n}}\nThe Giants opened a two touchdown lead in the first quarter on two Pisarcik touchdown passes,  and did not give up the lead until the final play of the game. The Eagles, conversely, struggled, missing one of their [[extra point]] attempts and botching the snap on the other. The Eagles found themselves down 17\u201312, meaning they could only win the game with a touchdown as time wound down.<ref name=\"Times game story\">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=20 Seconds Left As Eagles Win|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/20/archives/20-seconds-left-as-eagles-win-jets-bow-todd-reinjured.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDeep in their own territory, the Giants' [[Doug Kotar]] fumbled late in the fourth quarter, raising hopes (or fears) of a comeback by the visitors. Those were quickly put to rest, however, when rookie defensive back [[Odis McKinney]]'s first NFL interception gave the Giants possession of the football after the [[two-minute warning]]. The Eagles had exhausted all their timeouts by this point.<ref name=\"Times game story\" />\n\nFans in the stands began heading for the exits as the game seemed all but over, with no apparent remaining danger of an Eagles comeback. Nowadays, teams in this situation let the [[play clock]] run down to the last possible second and have the quarterback take a knee. On the sidelines, a disgusted Eagles coach [[Dick Vermeil]] was turning his attention away from the field and toward the postgame [[press conference]], where he would have to explain to reporters why his team had fallen to an inferior opponent.\n\n===The Giants' possession===\nSince the rule to allow QBs to simply kneel did not take effect until 1987, Pisarcik took the snap on first down<ref name=\"Sequence of plays\">{{cite AV media|people=|year=1978|title=NFL Game of the Week Show #12|time=17 minutes|publisher=NFL Films|id=Tape 52935}}</ref> and rolled on the ground (a common play for QBs in the pre-kneel era). Eagles [[linebacker|middle linebacker]] [[Bill Bergey]] charged into Giants' [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Jim Clack]], knocking him backward into Pisarcik in a desperate attempt to force a fumble. Since defensive players usually are not blocked in this situation, they usually in turn do not rush. Offensive players consider any breach of this tacit agreement as a provocation, particularly linemen whose job it is to protect the quarterback, and fights between angry linemen and the opposition were not uncommon.\n\nGibson did not want to expose his quarterback to further risk of injury, nor did he want to risk his players being fined for violating the league's rules against fighting. Most importantly, the last thing he wanted was for his team to get a penalty, which could stop the clock and require getting another first down to secure the win.  He also personally despised the kneeling play, considering it unsporting and somewhat dishonorable (a view popular among a lot of coaches of the period). Also given that the play clock at the time was only 30 seconds (as it would remain through the 1987 season), a play had to be run. So on second down he called \"65 Power-Up\", a standard play which called for Csonka to take a handoff and run up the middle. Csonka took the ball and ran for 11 yards. For the third play in the Giants' series, the same play was called again.\n\nIn the huddle, the Giants were incredulous when the call came in. \"Don't give me the ball,\" begged Csonka, the former [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] star. Other players asked Pisarcik to change the play, but he demurred.<ref name=\"Times game story\" /> Gibson had berated him for changing a play the week before and threatened to have him [[Waivers (American football)|waived]] if he ever did so again. Gibson did not take the time to explain his decision to Pisarcik. As a result, the rest of the offense simply viewed Gibson's call as a power trip. Because he was a second-year starting quarterback who still had not totally proven himself, in the era before [[Free agent|free agency]], Pisarcik lacked the stature to prevail in this kind of dispute.\n\nCsonka claims that, as he walked away from the huddle, he told Pisarcik he would not take the ball if he went through with it. It is not known whether the quarterback heard him or not, however. McVay's headphones, which normally allowed him to communicate with Pisarcik and Gibson, were not working properly at that point either. McVay has since stated that he would certainly have overruled Gibson had he heard what was coming.\n\nAcross the line of scrimmage, the Eagles had not huddled, as [[defensive coordinator]] [[Marion Campbell]] called for an all-out 11-man [[Blitz (American football)|blitz]]. Edwards, who as a defensive back normally would have been several yards deep, was instead close enough to Kotar to talk to him (the Giants player assured him that his team was just going to kneel again). Vermeil later said the blitz made the victory possible.\n\nThe Giants wasted several seconds in the huddle in dismay over the play-calling. At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding down and took it upon himself to snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants knelt on the subsequent play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).\n\nPisarcik, who at the time was distracted making sure Csonka was in position, was unprepared for the snap. It struck his middle finger so hard there was still blood on the nail after the game.<ref name=\"Times next week story\">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Giants' Progress is Key Asset for McVay|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/26/archives/giants-progress-is-key-asset-for-mcvay-friends-in-jeopardy.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> Nevertheless, he held on to the ball after a slight bobble and tried to hand it off to Csonka. Instead, the ball hit Csonka's hip and came loose.\n\nEdwards recovered it on its first bounce as Pisarcik unsuccessfully attempted to fall on it. Kotar, who could have blocked him or fallen on the ball himself, never even saw the fumble, according to Edwards. Once Edwards got it, he sprinted 26 yards untouched into the end zone for a 19\u201317 Eagles victory. There was stunned silence from the stands and the Giants' sideline. The only noise came from the celebrating Eagles.\n\n===The call===\nWith Giants victory all but assured, [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] commentator [[Don Criqui]] (working alongside [[Sonny Jurgensen]]) had begun to read the end credits for the game's control truck and on-field personnel shortly before the game's final play:\n\n{{quote|It's Giants football now, third and two. We thank our producer Bob Rowe, our director Jim Silman, and our CBS crew, spotter and statistician John Mara and Tom McHugh here at Giants Stadium.

[At this point, the snap and fumble take place.] Wait a minute... here's a free fla- I don't believe it! The Eagles pick it up and Herman Edwards runs it in for a touchdown! An incredible development!}}\n\nAfter the game, while showing league highlights, CBS replayed the play. They showed the reaction of both coaches, while [[Brent Musburger]] famously narrated, \"A study in contrast!\"  According to RJ Bell of Pregame, the point spread of Philadelphia Eagles \u22122 turned Giants winning bets into pushes.\n\n==The immediate aftermath==\nFor Edwards, the play was a personal redemption, as he had been burned on one of Pisarcik's early touchdown passes and would have been partially to blame for the loss. It also was his first NFL touchdown. Vermeil refused to question McVay's judgment but allowed that he, too, disliked sitting on the ball to preserve a victory.<ref name=\"Times game story\" />\n\nGiants fans were enraged. For a football team to lose in that situation was unprecedented. Pisarcik, who belatedly explained to the press, \"I never had control,\"<ref name=\"Times game story\" /> needed a police escort to get to his car.<ref name=\"Times next week story\" /> During an NFL Network show about famous on-field bloopers, Csonka said that he immediately had Pisarcik join him on a chartered plane trip to South Florida, where they hung out and fished for a few days before returning to New York.\n\nGibson was fired the next morning.<ref name=\"Times Gibson firing\">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Giants Oust Gibson A Day After Bungle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/21/archives/giants-oust-gibson-a-day-after-bungle-giants-oust-gibson-a-day.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 21, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> With angry fans already demanding that someone be held responsible for the debacle, team officials felt he had to go in hopes of saving the season.<ref name=gola20081118>{{cite news|last=Gola|first=Hank|title=30 years later, Giant disappointment of 'The Fumble' still lingers|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/30-years-giant-disappointment-fumble-lingers-article-1.335390|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 18, 2008|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> So great was the stigma of having called the play that he never worked in football at any level again.

Gibson was reached by telephone by ESPN and gave the following statement: \"I haven't talked about the game for thirty years, and I'm not about to start now.\"</ref> In 2008, in a telephone call from ESPN and 30 years after the game, Gibson said: \"I haven't talked about the game for 30 years, and I'm not about to start now.\" Gibson died in 2015 at the age of 88.\n\n===Giants fan reaction===\nFans turned on management and ownership as previously grumbled complaints about the team's ineptitude turned into an incessant roar. Their team was now the laughingstock of the league. The Fumble (a term in use before the end of the week) epitomized all the mismanagement and all the talent the team had let get away.\n\nAt a demonstration outside the stadium prior to the next home game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]], many fans threw their tickets into a [[bonfire]]. A [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] furniture dealer named Morris Spielberg organized a Giants' Fans Committee after running an ad in the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' that drew hundreds of responses. They met at a hotel near the stadium prior to the team's final home game on December 10 against the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] and distributed [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s to pass out to fellow fans during the game. Spielberg had arranged for a [[airplane|plane]] to fly over the stadium with a banner reading \"15 Years of Lousy Football \u2014 We've Had Enough.\" When it came, fans were to chant, \"We've had enough.\"\n\nThe Giants posted a 17\u20130 shutout win, but when the plane came (an hour behind schedule), fans showed the victory was not enough to make them forget their recent humiliation. There were more than 24,000 empty seats, yet crowd applause and chants briefly stopped play.\n\n==The rest of the season==\nThe surprise finish accelerated the directions both teams were taking over the season's final four games. They met in [[Veterans Stadium]] in the final [[regular season]] game.\n\n===Eagles===\nPhiladelphia was able to extend its win streak to four games the next week, before losing to Dallas and Minnesota. The Eagles managed a season sweep of the Giants with an easy 20\u20133 victory in the finale to finish 9\u20137 and snare the second of two wild-card spots available under the playoff format at that time. \"One play gets you feeling like you have confidence\", Edwards explained years later. \"You're not worried about losing anymore; now you're thinking about how you can win.\"<ref name=\"25th anniversary\">{{cite news|last=Barber|first=Phil|title=Miracle of Meadowlands Turns 25|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6827118|publisher=National Football League|date=November 12, 2003|accessdate=May 21, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214152018/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6827118|archivedate=December 14, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Eagles lost the [[1978\u201379 NFL playoffs|playoff game]] to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] because of another failed extra point, in addition to a missed field goal as time expired. But it gave them and their fans something to build on for the next season. Philadelphia corrected its kicking woes by drafting barefoot [[Tony Franklin (placekicker)|Tony Franklin]] from Texas A&M in 1979. As a rookie, Franklin booted a 59-yard field goal on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] during a 31\u201321 victory at [[Texas Stadium]].\n\n===Giants===\nAt first, the Giants tried to look ahead and recover. They vowed to win their remaining four games and protect McVay's job. Instead, the collapse continued. The next week, the Giants blew a 10-point lead over the 3\u20139 [[Buffalo Bills]] late in the game, giving up 27 points in the fourth quarter to lose 41\u201317. They would win only one more game the rest of the season, finishing with a 6\u201310 record. The sweep by Philadelphia ensured the Giants would finish last in the division (tied with the Cardinals) for the third straight season, extending their rut and further angering fans.\n\n==After the season==\n\n===Eagles===\nThe next year, the Eagles again earned a wild-card spot and then won their first post-merger playoff game over the [[1979 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] before falling to [[1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]]. Following that season, the Giants traded Pisarcik to them for a draft choice. He would finish his career as a backup to [[Ron Jaworski]] five years later. His entire NFL career is usually embodied in that play, and while he is sometimes reluctant to talk about it, he admits that at least people remember his name thanks to it.\n\nThe Eagles' momentum carried them further in [[1980 NFL season|the 1980\u201381 season]], to the division championship, then the conference title and finally to [[Super Bowl XV]], which they lost 27\u201310 to the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]]. \"We won the game at the end, and we went on to the playoffs\", Edwards said. \"The next thing, we're playing in the Super Bowl.\" He, too, would find that the play defined his career, even though he remained part of the Eagles' lineup for another seven years before going into coaching after a final season split between the Falcons and Rams.\n\n===Giants===\nMcVay's contract expired and, as expected, was not renewed. He said in 2008 that had the Giants won, the team likely would have won two more games, his contract would have been renewed, \"and now I'd be dead with a heart attack.\"{{r|gola20081118}} McVay never coached again, but went on to a front-office job with the [[San Francisco 49ers]], where he helped develop that team into one of the most dominant of the 1980s. [[Andy Robustelli]], a former All-Pro [[defensive end]] who served as the team's director of operations, was also let go.\n\nCsonka's contract was up as well. Since McVay, with whom he had played in the [[World Football League]]'s [[Memphis Southmen]] before signing with the Giants, was gone and his career was ending, he decided to return to Miami, site of his past glories, for one final season. He would win an [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] award before retiring.\n\nDespite widespread calls to hire [[Joe Paterno]] or another successful college coach, the Giants settled on [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]], then an assistant for the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]], to replace McVay. While Perkins was able to follow the Eagles' lead and build a team that eventually made the playoffs in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], the moves that really made a difference for the Giants drew less attention that off-season.\n\nWellington Mara had been running football operations himself since joining the organization in the late 1930s, long after most teams had hired a [[general manager]].  He continued to do so even after inheriting the team upon the death of his father, [[Tim Mara|Tim]], in 1958. While he had delegated some of his authority to Robustelli in 1974, he still had the final say in football matters.  However, the fan revolt that erupted in the wake of the Fumble made the Maras realize that they needed to delegate most of the decisions that sorely divided them.  As with many other team matters, they kept arguing over whom to hire as general manager. In the off-season, they called on NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] to mediate. He suggested [[George Young (football executive)|George Young]], then an executive with the [[Miami Dolphins]], who only took the job after he was granted complete control of the football side of the operation. He proved to be a superb judge of talent, drafting [[Phil Simms]], [[Lawrence Taylor]] and other future Giants stars over the next few seasons.\n\nIn 1981, Perkins hired a new defensive coordinator, [[Bill Parcells]], a [[New England Patriots]] assistant who was out of coaching in 1979 after serving as head coach at [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] in 1978. When Perkins resigned after the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] to succeed the late [[Bear Bryant]] at the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]], Parcells took over as head coach. He survived a disastrous first season to lead the talent Young had acquired to two Super Bowl championships.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Miracle at the Meadowlands has left a lasting impact on the way organized football is played at all levels, not just in the NFL. Most notably, it legitimized the [[quarterback kneel]]. Coaches everywhere took heed of Gibson's fate and immediately began instructing quarterbacks to sit on the ball in similar situations. Some traditionalists feel that the kneel-down has been detrimental to the game and have called for rule changes to eliminate or discourage the play.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Other leagues, such as the [[Arena Football League]], have done just that, and now require the ball to be advanced past the line of scrimmage in order for the clock to continue running in the final minute of play.\n\n[[File:Post-Pisarcik QB kneel formation.svg|250px|left|thumb|Formation used ever since the Fumble/Miracle for quarterback kneel play.]]\n\n===Formation change===\nThe week after the game, both the Giants and Eagles implemented a new offensive formation to be used only in end-of-game kneeldowns.  It is popularly known as the \"Victory Formation\" or \"Victory Offense\".\n\nNot only did the infamous game-losing play make kneeling acceptable, but most of the teams using it changed how it was done. Prior to Pisarcik's fumble, teams had employed standard offensive formations such as an I or a split backfield. The Eagles' unlikely touchdown, however, had made the weakness of doing so glaring. Even though Pisarcik had been trying to hand off instead of kneeling, when he fumbled the snap, there was not only no offensive player there to try to recover it, no one was in position to tackle Edwards and prevent the touchdown either.\n\nAt the end of the first half of the Bills game the following week, the Giants debuted the new formation when Pisarcik knelt to preserve their lead. Two running backs stood closely behind Pisarcik while a third (usually a speedy player such as a [[wide receiver]]) was stationed as a sort of safety several yards back.\n\nThe Eagles, too, had practiced a similar formation in practice, calling it the Herman Edwards play. Other NFL teams soon followed the lead, and today the formation is standard in college and high school games as well.\n\n===Similar plays===\nThe play has been recalled often by fans and reporters in later years when a team fumbled away a sure victory late in the game, although it never happened quite as spectacularly as it did that first time.\n\nProbably the most famous play to evoke the Miracle of the Meadowlands, although with a very different outcome, occurred almost three decades later in a [[2005\u201306 NFL playoffs#AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Indianapolis Colts 18|2006 Steelers-Colts AFC divisional playoff game]]. As in 1978, an [[Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis]] turnover on downs had given [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Pittsburgh]] the ball on the Indianapolis 2-yard line and an apparent three-point victory over the heavily favored Colts in the game's final two minutes. However, the Steelers had to keep running the ball, as the Colts still had all their timeouts left. A field goal would have at least required the Colts to score a touchdown (plus kick the extra point) to win the game, while a touchdown would essentially clinch victory, so it was in the Steelers' interest to keep running. A pass would run the risk of being intercepted, or seeing the defense knock the ball out of the quarterback's hand. But on the very first play, running back [[Jerome Bettis]], who had not fumbled all season, had the ball knocked loose by Indianapolis middle linebacker [[Gary Brackett]]. Defensive back [[Nick Harper (American football)|Nick Harper]] recovered the ball and appeared to be on the way to an Edwards-like touchdown, but Pittsburgh quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] managed to tackle Harper near midfield.\n\nSteelers fans and players feared that Bettis was about to end his career with the same ignominy that followed Pisarcik. Several plays later, however, Colts [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Mike Vanderjagt]] wound up the game's [[scapegoat#Scapegoating in sports|goat]], evoking [[Wide Right (Buffalo Bills)|another memorable football moment]] when he missed what would have been the tying field goal, ending what had been a strong season for his team. The Steelers eventually went on to [[Super Bowl XL|a Super Bowl victory that year]], and the play would instead enter NFL lore as \"[[Pittsburgh sports lore#The Tackle II|The Tackle II]]\".\n\nThe play most directly analogous to the Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On [[Thanksgiving Day]] [[1993 NFL season|1993]], the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]]. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, waiting for it to come to rest in order to down it as close as possible to the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end [[Leon Lett]] sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16\u201314 victory.\n\nLett earned comparisons to Pisarcik and the 1978 Giants since his action was as unnecessary and seemed equally inexplicable. It was fourth down and the ball would have been turned over to Dallas anyway. Coming on the heels of [[Super Bowl XXVII|the previous year's Super Bowl]], when a prematurely celebrating Lett had been stripped on a fourth-quarter fumble return as he was about to score a touchdown, the Thanksgiving gaffe cemented his reputation for unthinking play that overshadowed his entire career.\n\nA near-identical play in a 1999 collegiate game allowed the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV) to steal a victory from [[Baylor University|Baylor]]. With the final seconds ticking off the clock, Baylor had a 24\u201321 lead and possession of the football near the UNLV goal line.  With UNLV out of timeouts, only a kneeldown was necessary. However, instead of trying to run out the clock, Baylor elected to try for a touchdown in an attempt to [[running up the score|run up the final score]]. Baylor running back Darryl Bush fumbled while trying to punch his way into the end zone, and UNLV's Kevin Thomas picked up the loose football and went 99 yards for the game-winning touchdown on the last play of the game.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n\"The Miracle on the Mountain\" is another play with similar circumstances. It took place on October 12, 2002 in a game between the home [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State Mountaineers]] and visiting [[Furman University|Furman Paladins]] at Kidd Brewer Stadium. A low scoring affair, the Paladins elected to attempt a two-point conversion after scoring the go-ahead touchdown with seven seconds left in the game. Leading 15\u201314, Furman quarterback Billy Napier's pass was intercepted by Josh Jeffries at the four-yard line. He lateraled the ball to Derrick Black, who returned it for a score, giving the Mountaineers a 16\u201315 win.\n\nA similar play occurred during a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Chargers]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] on October 31, 2011. Tied 20\u201320, the Chargers offense marched the ball down the field to the Chiefs' 15-yard line. With one minute left, the Chiefs had no timeouts and the Chargers could run the clock down to the final seconds. Chargers quarterback [[Philip Rivers]] snapped the ball with the intent to simply fall down and to the left, to line up kicker [[Nick Novak]] for the game-winning field goal. However, on the snap, the football jammed into Rivers' ring finger, visibly dislocating it, causing Rivers to fumble the ball.<ref>{{cite news|author=soybon|title=W\u00fcrst Night Ever.|url=http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2011/11/1/2528919/wurst-night-ever|website=[[SB Nation]]|date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=ANIMATED: Philip Rivers Fumble Costs Chargers Shot At Win In Regulation|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2011/11/1/2528786/phillip-rivers-fumble-video-chargers-chiefs|website=SB Nation|date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref> Chiefs linebacker [[Andy Studebaker]] recovered the fumble in the resulting scrum.

With thousands of fans already having given up and headed to the [[Soldier Field]] parking lot, running back [[Blair Thomas]] took a handoff.  Bears defensive tackle [[Steve McMichael]] stopped Thomas cold and then proceeded to wrestle the ball from his grasp, falling on the fumble at the Jets' 36-yard line with 1:54 remaining. On the final play of regulation, [[Jim Harbaugh]] threw a six-yard touchdown pass to [[Neal Anderson]]; Bears kicker [[Kevin Butler (American football)|Kevin Butler]] tied the game with the extra point. In overtime, Harbaugh scored from the one-yard line to clinch the win for Chicago.\n\nOn October 23, 2000, the [[2000 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] overcame a 30\u20137 fourth-quarter deficit in a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (MNF) contest against the [[2000 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] to win 40\u201337 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]]. It was the greatest comeback in ''MNF'' history, and was later voted the best ''Monday Night Football'' game ever by the show's fans. Jets fans have referred to this game, too, as \"The Miracle at the Meadowlands\", though it is known throughout the NFL as the [[Monday Night Miracle (American football)|Monday Night Miracle]].\n\nA punt return by [[Brian Westbrook]] of the Eagles with 1:16 left on the clock on October 19, 2003 is occasionally referenced as a \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.section247sportsblog.com/tag/miracle-at-the-meadowlands-iii/|title=Miracle...Part III.

recovery by [[cornerback]] [[Herman Edwards]] of the [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] that he returned for a [[touchdown]] at the end of a November 19, 1978, [[National Football League]] (NFL) game against the [[1978 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in [[Giants Stadium]]. It is considered miraculous because the Giants were ahead and could easily have run out the final seconds; they had the ball and the Eagles had no [[Sport time-out|timeouts]] left. Everyone watching expected [[quarterback]] [[Joe Pisarcik]] to take one more [[Snap (football)|snap]] and [[quarterback kneel|kneel with the ball]], thus [[running out the clock]] and preserving a 17\u201312 Giants upset. Instead, he botched an attempt to hand off the football to [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Larry Csonka]]. Edwards  picked up the dropped ball and ran 26 yards for the winning score.\n\nThe term is primarily used by Eagles fans and sportscasters. Giants fans refer to the play simply as \"'''The Fumble'''\", though that name is generally used outside of New York for [[The Fumble|a play in the 1987 AFC Championship Game]] between the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Denver Broncos]].\n\nFor the Eagles, the victory snatched from the jaws of certain defeat served as a [[morale]] boost, leading that season to a [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] berth and, two seasons later, [[Super Bowl XV|the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance]]. To Giants fans, it was the [[nadir]] of a long era of mediocrity, but the aftermath would lead to major changes that proved beneficial for the franchise in the long run.\n\n==Background==\nIt was the first meeting between the divisional rivals that season. The Eagles were in third place in the [[NFC East]], behind the [[1978 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and [[1978 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]; the Giants were in fourth. The teams went into the game in similar situations, but heading in different directions. They had playoff hopes, especially since this was the first 16-game NFL season, but likely would have to settle for a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] berth due to the solid lead the powerful Dallas Cowboys had in the division. Given the similarity of their records, it was likely the outcome would have playoff implications, since the first tie-breaker for a wild card spot is the head-to-head record.\n\n===Giants===\nGoing into the game, the Giants were 5\u20136. A three-game losing streak on the road had made the team's playoff prospects much dimmer since midseason. However, a win at home against the favored Eagles could, the team hoped, reverse the trend and keep an outside shot at a playoff spot alive. Despite the team's [[History of the New York Giants|storied past]], the Giants had not played in the postseason since 1963 and had managed only two winning seasons since then. Although they were the league's fourth oldest franchise, they were almost a non-entity in the post-[[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] NFL. The move to [[New Jersey]] in 1976 had alienated some longtime fans, even if it made more seats available. Fans had never gone this long without a contender, but while they were growing restless, they were still forgiving.\n\nHowever, there was little pressure they could bring to bear on the people who could ultimately make changes, longtime team owners [[Wellington Mara]] and his nephew [[Timothy J. Mara|Tim]], who inherited his father [[Jack Mara|Jack's]] stake in the team after Jack Mara died in 1965. The two managed team operations closely, but feuded so bitterly with each other that at one point a partition had to be erected between their seats in the owners' box. The effects of this uncertainty and instability at the highest managerial level affected the team's play, most significantly when it came to some apparently inexplicable personnel decisions. It was not lost on fans that players ([[Craig Morton]] and [[Fran Tarkenton]]) and coaches ([[Tom Landry]] and [[Vince Lombardi]]) who had once been in the Giants' fold were now enjoying or had enjoyed great success elsewhere. The team also had passed over future stars for less able players in the annual [[NFL draft|draft]].\n\nBut all this was for naught. With far more demand for tickets than there were available, the team was financially healthy no matter how poorly it performed on the field, and the Maras were widely viewed as complacent by observers who didn't know the depth of the ownership schism.\n\n====Friction between offensive players and assistant coaches====\nThe week before the game, players, particularly on offense, had complained to reporters about the team's assistant coaches. Head coach [[John McVay]] was popular with them. He had taken over the team in the middle of the 1976 season after [[Bill Arnsparger]] was fired and improved morale while adding talented players to the team. However, the players were not so enthusiastic about many of the longtime friends he had hired as assistants. The players felt the assistant coaches were uninterested in helping younger players develop, at least compared to their counterparts on other teams. As an example, they pointed out that the season before, none of the team's three quarterbacks had had any previous NFL experience, yet no quarterback coach had been hired. They also noted that one of the few coaches who seemed to care, Jerry Wampfler, coached the [[lineman (football)|offensive line]], one of the Giants' most improved units that season.<ref name=\"Times pregame\">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Giants Voice Mutual Animosity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/19/archives/giants-voice-mutual-animosity-a-natural-leader-third-and-long-run.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 19, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Offensive coordinator]] [[Bob Gibson (football coach)|Bob Gibson]] was the most frequent target of complaints. He had taken to the relatively nascent practice (now quite common) of calling all the plays from the upstairs press box. Pisarcik had often challenged Gibson about this, sometimes openly, over the past two seasons.<ref name=\"Times pregame\" /> The players felt that Gibson should let Pisarcik call plays. They pointed out that during the previous week's loss to Washington, the team had attempted only three passes on several third-and-long situations during the game. They also felt insulted that on a third-and-7 in [[overtime (sport)|overtime]], the coaches had called a run play.<ref name=\"Times pregame\" /> Gibson for his part had limited confidence in Pisarcik's passing ability, an opinion widely shared (the media in New York referred to him as \"[[off-Broadway]] Joe\", a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] reference to former [[New York Jets]]' quarterback, [[Joe Namath|\"Broadway Joe\" Namath]]). He and other coaches pointed out that the three passing attempts the players pointed to had resulted in two [[interception]]s and a [[Quarterback sack|sack]].<ref name=\"Times pregame\" />\n\nThe team's general philosophy at the time was to concentrate on its improving defense and play conservatively on offense until it could be made more competitive. Players on the Giants' offense became frustrated over this decision and wanted more chances to prove themselves.<ref name=\"Times pregame\" />\n\n===Eagles===\nAt 6\u20135, things looked a little more promising for the visitors. The two-game win streak they took into the game had gotten them over a .500 first half. Momentum clearly was on their side, and the Giants had not beaten the Eagles since the opening game of [[1975 NFL season|the 1975 season]], three years prior. Still, the Giants were a decent team, and the Eagles knew they could not relax.\n\nThey, too, were an old-line NFL franchise coming off [[History of the Philadelphia Eagles|many years]] in the doldrums.  They had not been to the playoffs since winning their third NFL title in [[1960 NFL Championship Game|1960]], and had only notched two winning seasons in the 17 years since then.  However, their fans were less inclined to be forgiving than Giants' fans. A loss to the slumping Giants would have dealt a severe blow to the confidence the team needed to maintain over the last quarter of its schedule, in which it would face not only the Cowboys, but the equally formidable [[Minnesota Vikings]] as well as the Giants again in Philadelphia. 1978 was also viewed as an important season for head coach [[Dick Vermeil]], as there was little doubt the Eagles were playing much better under his watch, but there was also a great deal of local impatience for concrete results.\n\n==The game==\n{{Americanfootballbox\n| titlestyle = {{NFLPrimaryColor|New York Giants}}; {{NFLSecondaryColor|New York Giants}};text-align:center;\n| state = autocollapse\n| title = 1978 Week Twelve: Philadelphia Eagles at New York Giants\n| date = November 19\n| time = 1:00 p.m. EST\n| road = '''Eagles'''\n| R1 = 0 | R2 = 6 | R3 = 0 | R4 = 13\n| home = Giants\n| H1 = 14 |H2 = 0 | H3 = 3 | H4 = 0\n| stadium = [[Giants Stadium]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n| attendance = 70,318\n| weather = 49\u00b0F, Clear\n| Vegas line = Philadelphia Eagles \u22122 (from RJ Bell of Pregame)\n| referee = [[Cal Lepore]]\n| TV = [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n| TVAnnouncers = [[Don Criqui]] and [[Sonny Jurgensen]]\n| reference =\n| scoring =\n;First quarter\n* NYG [[Bobby Hammond]] 19-yard pass from Pisarcik ([[Joe Danelo]] kick)\n* NYG [[Johnny Perkins]] 30-yard pass from Pisarcik (Danelo kick)\n;Second quarter\n* PHI Montgomery 8-yard rush (kick failed)\n;Third quarter\n* NYG Danelo 37-yard FG\n;Fourth quarter\n* PHI [[Mike Hogan (American football)|Mike Hogan]] 1-yard rush (kick failed)\n* PHI [[Herman Edwards]] 26-yard fumble return ([[Mike Michel]] kick)\n| stats =\n;Top passers\n* PHI \u2013 [[Ron Jaworski]] \u2013 15/31, 164 YDS, 0 TD, 3 INT\n* NYG \u2013 [[Joe Pisarcik]] \u2013 13/23, 181 YDS, 2 TD, INT\n;Top rushers\n* PHI \u2013 [[Wilbert Montgomery]] \u2013 22 CAR, 88 YDS, TD\n* NYG \u2013 [[Doug Kotar]] \u2013 13 CAR, 36 YDS\n;Top receivers\n* PHI \u2013 [[Harold Carmichael]] \u2013 5 REC, 105 YDS\n* NYG \u2013 [[Jimmy Robinson]] \u2013 4 REC, 73 YDS\n}}\nThe Giants opened a two touchdown lead in the first quarter on two Pisarcik touchdown passes,  and did not give up the lead until the final play of the game. The Eagles, conversely, struggled, missing one of their [[extra point]] attempts and botching the snap on the other. The Eagles found themselves down 17\u201312, meaning they could only win the game with a touchdown as time wound down.<ref name=\"Times game story\">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=20 Seconds Left As Eagles Win|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/20/archives/20-seconds-left-as-eagles-win-jets-bow-todd-reinjured.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDeep in their own territory, the Giants' [[Doug Kotar]] fumbled late in the fourth quarter, raising hopes (or fears) of a comeback by the visitors. Those were quickly put to rest, however, when rookie defensive back [[Odis McKinney]]'s first NFL interception gave the Giants possession of the football after the [[two-minute warning]]. The Eagles had exhausted all their timeouts by this point.<ref name=\"Times game story\" />\n\nFans in the stands began heading for the exits as the game seemed all but over, with no apparent remaining danger of an Eagles comeback. Nowadays, teams in this situation let the [[play clock]] run down to the last possible second and have the quarterback take a knee. On the sidelines, a disgusted Eagles coach [[Dick Vermeil]] was turning his attention away from the field and toward the postgame [[press conference]], where he would have to explain to reporters why his team had fallen to an inferior opponent.\n\n===The Giants' possession===\nSince the rule to allow QBs to simply kneel did not take effect until 1987, Pisarcik took the snap on first down<ref name=\"Sequence of plays\">{{cite AV media|people=|year=1978|title=NFL Game of the Week Show #12|time=17 minutes|publisher=NFL Films|id=Tape 52935}}</ref> and rolled on the ground (a common play for QBs in the pre-kneel era). Eagles [[linebacker|middle linebacker]] [[Bill Bergey]] charged into Giants' [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Jim Clack]], knocking him backward into Pisarcik in a desperate attempt to force a fumble. Since defensive players usually are not blocked in this situation, they usually in turn do not rush. Offensive players consider any breach of this tacit agreement as a provocation, particularly linemen whose job it is to protect the quarterback, and fights between angry linemen and the opposition were not uncommon.\n\nGibson did not want to expose his quarterback to further risk of injury, nor did he want to risk his players being fined for violating the league's rules against fighting. Most importantly, the last thing he wanted was for his team to get a penalty, which could stop the clock and require getting another first down to secure the win.  He also personally despised the kneeling play, considering it unsporting and somewhat dishonorable (a view popular among a lot of coaches of the period). Also given that the play clock at the time was only 30 seconds (as it would remain through the 1987 season), a play had to be run. So on second down he called \"65 Power-Up\", a standard play which called for Csonka to take a handoff and run up the middle. Csonka took the ball and ran for 11 yards. For the third play in the Giants' series, the same play was called again.\n\nIn the huddle, the Giants were incredulous when the call came in. \"Don't give me the ball,\" begged Csonka, the former [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] star. Other players asked Pisarcik to change the play, but he demurred.<ref name=\"Times game story\" /> Gibson had berated him for changing a play the week before and threatened to have him [[Waivers (American football)|waived]] if he ever did so again. Gibson did not take the time to explain his decision to Pisarcik. As a result, the rest of the offense simply viewed Gibson's call as a power trip. Because he was a second-year starting quarterback who still had not totally proven himself, in the era before [[Free agent|free agency]], Pisarcik lacked the stature to prevail in this kind of dispute.\n\nCsonka claims that, as he walked away from the huddle, he told Pisarcik he would not take the ball if he went through with it. It is not known whether the quarterback heard him or not, however. McVay's headphones, which normally allowed him to communicate with Pisarcik and Gibson, were not working properly at that point either. McVay has since stated that he would certainly have overruled Gibson had he heard what was coming.\n\nAcross the line of scrimmage, the Eagles had not huddled, as [[defensive coordinator]] [[Marion Campbell]] called for an all-out 11-man [[Blitz (American football)|blitz]]. Edwards, who as a defensive back normally would have been several yards deep, was instead close enough to Kotar to talk to him (the Giants player assured him that his team was just going to kneel again). Vermeil later said the blitz made the victory possible.\n\nThe Giants wasted several seconds in the huddle in dismay over the play-calling. At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding down and took it upon himself to snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants knelt on the subsequent play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).\n\nPisarcik, who at the time was distracted making sure Csonka was in position, was unprepared for the snap. It struck his middle finger so hard there was still blood on the nail after the game.<ref name=\"Times next week story\">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Giants' Progress is Key Asset for McVay|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/26/archives/giants-progress-is-key-asset-for-mcvay-friends-in-jeopardy.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> Nevertheless, he held on to the ball after a slight bobble and tried to hand it off to Csonka. Instead, the ball hit Csonka's hip and came loose.\n\nEdwards recovered it on its first bounce as Pisarcik unsuccessfully attempted to fall on it. Kotar, who could have blocked him or fallen on the ball himself, never even saw the fumble, according to Edwards. Once Edwards got it, he sprinted 26 yards untouched into the end zone for a 19\u201317 Eagles victory. There was stunned silence from the stands and the Giants' sideline. The only noise came from the celebrating Eagles.\n\n===The call===\nWith Giants victory all but assured, [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] commentator [[Don Criqui]] (working alongside [[Sonny Jurgensen]]) had begun to read the end credits for the game's control truck and on-field personnel shortly before the game's final play:\n\n{{quote|It's Giants football now, third and two.

[At this point, the snap and fumble take place.] Wait a minute... here's a free fla- I don't believe it! The Eagles pick it up and Herman Edwards runs it in for a touchdown! An incredible development!}}\n\nAfter the game, while showing league highlights, CBS replayed the play. They showed the reaction of both coaches, while [[Brent Musburger]] famously narrated, \"A study in contrast!\"  According to RJ Bell of Pregame, the point spread of Philadelphia Eagles \u22122 turned Giants winning bets into pushes.\n\n==The immediate aftermath==\nFor Edwards, the play was a personal redemption, as he had been burned on one of Pisarcik's early touchdown passes and would have been partially to blame for the loss. It also was his first NFL touchdown. Vermeil refused to question McVay's judgment but allowed that he, too, disliked sitting on the ball to preserve a victory.<ref name=\"Times game story\" />\n\nGiants fans were enraged. For a football team to lose in that situation was unprecedented. Pisarcik, who belatedly explained to the press, \"I never had control,\"<ref name=\"Times game story\" /> needed a police escort to get to his car.<ref name=\"Times next week story\" /> During an NFL Network show about famous on-field bloopers, Csonka said that he immediately had Pisarcik join him on a chartered plane trip to South Florida, where they hung out and fished for a few days before returning to New York.\n\nGibson was fired the next morning.<ref name=\"Times Gibson firing\">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Giants Oust Gibson A Day After Bungle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/21/archives/giants-oust-gibson-a-day-after-bungle-giants-oust-gibson-a-day.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 21, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> With angry fans already demanding that someone be held responsible for the debacle, team officials felt he had to go in hopes of saving the season.<ref name=gola20081118>{{cite news|last=Gola|first=Hank|title=30 years later, Giant disappointment of 'The Fumble' still lingers|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/30-years-giant-disappointment-fumble-lingers-article-1.335390|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 18, 2008|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> So great was the stigma of having called the play that he never worked in football at any level again.

Gibson was reached by telephone by ESPN and gave the following statement: \"I haven't talked about the game for thirty years, and I'm not about to start now.\"</ref> In 2008, in a telephone call from ESPN and 30 years after the game, Gibson said: \"I haven't talked about the game for 30 years, and I'm not about to start now.\" Gibson died in 2015 at the age of 88.\n\n===Giants fan reaction===\nFans turned on management and ownership as previously grumbled complaints about the team's ineptitude turned into an incessant roar. Their team was now the laughingstock of the league. The Fumble (a term in use before the end of the week) epitomized all the mismanagement and all the talent the team had let get away.\n\nAt a demonstration outside the stadium prior to the next home game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]], many fans threw their tickets into a [[bonfire]]. A [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] furniture dealer named Morris Spielberg organized a Giants' Fans Committee after running an ad in the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' that drew hundreds of responses. They met at a hotel near the stadium prior to the team's final home game on December 10 against the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] and distributed [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s to pass out to fellow fans during the game. Spielberg had arranged for a [[airplane|plane]] to fly over the stadium with a banner reading \"15 Years of Lousy Football \u2014 We've Had Enough.\" When it came, fans were to chant, \"We've had enough.\"\n\nThe Giants posted a 17\u20130 shutout win, but when the plane came (an hour behind schedule), fans showed the victory was not enough to make them forget their recent humiliation. There were more than 24,000 empty seats, yet crowd applause and chants briefly stopped play.\n\n==The rest of the season==\nThe surprise finish accelerated the directions both teams were taking over the season's final four games. They met in [[Veterans Stadium]] in the final [[regular season]] game.\n\n===Eagles===\nPhiladelphia was able to extend its win streak to four games the next week, before losing to Dallas and Minnesota. The Eagles managed a season sweep of the Giants with an easy 20\u20133 victory in the finale to finish 9\u20137 and snare the second of two wild-card spots available under the playoff format at that time. \"One play gets you feeling like you have confidence\", Edwards explained years later. \"You're not worried about losing anymore; now you're thinking about how you can win.\"<ref name=\"25th anniversary\">{{cite news|last=Barber|first=Phil|title=Miracle of Meadowlands Turns 25|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6827118|publisher=National Football League|date=November 12, 2003|accessdate=May 21, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214152018/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6827118|archivedate=December 14, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Eagles lost the [[1978\u201379 NFL playoffs|playoff game]] to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] because of another failed extra point, in addition to a missed field goal as time expired. But it gave them and their fans something to build on for the next season. Philadelphia corrected its kicking woes by drafting barefoot [[Tony Franklin (placekicker)|Tony Franklin]] from Texas A&M in 1979. As a rookie, Franklin booted a 59-yard field goal on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] during a 31\u201321 victory at [[Texas Stadium]].\n\n===Giants===\nAt first, the Giants tried to look ahead and recover. They vowed to win their remaining four games and protect McVay's job. Instead, the collapse continued. The next week, the Giants blew a 10-point lead over the 3\u20139 [[Buffalo Bills]] late in the game, giving up 27 points in the fourth quarter to lose 41\u201317. They would win only one more game the rest of the season, finishing with a 6\u201310 record. The sweep by Philadelphia ensured the Giants would finish last in the division (tied with the Cardinals) for the third straight season, extending their rut and further angering fans.\n\n==After the season==\n\n===Eagles===\nThe next year, the Eagles again earned a wild-card spot and then won their first post-merger playoff game over the [[1979 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] before falling to [[1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]]. Following that season, the Giants traded Pisarcik to them for a draft choice. He would finish his career as a backup to [[Ron Jaworski]] five years later. His entire NFL career is usually embodied in that play, and while he is sometimes reluctant to talk about it, he admits that at least people remember his name thanks to it.\n\nThe Eagles' momentum carried them further in [[1980 NFL season|the 1980\u201381 season]], to the division championship, then the conference title and finally to [[Super Bowl XV]], which they lost 27\u201310 to the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]]. \"We won the game at the end, and we went on to the playoffs\", Edwards said. \"The next thing, we're playing in the Super Bowl.\" He, too, would find that the play defined his career, even though he remained part of the Eagles' lineup for another seven years before going into coaching after a final season split between the Falcons and Rams.\n\n===Giants===\nMcVay's contract expired and, as expected, was not renewed. He said in 2008 that had the Giants won, the team likely would have won two more games, his contract would have been renewed, \"and now I'd be dead with a heart attack.\"{{r|gola20081118}} McVay never coached again, but went on to a front-office job with the [[San Francisco 49ers]], where he helped develop that team into one of the most dominant of the 1980s. [[Andy Robustelli]], a former All-Pro [[defensive end]] who served as the team's director of operations, was also let go.\n\nCsonka's contract was up as well. Since McVay, with whom he had played in the [[World Football League]]'s [[Memphis Southmen]] before signing with the Giants, was gone and his career was ending, he decided to return to Miami, site of his past glories, for one final season. He would win an [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] award before retiring.\n\nDespite widespread calls to hire [[Joe Paterno]] or another successful college coach, the Giants settled on [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]], then an assistant for the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]], to replace McVay. While Perkins was able to follow the Eagles' lead and build a team that eventually made the playoffs in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], the moves that really made a difference for the Giants drew less attention that off-season.\n\nWellington Mara had been running football operations himself since joining the organization in the late 1930s, long after most teams had hired a [[general manager]].  He continued to do so even after inheriting the team upon the death of his father, [[Tim Mara|Tim]], in 1958. While he had delegated some of his authority to Robustelli in 1974, he still had the final say in football matters.  However, the fan revolt that erupted in the wake of the Fumble made the Maras realize that they needed to delegate most of the decisions that sorely divided them.  As with many other team matters, they kept arguing over whom to hire as general manager. In the off-season, they called on NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] to mediate. He suggested [[George Young (football executive)|George Young]], then an executive with the [[Miami Dolphins]], who only took the job after he was granted complete control of the football side of the operation. He proved to be a superb judge of talent, drafting [[Phil Simms]], [[Lawrence Taylor]] and other future Giants stars over the next few seasons.\n\nIn 1981, Perkins hired a new defensive coordinator, [[Bill Parcells]], a [[New England Patriots]] assistant who was out of coaching in 1979 after serving as head coach at [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] in 1978. When Perkins resigned after the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] to succeed the late [[Bear Bryant]] at the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]], Parcells took over as head coach. He survived a disastrous first season to lead the talent Young had acquired to two Super Bowl championships.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Miracle at the Meadowlands has left a lasting impact on the way organized football is played at all levels, not just in the NFL. Most notably, it legitimized the [[quarterback kneel]]. Coaches everywhere took heed of Gibson's fate and immediately began instructing quarterbacks to sit on the ball in similar situations. Some traditionalists feel that the kneel-down has been detrimental to the game and have called for rule changes to eliminate or discourage the play.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Other leagues, such as the [[Arena Football League]], have done just that, and now require the ball to be advanced past the line of scrimmage in order for the clock to continue running in the final minute of play.\n\n[[File:Post-Pisarcik QB kneel formation.svg|250px|left|thumb|Formation used ever since the Fumble/Miracle for quarterback kneel play.]]\n\n===Formation change===\nThe week after the game, both the Giants and Eagles implemented a new offensive formation to be used only in end-of-game kneeldowns.  It is popularly known as the \"Victory Formation\" or \"Victory Offense\".\n\nNot only did the infamous game-losing play make kneeling acceptable, but most of the teams using it changed how it was done. Prior to Pisarcik's fumble, teams had employed standard offensive formations such as an I or a split backfield. The Eagles' unlikely touchdown, however, had made the weakness of doing so glaring. Even though Pisarcik had been trying to hand off instead of kneeling, when he fumbled the snap, there was not only no offensive player there to try to recover it, no one was in position to tackle Edwards and prevent the touchdown either.\n\nAt the end of the first half of the Bills game the following week, the Giants debuted the new formation when Pisarcik knelt to preserve their lead. Two running backs stood closely behind Pisarcik while a third (usually a speedy player such as a [[wide receiver]]) was stationed as a sort of safety several yards back.\n\nThe Eagles, too, had practiced a similar formation in practice, calling it the Herman Edwards play. Other NFL teams soon followed the lead, and today the formation is standard in college and high school games as well.\n\n===Similar plays===\nThe play has been recalled often by fans and reporters in later years when a team fumbled away a sure victory late in the game, although it never happened quite as spectacularly as it did that first time.\n\nProbably the most famous play to evoke the Miracle of the Meadowlands, although with a very different outcome, occurred almost three decades later in a [[2005\u201306 NFL playoffs#AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Indianapolis Colts 18|2006 Steelers-Colts AFC divisional playoff game]]. As in 1978, an [[Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis]] turnover on downs had given [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Pittsburgh]] the ball on the Indianapolis 2-yard line and an apparent three-point victory over the heavily favored Colts in the game's final two minutes. However, the Steelers had to keep running the ball, as the Colts still had all their timeouts left. A field goal would have at least required the Colts to score a touchdown (plus kick the extra point) to win the game, while a touchdown would essentially clinch victory, so it was in the Steelers' interest to keep running. A pass would run the risk of being intercepted, or seeing the defense knock the ball out of the quarterback's hand. But on the very first play, running back [[Jerome Bettis]], who had not fumbled all season, had the ball knocked loose by Indianapolis middle linebacker [[Gary Brackett]]. Defensive back [[Nick Harper (American football)|Nick Harper]] recovered the ball and appeared to be on the way to an Edwards-like touchdown, but Pittsburgh quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] managed to tackle Harper near midfield.\n\nSteelers fans and players feared that Bettis was about to end his career with the same ignominy that followed Pisarcik. Several plays later, however, Colts [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Mike Vanderjagt]] wound up the game's [[scapegoat#Scapegoating in sports|goat]], evoking [[Wide Right (Buffalo Bills)|another memorable football moment]] when he missed what would have been the tying field goal, ending what had been a strong season for his team. The Steelers eventually went on to [[Super Bowl XL|a Super Bowl victory that year]], and the play would instead enter NFL lore as \"[[Pittsburgh sports lore#The Tackle II|The Tackle II]]\".\n\nThe play most directly analogous to the Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On [[Thanksgiving Day]] [[1993 NFL season|1993]], the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]]. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, waiting for it to come to rest in order to down it as close as possible to the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end [[Leon Lett]] sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16\u201314 victory.\n\nLett earned comparisons to Pisarcik and the 1978 Giants since his action was as unnecessary and seemed equally inexplicable. It was fourth down and the ball would have been turned over to Dallas anyway. Coming on the heels of [[Super Bowl XXVII|the previous year's Super Bowl]], when a prematurely celebrating Lett had been stripped on a fourth-quarter fumble return as he was about to score a touchdown, the Thanksgiving gaffe cemented his reputation for unthinking play that overshadowed his entire career.\n\nA near-identical play in a 1999 collegiate game allowed the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV) to steal a victory from [[Baylor University|Baylor]]. With the final seconds ticking off the clock, Baylor had a 24\u201321 lead and possession of the football near the UNLV goal line.  With UNLV out of timeouts, only a kneeldown was necessary. However, instead of trying to run out the clock, Baylor elected to try for a touchdown in an attempt to [[running up the score|run up the final score]]. Baylor running back Darryl Bush fumbled while trying to punch his way into the end zone, and UNLV's Kevin Thomas picked up the loose football and went 99 yards for the game-winning touchdown on the last play of the game.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n\"The Miracle on the Mountain\" is another play with similar circumstances. It took place on October 12, 2002 in a game between the home [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State Mountaineers]] and visiting [[Furman University|Furman Paladins]] at Kidd Brewer Stadium. A low scoring affair, the Paladins elected to attempt a two-point conversion after scoring the go-ahead touchdown with seven seconds left in the game. Leading 15\u201314, Furman quarterback Billy Napier's pass was intercepted by Josh Jeffries at the four-yard line. He lateraled the ball to Derrick Black, who returned it for a score, giving the Mountaineers a 16\u201315 win.\n\nA similar play occurred during a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Chargers]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] on October 31, 2011. Tied 20\u201320, the Chargers offense marched the ball down the field to the Chiefs' 15-yard line. With one minute left, the Chiefs had no timeouts and the Chargers could run the clock down to the final seconds. Chargers quarterback [[Philip Rivers]] snapped the ball with the intent to simply fall down and to the left, to line up kicker [[Nick Novak]] for the game-winning field goal.

With thousands of fans already having given up and headed to the [[Soldier Field]] parking lot, running back [[Blair Thomas]] took a handoff.  Bears defensive tackle [[Steve McMichael]] stopped Thomas cold and then proceeded to wrestle the ball from his grasp, falling on the fumble at the Jets' 36-yard line with 1:54 remaining. On the final play of regulation, [[Jim Harbaugh]] threw a six-yard touchdown pass to [[Neal Anderson]]; Bears kicker [[Kevin Butler (American football)|Kevin Butler]] tied the game with the extra point.

It was the greatest comeback in ''MNF'' history, and was later voted the best ''Monday Night Football'' game ever by the show's fans.

The club is the defending [[2018-19 FA WSL|Women's Super League]] champion.\n\n==Review==\n===[[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]]===\nThe 2019\u201320 season is coming off the back of the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]] which was played in France. A total of ten Gunners were competing at the World Cup with five different countries. Both [[Scotland women's national football team|Scotland]] and [[Netherlands women's national football team|The Netherlands]] both had three Arsenal players in their roster: [[Jennifer Beattie]], [[Kim Little]] and [[Lisa Evans]] for Scotland and [[Dani\u00eblle van de Donk]], [[Jill Roord]] and [[Vivianne Miedema]] for The Netherlands. [[Leah Williamson]] and [[Beth Mead]] were in the [[England women's national football team|England]] squad while [[Pauline Peyraud-Magnin]] played for hosts [[France women's national football team|France]] and [[Leonie Maier]] for [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]].\n\nThe Dutch got the furthest in the tournament, ultimately being defeated 2\u20130 by the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]] in the final winning them the silver medal in only their second World Cup appearance. England got fourth place after losing the third place play-off against Sweden 1\u20132. France got knocked out in the quarter-finals by the United States (1\u20132), Germany was beaten 1\u20132 by Sweden in the quarter-finals and Scotland was not able to get out of their group.\n\n===Pre-season===\n====[[2019 Emirates Cup|Emirates Cup]]====\nThe first pre-season friendly was against [[Bayern Munich (women)|Bayern M\u00fcnchen]] in the Emirates Cup on 28 July, played in the [[Emirates Stadium]]. The women's team played this as a double-header with the men, who played [[Olympique Lyonnais]] later that afternoon. The team were still missing their Dutch and English internationals, who were not yet in training as they just returned from holiday after playing in the later stages of the World Cup. Aside from those missing internationals, the team had only been in pre-season for one and a half weeks whilst Bayern's season would start in a few weeks. Bayern won the match 0\u20131, with [[Melanie Leupolz]] heading in a free-kick in the first half. The match was overshadowed by [[Danielle Carter (footballer)|Danielle Carter]] going off the field on a stretcher late in the second half. It was later revealed that she had sustained an ACL injury, which will keep her off the pitch for a long time. This just after she had come back from an ACL injury for which she had been out for almost a year. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Jul-28/women-bayern-munich-women-match-report|title=Arsenal Women 0-1 Bayern Munich: What Happened|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=July 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nCoach [[Joe Montemurro]] admitted that the game came a bit too early in their pre-season, but that it was a great occasion to showcase the women's game to a bigger crowd. He would've liked to come up against opposition of this kind a bit further into the pre-season, but the chance came along to be part of the Emirates Cup. It was important though to make sure the World Cup players were given a good rest before starting pre-season at the club. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://arseblog.news/2019/07/arsenal-women-bayern-munich/|title=Joe Montemurro reacts to Bayern Munich defeat|accessdate=August 4, 2019|date=July 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Playing Europe's best====\nThe first part of pre-season included the previously mentioned match against Bayern and further friendlies against [[VfL Wolfsburg (women)|VfL Wolfsburg]] (two-time Champions League winner and 2018-19 quarter-finalist) and [[FC Barcelona Femen\u00ed|FC Barcelona]] (2018-19 Champions League finalist). A 3\u20130 defeat against the current German champions in the Austrian mountains and a 2\u20135 defeat at home against Bar\u00e7a showed that the team still has work to do in order to prepare for the upcoming European season. One of the issues seems the absence of Lia W\u00e4lti, who is still recovering from a knee injury. She plays as defensive midfielder and Joe Montemurro has attempted to work around her injury by trying other players on that position or other formations, but none seem to have had the desired effect - a problem that will need solving before the season begins. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://arseblog.news/2019/08/danielle-van-de-donk-reacts-to-5-2-barcelona-defeat/|title=Danielle van de Donk Reacts to 5-2 Barcelona defeat|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Preparing for the domestic competition====\nAfter going head-to-head against the best European teams, Montemurro's team went on to play two more friendlies to prepare for the domestic season.

Women|West Ham United]] (8 September), which saw the official debuts of [[Jill Roord]], [[Leonie Maier]] and [[Manuela Zinsberger]] \u2013 [[Jen Beattie]] made her second debut for the club. [[Beth Mead]] put Arsenal ahead after 14 minutes and Roord scored on her debut before half-time. A second half goal by [[Martha Thomas (soccer)|Martha Thomas]] saw West Ham bring the score to 2\u20131 and they could've leveled it just before the end of the match when they were awarded an indirect free-kick after Arsenal goalkeeper Zinsberger picked up what the referee perceived to be a backpass, but the shot was saved by Zinsberger. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-08/women-2-1-west-ham-united-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 2-1 West Ham|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter more than five years Arsenal returned to the [[UEFA Women's Champions League|Champions League]] with their 12 September match in Italy against [[Fiorentina Women's F.C.|Fiorentina]] in which they ran out 0\u20134 winners thanks to two goals by [[Vivianne Miedema]] (who was missing from the West Ham match because of a tight hamstring), and a goal a piece by [[Lisa Evans]] and [[Kim Little]]. Advancement to the next round seems pretty certain, but Arsenal welcomes Fiorentina to Meadow Park on 26 September for the return fixture. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-12/fiorentina-women-0-4-women-match-report|title=Match report: Fiorentina 0-4 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 September the Gunners traveled to [[Leigh Sports Village]] to play newly promoted [[2018\u201319 FA Women's Championship|Championship]] champions [[Manchester United W.F.C.|Manchester United]]. It was a very tight match, with good chances on both sides: [[Jane Ross (footballer)|Jane Ross]] had her promising attack stopped by Zinsberger and Miedema saw her attempts frustrated by [[Mary Earps]]. A 89th-minute goal from [[Dani\u00eblle van de Donk]] proving to be the difference between the two teams that evening, the fixture ending in 0\u20131 and Arsenal maintaining their good start to the league season. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-16/manchester-united-women-women-match-report|title=Match report: Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe next competition to kick-off was the [[2019\u201320 FA Women's League Cup|League Cup]], in which Arsenal first traveled to newly-formed [[London City Lionesses]] on 22 September. On paper it should be a relatively easy tie against the second-tier Lionesses and so it turned out to be: Mead bagged a hat-trick while Roord and Mitchell got one each, ending the game at 0\u20135 and topping the group after this first game. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-22/london-city-lionesses-0-5-women-match-report|title=Match report: London City Lionesses 0-5 Arsenal|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Fiorentina Women's F.C.|Fiorentina]] visited Meadow Park for the first home Champions League game in more than five years on 26 September. Arsenal had already scored four away goals, thus this game shouldn't be more than a formality.

The Gunners ran out clear 4\u20130 victors, with Little, Miedema, Van de Donk and Nobbs all bagging one goal each. Besides scoring one goal, Miedema also assisted the goals for Little and Van de Donk. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-29/women-4-0-brighton-hove-albion-wfc-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal 4-0 Brighton & Hove Albion|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===October===\nAfter the October international break, Arsenal visited [[Chelsea F.C. Women|Chelsea]] at Kingsmeadow on 13 October. The Gunners took the early lead through a Van de Donk goal but seemed disjointed and underperforming in the second half, allowing in two Chelsea goals causing the first defeat this season and ending their run of 11 matches unbeaten. As a result of the 2\u20131 defeat, the team dropped down to third in the league rankings. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Oct-13/chelsea-women-1-1-women-match-report|title=Match report: Chelsea 2-1 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA quick turn-around was needed, as the team played [[SK Slavia Praha (women)|Slavia Praha]] in mid-week for the first tie in the round-of-16 of the Champions League. Arsenal showed how to bounce back, with Miedema scoring a hat-trick in the first half, before adding another one after the break and Little scoring a penalty. Leading 0\u20135, coach Montemurro opted to rest some players and take off McCabe and Williamson for Mitchell and Quinn and substituted Miedema off for Roord. Slavia were able to score twice after this, ending the game in 2\u20135 \u2013 taking home a clear advantage to Meadow Park in two weeks time. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Oct-16/sk-slavia-praha-women-match-report|title=Match report: Slavia Prague 2-5 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThat Sunday (20 October), [[Charlton Athletic W.F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] visited Meadow Park for the second match in the League Cup. Beattie scored her first goal back for the club in the 34th minute, before the game was wrapped up in a timespan of ten minutes with Van de Donk scoring twice, just before and after the break and Mead getting in on the scoring action too, ending the game in a clear 4\u20130 victory. Only point of worry was Miedema going off the pitch in the final stages of the match, after getting a kick to the calf - Montemurro had run out of substitutes and the Gunners played the remaining minutes with 10. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/was-all-part-build-city|title=\u2018This was all part of the build-up for City\u2019|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBack to the league, [[Manchester City W.F.C.|Manchester City]] came to Arsenal's home on 27 October. City were the only side who hadn't dropped any points in the league yet and were on top of the league. Great play between Little and Miedema saw the latter score her 49th goal in as many starts for the club, slotting the ball low past City goalkeeper [[Ellie Roebuck]]. Her goal turned out to be the only one in the game, though Nobbs came very close in the latter stages of the second half, but missed an absolute sitter a few yards from the goal. With the 1\u20130 victory, Arsenal moved up to second, just one point behind Chelsea. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Oct-27/women-1-0-manchester-city-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 1-0 Manchester City|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArsenal finished off October with a solid 8\u20130 thumping of Slavia in the Champions League return. The tie was already clearly in Arsenal's favour, having a three-goal advantage - meaning that Slavia would've needed to score at least four goals (away-goal rule) in order to progress. However, the home team left the visitors no chances, the Gunners were clearly on top in this fixture which saw Van de Donk and Miedema both score a hat-trick, with Little (penalty) and Roord each scoring one. Arsenal move on to the quarter-finals, the tie ending in 13\u20132 on aggregate. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Oct-31/women-8-0-sk-slavia-praha-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal 8-0 Slavia Prague (agg 13-2)|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===November===\nThe first game of November was played at [[Brighton & Hove Albion W.F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] on 3 November in the groupstage of the League Cup. No goals were scored in regular time, gaining both teams one point. Afterwards, a penalty shoot-out was held to determine the winner of another point. Little and Mead missed their penalties, four of the five Brighton players were able to score - giving the second point to Brighton. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Nov-03/brighton-hove-albion-wfc-0-0-women-match-report|title=Match report: Brighton 0-0 Arsenal (4-2 pens)|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=November 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the international break, the Gunners played [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Women|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 17 November in the first women's league [[North London Derby]], at the new [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium]]. The first half was pretty even between Arsenal and rivals Spurs, but in the end a league record crowd of 38,262 saw Arsenal win 2\u20130, thanks to second-half goals from Little and Miedema. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Nov-17/tottenham-hotspur-wfc-0-2-women-match-report|title=Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 0-2 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBack to the League Cup, Arsenal welcomed [[Bristol City W.F.C.|Bristol City]] to Meadow Park on 21 November in this mid-week game in the League Cup. The game stayed 0\u20130 for a long time in the first half, but Little found the back of the net after 33 minutes. This was the start of plenty of Arsenal goals: Little scored two, as did Miedema. Further goals came from Roord, Nobbs and Beattie. The game ended in 7\u20130 with advancement to the knock-out stages of the League Cup all but secured. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2020-Mar-22/bristol-city-women-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 7-0 Bristol City|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe last game of November, on the 24th was against bottom of the league [[Liverpool W.F.C.|Liverpool]]. Although standing last in the league, Liverpool hadn't conceded many goals throughout the season. This game was no different, a first-half goal by Miedema making the difference to decide this match: 1\u20130. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Nov-24/women-1-0-liverpool-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 1-0 Liverpool|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=November 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===December===\n{{Main|Arsenal Women 11\u20131 Bristol City Women}}\nWhen [[Bristol City W.F.C.|Bristol City]] returned to Meadow Park for the league on 1 December, Arsenal continued where they left off in the League Cup 10 days prior. In a new record win for the [[Women's Super League]], the Gunners put 11 goals past Bristol, in what could only be described as a Miedema masterclass. In her 70 minutes on the pitch, she scored six and assisted another four goals: two scored by Evans, and one each by Williamson and Nobbs. Miedema was thus involved in all ten goals scored when she was on the pitch. After being substituted, two further goals were scored: one by Mitchell - who substituted on for Miedema and one by Bristol's [[Yana Daniels]], who put away a penalty rebound ending the game in 11\u20131. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Dec-01/women-11-1-bristol-city-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 11-1 Bristol City|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA week later on 8 December Arsenal went to [[Adams Park]] to take on [[Reading F.C. Women|Reading]] in the league. After a slow start (first 30 minutes) in which Reading played a high press, making it difficult for Arsenal to execute their game plan, Miedema was the first to score. Ten minutes later Little finished a superbe team-goal, engineered by her with one-touch passing between her, Nobbs and Williamson. After the break, not much changed for the scoreline until the first minute of extra time when Miedema dinked the ball over the keeper into the net after a long pass by Van de Donk, ending the game in 0\u20133. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Dec-08/reading-women-0-3-women-match-report|title=Match report: Reading 0-3 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=December 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArsenal welcomed [[London Bees]] on 11 December for the final groupstage game in the League Cup. The difference between the Super League champions and the Championship side was quite clear, a hattrick from both McCabe and [[Melisa Filis]], a further two goals by Evans and one by Mead and a clean sheet producing the 9\u20130 end result. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Dec-11/women-9-0-london-bees-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 9-0 London Bees|accessdate=December 13, 2019|date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the last game of 2019, Arsenal traveled to [[Everton F.C. (Women)|Everton]] on 15 December for their league game. Game started off well, Miedema scoring the first inside 15 minutes. Halfway through the first half, [[Gabrielle George]] collided with Mead causing the latter to be stretchered off the field, letting Arsenal fans - all to familiar with injuries over the last seasons - fear the worst. The second half produced the end result: a Little penalty, another Miedema goal and an Everton goal by [[Chloe Kelly]] ending the game in 1\u20133. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Dec-15/everton-ladies-1-3-women-match-report|title=Match report: Everton 1-3 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 19, 2019|date=December 15, 2019}}</ref> Luckily for the Gunners, Arsenal later reported that after taking x-rays of her leg, Mead's injuries weren't as bad as they seemed during the game - only sustaining brusing to her lower leg. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/beth-mead-injury-update|title=Beth Mead injury update|accessdate=December 19, 2019|date=December 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===January===\nThe new year started off with a visit by [[Birmingham City W.F.C.|Birmingham City]] to Meadow Park on 5 January. A first-half goal each from Little and Nobbs resulting in a 2\u20130 win. The Birmingham side had been a mainstay in the top four for recent seasons, but managerial changes and important players transferring out has left the club fighting to stay up thus far this season. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2020-Jan-05/women-2-0-birmingham-city-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 2-0 Birmingham City|accessdate=February 16, 2019|date=January 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA week later (12 January), the Gunners traveled to [[Brighton & Hove Albion W.F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]].

Women|Chelsea]] to Meadow Park. The first 20 minutes from the visitors was an onslaught, striking three times - by England, Kerr and Ingle, leaving the Gunners no chance to get into the game. Reiten scored a fourth in the second-half before Mead got a consolation goal. Manager Montemurro later admitted that he got the tactics wrong in attempting to press a bit higher up the pitch and stop them from playing through the middle and to create overloads in the middle of the park <ref>{{cite web|url=https://arseblog.news/2020/01/joe-montemurro-reacts-to-chelsea-defeat/|title=JOE MONTEMURRO REACTS TO CHELSEA DEFEAT|accessdate=February 13, 2020|date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>, which allowed Chelsea to easily attack from the sides. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2020-Jan-19/women-1-4-chelsea-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 1-4 Chelsea|accessdate=February 16, 2019|date=January 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArsenal entered [[2019\u201320 Women's FA Cup|the season's FA Cup]] in the fourth round, drawing fellow WSL-side [[West Ham United F.C.

Club]]'s 34rd season of competitive [[Association football|football]]. The club participates in the [[2019\u201320 UEFA Women's Champions League|Champions League]], the [[2019-20 FA WSL|Women's Super League]], the [[2019-20 FA Women's Cup|FA Cup]] and the [[2019-20 FA WSL Cup|League Cup]]. The club is the defending [[2018-19 FA WSL|Women's Super League]] champion.\n\n==Review==\n===[[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]]===\nThe 2019\u201320 season is coming off the back of the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]] which was played in France. A total of ten Gunners were competing at the World Cup with five different countries. Both [[Scotland women's national football team|Scotland]] and [[Netherlands women's national football team|The Netherlands]] both had three Arsenal players in their roster: [[Jennifer Beattie]], [[Kim Little]] and [[Lisa Evans]] for Scotland and [[Dani\u00eblle van de Donk]], [[Jill Roord]] and [[Vivianne Miedema]] for The Netherlands. [[Leah Williamson]] and [[Beth Mead]] were in the [[England women's national football team|England]] squad while [[Pauline Peyraud-Magnin]] played for hosts [[France women's national football team|France]] and [[Leonie Maier]] for [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]].\n\nThe Dutch got the furthest in the tournament, ultimately being defeated 2\u20130 by the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]] in the final winning them the silver medal in only their second World Cup appearance. England got fourth place after losing the third place play-off against Sweden 1\u20132. France got knocked out in the quarter-finals by the United States (1\u20132), Germany was beaten 1\u20132 by Sweden in the quarter-finals and Scotland was not able to get out of their group.\n\n===Pre-season===\n====[[2019 Emirates Cup|Emirates Cup]]====\nThe first pre-season friendly was against [[Bayern Munich (women)|Bayern M\u00fcnchen]] in the Emirates Cup on 28 July, played in the [[Emirates Stadium]]. The women's team played this as a double-header with the men, who played [[Olympique Lyonnais]] later that afternoon. The team were still missing their Dutch and English internationals, who were not yet in training as they just returned from holiday after playing in the later stages of the World Cup. Aside from those missing internationals, the team had only been in pre-season for one and a half weeks whilst Bayern's season would start in a few weeks. Bayern won the match 0\u20131, with [[Melanie Leupolz]] heading in a free-kick in the first half. The match was overshadowed by [[Danielle Carter (footballer)|Danielle Carter]] going off the field on a stretcher late in the second half. It was later revealed that she had sustained an ACL injury, which will keep her off the pitch for a long time. This just after she had come back from an ACL injury for which she had been out for almost a year. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Jul-28/women-bayern-munich-women-match-report|title=Arsenal Women 0-1 Bayern Munich: What Happened|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=July 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nCoach [[Joe Montemurro]] admitted that the game came a bit too early in their pre-season, but that it was a great occasion to showcase the women's game to a bigger crowd. He would've liked to come up against opposition of this kind a bit further into the pre-season, but the chance came along to be part of the Emirates Cup. It was important though to make sure the World Cup players were given a good rest before starting pre-season at the club. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://arseblog.news/2019/07/arsenal-women-bayern-munich/|title=Joe Montemurro reacts to Bayern Munich defeat|accessdate=August 4, 2019|date=July 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Playing Europe's best====\nThe first part of pre-season included the previously mentioned match against Bayern and further friendlies against [[VfL Wolfsburg (women)|VfL Wolfsburg]] (two-time Champions League winner and 2018-19 quarter-finalist) and [[FC Barcelona Femen\u00ed|FC Barcelona]] (2018-19 Champions League finalist). A 3\u20130 defeat against the current German champions in the Austrian mountains and a 2\u20135 defeat at home against Bar\u00e7a showed that the team still has work to do in order to prepare for the upcoming European season. One of the issues seems the absence of Lia W\u00e4lti, who is still recovering from a knee injury. She plays as defensive midfielder and Joe Montemurro has attempted to work around her injury by trying other players on that position or other formations, but none seem to have had the desired effect - a problem that will need solving before the season begins. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://arseblog.news/2019/08/danielle-van-de-donk-reacts-to-5-2-barcelona-defeat/|title=Danielle van de Donk Reacts to 5-2 Barcelona defeat|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Preparing for the domestic competition====\nAfter going head-to-head against the best European teams, Montemurro's team went on to play two more friendlies to prepare for the domestic season. They first played [[West Ham United W.F.C.|West Ham United]] behind closed doors, winning it 2\u20130.  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://arseblog.news/2019/08/arsenal-v-tottenham-hotspr-women-match-preview/|title=Arsenal v Tottenham Hotsp*r women match preview|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=August 23, 2019}}</ref> The final pre-season game came on 25 August against North London rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Women|Tottenham Hotspur]] which was won 6\u20130 with an hat-trick by new signing [[Jill Roord]] and further goals by fellow new signing [[Jen Beattie]], 2018/19 topscorer [[Vivianne Miedema]] and [[Jordan Nobbs]], who returned to the pitch after being out since November 2018 with an ACL injury. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Aug-25/women-6-0-tottenham-hotspur-wfc-match-report|title=Match Report: Arsenal Women 6-0 Tottenham|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===September===\nThe Gunners' season started in September with a home game against [[West Ham United F.C. Women|West Ham United]] (8 September), which saw the official debuts of [[Jill Roord]], [[Leonie Maier]] and [[Manuela Zinsberger]] \u2013 [[Jen Beattie]] made her second debut for the club. [[Beth Mead]] put Arsenal ahead after 14 minutes and Roord scored on her debut before half-time. A second half goal by [[Martha Thomas (soccer)|Martha Thomas]] saw West Ham bring the score to 2\u20131 and they could've leveled it just before the end of the match when they were awarded an indirect free-kick after Arsenal goalkeeper Zinsberger picked up what the referee perceived to be a backpass, but the shot was saved by Zinsberger. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-08/women-2-1-west-ham-united-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 2-1 West Ham|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter more than five years Arsenal returned to the [[UEFA Women's Champions League|Champions League]] with their 12 September match in Italy against [[Fiorentina Women's F.C.|Fiorentina]] in which they ran out 0\u20134 winners thanks to two goals by [[Vivianne Miedema]] (who was missing from the West Ham match because of a tight hamstring), and a goal a piece by [[Lisa Evans]] and [[Kim Little]]. Advancement to the next round seems pretty certain, but Arsenal welcomes Fiorentina to Meadow Park on 26 September for the return fixture. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-12/fiorentina-women-0-4-women-match-report|title=Match report: Fiorentina 0-4 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 September the Gunners traveled to [[Leigh Sports Village]] to play newly promoted [[2018\u201319 FA Women's Championship|Championship]] champions [[Manchester United W.F.C.|Manchester United]]. It was a very tight match, with good chances on both sides: [[Jane Ross (footballer)|Jane Ross]] had her promising attack stopped by Zinsberger and Miedema saw her attempts frustrated by [[Mary Earps]]. A 89th minute goal from [[Dani\u00eblle van de Donk]] proving to be the difference between the two teams that evening, the fixture ending in 0\u20131 and Arsenal maintaining their good start to the league season. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-16/manchester-united-women-women-match-report|title=Match report: Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe next competition to kick-off was the [[2019\u201320 FA Women's League Cup|League Cup]], in which Arsenal first traveled to newly-formed [[London City Lionesses]] on 22 September. On paper it should be a relatively easy tie against the second-tier Lionesses and so it turned out to be: Mead bagged a hat-trick while Roord and Mitchell got one each, ending the game at 0\u20135 and topping the group after this first game. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-22/london-city-lionesses-0-5-women-match-report|title=Match report: London City Lionesses 0-5 Arsenal|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Fiorentina Women's F.C.|Fiorentina]] visited Meadow Park for the first home Champions League game in more than five years on 26 September. Arsenal had already scored four away goals, thus this game shouldn't be more than a formality. A first-half penalty by Little and a second half goal from Miedema ended the game in 2-0, the Gunners winning the tie 6-0 on aggregate. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-26/women-2-0-fiorentina-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal 2-0 Fiorentina (6-0 agg)|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLeague action returned when [[Brighton & Hove Albion W.F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] visited Meadow Park on 29 September for the third league game of the season. The Gunners ran out clear 4\u20130 victors, with Little, Miedema, Van de Donk and Nobbs all bagging one goal each. Besides scoring one goal, Miedema also assisted the goals for Little and Van de Donk. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Sep-29/women-4-0-brighton-hove-albion-wfc-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal 4-0 Brighton & Hove Albion|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===October===\nAfter the October international break, Arsenal visited [[Chelsea F.C. Women|Chelsea]] at Kingsmeadow on 13 October. The Gunners took the early lead through a Van de Donk goal but seemed disjointed and underperforming in the second half, allowing in two Chelsea goals causing the first defeat this season and ending their run of 11 matches unbeaten. As a result of the 2\u20131 defeat, the team dropped down to third in the league rankings. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Oct-13/chelsea-women-1-1-women-match-report|title=Match report: Chelsea 2-1 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA quick turn-around was needed, as the team played [[SK Slavia Praha (women)|Slavia Praha]] in mid-week for the first tie in the round-of-16 of the Champions League. Arsenal showed how to bounce back, with Miedema scoring a hat-trick in the first half, before adding another one after the break and Little scoring a penalty. Leading 0\u20135, coach Montemurro opted to rest some players and take off McCabe and Williamson for Mitchell and Quinn and substituted Miedema off for Roord. Slavia were able to score twice after this, ending the game in 2\u20135 \u2013 taking home a clear advantage to Meadow Park in two weeks time. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Oct-16/sk-slavia-praha-women-match-report|title=Match report: Slavia Prague 2-5 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThat Sunday (20 October), [[Charlton Athletic W.F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] visited Meadow Park for the second match in the League Cup. Beattie scored her first goal back for the club in the 34th minute, before the game was wrapped up in a timespan of ten minutes with Van de Donk scoring twice, just before and after the break and Mead getting in on the scoring action too, ending the game in a clear 4\u20130 victory. Only point of worry was Miedema going off the pitch in the final stages of the match, after getting a kick to the calf - Montemurro had run out of substitutes and the Gunners played the remaining minutes with 10. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/was-all-part-build-city|title=\u2018This was all part of the build-up for City\u2019|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBack to the league, [[Manchester City W.F.C.|Manchester City]] came to Arsenal's home on 27 October. City were the only side who hadn't dropped any points in the league yet and were on top of the league. Great play between Little and Miedema saw the latter score her 49th goal in as many starts for the club, slotting the ball low past City goalkeeper [[Ellie Roebuck]]. Her goal turned out to be the only one in the game, though Nobbs came very close in the latter stages of the second half, but missed an absolute sitter a few yards from the goal. With the 1\u20130 victory, Arsenal moved up to second, just one point behind Chelsea. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Oct-27/women-1-0-manchester-city-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 1-0 Manchester City|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArsenal finished off October with a solid 8\u20130 thumping of Slavia in the Champions League return. The tie was already clearly in Arsenal's favour, having a three-goal advantage - meaning that Slavia would've needed to score at least four goals (away-goal rule) in order to progress. However, the home team left the visitors no chances, the Gunners were clearly on top in this fixture which saw Van de Donk and Miedema both score a hat-trick, with Little (penalty) and Roord each scoring one. Arsenal move on to the quarter-finals, the tie ending in 13\u20132 on aggregate. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Oct-31/women-8-0-sk-slavia-praha-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal 8-0 Slavia Prague (agg 13-2)|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===November===\nThe first game of November was played at [[Brighton & Hove Albion W.F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] on 3 November in the groupstage of the League Cup. No goals were scored in regular time, gaining both teams one point. Afterwards, a penalty shoot-out was held to determine the winner of another point. Little and Mead missed their penalties, four of the five Brighton players were able to score - giving the second point to Brighton. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Nov-03/brighton-hove-albion-wfc-0-0-women-match-report|title=Match report: Brighton 0-0 Arsenal (4-2 pens)|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=November 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the international break, the Gunners played [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Women|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 17 November in the first women's league [[North London Derby]], at the new [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium]]. The first half was pretty even between Arsenal and rivals Spurs, but in the end a league record crowd of 38,262 saw Arsenal win 2\u20130, thanks to second-half goals from Little and Miedema. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Nov-17/tottenham-hotspur-wfc-0-2-women-match-report|title=Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 0-2 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBack to the League Cup, Arsenal welcomed [[Bristol City W.F.C.|Bristol City]] to Meadow Park on 21 November in this mid-week game in the League Cup. The game stayed 0\u20130 for a long time in the first half, but Little found the back of the net after 33 minutes. This was the start of plenty of Arsenal goals: Little scored two, as did Miedema. Further goals came from Roord, Nobbs and Beattie. The game ended in 7\u20130 with advancement to the knock-out stages of the League Cup all but secured. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2020-Mar-22/bristol-city-women-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 7-0 Bristol City|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe last game of November, on the 24th was against bottom of the league [[Liverpool W.F.C.|Liverpool]]. Although standing last in the league, Liverpool hadn't conceded many goals throughout the season. This game was no different, a first-half goal by Miedema making the difference to decide this match: 1\u20130. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Nov-24/women-1-0-liverpool-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 1-0 Liverpool|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=November 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===December===\n{{Main|Arsenal Women 11\u20131 Bristol City Women}}\nWhen [[Bristol City W.F.C.|Bristol City]] returned to Meadow Park for the league on 1 December, Arsenal continued where they left off in the League Cup 10 days prior. In a new record win for the [[Women's Super League]], the Gunners put 11 goals past Bristol, in what could only be described as a Miedema masterclass. In her 70 minutes on the pitch, she scored six and assisted another four goals: two scored by Evans, and one each by Williamson and Nobbs. Miedema was thus involved in all ten goals scored when she was on the pitch. After being substituted, two further goals were scored: one by Mitchell - who substituted on for Miedema and one by Bristol's [[Yana Daniels]], who put away a penalty rebound ending the game in 11\u20131. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Dec-01/women-11-1-bristol-city-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 11-1 Bristol City|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA week later on 8 December Arsenal went to [[Adams Park]] to take on [[Reading F.C. Women|Reading]] in the league. After a slow start (first 30 minutes) in which Reading played a high press, making it difficult for Arsenal to execute their game plan, Miedema was the first to score. Ten minutes later Little finished a superbe team-goal, engineered by her with one-touch passing between her, Nobbs and Williamson. After the break, not much changed for the scoreline until the first minute of extra time when Miedema dinked the ball over the keeper into the net after a long pass by Van de Donk, ending the game in 0\u20133. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Dec-08/reading-women-0-3-women-match-report|title=Match report: Reading 0-3 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 9, 2019|date=December 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArsenal welcomed [[London Bees]] on 11 December for the final groupstage game in the League Cup. The difference between the Super League champions and the Championship side was quite clear, a hattrick from both McCabe and [[Melisa Filis]], a further two goals by Evans and one by Mead and a clean sheet producing the 9\u20130 end result. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Dec-11/women-9-0-london-bees-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 9-0 London Bees|accessdate=December 13, 2019|date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the last game of 2019, Arsenal traveled to [[Everton F.C. (Women)|Everton]] on 15 December for their league game. Game started off well, Miedema scoring the first inside 15 minutes. Halfway through the first half, [[Gabrielle George]] collided with Mead causing the latter to be stretchered off the field, letting Arsenal fans - all to familiar with injuries over the last seasons - fear the worst. The second half produced the end result: a Little penalty, another Miedema goal and an Everton goal by [[Chloe Kelly]] ending the game in 1\u20133. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2019-Dec-15/everton-ladies-1-3-women-match-report|title=Match report: Everton 1-3 Arsenal Women|accessdate=December 19, 2019|date=December 15, 2019}}</ref> Luckily for the Gunners, Arsenal later reported that after taking x-rays of her leg, Mead's injuries weren't as bad as they seemed during the game - only sustaining brusing to her lower leg. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/beth-mead-injury-update|title=Beth Mead injury update|accessdate=December 19, 2019|date=December 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===January===\nThe new year started off with a visit by [[Birmingham City W.F.C.|Birmingham City]] to Meadow Park on 5 January. A first-half goal each from Little and Nobbs resulting in a 2\u20130 win. The Birmingham side had been a mainstay in the top four for recent seasons, but managerial changes and important players transferring out has left the club fighting to stay up thusfar this season. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2020-Jan-05/women-2-0-birmingham-city-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 2-0 Birmingham City|accessdate=February 16, 2019|date=January 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA week later (12 January), the Gunners traveled to [[Brighton & Hove Albion W.F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]].

Reiten scored a fourth in the second-half before Mead got a consolation goal. Manager Montemurro later admitted that he got the tactics wrong in attempting to press a bit higher up the pitch and stop them from playing through the middle and to create overloads in the middle of the park <ref>{{cite web|url=https://arseblog.news/2020/01/joe-montemurro-reacts-to-chelsea-defeat/|title=JOE MONTEMURRO REACTS TO CHELSEA DEFEAT|accessdate=February 13, 2020|date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>, which allowed Chelsea to easily attack from the sides. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/fixture/women/2020-Jan-19/women-1-4-chelsea-women-match-report|title=Match report: Arsenal Women 1-4 Chelsea|accessdate=February 16, 2019|date=January 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArsenal entered [[2019\u201320 Women's FA Cup|the season's FA Cup]] in the fourth round, drawing fellow WSL-side [[West Ham United F.C.

Veluthambi ([[Vimal (actor)|Vimal]]) is a graduate aspiring for a government job. His father Annamalai ([[K. Bhagyaraj|Bhagyaraj]]) advises him to work temporarily for a NGO that helps in educating rural children so that he will be given a priority for a government job. Velu, although uninterested, joins the NGO and gets appointed as a teacher in a small dry village which lacks basic facilities. The entire village works for a rich landlord named JP ([[Ponvannan]]), who owns a brick factory.

The entire village works for a rich landlord named JP ([[Ponvannan]]), who owns a brick factory.

Characteristic symptoms are pronounced [[hyperthermia]], [[tachycardia]], and [[hypertension]], along with agitation, confusion, and [[convulsion]]s. PMA overdose also tends to cause [[hypoglycaemia]] and [[hyperkalaemia]], which can help to distinguish it from MDMA overdose. Complications can sometimes include more serious symptoms such as [[rhabdomyolysis]] and [[cerebral hemorrhage]], requiring emergency surgery. There is no specific antidote, so treatment is symptomatic, and usually includes both external cooling, and internal cooling via IV infusion of cooled saline. [[Benzodiazepine]]s are used initially to control convulsions, with stronger anticonvulsants such as [[phenytoin]] or [[thiopental]] used if convulsions continue. Blood pressure can be lowered either with a combination of [[alpha blocker]]s and [[beta blocker]]s (or a mixed alpha/beta blocker), or with other drugs such as [[nifedipine]] or [[nitroprusside]]. [[Serotonin antagonist]]s and [[dantrolene]] may be used as required. Despite the seriousness of the condition, the majority of patients survive if treatment is given in time, however, patients with a core body temperature over 40&nbsp;\u00b0C at presentation tend to have a poor prognosis.<ref name=\"pmid12733852\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Caldicott DG, Edwards NA, Kruys A, Kirkbride KP, Sims DN, Byard RW, Prior M, Irvine RJ |title=Dancing with \"death\": p-methoxyamphetamine overdose and its acute management |journal=Journal of Toxicology.

Characteristic symptoms are pronounced [[hyperthermia]], [[tachycardia]], and [[hypertension]], along with agitation, confusion, and [[convulsion]]s. PMA overdose also tends to cause [[hypoglycaemia]] and [[hyperkalaemia]], which can help to distinguish it from MDMA overdose. Complications can sometimes include more serious symptoms such as [[rhabdomyolysis]] and [[cerebral hemorrhage]], requiring emergency surgery. There is no specific antidote, so treatment is symptomatic, and usually includes both external cooling, and internal cooling via IV infusion of cooled saline. [[Benzodiazepine]]s are used initially to control convulsions, with stronger anticonvulsants such as [[phenytoin]] or [[thiopental]] used if convulsions continue. Blood pressure can be lowered either with a combination of [[alpha blocker]]s and [[beta blocker]]s (or a mixed alpha/beta blocker), or with other drugs such as [[nifedipine]] or [[nitroprusside]]. [[Serotonin antagonist]]s and [[dantrolene]] may be used as required. Despite the seriousness of the condition, the majority of patients survive if treatment is given in time, however, patients with a core body temperature over 40&nbsp;\u00b0C at presentation tend to have a poor prognosis.<ref name=\"pmid12733852\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Caldicott DG, Edwards NA, Kruys A, Kirkbride KP, Sims DN, Byard RW, Prior M, Irvine RJ |title=Dancing with \"death\": p-methoxyamphetamine overdose and its acute management |journal=Journal of Toxicology.

It appears that PMA activates the [[hypothalamus]] much more strongly than MDMA and other drugs like ephedrine, thereby causing rapid increases in body temperature (which is the major cause of death in PMA mortalities).<ref>Jaehne EJ, Salem A, Irvine RJ.

It is a well-regarded and over-subscribed school, performing well both regionally and nationally. In its last [[OFSTED]] inspection (2013) it was described as \"an outstanding and inclusive school\" and found to be outstanding in all major areas assessed. The school converted to academy status on 1 February 2012.\n\n== School Organisation ==\nThe current headteacher is Jonathan Parkinson, who took over after Michael Zarraga [[OBE]] retired in 2005. Its motto is \"regis servus dei prius\" which translates as, \"I am the King's good servant, but God's first\". This is a reference to [[St Thomas More]], and his refusal to recognise [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] as the Supreme Head of the Church following the King's split from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Catholicism]]. There are strong ties to the two Catholic churches in Blaydon and [[Winlaton]], St Joseph's and St Anne's, respectively.\n\nThe school runs with a headteacher '''Mr Jonathan Parkinson''' and deputy heads, '''Mrs Jillian Turner''' and '''Mr Nicholas wood''' as well as assistant heads \n''Mrs Barbara Kamali'',\n''Mrs Catherine Lennox'', &\n''Mr David Shield'' .\n \nThe school is divided into four houses which every pupil placed into one.  Each of the houses are named after saints and are as follows:\n*[[St Bernadette]] (''Miss Kathryn McNeill'')\n*[[St Therese]] (''Mrs Deborah Ashdown'')\n*[[St John Fisher]] (''Mr Johnny Greenshields'') \n*[[Catherine Labour\u00e9|St Catherine Labour\u00e9]] (''Mrs J Cervantes'')\nNote: (''Heads of houses'')\n\nThe houses provide [[pastoral care]] for each pupil, as well as being the focus of rivalry during inter-house competitions at the start of the year. During the inter-house competitions the houses compete against one another in activities such as [[soccer|football]], [[basketball]], [[chess]] and [[scrabble]]. During the final week of the Autumn Term, a quiz is held, with students representing their houses. Around 230 pupils enter the school every year, and are placed into eight classes, two in each house. Members of staff assist across the years with pastoral duties, such as attendance, behavior, and grades.\n\nCatering at St Thomas More Catholic School is provided by an in-house company, Bistro@STM. There is a dining hall and separate booth on the yard serving snacks and light meals to the lower school, whilst the [[sixth form]] has a bistro bar.\n\nThe school draws upon pupils from Year 13 to act as headboy and headgirl, with deputy positions. They plan and organise the [[prom]] at the end of each year, often at [[Beamish Hall]]. There are also House captains, usually one boy and one girl per house, also from Year 13.\n\nThe majority of pupils eventually proceed to sixth form, run by Mr J Davis and Miss P Sanderson and then [[higher education]], with a small minority of sixth form leavers achieving places at [[Oxbridge]] most years.\n\n== Development ==\nIn October 2011, a new building phase was begun, to house new class rooms which replaced a temporary block. The new building was attached to the main part of the school from the ICT department to the English department, housing science labs and humanities classrooms. The building was completed for the beginning of the 2013/2014 academic year.\n\nDuring 2015 the school began an extensive construction project that included building a third floor on top of existing maths classrooms and science labs, as well as refurbishing both the interior and exterior of the maths classrooms and science labs and the interior of the textiles technology classrooms. The new floor meant that a larger maths classroom could be built, along with extensive facilities for learning support and psychology as well as a new general classroom and a designated training room. Also a new area was constructed as an addition to the playground that consisted of tables and benches for students to use, replacing area left by the temporary structure.\n\nThe school became an academy in August 2012, joining Thorp Academy to become two of the north east's leading schools. A multi-academy trust (The St Thomas More Partnership of Schools) was founded in 2014 with local [[primary schools]], Sacred Heart in [[Byermoor]], and St Matthew's in [[Prudhoe]].\n\n== Extracurricular ==\nThere are active Music and Drama departments, who run several groups and performances throughout the year. There are three main concerts each year, as well as a musical during the Spring term.

It is a well-regarded and over-subscribed school, performing well both regionally and nationally. In its last [[OFSTED]] inspection (2013) it was described as \"an outstanding and inclusive school\" and found to be outstanding in all major areas assessed. The school converted to academy status on 1 February 2012.\n\n== School Organisation ==\nThe current headteacher is Jonathan Parkinson, who took over after Michael Zarraga [[OBE]] retired in 2005. Its motto is \"regis servus dei prius\" which translates as, \"I am the King's good servant, but God's first\". This is a reference to [[St Thomas More]], and his refusal to recognise [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] as the Supreme Head of the Church following the King's split from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Catholicism]]. There are strong ties to the two Catholic churches in Blaydon and [[Winlaton]], St Joseph's and St Anne's, respectively.\n\nThe school runs with a headteacher '''Mr Jonathan Parkinson''' and deputy heads, '''Mrs Jillian Turner''' and '''Mr Nicholas wood''' as well as assistant heads \n''Mrs Barbara Kamali'',\n''Mrs Catherine Lennox'', &\n''Mr David Shield'' .\n \nThe school is divided into four houses which every pupil placed into one.  Each of the houses are named after saints and are as follows:\n*[[St Bernadette]] (''Miss Kathryn McNeill'')\n*[[St Therese]] (''Mrs Deborah Ashdown'')\n*[[St John Fisher]] (''Mr Johnny Greenshields'') \n*[[Catherine Labour\u00e9|St Catherine Labour\u00e9]] (''Mrs J Cervantes'')\nNote: (''Heads of houses'')\n\nThe houses provide [[pastoral care]] for each pupil, as well as being the focus of rivalry during inter-house competitions at the start of the year. During the inter-house competitions the houses compete against one another in activities such as [[soccer|football]], [[basketball]], [[chess]] and [[scrabble]]. During the final week of the Autumn Term, a quiz is held, with students representing their houses. Around 230 pupils enter the school every year, and are placed into eight classes, two in each house. Members of staff assist across the years with pastoral duties, such as attendance, behavior, and grades.\n\nCatering at St Thomas More Catholic School is provided by an in-house company, Bistro@STM. There is a dining hall and separate booth on the yard serving snacks and light meals to the lower school, whilst the [[sixth form]] has a bistro bar.\n\nThe school draws upon pupils from Year 13 to act as headboy and headgirl, with deputy positions. They plan and organise the [[prom]] at the end of each year, often at [[Beamish Hall]]. There are also House captains, usually one boy and one girl per house, also from Year 13.\n\nThe majority of pupils eventually proceed to sixth form, run by Mr J Davis and Miss P Sanderson and then [[higher education]], with a small minority of sixth form leavers achieving places at [[Oxbridge]] most years.\n\n== Development ==\nIn October 2011, a new building phase was begun, to house new class rooms which replaced a temporary block. The new building was attached to the main part of the school from the ICT department to the English department, housing science labs and humanities classrooms. The building was completed for the beginning of the 2013/2014 academic year.\n\nDuring 2015 the school began an extensive construction project that included building a third floor on top of existing maths classrooms and science labs, as well as refurbishing both the interior and exterior of the maths classrooms and science labs and the interior of the textiles technology classrooms. The new floor meant that a larger maths classroom could be built, along with extensive facilities for learning support and psychology as well as a new general classroom and a designated training room. Also a new area was constructed as an addition to the playground that consisted of tables and benches for students to use, replacing area left by the temporary structure.\n\nThe school became an academy in August 2012, joining Thorp Academy to become two of the north east's leading schools. A multi-academy trust (The St Thomas More Partnership of Schools) was founded in 2014 with local [[primary schools]], Sacred Heart in [[Byermoor]], and St Matthew's in [[Prudhoe]].\n\n== Extracurricular ==\nThere are active Music and Drama departments, who run several groups and performances throughout the year. There are three main concerts each year, as well as a musical during the Spring term. Notably, the Chamber Choir performed at the [[Albert Hall]] in 2013.<ref>[http://www.classicfm.com/events/schools-prom/wednesday-13-november-2013/st-thomas-more-school-chamber-choir/ St Thomas More Chamber Choir] Retrieved 22 January 2017</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzhAoWgybBw Interview with St Thomas More Chamber Choir] Retrieved 22 January 2017</ref> Pupils are awarded for their commitment after participating for three years in clubs, sports and the performing arts alike, through Colours Awards.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
