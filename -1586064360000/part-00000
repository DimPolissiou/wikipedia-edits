Serving as the [[capital city|administrative center]] of [[Dubno Raion]] ([[raion|district]]), Dubno is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and does not belong to the raion. The city is located on intersection of two major European routes E40 and E85. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2017|38,039}} It is located within the historic region of [[Volhynia]].\n\nIn Soviet times it was home to the [[Cold War]] facility [[Dubno (air base)|Dubno air base]]. The city is also famous for its [[Dubno Castle|fortress]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Ostrogski coat of arms}}\n===Middle Ages===\nFirst mentioned in a chronicle of 1100, when it was in possession of [[Yaroslav the Wise]]'s grandson David of Brest {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, Dubno was even a seat of local princes for a short period of time. <!-- Dubno Principality? Still dubious. --> In 1240 the town was raided by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. In the early 14th century the region was the subject of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025-1385)|Polish]]-[[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] rivalry, as a result of which Dubno became part of the latter. However, soon after with the [[Union of Krewo]] (1385), it came under Polish influence as part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Union]]. In 1386 King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] granted Dubno along with nearby [[Ostroh|Ostr\u00f3g]] to magnate [[Feodor Ostrogski]] and since then as a [[private town]] it has belonged for over 200 years to the influential [[Ostrogski family]].<ref name=GG>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetagazeta.com/artman/publish/printer_16663.shtml|title=Kresy \u2013 przywracanie pami\u0119ci. Dubno.|website=Gazeta Gazeta|author=Alf Sobczy\u0144ski|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> Later, it became a notable stronghold in [[Volhynia]]. <!-- the legal standing of the duchy of Ostrog needs to be clarified: was it ever a part of Poland? --> Granted [[city rights]] in 1498 by [[Alexander Jagiellon]], the town attracted many foreign settlers, most notably [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]]. As such, it became the seat of one of the oldest and most vibrant Jewish communes in Central-Eastern Europe. Since 14th century owned by the mighty [[Ostrogski]] family, who built the [[Dubno Castle]] during the times of [[Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski]].\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[File:Castle in Dubno Ukraine.jpg|thumb|left|A tower of the [[Dubno Castle]]]]\nBetween 1489 and 1506 the castle was significantly expanded by [[Konstanty Ostrogski]], who made it a modern fortress, one of the strongest in the area. After 1566 Dubno was part of the [[Volhynian Voivodeship (1569\u20131795)|Volhynian Voivodeship]] of the [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown|Lesser Poland Province]] of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]]. During the [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)|Polish-Russian War of 1605\u20131618]] in 1617, Prince and future King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]] resided in the city.<ref name=GG/>\n\nWith the death of [[Janusz Ostrogski]] in 1619, the last of his kin, the area was inherited by his brother-in-law [[Aleksander Zas\u0142awski]] of the cadet branch of the Ostrogski family. About that time it was again modernized to stand up to the standards of [[renaissance]] warfare and modernization of [[artillery]]. Finally, in 1673 it passed to the [[Lubomirski family]], which built a new palace within the fortress walls.<ref name=GG/>\n\nIn the 1780s the castle underwent yet another modernization and was rebuilt as a residential manor, mostly losing its fortified character. In 1781 King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] visited Dubno.<ref name=GG/> By that time, the town was the largest settlement of the [[Wo\u0142y\u0144 Voivodeship (1569\u20131795)|Volhynian Voivodeship]] and arguably the most notable centre of the area. In spite of the [[Partitions of Poland]] the town initially flourished after the [[First Partition of Poland|first partition]], as the [[szlachta]] register was moved there from [[Lw\u00f3w]], which was annexed by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]. Dubno itself was annexed by [[Imperial Russia]] in 1795 during the [[Third Partition of Poland]], after which the nobility's register was moved to [[Kiev]] and the town lost its importance, gradually falling into neglect.\n\n===Late modern period===\n[[File:\u0414\u0443\u0431\u043d\u043e. \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430..jpg|thumb|220px|left|Old centre of Dubno]]\nAs part of anti-Polish repressions, the Russian administration closed down the Bernardine and Carmelite monasteries and confiscated them from the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=GG/> In 1870 Dubno was declared a ''Fortified Town'', which imposed serious limitations on settlement and housing construction, further limiting the development. However, it remained a notable centre of commerce, most notably because of numerous [[Czech people|Czech]] settlements around the town, that gave it the nickname of ''the brewery of [[Volhynia]]''. The castle was ruined in 1915 during the [[World War I]].\n[[File:POL Dubno COA.svg|thumb|140px|Historic Polish coat of arms of Dubno]]\nRetaken by Poland after the state's independence in 1918 and finally granted to Poland in the [[Peace of Riga]], it was a seat of a [[powiat]] and a notable military garrison of both the [[Border Defence Corps|KOP]], and the [[Polish Army]], with the 43rd Rifle Regiment (part of the [[13th Infantry Division (Poland)|13th Kresy Infantry Division]]), and the 2nd Regiment of Mounted Artillery (part of [[Volhynian Cavalry Brigade]]) stationed here. Dubno also was the seat of Papal Eastern Seminary (''Papieskie Seminarium Wschodnie''). In 1935 a large prison was started to be built, the third biggest in Poland at that time. Between 1932 and 1939 the castle was being rebuilt in its original form, but the works were stopped by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. In 1937, its population was app. 15,500, out of which Jews made 45%, Ukrainians 29%, and Poles 26%.\n\n===World War II and post-war===\nOccupied by the [[Soviet Union]] following the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939, it was subject to harsh policies of the [[NKVD]]. The uncompleted prison was taken over by the NKVD in December 1939 and was used for political prisoners from all parts of Soviet-occupied Poland. Between 1500 and 3000 prisoners were kept there in harsh conditions, with new inmates arriving after the previous ones were successively transported to [[Gulag]] and other Soviet prisons. In 1940 most of the local Poles were arrested and resettled to various Soviet Gulags and prisons throughout the USSR. In 1941, following the outbreak of [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet-German War]], on June 24 and June 25, 1941, approximately 550 prisoners of the Dubno prison were executed by the withdrawing NKVD while only 8 of them survived. About that time in the vicinity of the town (and around [[Lutsk]] and [[Brody]]) a large tank battle was fought. In the [[Battle of Brody (1941)]] the German 1st Panzer Group under [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]] managed to break the counter-attack by Soviet 9th and 19th Mechanized Corps, and 8th Mechanized Corps. 8th Corps Tank Group took Dubno and held it for 5 days before it was retaken by stronger German forces' (under [[Konstantin Rokossovski]], [[Nikolay Feklenko]] and [[D.I Rybjasev]], Commander of 8th Corps Tank group was brigade commisar N.K. Popel, respectively). Soon afterwards the town was occupied by Germany. During the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation]], the Germans blew up the historic town hall from the 18th century.<ref name=GG/>\n\nIn the second half of 1943, Dubno became a shelter for ethnic Polish population of Volhynia, who came here to escape the [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|Volhynian Genocide]]. The town was defended by a unit of Polish self-defence, which was tolerated by German authorities. On February 28, 1944, the Germans evacuated Poles from Dubno to [[Brody]], and then to the Reich, where they became [[OST-Arbeiter|slave workers]]. In 1944 Dubno found itself again under [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Soviet occupation]] and after the war it was taken from Poland and annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] in accordance to the [[Potsdam Conference]].\n\nIn 1959 the Roman Catholic Church of Saint John Nepomuk was closed down by the Soviets.<ref name=GG/> It was reopened in 1993, thanks to the efforts of the local Polish community.<ref name=GG/>\n\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Dubno became part of Ukraine.\n\n=== Jewish history ===\n[[File:\u0414\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0430.jpg|thumb|Great Synagogue in Dubno]]\nAccording to the census of 1897, Dubno had a population of 13,785, including 5,608 Jews. The main sources of income for the Jewish community were trading and industrial occupations. There were 902 artisans, 147 day-laborers, 27 factory and workshop employees, and 6 families cultivating land. The town had a Jewish hospital and several chederim (Jewish schools). The earliest date given in connection with the Jews of Dubno is the beginning of the 17th century. In 1650, there were 47 Jewish and 141 Christian taxable households.\n\nDubno is perhaps best known within the Jewish world as the long-time home of [[Yosef Yaakov (Yoska) Sabatka]], the Rabbi Yosef, Rabbi of Dubno and [[Jacob ben Wolf Kranz]], known as the Dubno (or Dubner) [[Maggid]].\n\nThe Nazi occupation of Dubno began on June 25, 1941. During Passover of 1942, a large ghetto was created in the city. The ghetto included the local Jewish population as well as many refugees from other parts of [[Poland]] who had fled east. Within the Dubno ghetto, all Jews were identified by the Star of David on an armband. With 12,000 people in a small area, the ghetto became overcrowded and hunger/sickness were abundant. After October 24, 1942, the Jewish community ceased to exist.<ref name=\"Holocaust1\">{{cite web|url=http://chelm.freeyellow.com/dubnomemorial.html|title=Remember Jewish Dubno|date=2018-07-21|language=English}}</ref> \n\nMost of the local Jews (roughly 12,000, that is 59% of pre-war inhabitants of the town) were killed in [[The Holocaust]].

Serving as the [[capital city|administrative center]] of [[Dubno Raion]] ([[raion|district]]), Dubno is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and does not belong to the raion. The city is located on intersection of two major European routes E40 and E85. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2017|38,039}} It is located within the historic region of [[Volhynia]].\n\nIn Soviet times it was home to the [[Cold War]] facility [[Dubno (air base)|Dubno air base]]. The city is also famous for its [[Dubno Castle|fortress]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Ostrogski coat of arms}}\n===Middle Ages===\nFirst mentioned in a chronicle of 1100, when it was in possession of [[Yaroslav the Wise]]'s grandson David of Brest {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, Dubno was even a seat of local princes for a short period of time. <!-- Dubno Principality? Still dubious. --> In 1240 the town was raided by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. In the early 14th century the region was the subject of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025-1385)|Polish]]-[[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] rivalry, as a result of which Dubno became part of the latter. However, soon after with the [[Union of Krewo]] (1385), it came under Polish influence as part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Union]]. In 1386 King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] granted Dubno along with nearby [[Ostroh|Ostr\u00f3g]] to magnate [[Feodor Ostrogski]] and since then as a [[private town]] it has belonged for over 200 years to the influential [[Ostrogski family]].<ref name=GG>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetagazeta.com/artman/publish/printer_16663.shtml|title=Kresy \u2013 przywracanie pami\u0119ci. Dubno.|website=Gazeta Gazeta|author=Alf Sobczy\u0144ski|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> Later, it became a notable stronghold in [[Volhynia]]. <!-- the legal standing of the duchy of Ostrog needs to be clarified: was it ever a part of Poland? --> Granted [[city rights]] in 1498 by [[Alexander Jagiellon]], the town attracted many foreign settlers, most notably [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]]. As such, it became the seat of one of the oldest and most vibrant Jewish communes in Central-Eastern Europe. Since 14th century owned by the mighty [[Ostrogski]] family, who built the [[Dubno Castle]] during the times of [[Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski]].\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[File:Castle in Dubno Ukraine.jpg|thumb|left|A tower of the [[Dubno Castle]]]]\nBetween 1489 and 1506 the castle was significantly expanded by [[Konstanty Ostrogski]], who made it a modern fortress, one of the strongest in the area. After 1566 Dubno was part of the [[Volhynian Voivodeship (1569\u20131795)|Volhynian Voivodeship]] of the [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown|Lesser Poland Province]] of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]]. During the [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)|Polish-Russian War of 1605\u20131618]] in 1617, Prince and future King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]] resided in the city.<ref name=GG/>\n\nWith the death of [[Janusz Ostrogski]] in 1619, the last of his kin, the area was inherited by his brother-in-law [[Aleksander Zas\u0142awski]] of the cadet branch of the Ostrogski family. About that time it was again modernized to stand up to the standards of [[renaissance]] warfare and modernization of [[artillery]]. Finally, in 1673 it passed to the [[Lubomirski family]], which built a new palace within the fortress walls.<ref name=GG/>\n\nIn the 1780s the castle underwent yet another modernization and was rebuilt as a residential manor, mostly losing its fortified character. In 1781 King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] visited Dubno.<ref name=GG/> By that time, the town was the largest settlement of the [[Wo\u0142y\u0144 Voivodeship (1569\u20131795)|Volhynian Voivodeship]] and arguably the most notable centre of the area. In spite of the [[Partitions of Poland]] the town initially flourished after the [[First Partition of Poland|first partition]], as the [[szlachta]] register was moved there from [[Lw\u00f3w]], which was annexed by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]. Dubno itself was annexed by [[Imperial Russia]] in 1795 during the [[Third Partition of Poland]], after which the nobility's register was moved to [[Kiev]] and the town lost its importance, gradually falling into neglect.\n\n===Late modern period===\n[[File:\u0414\u0443\u0431\u043d\u043e. \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430..jpg|thumb|220px|left|Old centre of Dubno]]\nAs part of anti-Polish repressions, the Russian administration closed down the Bernardine and Carmelite monasteries and confiscated them from the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=GG/> In 1870 Dubno was declared a ''Fortified Town'', which imposed serious limitations on settlement and housing construction, further limiting the development. However, it remained a notable centre of commerce, most notably because of numerous [[Czech people|Czech]] settlements around the town, that gave it the nickname of ''the brewery of [[Volhynia]]''. The castle was ruined in 1915 during the [[World War I]].\n[[File:POL Dubno COA.svg|thumb|140px|Historic Polish coat of arms of Dubno]]\nRetaken by Poland after the state's independence in 1918 and finally granted to Poland in the [[Peace of Riga]], it was a seat of a [[powiat]] and a notable military garrison of both the [[Border Defence Corps|KOP]], and the [[Polish Army]], with the 43rd Rifle Regiment (part of the [[13th Infantry Division (Poland)|13th Kresy Infantry Division]]), and the 2nd Regiment of Mounted Artillery (part of [[Volhynian Cavalry Brigade]]) stationed here. Dubno also was the seat of Papal Eastern Seminary (''Papieskie Seminarium Wschodnie''). In 1935 a large prison was started to be built, the third biggest in Poland at that time. Between 1932 and 1939 the castle was being rebuilt in its original form, but the works were stopped by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. In 1937, its population was app. 15,500, out of which Jews made 45%, Ukrainians 29%, and Poles 26%.\n\n===World War II and post-war===\nOccupied by the [[Soviet Union]] following the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939, it was subject to harsh policies of the [[NKVD]]. The uncompleted prison was taken over by the NKVD in December 1939 and was used for political prisoners from all parts of Soviet-occupied Poland. Between 1500 and 3000 prisoners were kept there in harsh conditions, with new inmates arriving after the previous ones were successively transported to [[Gulag]] and other Soviet prisons. In 1940 most of the local Poles were arrested and resettled to various Soviet Gulags and prisons throughout the USSR. In 1941, following the outbreak of [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet-German War]], on June 24 and June 25, 1941, approximately 550 prisoners of the Dubno prison were executed by the withdrawing NKVD while only 8 of them survived. About that time in the vicinity of the town (and around [[Lutsk]] and [[Brody]]) a large tank battle was fought. In the [[Battle of Brody (1941)]] the German 1st Panzer Group under [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]] managed to break the counter-attack by Soviet 9th and 19th Mechanized Corps, and 8th Mechanized Corps. 8th Corps Tank Group took Dubno and held it for 5 days before it was retaken by stronger German forces' (under [[Konstantin Rokossovski]], [[Nikolay Feklenko]] and [[D.I Rybjasev]], Commander of 8th Corps Tank group was brigade commisar N.K. Popel, respectively). Soon afterwards the town was occupied by Germany. During the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation]], the Germans blew up the historic town hall from the 18th century.<ref name=GG/>\n\nIn the second half of 1943, Dubno became a shelter for ethnic Polish population of Volhynia, who came here to escape the [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|Volhynian Genocide]]. The town was defended by a unit of Polish self-defence, which was tolerated by German authorities. On February 28, 1944, the Germans evacuated Poles from Dubno to [[Brody]], and then to the Reich, where they became [[OST-Arbeiter|slave workers]]. In 1944 Dubno found itself again under [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Soviet occupation]] and after the war it was taken from Poland and annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] in accordance to the [[Potsdam Conference]].\n\nIn 1959 the Roman Catholic Church of Saint John Nepomuk was closed down by the Soviets.<ref name=GG/> It was reopened in 1993, thanks to the efforts of the local Polish community.<ref name=GG/>\n\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Dubno became part of Ukraine.\n\n=== Jewish history ===\n[[File:\u0414\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0430.jpg|thumb|Great Synagogue in Dubno]]\nAccording to the census of 1897, Dubno had a population of 13,785, including 5,608 Jews. The main sources of income for the Jewish community were trading and industrial occupations. There were 902 artisans, 147 day-laborers, 27 factory and workshop employees, and 6 families cultivating land. The town had a Jewish hospital and several chederim (Jewish schools). The earliest date given in connection with the Jews of Dubno is the beginning of the 17th century. In 1650, there were 47 Jewish and 141 Christian taxable households.\n\nDubno is perhaps best known within the Jewish world as the long-time home of [[Yosef Yaakov (Yoska) Sabatka]], the Rabbi Yosef, Rabbi of Dubno and [[Jacob ben Wolf Kranz]], known as the Dubno (or Dubner) [[Maggid]].\n\nThe Nazi occupation of Dubno began on June 25, 1941. During Passover of 1942, a large ghetto was created in the city. The ghetto included the local Jewish population as well as many refugees from other parts of [[Poland]] who had fled east. Within the Dubno ghetto, all Jews were identified by the Star of David on an armband. With 12,000 people in a small area, the ghetto became overcrowded and hunger/sickness were abundant. After October 24, 1942, the Jewish community ceased to exist<ref name=\"Holocaust1\">{{cite web|url=http://chelm.freeyellow.com/dubnomemorial.html|title=Remember Jewish Dubno|date=2018-07-21|language=English}}</ref>. \n\nMost of the local Jews (roughly 12,000, that is 59% of pre-war inhabitants of the town) were killed in [[The Holocaust]].

Drinking in bars, restaurants, stadiums, and other such establishments, for example, is not generally considered to be \"in public\" even though those establishments are open to the general public.

There may also be local by-laws which further regulate the issue within a state. Drinking in public is illegal in most jurisdictions in the United States, with this ban usually extending to include drinking within a moving car (related to [[drunk driving]] laws).\n\nLaws against drinking in public are known as open container laws, as the presence of an open container of alcohol is seen as evidence of drinking in public and is far easier to witness and prove than the act of drinking.\n\nIn some places and circumstances,  public alcohol consumption is accepted. This includes such cities as New Orleans, Las Vegas, Indianapolis, the State of [[Wisconsin]], certain college campuses, and around sporting events \u2013 notably at a [[tailgate party]]. Open containers of alcohol are often concealed in public, traditionally inside a brown paper bag, though this does not make them legal in jurisdictions where they are outlawed.

Drinking in public is illegal in most jurisdictions in the United States, with this ban usually extending to include drinking within a moving car (related to [[drunk driving]] laws).\n\nLaws against drinking in public are known as open container laws, as the presence of an open container of alcohol is seen as evidence of drinking in public and is far easier to witness and prove than the act of drinking.\n\nIn some places and circumstances,  public alcohol consumption is accepted. This includes such cities as New Orleans, Las Vegas, Indianapolis, the State of [[Wisconsin]], certain college campuses, and around sporting events \u2013 notably at a [[tailgate party]]. Open containers of alcohol are often concealed in public, traditionally inside a brown paper bag, though this does not make them legal in jurisdictions where they are outlawed. If a law enforcement officer can detect that alcohol is being consumed, the violator may be cited or arrested.<ref name=\"Open Container NYS\">{{cite web|last=Sachs|first=Eric|title=New York Open Container Laws|url=http://www.esachslaw.com/new-york-open-container-laws|publisher=Eric Sachs New York DWI Lawyer|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alcohol-free zone]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Alcohol and health}}\n\n[[Category:Drinking culture]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_in_public"}

Frusciante refused, feeling that the creative freedom he needed for his solo projects would have conflicted with his role in the band.<ref name=radio/>\n\n===Technique===\nFrusciante's guitar playing employs emphasis on appropriate melody, tone, and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this.<ref name=Kerrangspain>''Kerrang!'' Issue #21; pp. 76\u201382</ref> He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked.<ref name=\"tgm2002\"/> Therefore, he accentuates the melodically driven technique of players such as [[Matthew Ashman]] of [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Bernard Sumner]] of [[Joy Division]] as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored.<ref name=\"tgm2002\"/> Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Steve Vai]], but represses an urge to emulate their style: \"People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s.\"<ref name=Kerrangspain/> Believing that focusing only on \"clean tones\" is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a \"grimy\" sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to \"mistreat\" his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> He also tries to break as many \"stylistic boundaries\" as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal, and that many of his contemporaries \"follow the rules with no risk\".<ref name=Kerrangspain/>\n\nFrusciante has stated that he became serious about creating and engineering his own electronic music in 2007. As he progressed in enhancing his skills with electronic instruments and techniques, he has stated that he felt comfortable with how [[R&B]] and [[Hip hop music]] integrated into his work. He has noted that these and other new techniques were all influences on his EP, ''Letur-Lefr''.<ref name=RecentHistory/> ''PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone'' was recorded while Frusciante looked to find new ways to play the guitar with the new forms of music and production that he had been studying. In his blog post, \"My Recent History,\" he notes that \"Aspects of PBX are the realization of combinations of styles of music I saw in my head many years ago, as potentials, but which I had no idea how to execute.\"<ref name=RecentHistory/>\n\nFrusciante's approach to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that \"even on [''To Record Only Water for Ten Days''] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars.\"<ref name=guitarplayer2006/> However, on later albums such as ''Shadows Collide With People'', he pursued the opposite: \"I just wanted everything to be perfect\u2014I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that.\"<ref name=guitarplayer2006>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|author=Cleveland, Barry|title=''Exclusive Outtakes from GP's Interview with John Frusciante!''|date=November 2006|accessdate=August 27, 2007|magazine=Guitar Player|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320091008/https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|archivedate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: \"If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it.\"<ref name=selvaggio/> Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar.<ref name=Acoustic>Di Perna, Alan.

''Electronic Musician''.</ref> This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency.<ref name=law1/> Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks \"music comes alive when [you] are creating it fast\". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism.<ref name=electronic/> With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted that there has been a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new \"Progressive Synth Pop\" that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole.<ref name=RecentHistory/> He currently uses the [[music tracker]] [[Renoise]] as his main [[Digital audio workstation]] along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his [[Doepfer]], Arp, and other modular synthesizers.<ref name=guitarplayer2014-04>{{cite magazine|url=http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-guitar-player|title=''John Frusciante reprograms himself, his music and Black Knights''|date=April 2014|accessdate=April 4, 2014|magazine=Guitar Player|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410031244/http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-04-guitar-player|archive-date=April 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nFrusciante's first major influence was [[Jimi Hendrix]].

He has recorded five studio albums with them.\n\nFrusciante has an active solo career, having released twelve solo albums and seven EPs; his recordings include elements ranging from [[experimental rock]] and [[ambient music]] to [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[electronica]]. Frusciante also released two [[acid house]] albums and one [[Extended play|EP]] under his alias '''Trickfinger'''. He has also recorded with numerous other artists, including [[the Mars Volta]], for whom he was a studio guitarist (and occasional live performer) from 2002 until 2008; [[Josh Klinghoffer]] and [[Joe Lally]], with whom he released two albums as [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]]; and various collaborations with both Klinghoffer and [[Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez]].

The group's follow-up album, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' (1991), was a breakthrough success. Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered a long period of drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: ''[[Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt]]'' (1994) and ''[[Smile from the Streets You Hold]]'' (1997). In 1998, he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

He thoroughly enjoyed his role in the Chili Peppers as backing vocalist, and said that backing vocals are a \"real art form\".<ref name=radio>{{cite web|url=http://www.locborg.de/fru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=806&Itemid=124 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212095842/http://www.locborg.de/fru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=806&Itemid=124 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 12, 2008 |title=Radio interview |date=April 3, 2004 |accessdate=September 2, 2007 }}</ref> Despite his commitment to the Chili Peppers, he felt that his work with the band should remain separate from his solo projects. When he returned to the Chili Peppers in 1998, Kiedis wanted the band to record \"Living in Hell\", a song Frusciante had written several years before. Frusciante refused, feeling that the creative freedom he needed for his solo projects would have conflicted with his role in the band.<ref name=radio/>\n\n===Technique===\nFrusciante's guitar playing employs emphasis on appropriate melody, tone, and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this.<ref name=Kerrangspain>''Kerrang!'' Issue #21; pp. 76\u201382</ref> He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked.<ref name=\"tgm2002\"/> Therefore, he accentuates the melodically driven technique of players such as [[Matthew Ashman]] of [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Bernard Sumner]] of [[Joy Division]] as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored.<ref name=\"tgm2002\"/> Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Steve Vai]], but represses an urge to emulate their style: \"People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s.\"<ref name=Kerrangspain/> Believing that focusing only on \"clean tones\" is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a \"grimy\" sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to \"mistreat\" his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> He also tries to break as many \"stylistic boundaries\" as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal, and that many of his contemporaries \"follow the rules with no risk\".<ref name=Kerrangspain/>\n\nFrusciante has stated that he became serious about creating and engineering his own electronic music in 2007. As he progressed in enhancing his skills with electronic instruments and techniques, he has stated that he felt comfortable with how [[R&B]] and [[Hip hop music]] integrated into his work. He has noted that these and other new techniques were all influences on his EP, ''Letur-Lefr''.<ref name=RecentHistory/> ''PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone'' was recorded while Frusciante looked to find new ways to play the guitar with the new forms of music and production that he had been studying. In his blog post, \"My Recent History,\" he notes that \"Aspects of PBX are the realization of combinations of styles of music I saw in my head many years ago, as potentials, but which I had no idea how to execute.\"<ref name=RecentHistory/>\n\nFrusciante's approach to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that \"even on [''To Record Only Water for Ten Days''] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars.\"<ref name=guitarplayer2006/> However, on later albums such as ''Shadows Collide With People'', he pursued the opposite: \"I just wanted everything to be perfect\u2014I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that.\"<ref name=guitarplayer2006>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|author=Cleveland, Barry|title=''Exclusive Outtakes from GP's Interview with John Frusciante!''|date=November 2006|accessdate=August 27, 2007|magazine=Guitar Player|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320091008/https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|archivedate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: \"If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it.\"<ref name=selvaggio/> Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar.<ref name=Acoustic>Di Perna, Alan. (April 2005). \"Basic Instinct\". ''Guitar World Acoustic''.</ref><ref>\"Me and My Friends\". ''Austin Chronicle''.</ref> He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment.<ref name=electronic>Tingen, Paul. (July 2004). \"John Frusciante's Creative Explosion\". ''Electronic Musician''.</ref> This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency.<ref name=law1/> Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks \"music comes alive when [you] are creating it fast\". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism.<ref name=electronic/> With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted that there has been a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new \"Progressive Synth Pop\" that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole.<ref name=RecentHistory/> He currently uses the [[music tracker]] [[Renoise]] as his main [[Digital audio workstation]] along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his [[Doepfer]], Arp, and other modular synthesizers.<ref name=guitarplayer2014-04>{{cite magazine|url=http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-guitar-player|title=''John Frusciante reprograms himself, his music and Black Knights''|date=April 2014|accessdate=April 4, 2014|magazine=Guitar Player|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410031244/http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-04-guitar-player|archive-date=April 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nFrusciante's first major influence was [[Jimi Hendrix]].

Garber began his career at NFL Properties in 1984 as a marketing manager and became the League's director of marketing in 1988. In 1992, he was appointed the NFL's senior vice president of business development and was responsible for a variety of television, special event and marketing activities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/The-Soccer-Don_8749|title=The Soccer Don {{!}} News & Features|last=Inc.|first=M.

One of his first moves as commissioner was to bring the league more in line with the international standard, eliminating the shootout and having the referee keep the time on the field.<ref name=\"test0\">[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-11-20/sports/9911200162_1_mls-cup-mls-commissioner-don-garber-fans], additional text.</ref> In 2004, MLS also eliminated overtime and the three-plus-one substitution rule used since the league's inception. This enabled teams to substitute three field players as well as an additional goalkeeper. \"This decision reflects our focus on continuing our alignment with the world's game,\" said Garber at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccertimes.com/mls/2004/mar24.htm|title=MLS: End of overtime leads several rule changes for 2004.|website=www.soccertimes.com|access-date=2017-09-13}}</ref>\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2018}}\n===MLS growth===\nGarber has emphasized gradual, sustained growth of the league over decades rather than attempting grandiose moves to win headlines. Before Garber came into the Commissioner's office, the league had only one team in its own stadium, [[Columbus Crew SC]], whose [[Mapfre Stadium]] was built by [[Lamar Hunt]] in 1999.\n\n[[File:Don Garber, MLS Commissioner, speaks to fans 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Garber speaking to fans prior to the opening match of the [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007 MLS season]]]]\n\nOn December 7, 2001, Garber met with club owners at the Colorado ranch of Philip Anschutz in order to establish a plan to ensure the league's survival. Among the concepts agreed upon was building soccer-specific stadiums; establishing what would be known as Soccer United Marketing \u2013 an agency designed to manage soccer content in the U.S.; and pursuing (and ultimately winning) broadcast rights to the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. The entire summit led by Garber at the Anshutz ranch is regarded as a critical moment in the eventual rise of MLS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.socceramerica.com/article/11865/mls-showdown-at-the-aeg-corral.html|title=SoccerAmerica \u2013 MLS: Showdown at the AEG corral 12/07/2001|website=www.socceramerica.com|access-date=September 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Soccer-specific stadiums ===\nFollowing Columbus Crew SC's lead, and after the summit at Anshutz's ranch, MLS clubs soon began building soccer-specific stadiums. The new venues enhanced the game-day experience for fans and granted teams full operating control of the stadiums and greater shares of stadium revenue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2013/11/20/major-league-soccers-most-valuable-teams/#7a7a4d6b19a6|title=Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Teams|last=Smith|first=Chris|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the \"cathedral of American Soccer,\" the Home Depot Center (now known as [[Dignity Health Sports Park]]), was built to house the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], and both senior national teams. Four more soccer-specific stadiums were built by the start of the 2007 MLS season. In 2019, MLS has 20 stadiums built or transformed for soccer. Within the next few years, a minimum of seven more stadiums built for MLS clubs will debut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/04/15/soccer-stadium-boom-13-new-mls-stadiums-decade-alone|title=2018 MLS Stadiums: Everything you need to know about every league venue|archive-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Soccer United Marketing ===\nSoccer United Marketing (SUM), one of the game-changing ideas to come out of Garber's meeting with club owners at the Anshutz ranch, was established in 2002 and manages all sponsorship, licensing and advertising sales for MLS and other premier soccer properties in North America, including US Soccer and the Mexican National Team.\n\nSUM's first deal was the purchase of the English-language rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cups for $40 million and to have the games broadcast on ESPN, splitting advertising revenue with the network. A decade later, FOX Network paid more than ten times that amount for the same rights.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/sports/soccer/fox-and-telemundo-win-us-rights-to-2018-and-2022-world-cups.html|title=Fox and Telemundo Win U.S. Rights to 2018 and 2022 World Cups|last=Longman|first=Jer\u00e9|date=2011-10-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nSUM continues to increase its partnerships.

The league's plan is to expand to 30 clubs in the coming years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/04/18/mls-announces-plans-expand-30-teams|title=MLS announces plans to expand to 30 teams|date=April 18, 2019}}</ref> The cost of expansion clubs has risen steeply during this period. Toronto FC paid an expansion price of $10 million in 2006. The cost for teams to join MLS in its next wave of expansion is a reported $200 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sacbee.com/sports/mls/article93124167.html|title=MLS says expansion fee could hit $200 million|last=Kasler|first=Dale|work=The Sacramento Bee|access-date=2019-06-18|language=en-US|issn=0890-5738}}</ref>\n\nOn April 18, 2019, Garber confirmed the league announced it would expand to 30 teams. Ownership groups from Sacramento and St. Louis were given exclusive rights to negotiate for spots 28 and 29 at an expansion fee of $200 million each, while the league's Board of Governors deferred a decision on a fee and timetable for the 30th team.\n\n=== Club valuation ===\nAs the league expanded and established a footprint across North America with successful clubs in Seattle, Portland, Toronto, New York and Atlanta, among many others, team valuations have soared.\n\nWhen Forbes first released valuations of MLS clubs in 2008, the average team value was $48 million. In 2018, Forbes reported that the average value of a MLS club was $240 million \u2013 a 500 percent increase in 10 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2018/11/14/mls-most-valuable-teams-2018/|title=Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Teams 2018: Atlanta United Debuts On Top|last=Smith|first=Chris|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Designated Player rule ===\nAt the conclusion of the 2006 season, MLS created the [[Designated Player Rule]]. The rule enables clubs to sign up to three players whose total costs exceed the maximum salary budget charge.<ref name=\"Wahl\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/planet-futbol/2014/12/03/don-garber-mls-commissioner-major-league-soccer|title=15 Years of The Don: Under Garber, MLS stayed afloat, has taken strides|last=Wahl|first=Grant|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref>\n\nGarber stated that fan research was one of the driving forces behind the decision to institute the Designated Player Rule. Garber and the league's owners also acknowledged that MLS needed additional \"marquee\" players to boost interest and the long-term strength of the league in a quicker fashion. The rule made it possible for clubs to sign an international icon like David Beckham with the LA Galaxy in 2006, or current stars like Jozy Altidore to larger contracts.\n\nThe strategy for signing Designated Players has evolved in recent years. Whereas clubs were more likely to use the rule to sign older, brand-name stars from Europe toward the perceived latter stages of their careers, teams began to utilize it to acquire younger, rising stars. For example, Seattle won MLS Cup in 2016 in part behind the strong play of 26-year-old midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro, who was signed as a Designated Player.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/sports/soccer/mls-cup-seattle-sounders-toronto-fc.html|title=M.L.S.

In 2006, the league mandated the creation of youth development systems and declared that any player developed by a team could be signed by that team without the player having to go through the [[MLS SuperDraft]]. In 2010, MLS required each of its teams to establish youth amateur programs separate from the pro club. Players registered for at least 1 year in an MLS youth program became eligible to sign a pro contract with that team without entering the SuperDraft.\n\nWith a true foundation in place after a decade, [[Homegrown Player Rule (Major League Soccer)|homegrown players]] like FC Dallas\u2019 Paxton Pomykal, LA Galaxy\u2019s Efrain Alvarez, Sporting Kansas City\u2019s Gianluca Busio and Seattle\u2019s Jordan Morris have emerged. Smaller-market clubs like Sporting KC have been able to develop their own stars from local communities.<ref>{{Citation|title=Homegrown Player Rule (Major League Soccer)|date=2019-06-13|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homegrown_Player_Rule_(Major_League_Soccer)&oldid=901735902|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\nAnd in 2019, the Under-17 club of Seattle Sounders FC proved how far it had come in a relatively brief time by winning the Champions Division of the Generation adidas Cup over the academy teams of top international clubs. \n\n=== Canada ===\nMLS expanded into Canada midway through Garber's tenure. Toronto joined the league in 2007, Vancouver in 2011 and Montreal in 2012 and all established successful MLS clubs.<ref name=\"Wahl\"/>\n\nThe league has signed multiple, long-term broadcast agreements with Canada's sports networks. In January, 2017, MLS extended its deal with TSN for five years and signed a new five-year contract with the French language network TVA Sports. This was in the wake of a banner year for Canadian teams in MLS in 2016, as [[Toronto FC]] defeated the [[Montreal Impact]] in the Eastern Conference Final.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Global/Issues/2017/01/11/Media/MLS-Canadian-rights.aspx|title=MLS Announces Five-Year Deals With Canadian Broadcasters TSN, TVA|website=www.sportsbusinessdaily.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref> In 2018, [[DAZN|DAZN Canada]], a leading live-streaming sports service, and MLS announced a three-year agreement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/03/02/dazn-canada-and-major-league-soccer-sign-3-year-deal|title=DAZN Canada and Major League Soccer Sign 3-Year Agreement|date=March 2, 2018|website=MLS Soccer}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the league enacted a major change in policy. A limited number of Canadians would now be counted as domestic players. Previously, Canadian players only counted as domestic in MLS if they played for one of the three Canadian-based franchises. The change was part of a collaboration with the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] (CSA) and executives from the three Canadian teams to improve youth development for Canada. Another aspect of the collaboration was a Canadian-specific Generation Adidas program to improve development of young players. The league and CSA work together to identify Canadian players who could be signed to contracts and made available in the MLS SuperDraft.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theprovince.com/sports/soccer/mls/vancouver-whitecaps/some-canadian-players-granted-domestic-status-in-mls-generation-adidas-canada-created|title=Some Canadian players granted domestic status in MLS; Generation adidas Canada created|date=2016-11-30|work=The Province|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Media rights deals ===\nAs MLS has grown in scope and popularity, the league's media rights deals have seen major increases. In 2014, the English-language rights to MLS and U.S. Soccer matches were sold to ESPN and FOX for $75 million per year for eight years. Univision won the Spanish-language rights for $15 million a year. The combined average rights fee of $90 million per year for eight years for ESPN, FOX and Univision represented a 500 percent increase from MLS\u2019 previous broadcast deals, which averaged $18 million per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2014/05/12/Media/MLS-TV.aspx|title=MLS's big play|website=www.sportsbusinessdaily.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref>\n\nMLS also signed new international TV agreements in 2015, including deals with Sky Sports, Eurosport and Globosat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-mls-sky/sky-sports-lands-four-year-deal-for-mls-broadcast-rights-idUSKBN0LT27G20150225|title=Sky Sports lands four-year deal for MLS broadcast rights|date=February 25, 2015|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-09-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, MLS sold rights to league games to networks in India, Australia and New Zealand. In total, MLS matches can be seen in more than 170 countries.\n\nMLS has also been at the forefront of innovation in media among global sports leagues. In 2017, Facebook signed a deal with MLS and Univision to stream at least 22 matches during the regular season and exclusively stream 40 \u201cMatchday Live\u201d shows with highlights and analysis. The games are streamed on the Facebook page of [[Univision Deportes Network|Univision Deportes]] and the shows are available on MLS\u2019 Facebook page.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-mls/facebook-signs-soccer-live-streaming-deal-with-mls-univision-idUSKBN16H20Y|title=Facebook signs soccer live-streaming deal with MLS, Univision|date=March 10, 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-09-14}}</ref> In 2019 there are six MLS clubs with exclusive streaming partnerships outside of deals with [[Regional sports network|regional sports networks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/major-league-soccer-experiments-with-streaming-partners-as-it-eyes-next-tv-rights-deals/|title=Major League Soccer Experiments With Streaming Partners as It Eyes Next TV Rights Deals|last=Jerde{{!}}March 1|first=Sara|last2=2019 .st0{fill:#F7EC13}.st1{clip-path:url}.st2{clip-path:url;fill:#020100}|website=www.adweek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref> \n\n=== Sponsors ===\nFurthering the league's financial well-being is the landmark decision to be the first professional sports league in North America to allow sponsor's names on the front of jerseys. [[Real Salt Lake]] signed the first agreement with [[XanGo]] in 2006 for an estimated $4\u20135 million over 4 years. Teams now generate multimillion-dollar sponsorships for their jersey-front sponsorships. Most jersey-front sponsorships run between $2 million \u2013 $5 million per year. MLS has announced that starting in 2020, the league will remove its logo from the right sleeve of jerseys, allowing teams to sell a 2.5-by-2.5-inch square ad to corporate partners. The new sponsorship opportunity will bring each team more than $1 million a year.\n\nIn addition, major brands such as adidas, The Home Depot, [[Coca-Cola]], [[Heineken]], [[Audi]], [[Johnson & Johnson]], [[Continental Tire]], [[Allstate]], and [[Kellogg's]] have signed league-wide sponsorships and partnership renewals in recent years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2017/03/02/mls-kicks-off-2017-season-with-new-sponsorship-from-kelloggs/#4aaca4a374f0|title=MLS Kicks Off 2017 Season With New Sponsorship From Kellogg's|last=Smith|first=Chris|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Ownership ===\nDuring Garber's tenure, ownership has been dramatically diversified. In 2001, there were just three investor-operators in the league: [[Philip Anschutz]]'s [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) controlled six teams, [[Lamar Hunt]]'s Hunt Sports three teams, and [[Robert Kraft]] one team. When AEG sold its remaining interests in [[Houston Dynamo]] in 2015, the then 20-team MLS became for the first time a league without multiple-team operators.\n\nGarber champions \u201cdiversity of thought\u201d among club owners in the current era of Major League Soccer.

One of his first moves as commissioner was to bring the league more in line with the international standard, eliminating the shootout and having the referee keep the time on the field.<ref name=\"test0\">[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-11-20/sports/9911200162_1_mls-cup-mls-commissioner-don-garber-fans], additional text.</ref> In 2004, MLS also eliminated overtime and the three-plus-one substitution rule used since the league's inception.

Before Garber came into the Commissioner's office, the league had only one team in its own stadium, [[Columbus Crew SC]], whose [[Mapfre Stadium]] was built by [[Lamar Hunt]] in 1999.\n\n[[File:Don Garber, MLS Commissioner, speaks to fans 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Garber speaking to fans prior to the opening match of the [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007 MLS season]]]]\n\nOn December 7, 2001, Garber met with club owners at the Colorado ranch of Philip Anschutz in order to establish a plan to ensure the league's survival. Among the concepts agreed upon was building soccer-specific stadiums; establishing what would be known as Soccer United Marketing \u2013 an agency designed to manage soccer content in the U.S.; and pursuing (and ultimately winning) broadcast rights to the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. The entire summit led by Garber at the Anshutz ranch is regarded as a critical moment in the eventual rise of MLS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.socceramerica.com/article/11865/mls-showdown-at-the-aeg-corral.html|title=SoccerAmerica \u2013 MLS: Showdown at the AEG corral 12/07/2001|website=www.socceramerica.com|access-date=September 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Soccer-specific stadiums ===\nFollowing Columbus Crew SC's lead, and after the summit at Anshutz's ranch, MLS clubs soon began building soccer-specific stadiums. The new venues enhanced the game-day experience for fans and granted teams full operating control of the stadiums and greater shares of stadium revenue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2013/11/20/major-league-soccers-most-valuable-teams/#7a7a4d6b19a6|title=Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Teams|last=Smith|first=Chris|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the \"cathedral of American Soccer,\" the Home Depot Center (now known as [[Dignity Health Sports Park]]), was built to house the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], and both senior national teams. Four more soccer-specific stadiums were built by the start of the 2007 MLS season. In 2019, MLS has 20 stadiums built or transformed for soccer. Within the next few years, a minimum of seven more stadiums built for MLS clubs will debut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/04/15/soccer-stadium-boom-13-new-mls-stadiums-decade-alone|title=2018 MLS Stadiums: Everything you need to know about every league venue|archive-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Soccer United Marketing ===\nSoccer United Marketing (SUM), one of the game-changing ideas to come out of Garber's meeting with club owners at the Anshutz ranch, was established in 2002 and manages all sponsorship, licensing and advertising sales for MLS and other premier soccer properties in North America, including US Soccer and the Mexican National Team.\n\nSUM's first deal was the purchase of the English-language rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cups for $40 million and to have the games broadcast on ESPN, splitting advertising revenue with the network. A decade later, FOX Network paid more than ten times that amount for the same rights.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/sports/soccer/fox-and-telemundo-win-us-rights-to-2018-and-2022-world-cups.html|title=Fox and Telemundo Win U.S. Rights to 2018 and 2022 World Cups|last=Longman|first=Jer\u00e9|date=2011-10-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nSUM continues to increase its partnerships.

Ownership groups from Sacramento and St. Louis were given exclusive rights to negotiate for spots 28 and 29 at an expansion fee of $200 million each, while the league's Board of Governors deferred a decision on a fee and timetable for the 30th team.\n\n=== Club valuation ===\nAs the league expanded and established a footprint across North America with successful clubs in Seattle, Portland, Toronto, New York and Atlanta, among many others, team valuations have soared.\n\nWhen Forbes first released valuations of MLS clubs in 2008, the average team value was $48 million. In 2018, Forbes reported that the average value of a MLS club was $240 million \u2013 a 500 percent increase in 10 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2018/11/14/mls-most-valuable-teams-2018/|title=Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Teams 2018: Atlanta United Debuts On Top|last=Smith|first=Chris|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Designated Player rule ===\nAt the conclusion of the 2006 season, MLS created the [[Designated Player Rule]]. The rule enables clubs to sign up to three players whose total costs exceed the maximum salary budget charge.<ref name=\"Wahl\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/planet-futbol/2014/12/03/don-garber-mls-commissioner-major-league-soccer|title=15 Years of The Don: Under Garber, MLS stayed afloat, has taken strides|last=Wahl|first=Grant|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref>\n\nGarber stated that fan research was one of the driving forces behind the decision to institute the Designated Player Rule. Garber and the league's owners also acknowledged that MLS needed additional \"marquee\" players to boost interest and the long-term strength of the league in a quicker fashion. The rule made it possible for clubs to sign an international icon like David Beckham with the LA Galaxy in 2006, or current stars like Jozy Altidore to larger contracts.\n\nThe strategy for signing Designated Players has evolved in recent years. Whereas clubs were more likely to use the rule to sign older, brand-name stars from Europe toward the perceived latter stages of their careers, teams began to utilize it to acquire younger, rising stars. For example, Seattle won MLS Cup in 2016 in part behind the strong play of 26-year-old midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro, who was signed as a Designated Player.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/sports/soccer/mls-cup-seattle-sounders-toronto-fc.html|title=M.L.S.

In 2006, the league mandated the creation of youth development systems and declared that any player developed by a team could be signed by that team without the player having to go through the [[MLS SuperDraft]]. In 2010, MLS required each of its teams to establish youth amateur programs separate from the pro club. Players registered for at least 1 year in an MLS youth program became eligible to sign a pro contract with that team without entering the SuperDraft.\n\nWith a true foundation in place after a decade, [[Homegrown Player Rule (Major League Soccer)|homegrown players]] like FC Dallas\u2019 Paxton Pomykal, LA Galaxy\u2019s Efrain Alvarez, Sporting Kansas City\u2019s Gianluca Busio and Seattle\u2019s Jordan Morris have emerged. Smaller-market clubs like Sporting KC have been able to develop their own stars from local communities.<ref>{{Citation|title=Homegrown Player Rule (Major League Soccer)|date=2019-06-13|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homegrown_Player_Rule_(Major_League_Soccer)&oldid=901735902|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\nAnd in 2019, the Under-17 club of Seattle Sounders FC proved how far it had come in a relatively brief time by winning the Champions Division of the Generation adidas Cup over the academy teams of top international clubs. \n\n=== Canada ===\nMLS expanded into Canada midway through Garber's tenure. Toronto joined the league in 2007, Vancouver in 2011 and Montreal in 2012 and all established successful MLS clubs.<ref name=\"Wahl\"/>\n\nThe league has signed multiple, long-term broadcast agreements with Canada's sports networks. In January, 2017, MLS extended its deal with TSN for five years and signed a new five-year contract with the French language network TVA Sports. This was in the wake of a banner year for Canadian teams in MLS in 2016, as [[Toronto FC]] defeated the [[Montreal Impact]] in the Eastern Conference Final.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Global/Issues/2017/01/11/Media/MLS-Canadian-rights.aspx|title=MLS Announces Five-Year Deals With Canadian Broadcasters TSN, TVA|website=www.sportsbusinessdaily.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref> In 2018, [[DAZN|DAZN Canada]], a leading live-streaming sports service, and MLS announced a three-year agreement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/03/02/dazn-canada-and-major-league-soccer-sign-3-year-deal|title=DAZN Canada and Major League Soccer Sign 3-Year Agreement|date=March 2, 2018|website=MLS Soccer}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the league enacted a major change in policy. A limited number of Canadians would now be counted as domestic players. Previously, Canadian players only counted as domestic in MLS if they played for one of the three Canadian-based franchises. The change was part of a collaboration with the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] (CSA) and executives from the three Canadian teams to improve youth development for Canada. Another aspect of the collaboration was a Canadian-specific Generation Adidas program to improve development of young players. The league and CSA work together to identify Canadian players who could be signed to contracts and made available in the MLS SuperDraft.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theprovince.com/sports/soccer/mls/vancouver-whitecaps/some-canadian-players-granted-domestic-status-in-mls-generation-adidas-canada-created|title=Some Canadian players granted domestic status in MLS; Generation adidas Canada created|date=2016-11-30|work=The Province|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Media rights deals ===\nAs MLS has grown in scope and popularity, the league's media rights deals have seen major increases. In 2014, the English-language rights to MLS and U.S. Soccer matches were sold to ESPN and FOX for $75 million per year for eight years. Univision won the Spanish-language rights for $15 million a year. The combined average rights fee of $90 million per year for eight years for ESPN, FOX and Univision represented a 500 percent increase from MLS\u2019 previous broadcast deals, which averaged $18 million per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2014/05/12/Media/MLS-TV.aspx|title=MLS's big play|website=www.sportsbusinessdaily.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref>\n\nMLS also signed new international TV agreements in 2015, including deals with Sky Sports, Eurosport and Globosat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-mls-sky/sky-sports-lands-four-year-deal-for-mls-broadcast-rights-idUSKBN0LT27G20150225|title=Sky Sports lands four-year deal for MLS broadcast rights|date=February 25, 2015|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-09-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, MLS sold rights to league games to networks in India, Australia and New Zealand. In total, MLS matches can be seen in more than 170 countries.\n\nMLS has also been at the forefront of innovation in media among global sports leagues.

[[Real Salt Lake]] signed the first agreement with [[XanGo]] in 2006 for an estimated $4\u20135 million over 4 years. Teams now generate multimillion-dollar sponsorships for their jersey-front sponsorships. Most jersey-front sponsorships run between $2 million \u2013 $5 million per year. MLS has announced that starting in 2020, the league will remove its logo from the right sleeve of jerseys, allowing teams to sell a 2.5-by-2.5-inch square ad to corporate partners. The new sponsorship opportunity will bring each team more than $1 million a year.\n\nIn addition, major brands such as adidas, The Home Depot, [[Coca-Cola]], [[Heineken]], [[Audi]], [[Johnson & Johnson]], [[Continental Tire]], [[Allstate]], and [[Kellogg's]] have signed league-wide sponsorships and partnership renewals in recent years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2017/03/02/mls-kicks-off-2017-season-with-new-sponsorship-from-kelloggs/#4aaca4a374f0|title=MLS Kicks Off 2017 Season With New Sponsorship From Kellogg's|last=Smith|first=Chris|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Ownership ===\nDuring Garber's tenure, ownership has been dramatically diversified. In 2001, there were just three investor-operators in the league: [[Philip Anschutz]]'s [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) controlled six teams, [[Lamar Hunt]]'s Hunt Sports three teams, and [[Robert Kraft]] one team. When AEG sold its remaining interests in [[Houston Dynamo]] in 2015, the then 20-team MLS became for the first time a league without multiple-team operators.\n\nGarber champions \u201cdiversity of thought\u201d among club owners in the current era of Major League Soccer.

Its members were Jon N\u00f6dtveidt, [[Ole \u00d6hman]], Peter Palmdahl, and Mattias \"M\u00e4be\" Johansson. The group recorded a single demo before breaking up in 1989.<ref name=biography>Andrea Biagi: [https://archive.is/20031005065926/http://www.dissection.nu/biography.htm ''Biography Part One''. ''\"The First Era\"''].</ref> N\u00f6dtveidt joined the band Rabbit\u2019s Carrot, where \u00d6hman played drums. N\u00f6dtveidt and \u00d6hman \"were never very comfortable in Rabbit's Carrot, which also explains their short time in that band, as they wanted the music and lyrics to evolve on the extreme dark side. Jon would write songs and arrange them together with Ole in the rehearsal place, but the other members, didn't feel that the material would fit the band.\"<ref name=biography/> In autumn 1989, Jon N\u00f6dtveidt formed Dissection together with Palmdahl on bass. In the spring of 1990, they recruited drummer \u00d6hman. In April 1990, the first official rehearsal tape ''Severed into Shreds'' was recorded and sent to underground [[fanzine]]s worldwide \"to mark the birth of Dissection, a band that was about to make heavy impact on the scene\".<ref name=biography/> The band recruited former Siren\u2019s Yell bassist Mattias \"M\u00e4be\" Johansson, who was now playing with the local death/thrash metal band Nosferatu, as a live session member playing the rhythm guitar. Dissection\u2019s first concert was held in October 1990 with death metal act [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]].<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn December 1990, the band recorded and released the demo ''The Grief Prophecy''.<ref name=biography/> It contained three songs and featured illustrations by the artist known as [[Kristian W\u00e5hlin|Necrolord]], who later created most Dissection album artworks.\n\nIn January 1991, second guitarist [[John Zwetsloot]] joined the band, which now had a complete line-up \"and could further develop their characteristic dual-harmony guitar-sound that was to become an important part of the band's sound\". The first concert with Zwetsloot was held in February 1991 at a local death metal event in the band\u2019s hometown Str\u00f6mstad. As the demo was spreading in the underground scene, the [[France|French]] [[record label]] Corpsegrinder Records offered Dissection a deal to record an EP.<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn April 1991, [[Per \"Dead\" Ohlin|Dead]], of the notorious [[Norway|Norwegian]] black metal group [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]\u2019s vocalist, committed suicide. A few days later, Dissection played the Mayhem song ''Freezing Moon'' in honor of Dead at a show in Falkenberg, Sweden, and made an unofficial special edition of ''The Grief Prophecy'' demo with a cover drawn by Dead. In September 1991 the band record three new tracks for the 7\" EP ''Into Infinite Obscurity'', released in December 1991 by Corpsegrinder Records in a limited edition of 1000 copies. In December 1991 N\u00f6dtveidt and \u00d6hman also played live in Askim, Norway, at a black metal concert arranged by the Norwegian Black Circle N\u00f6dtveidt had joined, and [[Euronymous]], who led the Circle and the band Mayhem. N\u00f6dtveidt, \u00d6hman and Euronymous performed ''Freezing Moon'' live.<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn 1992 Dissection recorded a four-track promo tape and signed a one-album deal with [[No Fashion Records]]. In March 1993, the band recorded the full-length album ''[[The Somberlain]]'', recorded and mixed at Hellspawn/Unisound studios with [[Dan Swan\u00f6]]. During that time, the band\u2019s members, who were temporarily living in different towns, all moved to [[Gothenburg]] after the summer of 1993, where they shared a steady rehearsal place with [[At the Gates]]. The album was released in December 1993 and dedicated to Euronymous, who had been murdered earlier the same year.<ref name=biography/>\n\nAs the band members \"would find themselves rehearsing more and more without John [Zwetsloot] even showing up\" and \"even had to cancel gigs because he didn't show up for the preparing rehearsals\", they \"felt they had their hands tied behind their backs with John still in the band and that they could do nothing but kick him out\". The last concert with Zwetsloot was performed in Oslo, Norway, on 14 April 1994. The day Zwetsloot was fired, Dissection called Johan Norman from Satanized (a short-lived project N\u00f6dtveidt was involved with), who showed up one day later and \"proved to be a worthy replacement for John, having the motivation that John was lacking\". Dissection continued playing live, wrote songs for a second album, and entered the studio twice to record demos of new songs and the contribution ''Anti-Christ'' for the [[Slayer]] tribute compilation album ''Slatanic Slaughter'' on Black Sun Records. In November 1994, Dissection signed a deal with [[Nuclear Blast]] and focussed on the second album. In March 1995, the band returned to the Hellspawn/Unisound studios to record the second full-length album ''[[Storm of the Light's Bane]]'', followed by a three date tour through the UK with [[Cradle of Filth]] and a few concerts in Sweden.<ref name=biography/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1995 N\u00f6dtveidt and Norman joined the newly formed [[Satanism|Satanic]] organization Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO). In September 1995 drummer Ole \u00d6hman left Dissection and was replaced by Tobias Kellgren (ex-Satanized). He was introduced to the Swedish fans at a show with [[Morbid Angel]] at K\u00e5ren in Gothenburg, 10 October 1995.<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn November 1995, ''Storm of the Light\u2019s Bane'' was released by Nuclear Blast, followed by a two-week European tour through Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Sweden in December 1995, and the World Tour of the Light\u2019s Bane covering Europe and America, ending in 1997.<ref name=biography/>\n\nBy the beginning of January 1996, Dissection was playing shows in Sweden before leaving for a UK tour with At the Gates in February, followed by a vast US tour with At the Gates and Morbid Angel in March. Back in Scandinavia, Dissection played at the Rockefeller in Oslo together with [[Darkthrone]] and [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], marking the start of a co-headlining European tour. In April, in connection with the co-headlining European tour, Dissection released the ''[[Where Dead Angels Lie]]'' MCD, which contained the title track\u2019s studio and demo version as well as other demo recordings and two cover songs.<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn 1997, Dissection played the Gods of Darkness tour together with Cradle of Filth, [[In Flames]] and [[Dimmu Borgir]].<ref name=biography/> Dissection\u2019s and Dimmu Borgir\u2019s show at the Live Music Hall in Cologne, Germany, on 31 March 1997,<ref>Dimmu Borgir/Dissection: ''Live & Plugged Vol. II'', Nuclear Blast 1997.</ref> was recorded and released by Nuclear Blast on the live split video cassette ''Live & Plugged Vol. II''. Dissection\u2019s World Tour of the Light's Bane ended with an appearance at the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival, which was recorded and released on the ''[[Live Legacy]]'' album, and the Nuclear Blast festivals.<ref name=biography/>\n\nAlthough \"[t]he first era of Dissection was now at its peak\" and \"the situation, at least on the surface, seemed to be stable and prosperous with the band's success peaking, personal differences prevailed\". This resulted in Palmdahl leaving the band and being replaced by Jon N\u00f6dtveidt's brother Emil N\u00f6dtveidt for the summer festivals. After the summer Norman \"suddenly 'disappeared' for several months without notice, with Tobias covering up for him claiming to know nothing (however remaining in close contact with Johan throughout this period). The background of this 'disappearance' being that Johan had turned his back on and betrayed the MLO, fearing their retribution.\" As N\u00f6dtveidt was a member of MLO, Norman had also left Dissection behind, N\u00f6dtveidt being the only member left in the band.

Despite a number of lineup changes, Dissection released ''[[The Somberlain]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Storm of the Light's Bane]]'' in 1995, before splitting up in 1997 due to N\u00f6dtveidt's imprisonment for complicity in the murder of [[Keillers Park murder|Josef Meddour]].\n\nAfter his release, N\u00f6dtveidt reformed the band in 2004 with new members whom he felt could \"stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's Satanic concept.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} They released their third and final full-length album ''[[Reinkaos]]'' in April 2006, before disbanding that June. N\u00f6dtveidt said he had \"reached the limitations of music as a tool for expressing what I want to express, for myself and the handful of others that I care about.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Two months later, N\u00f6dtveidt committed suicide with a gun inside a circle of lit candles in his apartment in [[H\u00e4sselby]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nDissection released a number of live albums and EPs before its final dissolution, and played a central role in the development of Sweden's black metal and death metal scenes, particularly through the influence of the first two albums; it has sometimes been described as part of the [[Gothenburg metal|Gothenburg scene]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+black+metal+%22dissection%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjggaz0uvzRAhXDuBQKHVkNAfQQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=dissection&f=false|title=Swedish Death Metal|last=Ekeroth|first=Daniel|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Bazillion Points Books|isbn=9780979616310|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== First era ===\nIn 1988, a [[thrash metal]] band by the name of Siren\u2019s Yell was formed in the Swedish town of [[Str\u00f6mstad]]. Its members were Jon N\u00f6dtveidt, [[Ole \u00d6hman]], Peter Palmdahl, and Mattias \"M\u00e4be\" Johansson. The group recorded a single demo before breaking up in 1989.<ref name=biography>Andrea Biagi: [https://archive.is/20031005065926/http://www.dissection.nu/biography.htm ''Biography Part One''. ''\"The First Era\"''].</ref> N\u00f6dtveidt joined the band Rabbit\u2019s Carrot, where \u00d6hman played drums. N\u00f6dtveidt and \u00d6hman \"were never very comfortable in Rabbit's Carrot, which also explains their short time in that band, as they wanted the music and lyrics to evolve on the extreme dark side. Jon would write songs and arrange them together with Ole in the rehearsal place, but the other members, didn't feel that the material would fit the band.\"<ref name=biography/> In autumn 1989, Jon N\u00f6dtveidt formed Dissection together with Palmdahl on bass. In the spring of 1990, they recruited drummer \u00d6hman. In April 1990, the first official rehearsal tape ''Severed into Shreds'' was recorded and sent to underground [[fanzine]]s worldwide \"to mark the birth of Dissection, a band that was about to make heavy impact on the scene\".<ref name=biography/> The band recruited former Siren\u2019s Yell bassist Mattias \"M\u00e4be\" Johansson, who was now playing with the local death/thrash metal band Nosferatu, as a live session member playing the rhythm guitar. Dissection\u2019s first concert was held in October 1990 with death metal act [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]].<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn December 1990, the band recorded and released the demo ''The Grief Prophecy''.<ref name=biography/> It contained three songs and featured illustrations by the artist known as [[Kristian W\u00e5hlin|Necrolord]], who later created most Dissection album artworks.\n\nIn January 1991, second guitarist [[John Zwetsloot]] joined the band, which now had a complete line-up \"and could further develop their characteristic dual-harmony guitar-sound that was to become an important part of the band's sound\". The first concert with Zwetsloot was held in February 1991 at a local death metal event in the band\u2019s hometown Str\u00f6mstad. As the demo was spreading in the underground scene, the [[France|French]] [[record label]] Corpsegrinder Records offered Dissection a deal to record an EP.<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn April 1991, [[Per \"Dead\" Ohlin|Dead]], of the notorious [[Norway|Norwegian]] black metal group [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]\u2019s vocalist, committed suicide. A few days later, Dissection played the Mayhem song ''Freezing Moon'' in honor of Dead at a show in Falkenberg, Sweden, and made an unofficial special edition of ''The Grief Prophecy'' demo with a cover drawn by Dead. In September 1991 the band record three new tracks for the 7\" EP ''Into Infinite Obscurity'', released in December 1991 by Corpsegrinder Records in a limited edition of 1000 copies. In December 1991 N\u00f6dtveidt and \u00d6hman also played live in Askim, Norway, at a black metal concert arranged by the Norwegian Black Circle N\u00f6dtveidt had joined, and [[Euronymous]], who led the Circle and the band Mayhem. N\u00f6dtveidt, \u00d6hman and Euronymous performed ''Freezing Moon'' live.<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn 1992 Dissection recorded a four-track promo tape and signed a one-album deal with [[No Fashion Records]]. In March 1993, the band recorded the full-length album ''[[The Somberlain]]'', recorded and mixed at Hellspawn/Unisound studios with [[Dan Swan\u00f6]]. During that time, the band\u2019s members, who were temporarily living in different towns, all moved to [[Gothenburg]] after the summer of 1993, where they shared a steady rehearsal place with [[At the Gates]]. The album was released in December 1993 and dedicated to Euronymous, who had been murdered earlier the same year.<ref name=biography/>\n\nAs the band members \"would find themselves rehearsing more and more without John [Zwetsloot] even showing up\" and \"even had to cancel gigs because he didn't show up for the preparing rehearsals\", they \"felt they had their hands tied behind their backs with John still in the band and that they could do nothing but kick him out\". The last concert with Zwetsloot was performed in Oslo, Norway, on 14 April 1994. The day Zwetsloot was fired, Dissection called Johan Norman from Satanized (a short-lived project N\u00f6dtveidt was involved with), who showed up one day later and \"proved to be a worthy replacement for John, having the motivation that John was lacking\". Dissection continued playing live, wrote songs for a second album, and entered the studio twice to record demos of new songs and the contribution ''Anti-Christ'' for the [[Slayer]] tribute compilation album ''Slatanic Slaughter'' on Black Sun Records. In November 1994, Dissection signed a deal with [[Nuclear Blast]] and focussed on the second album. In March 1995, the band returned to the Hellspawn/Unisound studios to record the second full-length album ''[[Storm of the Light's Bane]]'', followed by a three date tour through the UK with [[Cradle of Filth]] and a few concerts in Sweden.<ref name=biography/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1995 N\u00f6dtveidt and Norman joined the newly formed [[Satanism|Satanic]] organization Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO). In September 1995 drummer Ole \u00d6hman left Dissection and was replaced by Tobias Kellgren (ex-Satanized). He was introduced to the Swedish fans at a show with [[Morbid Angel]] at K\u00e5ren in Gothenburg, 10 October 1995.<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn November 1995, ''Storm of the Light\u2019s Bane'' was released by Nuclear Blast, followed by a two-week European tour through Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Sweden in December 1995, and the World Tour of the Light\u2019s Bane covering Europe and America, ending in 1997.<ref name=biography/>\n\nBy the beginning of January 1996, Dissection was playing shows in Sweden before leaving for a UK tour with At the Gates in February, followed by a vast US tour with At the Gates and Morbid Angel in March. Back in Scandinavia, Dissection played at the Rockefeller in Oslo together with [[Darkthrone]] and [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], marking the start of a co-headlining European tour. In April, in connection with the co-headlining European tour, Dissection released the ''[[Where Dead Angels Lie]]'' MCD, which contained the title track\u2019s studio and demo version as well as other demo recordings and two cover songs.<ref name=biography/>\n\nIn 1997, Dissection played the Gods of Darkness tour together with Cradle of Filth, [[In Flames]] and [[Dimmu Borgir]].<ref name=biography/> Dissection\u2019s and Dimmu Borgir\u2019s show at the Live Music Hall in Cologne, Germany, on 31 March 1997,<ref>Dimmu Borgir/Dissection: ''Live & Plugged Vol. II'', Nuclear Blast 1997.</ref> was recorded and released by Nuclear Blast on the live split video cassette ''Live & Plugged Vol. II''. Dissection\u2019s World Tour of the Light's Bane ended with an appearance at the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival, which was recorded and released on the ''[[Live Legacy]]'' album, and the Nuclear Blast festivals.<ref name=biography/>\n\nAlthough \"[t]he first era of Dissection was now at its peak\" and \"the situation, at least on the surface, seemed to be stable and prosperous with the band's success peaking, personal differences prevailed\". This resulted in Palmdahl leaving the band and being replaced by Jon N\u00f6dtveidt's brother Emil N\u00f6dtveidt for the summer festivals. After the summer Norman \"suddenly 'disappeared' for several months without notice, with Tobias covering up for him claiming to know nothing (however remaining in close contact with Johan throughout this period). The background of this 'disappearance' being that Johan had turned his back on and betrayed the MLO, fearing their retribution.\" As N\u00f6dtveidt was a member of MLO, Norman had also left Dissection behind, N\u00f6dtveidt being the only member left in the band. He recruited a new line-up and booked the Studio Fredman for the supposed recording of the third studio album.<ref name=biography/>\n\n====N\u00f6dtveidt's murder conviction====\n{{Main article|Keillers Park murder}}\nOn 18 December 1997, N\u00f6dtveidt and fellow MLO member Vlad (Victor Draconi / Nemesis Khoshnood-Sharis) were arrested for the murder of a 37-year-old homosexual man, [[Keillers Park murder|Josef ben Meddour]], on 22 July 1997.<ref name=killing>{{cite web|url=http://www.dissection.nu/killing.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20040216045715/http://www.dissection.nu/killing.htm|url-status=dead|title=Official DISSECTION website|date=16 February 2004|archivedate=16 February 2004|website=Dissection.nu|accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref> N\u00f6dtveidt received a 10-year sentence,<ref name=biography/><ref name=killing/> and [[Necropolis Records]] released the compilation album ''[[The Past Is Alive (The Early Mischief)]]''.

The band followed the teachings of the Swedish organisation known as the Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO), now known as [[Temple of the Black Light]], and the lyrics in the ''Reinkaos'' album contain [[magical formula]]e from the ''Liber Azerate'', and are based on the organisation's teachings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dissection.nu/disc/reinkaos.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080208150021/http://www.dissection.nu/disc/reinkaos.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-02-08 |title=REINKA\u03a9S |website=Dissection.nu|accessdate=2011-02-10 }}</ref>\n\n=== Breakup ===\nIn May 2006, shortly after the release of ''Reinkaos'', the band announced plans to split following a short tour. The tour was scheduled to include two appearances in the United States, but these were eventually canceled after N\u00f6dtveidt was denied an [[Visa (document)|entry visa]] to the country, due to his previous incarceration. The band played its final European concert in Stockholm on [[Midsummer]], 24 June 2006.

It was launched on 29 September 2000 as Playhouse Disney.\n\nThe channel was rebranded as \"Disney Junior\" on 7 May 2011.\n\n==History==\nDuring the re-brand of Disney Channel UK in 1997, an unbranded block of pre-school shows was added to the network. On 28 September 1999, it was rebranded as Playhouse Disney. On September 29, 2000, Disney Television International launched a standalone Playhouse Disney channel alongside Toon Disney and Disney Channel +1 on the [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky Digital]] platform.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney launches new channels|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Brand Republic|agency=MediaWeek|publisher=Haymarket Media Group Ltd.|date=September 13, 2000|archiveurl=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/506643/Disney-launches-new-channels/?HAYILC=RELATED|archivedate=September 13, 2000}}</ref> Since the channel was exclusive to Sky Digital at this time, the Playhouse Disney block continued to broadcast on Disney Channel during school-term weekdays, although the channel was later launched on [[NTL Incorporated|NTL]] and [[Telewest]] by 2002 and 2003 respectively. The block eventually reduced it's hours of programming featured and was eventually disposed of in July 2004.\n\nIn June 2006, a Playhouse Disney block was added to the morning schedule of free-to-air network [[ABC1 (UK and Irish TV channel)|ABC1]].<ref name=ks>{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Lianne|title=New kid on the U.K. Freeview block|url=http://kidscreen.com/2006/04/01/abc-20060401/|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=Kidscreen|publisher=Brunico Communications Ltd.|date=1 April 2006}}</ref> It was removed after Disney ceased transmission of ABC1 in September 2007. ABC1's slot itself on Sky would be used to launch a 25-minute timeshift (currently 1-hour) of Playhouse Disney, called Playhouse Disney + in October 2007.\n\nThe Playhouse Disney brand, which existed as 22 channels or blocks in 156 countries and territories, rebranded as [[Disney Junior]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/resources/detail.asp?area=79&article=55780|title=Disney Junior to replace SoapNet, Playhouse|publisher=C21Media|date=2010-05-26}}</ref> In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Disney Junior began on Saturday 7 May 2011 with its first show as ''[[Handy Manny]]''. At the same time the channel started broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen. The last show that aired on Playhouse Disney UK before it became Disney Junior was ''[[JoJo's Circus]]''.\n\nA high-definition simulcast of Disney Junior was made available to Sky+ HD subscribers on 9 April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/101972|title=Disney, Sky bow co-branded movie net|publisher=C21Media|date=21 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 May 2017, the channel went 24/7.\n\nThroughout September 2017, Disney XD +1 was turned into a pop-up channel titled Mickey and Pals, which aired various programming from this channel.\n\n==Presentation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nWhen Playhouse Disney originally launched in the United Kingdom, it used live presentation and links, being set in a large \"Playhouse\" featuring different rooms and areas. This presentation format was also used for Playhouse Disney in Australia, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Germany and several other territories outside North America.\n\nPlayhouse Disney UK's main live presenters were [[Dave Benson Phillips]] and [[Alex Lovell]], who were referred to as Big Dave and Little Alex.  In addition to presenting the \"Playhouse\", both Dave and Alex presented \"Music Time\", where they sang mostly Disney songs, with the original recordings of the songs. Dave also presented the children's cookery show, ''Bite Size'', alongside [[Sophie Aldred]] and Karl Woolley and puppet Mitzi the Oven Glove.\n\nTwo other segments were also featured. The first was \"Circle Time\", presented by Jason Canning, where he alongside a few children, made up stories from animated drawings that viewers sent in. The other was \"Art Play\", presented by Sara-Louise Harper, which featured her and a few children creating a piece of artwork based on a popular Disney movie.\n\nNew graphics and a new logo were introduced in March 2003, coinciding with the debut of the main Disney Channel's new look, although the \"Playhouse\" format was kept the same.\n\nIn Late 2003, the format of the channel was changed significantly. With this, Jason Canning was axed from the channel, removing the 'Circle Time' segment in the process. Art Play was kept, but the presenting role was taken by Olivia Bonnici after Sara-Louise Harper was too axed. A dedicated nighttime block called \"PJ's Bedtime\" was introduced, being presented by Olivia and Big Dave. While the \"Playhouse\" format would remain for the next few years, the channel's presentation gradually began to focus more on out-of-vision links, like what its American counterpart would use.\n\nOn 27 August 2006, Dave Benson Philips and Alex Lovell were axed from the channel. the Art Play and Music Time strands were removed around the same time. The two remaining strands, PJ's Bedtime and Bite Size, were removed in November 2007 and May 2008, respectively. By then, the channel featured a format and identity in-par with its American counterpart.\n\nIn September 2007, the channel logo in the external promotionals (programme press releases, promos for terrestrial television) were changed to include the inscription \"Channel\" as in all Playhouse Disney Europe channels, but on the channel itself the logo was not changed. This move was to differentiate the channel from the \"Playhouse Disney\" block, shown all mornings on the american [[Disney Channel]].\n\nPresenters were re-added to the channel in September 2009, with new presenters Samantha Pearl and James Sherwood presenting on air between 6pm and 8pm.\n\nOn 11 February 2019, Disney Junior UK was re-branded and the logo colour changed from red to yellow, to match the other international Disney Junior channels. In Christmas 2019-2 Jan 2020, the logo color changed from yellow to light blue with snowflakes on screen.\n\n==Disney Junior +==\nA one-hour [[Timeshift channel|timeshift]] service of the channel, Disney Junior +, launched on 29 October 2007 as Playhouse Disney +, replacing the now defunct channel [[ABC1 (United Kingdom)|ABC1]]. It launched on the same day that the Disney Channels were reshuffled on Sky, involving [[Disney Cinemagic]] and Disney Cinemagic +1 moving down the [[Electronic program guide|EPG]], to enable Playhouse Disney to move up the EPG to allow Playhouse Disney + to launch next to it on Sky 611 and 612 respectively. Playhouse Disney + was initially a 25-minute timeshift service until 11 April 2011 when it became a 1-hour timeshift service. It was renamed as Disney Junior +1 on 11 Feb 2019.\n\n==Live show==\nA live tour took place in Aug 2007-Late 2010. It was shown in several cities, across the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the United Kingdom, the tour included [[Bristol]], [[London]], [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Brighton]].\n\n==Blocks==\n===Current===\n* '''Magical Mondays''' - Magical Mondays was introduced in 2013 and runs on Monday afternoons.

On September 29, 2000, Disney Television International launched a standalone Playhouse Disney channel alongside Toon Disney and Disney Channel +1 on the [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky Digital]] platform.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney launches new channels|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Brand Republic|agency=MediaWeek|publisher=Haymarket Media Group Ltd.|date=September 13, 2000|archiveurl=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/506643/Disney-launches-new-channels/?HAYILC=RELATED|archivedate=September 13, 2000}}</ref> Since the channel was exclusive to Sky Digital at this time, the Playhouse Disney block continued to broadcast on Disney Channel during school-term weekdays, although the channel was later launched on [[NTL Incorporated|NTL]] and [[Telewest]] by 2002 and 2003 respectively. The block eventually reduced it's hours of programming featured and was eventually disposed of in July 2004.\n\nIn June 2006, a Playhouse Disney block was added to the morning schedule of free-to-air network [[ABC1 (UK and Irish TV channel)|ABC1]]<ref name=ks>{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Lianne|title=New kid on the U.K. Freeview block|url=http://kidscreen.com/2006/04/01/abc-20060401/|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=Kidscreen|publisher=Brunico Communications Ltd.|date=1 April 2006}}</ref>. It was removed after Disney ceased transmission of ABC1 in September 2007. ABC1's slot itself on Sky would be used to launch a 25-minute timeshift (currently 1-hour) of Playhouse Disney, called Playhouse Disney + in October 2007.\n\nThe Playhouse Disney brand, which existed as 22 channels or blocks in 156 countries and territories, rebranded as [[Disney Junior]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/resources/detail.asp?area=79&article=55780|title=Disney Junior to replace SoapNet, Playhouse|publisher=C21Media|date=2010-05-26}}</ref> In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Disney Junior began on Saturday 7 May 2011 with its first show as ''[[Handy Manny]]''. At the same time the channel started broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen. The last show that aired on Playhouse Disney UK before it became Disney Junior was ''[[JoJo's Circus]]''.\n\nA high-definition simulcast of Disney Junior was made available to Sky+ HD subscribers on 9 April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/101972|title=Disney, Sky bow co-branded movie net|publisher=C21Media|date=21 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 May 2017, the channel went 24/7.\n\nThroughout September 2017, Disney XD +1 was turned into a pop-up channel titled Mickey and Pals, which aired various programming from this channel.\n\n==Presentation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nWhen Playhouse Disney originally launched in the United Kingdom, it used live presentation and links, being set in a large \"Playhouse\" featuring different rooms and areas. This presentation format was also used for Playhouse Disney in Australia, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Germany and several other territories outside North America.\n\nPlayhouse Disney UK's main live presenters were [[Dave Benson Phillips]] and [[Alex Lovell]], who were referred to as Big Dave and Little Alex.  In addition to presenting the \"Playhouse\", both Dave and Alex presented \"Music Time\", where they sang mostly Disney songs, with the original recordings of the songs. Dave also presented the children's cookery show, ''Bite Size'', alongside [[Sophie Aldred]] and Karl Woolley and puppet Mitzi the Oven Glove.\n\nTwo other segments were also featured. The first was \"Circle Time\", presented by Jason Canning, where he alongside a few children, made up stories from animated drawings that viewers sent in. The other was \"Art Play\", presented by Sara-Louise Harper, which featured her and a few children creating a piece of artwork based on a popular Disney movie.\n\nNew graphics and a new logo were introduced in March 2003, coinciding with the debut of the main Disney Channel's new look, although the \"Playhouse\" format was kept the same.\n\nIn Late 2003, the format of the channel was changed significantly. With this, Jason Canning was axed from the channel, removing the 'Circle Time' segment in the process. Art Play was kept, but the presenting role was taken by Olivia Bonnici after Sara-Louise Harper was too axed. A dedicated nighttime block called \"PJ's Bedtime\" was introduced, being presented by Olivia and Big Dave. While the \"Playhouse\" format would remain for the next few years, the channel's presentation gradually began to focus more on out-of-vision links, like what its American counterpart would use.\n\nOn 27 August 2006, Dave Benson Philips and Alex Lovell were axed from the channel. the Art Play and Music Time strands were removed around the same time. The two remaining strands, PJ's Bedtime and Bite Size, were removed in November 2007 and May 2008, respectively. By then, the channel featured a format and identity in-par with its American counterpart.\n\nIn September 2007, the channel logo in the external promotionals (programme press releases, promos for terrestrial television) were changed to include the inscription \"Channel\" as in all Playhouse Disney Europe channels, but on the channel itself the logo was not changed. This move was to differentiate the channel from the \"Playhouse Disney\" block, shown all mornings on the american [[Disney Channel]].\n\nPresenters were re-added to the channel in September 2009, with new presenters Samantha Pearl and James Sherwood presenting on air between 6pm and 8pm.\n\nOn 11 February 2019, Disney Junior UK was re-branded and the logo colour changed from red to yellow, to match the other international Disney Junior channels. In Christmas 2019-2 Jan 2020, the logo color changed from yellow to light blue with snowflakes on screen.\n\n==Disney Junior +==\nA one-hour [[Timeshift channel|timeshift]] service of the channel, Disney Junior +, launched on 29 October 2007 as Playhouse Disney +, replacing the now defunct channel [[ABC1 (United Kingdom)|ABC1]]. It launched on the same day that the Disney Channels were reshuffled on Sky, involving [[Disney Cinemagic]] and Disney Cinemagic +1 moving down the [[Electronic program guide|EPG]], to enable Playhouse Disney to move up the EPG to allow Playhouse Disney + to launch next to it on Sky 611 and 612 respectively. Playhouse Disney + was initially a 25-minute timeshift service until 11 April 2011 when it became a 1-hour timeshift service. It was renamed as Disney Junior +1 on 11 Feb 2019.\n\n==Live show==\nA live tour took place in Aug 2007-Late 2010. It was shown in several cities, across the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the United Kingdom, the tour included [[Bristol]], [[London]], [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Brighton]].\n\n==Blocks==\n===Current===\n* '''Magical Mondays''' - Magical Mondays was introduced in 2013 and runs on Monday afternoons.

He is, however, subject to the [[Canon Law|Sacred Canons]] of the Orthodox Church, and answers to the [[Synod of Bishops (Orthodox)|Synod of Bishops]] to which he belongs.

The church is defined Eucharistically: <blockquote>in each particular community gathered around its bishop; and at every local celebration of the Eucharist it is the ''whole'' Christ who is present, not just a part of Him. Therefore, each local community, as it celebrates the Eucharist ... is the church in its fullness.\"<ref name=\"Ware_21\"/></blockquote> This is not to say that the Orthodox Church has a [[Congregationalist polity]]; on the contrary, the local priest functions as the \"hands\" of the bishop, and must receive from the bishop an [[antimension]] and [[chrism]] before he is permitted to celebrate any of the [[Sacred Mysteries]] (sacraments) within the diocese.\n\nAn Orthodox bishop's authority comes from his election and [[consecration]]. He is, however, subject to the [[Canon Law|Sacred Canons]] of the Orthodox Church, and answers to the [[Synod of Bishops (Orthodox)|Synod of Bishops]] to which he belongs. In case an Orthodox bishop is overruled by his local synod, he retains the right of [[appeal]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u1f1c\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, ''\u00c9kkl\u0113ton'') to his ecclesiastical superior (e.g. a Patriarch) and his synod.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military ordinariate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n\n[[Category:Ecclesiastical titles]]\n[[Category:Canon law]]\n[[Category:Episcopacy in the Catholic Church]]\n[[Category:Catholic ecclesiastical titles]]\n", "name_user": "Esrever", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_(church_officer)"}
