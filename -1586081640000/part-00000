In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man.

Its first director was Oleksandr Yevdokymenko, who was arrested in 1938 and sentenced to ten years imprisonment during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]]. Originally the institute consisted of two departments, History and Philology, and had five chairs.\n\nSerhiy Ksenofontov became its head in 1940 and added the Physics-Mathematical Faculty in 1941. Due to [[Nazi Germany]]'s invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[World War II]], in 1941 the institute was evacuated first to [[Kungur]] and soon thereafter to [[Perm|Molotov]], where it was liquidated. It was reestablished in 1943, following the liberation of Donetsk, by a decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].\n\n=== After World War II ===\nThe school's Student Scientific Association, composed of two divisions \u2013 historical-philological and physical-mathematical \u2013 was established in 1951. In 1961, Mykola Khoroshailov took over from Ksenofontov as the head of the institute and its name was changed to '''Donetsk State Pedagogical Institute'''. In 1964, the institute was subordinated to [[Kharkiv University|Kharkiv State University]] and became a ''Donetsk branch of Kharkiv State University named after [[Maksim Gorky]]''.\n\nOn May 28, 1965, the Soviet of Ministers of the USSR enacted a decree on organising the '''Donetsk State University''' (DonSU) based at the Donetsk branch of Kharkiv State University. Professor Leonid Lytvynenko became the first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university (1965\u20131968). 1965 saw the launch of post-graduate studies (with an initial enrollment of 16 students), the addition of the faculties of biology and physics, and the construction of the students' campus.\n\nAppointed the second rector of the University, Professor Yuriy Shevlyakov managed the institution from 1968 to 1970, during which the main 12-storey building was constructed. Professor Hryhoriy Tymoshenko was the third University rector (1970\u20131975). In 1972, the University's history museum was opened in the main building. Professor Hryhoriy Ponomarenko became the rector in 1975, followed by Professor Volodymyr Shevchenko in 1986.

Its first director was Oleksandr Yevdokymenko, who was arrested in 1938 and sentenced to ten years imprisonment during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]]. Originally the institute consisted of two departments, History and Philology, and had five chairs.\n\nSerhiy Ksenofontov became its head in 1940 and added the Physics-Mathematical Faculty in 1941. Due to [[Nazi Germany]]'s invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[World War II]], in 1941 the institute was evacuated first to [[Kungur]] and soon thereafter to [[Perm|Molotov]], where it was liquidated. It was reestablished in 1943, following the liberation of Donetsk, by a decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].\n\n=== After World War II ===\nThe school's Student Scientific Association, composed of two divisions \u2013 historical-philological and physical-mathematical \u2013 was established in 1951. In 1961, Mykola Khoroshailov took over from Ksenofontov as the head of the institute and its name was changed to '''Donetsk State Pedagogical Institute'''. In 1964, the institute was subordinated to [[Kharkiv University|Kharkiv State University]] and became a ''Donetsk branch of Kharkiv State University named after [[Maksim Gorky]]''.\n\nOn May 28, 1965, the Soviet of Ministers of the USSR enacted a decree on organising the '''Donetsk State University''' (DonSU) based at the Donetsk branch of Kharkiv State University. Professor Leonid Lytvynenko became the first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university (1965\u20131968). 1965 saw the launch of post-graduate studies (with an initial enrollment of 16 students), the addition of the faculties of biology and physics, and the construction of the students' campus.\n\nAppointed the second rector of the University, Professor Yuriy Shevlyakov managed the institution from 1968 to 1970, during which the main 12-storey building was constructed. Professor Hryhoriy Tymoshenko was the third University rector (1970\u20131975). In 1972, the University's history museum was opened in the main building. Professor Hryhoriy Ponomarenko became the rector in 1975, followed by Professor Volodymyr Shevchenko in 1986. On September 11, 2000 the university was accorded national status by a decree of the [[President of Ukraine]], [[Leonid Kuchma]].\n\n=== War in Donbass and move to Vinnytsia ===\nDuring the [[war in Donbass]], part of the university relocated to [[Vinnytsia]].<ref name=\"AC160826\">{{cite news |url= http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-one-university-defied-putin-and-his-armed-mob |title= How One University Defied Putin and His Armed Mob |first= Melinda |last= Haring |work= Atlantic Council |date= August 26, 2016 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160913065926/http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-one-university-defied-putin-and-his-armed-mob |archivedate= September 13, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=KP141113>{{cite news |url= http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/donetsk-national-university-finds-refuge-no-cash-371745.html |title= Donetsk National University finds refuge, no cash |first= Olena |last= Goncharova |work= [[Kyiv Post]] |date= November 13, 2014 }}</ref> In June 2016, 75 out of 105 staff members voted in favour of naming the university after one of its alumni, the poet [[Vasyl Stus]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1465647214 |title= Donetsk University Finally Named After Great Ukrainian Poet Vasyl Stus |first= Halya |last= Coynash |work= [[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]] |date= 20 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\nVasyl' Stus Donetsk National University unites educational and research centers forming a complex that includes: 9 Faculties; 2 regional Training and Retraining Centers; Department of International Education, the UNESCO Department for Ecology in the Technogenous Region; Business Centre; Youth Centre for Legal Studies; the Laboratory for International Scientific and Technical Cooperation; Consulting Centres of the British, German and French Councils; Postgraduate Courses and Doctoral Studies etc.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Vasyl Stus]], Ukrainian poet, Soviet dissident\n* [[Hryhoriy Nemyria]], Ukrainian politician, vice prime minister in the [[Second Tymoshenko Government]]\n* [[Ivan Dziuba]], Ukrainian academician, minister of culture, literary critic, author of \"[[Internationalism or Russification?]]\", [[Holodomor]] survivor, co-founder of the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n''This article incorporates text from \"History of the University\" at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060925114750/http://www.donnu.edu.ua/museum/en/history.asp Official Web Site of the University], whose republication is expressly allowed if referenced to www.donnu.edu.ua.''\n\n{{Higher education in Donetsk}}\n{{Universities in Ukraine}}\n\n{{coord|48.0041|N|37.7975|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Donetsk National University| ]]\n[[Category:Universities and institutes established in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Universities in Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Donetsk]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Vinnytsia]]\n[[Category:1937 establishments in Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1937]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_National_University"}
