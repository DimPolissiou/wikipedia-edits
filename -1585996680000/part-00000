His son [[Mario Van Peebles]] also appears in a small role, playing the title character as a young boy. It tells the [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] story of the flight of a poor black man from the [[White American|white]] police authorities.\n\nVan Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three-picture contract for [[Columbia Pictures]]. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded it himself, shooting it independently over 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, some reportedly [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=J.|title=Videodrome: Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)|url=http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2014/01/29/videodrome-sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971/|website=Aquarium Drunkard|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> He received a $50,000 loan from [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on African-American cinema.\n\nThe musical score of ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' was performed by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Van Peebles did not have money for traditional advertising methods, so released the [[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] prior to the film's release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened in only two theaters in the United States. It went on to gross $15.2 million at the box office. [[Huey P. Newton]] celebrated and welcomed the film's revolutionary implications, and ''Sweetback'' became required viewing for members of the [[Black Panther Party]]. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', it demonstrated to [[Hollywood film industry|Hollywood]] that films which portrayed \"militant\" blacks could be highly profitable, leading to the creation of the [[blaxploitation]] genre,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jutton |first1=Lee |title=SWEET SWEETBACK\u2019S BAADASSSSS SONG: A Blaxploitation Classic That Remains All Too Relevant Today |url=https://www.filminquiry.com/sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971-review/ |website=www.filminquiry.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> although critic [[Roger Ebert]], commenting on a review of the 2004 film about the making of this movie, did not consider this example of Van Peebles' work to be an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040611/REVIEWS/406110302 |title=Review of ''Baadasssss!'' |accessdate=2007-01-04 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=June 11, 2004 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA young African-American orphan is sheltered by a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] brothel in the 1940s. Working as a towel boy, he is raped by one of the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]. The women name him \"Sweet Sweetback\" in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis. As an adult, Sweetback performs in the whorehouse [[sex show]].\n\nOne night, two white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers come in to speak to Sweetback's boss, Beetle. A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police suggest arresting Sweetback to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and they arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] named Mu-Mu after some trouble. They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into [[brass knuckles]] and beats the officers, putting them into comas.\n\nSweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by order of the police chief, seeking information about Mu-Mu's whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a [[molotov cocktail]] at the police car transporting him to the station for more severe interrogation. He next visits an old girlfriend, who similarly refuses him aid but cuts his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks his [[priest]] for help, but he refuses for fear of the police shutting down the church's [[drug rehab]] center.\n\nPolice officers interrogate Beetle, seeking to discover Sweetback's whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun against each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through [[South Central Los Angeles]] to the outskirts. Stopping overnight at a seemingly abandoned building, they discover it is a [[safe house]] for the [[Hells Angels]]. Their helmetted president challenges Sweetback to a duel: asked to decide the weapon and discovering she is a woman, he chooses sex and is judged to win. The bikers leave the men in their club to await a member of the all black [[East Bay Dragons MC|East Bay Dragons]] who will get them to Mexico. During the night, the club is raided by two policemen with drawn guns. Sweetback resists arrest and kills both officers in self-defense, but Mu-Mu is badly wounded. The next morning, the Dragon arrives, but his motorcycle can only carry one; Sweetback asks him to take Mu-Mu, as the activist is their future.\n\nAs Sweetback and Mu-Mu continue to evade arrest, pressure mounts on the police; the police chief warns his staff that the fugitives' example could prompt a black uprising. The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be probably one of the fugitives, and that he deserves a beating in any case. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair following the police brutality, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback and smiles when he sees it is somone else. As the police trawl black areas for him, they find Sweetback's biological and rather confused mother, who reveals that his birth name is Leroy.\n\nSweetback pays a [[hippie]] to switch clothes with him, deceiving a police helicopter which sends a patrol car in pursuit. Sweetback was also wounded in the shootout and both stows away and hitches rides on trucks and a train heading south. Running through arid country, he survives by drinking from a puddle and eating a lizard. When police hear he might be at a rural hippie musical event, he successfully disguises himself by simulating sex in the bushes. He is later spotted and police borrow a farmer's hunting dogs to track him. Realising he will cross the border before they reach him, a policeman releases the dogs, expecting them to catch and kill him. However, at the [[Tijuana River]], Sweetback stabs the dogs and escapes into Mexico, swearing to return to \"collect some dues\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Sweetback\n* Hubert Scales as Mu-Mu\n* Simon Chuckster as Beetle\n* John Dullaghan as Commissioner\n* West Gale\n* Niva Rochelle\n* [[Rhetta Hughes]] as Old Girl Friend\n* Nick Ferrari\n* Ed Rue\n* [[John Amos]] as Biker (as Johnny Amos)\n* Lavelle Roby\n* Ted Hayden\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Young Sweetback / Kid (as Mario Peebles)\n{{Colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nDuring production on ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]], Van Peebles attempted to rewrite the script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun of white liberals into the first [[black power]] film. The writer, [[Herman Raucher]], who had based the script on friends of his who expressed liberal sentiments while still holding onto bigoted beliefs, objected to Van Peebles' efforts because he felt that the movie should be a parody of liberal culture.<ref>[http://www.cinedump.com/interviews/2016/9/13/hermanraucher Fassel, Preston. ''Rediscovering Herman Raucher.'' Retrieved 10 February 2017]</ref> Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.\n\nAfter ''Watermelon Man'' proved to be a financial success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song''. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the [[Mojave desert]], turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun.  He decided that the film was going to be \"about a brother getting [[the Man]]'s foot out of his ass.\"<ref name=\"DariusJames\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink=Darius James |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-312-13192-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">Van Peebles, Melvin.

Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the film. \"Cosby didn't want an equity part,\" according to Van Peebles. \"He just wanted his money back.\" Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nAccording to Van Peebles, during the first day of shooting, director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the [[Dailies|rushes]], Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a relatively short period of 19 days in order to reduce the possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as \"globs,\" where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a [[Stunt performer|stunt man]], he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, \"Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again.\" Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted [[gonorrhea]] when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] in order to get [[workers' compensation]] because he was \"hurt on the job.\" Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=2 What Culture#17]; Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</ref>\n\nVan Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to stay until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crew members were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nVan Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Directing===\nVan Peebles stated that he approached directing the film \"like you do the cupboard when you're broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope to come out on top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" /> Van Peebles stated that \"story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. ... To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\">{{cite book |last=Van Peebles |first=Melvin |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Kaufman, Alan |editor2=Ortenberg, Neil |editor3=Rosset, Barney |others= |title=The Outlaw Bible of American Literature |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-56025-550-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 286\u2013289] |chapter=''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles wanted \"a victorious film ... where [[nigger]]s could walk out standing tall instead of avoiding each other's eyes, looking once again like they'd had it.\" Van Peebles was aware of the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low-budget independently made features, and was determined to make a film that \"[looked] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles knew that in order to spread his message, the film \"simply couldn't be a didactic discourse which would end up playing ... to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat me on the back and say it tells it like it is\" and that \"to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains\". Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would \"be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product ... [The Man] ain't about to go carrying no messages for you, especially a relevant one, for free.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles wanted half of his shooting crew \"to be third world people. ... So at best a staggering amount of my crew would be relatively inexperienced. ... Any type of film requiring an enormous technical sophistication at the shooting stage should not be attempted.\" Van Peebles knew that gaining financing for the film would not be easy and expected \"a great deal of animosity from the film media (white in the first place and right wing in the second) at all levels of filmmaking\", thus he had to \"write a flexible script where emphasis could be shifted. In short, stay loose.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThe film's fast-paced [[Montage sequence|montage]]s and [[jump cut]]s were novel features for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the film's editing had \"a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|title=FILM VIEW; Sweet Sweetback's World Revisited\n|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=July 2, 1995|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/movies/film-view-sweet-sweetback-s-world-revisited.html|accessdate=January 11, 2012|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref> In ''The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity'', author S.

Because he did not know how to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Van Peebles stated that \"Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations. Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension. So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nThe film's music was performed by the then-unknown group [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], who were living in a single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> By alternating [[hymn]]-based vocalization and [[jazz]] rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in [[hip hop music]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Kermit Ernest |title=Gettin' our groove on: rhetoric, language, and literacy for the hip hop generation |year=2005 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2925-2 |page=43 |chapter=Professing the Power of the Rap }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles recalls that \"music was not used as a selling tool in movies at the time. Even musicals, it would take three months after the release of the movie before they would bring out an album.\" Because Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods, he decided that by releasing a [[soundtrack album]] in anticipation of the film's release, he could help build awareness for the film with its music.<ref name=\"Funk\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Funk |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2001 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-87930-629-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 207\u2013208] |chapter=Blaxploitation: Funk Goes to the Movies |chapterurl= |quote= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==Release and alterations==\nThe film was released on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that \"at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in [[Detroit]], and one in [[Atlanta]]. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater's records, and that was only on the strength of the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet.

We may not want him to exist but he does.\" Critic [[Donald Bogle]] states in a ''New York Times'' interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, [[Sidney Poitier]]-type characters and that they wanted a \"viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero.\"<ref name=\"FramingBlackness\" /> In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: \"Not since [[Oscar Micheaux]] had an African-American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment...[it] depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other.\"<ref name=\"moma\">Higgins, Steven.

Warts and all, the film is perhaps the closest analogy to the progressive aims of the then-flourishing Black Arts movement. Indeed, it can be argued that because it was written, produced and directed by an American-born African outside of Hollywood, the film is not truly part of the blaxploitation genre, yet it cannot be denied that it shares certain thematic similarities. The film works best when it follows Sweetback's odyssey from stud boy to proto-nationalist consciousness. Unlike the Horatio Alger-style integrationism propagated in past films about blacks, here we see an outlaw among outlaws, nourished by a community segregated from the mainstream. It is in this disenfranchised community--and not the sterile offices of the NAACP--that he seeks and finds refuge. The sordid sexual trysts, the faux fantasies in the desert are, finally, less interesting than Sweetback's quest for self-realization.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=Nicky |title=In the early '70s, blaxploitation upended Hollywood stereotypes |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/blax-9545.html |website=www.metroactive.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Notable reactions===\n[[Huey P.

Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that \"some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes.\" Bennett concluded that the film is \"neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation.\" Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the \"rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute.\" Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as \"emancipation orgasms\" and stated that \"it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom.

His son [[Mario Van Peebles]] also appears in a small role, playing the title character as a young boy. It tells the [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] story of the flight of a poor black man from the [[White American|white]] police authorities.\n\nVan Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three-picture contract for [[Columbia Pictures]]. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded it himself, shooting it independently over 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, some reportedly [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=J.|title=Videodrome: Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)|url=http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2014/01/29/videodrome-sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971/|website=Aquarium Drunkard|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> He received a $50,000 loan from [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on African-American cinema.\n\nThe musical score of ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' was performed by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Van Peebles did not have money for traditional advertising methods, so released the [[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] prior to the film's release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened in only two theaters in the United States. It went on to gross $15.2 million at the box office. [[Huey P.

Working as a towel boy, he is raped by one of the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]. The women name him \"Sweet Sweetback\" in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis. As an adult, Sweetback performs in the whorehouse [[sex show]].\n\nOne night, two white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers come in to speak to Sweetback's boss, Beetle. A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police suggest arresting Sweetback to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and they arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] named Mu-Mu after some trouble. They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into [[brass knuckles]] and beats the officers, putting them into comas.\n\nSweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by order of the police chief, seeking information about Mu-Mu's whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a [[molotov cocktail]] at the police car transporting him to the station for more severe interrogation. He next visits an old girlfriend, who similarly refuses him aid but cuts his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks his [[priest]] for help, but he refuses for fear of the police shutting down the church's [[drug rehab]] center.\n\nPolice officers interrogate Beetle, seeking to discover Sweetback's whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun against each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through [[South Central Los Angeles]] to the outskirts. Stopping overnight at a seemingly abandoned building, they discover it is a [[safe house]] for the [[Hells Angels]]. Their helmetted president challenges Sweetback to a duel: asked to decide the weapon and discovering she is a woman, he chooses sex and is judged to win. The bikers leave the men in their club to await a member of the all black [[East Bay Dragons MC|East Bay Dragons]] who will get them to Mexico. During the night, the club is raided by two policemen with drawn guns. Sweetback resists arrest and kills both officers in self-defense, but Mu-Mu is badly wounded. The next morning, the Dragon arrives, but his motorcycle can only carry one; Sweetback asks him to take Mu-Mu, as the activist is their future.\n\nAs Sweetback and Mu-Mu continue to evade arrest, pressure mounts on the police; the police chief warns his staff that the fugitives' example could prompt a black uprising. The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be probably one of the fugitives, and that he deserves a beating in any case. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair following the police brutality, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback and smiles when he sees it is somone else. As the police trawl black areas for him, they find Sweetback's biological and rather confused mother, who reveals that his birth name is Leroy.\n\nSweetback pays a [[hippie]] to switch clothes with him, deceiving a police helicopter which sends a patrol car in pursuit. Sweetback was also wounded in the shootout and both stows away and hitches rides on trucks and a train heading south. Running through arid country, he survives by drinking from a puddle and eating a frog. Whe police hear he might be at a rural hippie musical event, he successfully disguises himself by simulating sex in the bushes. He is later spotted and police borrow a farmer's hunting dogs to track him. Realising he will cross the border before they reach him, a policeman releases the dogs, expecting them to catch and kill him. However, at the [[Tijuana River]], Sweetback stabs the dogs and escapes into Mexico, swearing to return to \"collect some dues\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Sweetback\n* Hubert Scales as Mu-Mu\n* Simon Chuckster as Beetle\n* John Dullaghan as Commissioner\n* West Gale\n* Niva Rochelle\n* [[Rhetta Hughes]] as Old Girl Friend\n* Nick Ferrari\n* Ed Rue\n* [[John Amos]] as Biker (as Johnny Amos)\n* Lavelle Roby\n* Ted Hayden\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Young Sweetback / Kid (as Mario Peebles)\n{{Colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nDuring production on ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]], Van Peebles attempted to rewrite the script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun of white liberals into the first [[black power]] film. The writer, [[Herman Raucher]], who had based the script on friends of his who expressed liberal sentiments while still holding onto bigoted beliefs, objected to Van Peebles' efforts because he felt that the movie should be a parody of liberal culture.<ref>[http://www.cinedump.com/interviews/2016/9/13/hermanraucher Fassel, Preston. ''Rediscovering Herman Raucher.'' Retrieved 10 February 2017]</ref> Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.\n\nAfter ''Watermelon Man'' proved to be a financial success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song''. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the [[Mojave desert]], turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun.  He decided that the film was going to be \"about a brother getting [[the Man]]'s foot out of his ass.\"<ref name=\"DariusJames\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink=Darius James |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-312-13192-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">Van Peebles, Melvin.

Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the film. \"Cosby didn't want an equity part,\" according to Van Peebles. \"He just wanted his money back.\" Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nAccording to Van Peebles, during the first day of shooting, director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the [[Dailies|rushes]], Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a relatively short period of 19 days in order to reduce the possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as \"globs,\" where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a [[Stunt performer|stunt man]], he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, \"Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again.\" Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted [[gonorrhea]] when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] in order to get [[workers' compensation]] because he was \"hurt on the job.\" Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=2 What Culture#17]; Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</ref>\n\nVan Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to stay until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crew members were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nVan Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Directing===\nVan Peebles stated that he approached directing the film \"like you do the cupboard when you're broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope to come out on top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" /> Van Peebles stated that \"story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. ...

Because he did not know how to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Van Peebles stated that \"Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa.

So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nThe film's music was performed by the then-unknown group [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], who were living in a single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> By alternating [[hymn]]-based vocalization and [[jazz]] rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in [[hip hop music]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Kermit Ernest |title=Gettin' our groove on: rhetoric, language, and literacy for the hip hop generation |year=2005 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2925-2 |page=43 |chapter=Professing the Power of the Rap }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles recalls that \"music was not used as a selling tool in movies at the time. Even musicals, it would take three months after the release of the movie before they would bring out an album.\" Because Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods, he decided that by releasing a [[soundtrack album]] in anticipation of the film's release, he could help build awareness for the film with its music.<ref name=\"Funk\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Funk |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2001 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-87930-629-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 207\u2013208] |chapter=Blaxploitation: Funk Goes to the Movies |chapterurl= |quote= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==Release and alterations==\nThe film was released on April 23, 1971.

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] cited the ending as a reason for the film not to be labeled as an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\"/>\n\nThe ''New York Times'' critic Clayton Riley viewed the film favorably, commenting on its aesthetic innovation, but stated of the character of Sweetback that he \"is the ultimate sexualist in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic [[colonialism]].\" In another review, Riley explained that \"Sweetback, the profane sexual athlete and fugitive, is based on a reality that is Black. We may not want him to exist but he does.\" Critic [[Donald Bogle]] states in a ''New York Times'' interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, [[Sidney Poitier]]-type characters and that they wanted a \"viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero.\"<ref name=\"FramingBlackness\" /> In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: \"Not since [[Oscar Micheaux]] had an African-American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment...[it] depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other.\"<ref name=\"moma\">Higgins, Steven.

Warts and all, the film is perhaps the closest analogy to the progressive aims of the then-flourishing Black Arts movement. Indeed, it can be argued that because it was written, produced and directed by an American-born African outside of Hollywood, the film is not truly part of the blaxploitation genre, yet it cannot be denied that it shares certain thematic similarities. The film works best when it follows Sweetback's odyssey from stud boy to proto-nationalist consciousness. Unlike the Horatio Alger-style integrationism propagated in past films about blacks, here we see an outlaw among outlaws, nourished by a community segregated from the mainstream. It is in this disenfranchised community--and not the sterile offices of the NAACP--that he seeks and finds refuge. The sordid sexual trysts, the faux fantasies in the desert are, finally, less interesting than Sweetback's quest for self-realization.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=Nicky |title=In the early '70s, blaxploitation upended Hollywood stereotypes |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/blax-9545.html |website=www.metroactive.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Notable reactions===\n[[Huey P.

Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that \"some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes.\" Bennett concluded that the film is \"neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation.\" Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the \"rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute.\" Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as \"emancipation orgasms\" and stated that \"it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that they are going to be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set you free.

''comosum'' has strap-shaped narrow leaves and is found along forest margins, ''C.&nbsp;comosum'' var. ''bipindense'' has broader, [[petiole (botany)|petiolate]] leaves with stripes on the underside and the inflorescences are 2-3 times the length of the leaves, and ''C.&nbsp;comosum'' var. ''sparsiflorum'' also has broader leaves that narrow to the base and usually lacks a petiole and the striping on the underside of the leaf and the inflorescences are up to two times the length of the leaves. The latter two are rain forest-dwelling taxa that had earlier been described as separate species, but botanists Axel Dalberg Poulsen and Inger Nordal reduced the taxa to varieties of ''C.&nbsp;comosum'' in 2005.<ref name=\"Poulsen & Nordal 2005\">Poulsen, AD, and I Nordal. 2005.

The evidence given to support this is the widespread distribution of most taxa in the genus and poor seed dispersal, leading to the conclusion of deeper evolutionary divergence among the taxa.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas Light Sweet, is a type of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing and the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is a light crude oil, lighter than Brent Crude oil. It contains about 0.24% sulfur, rating it a sweet crude, sweeter than Brent. Its properties and production site make it ideal for being refined in the United States, mostly in the Midwest and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] (USGC) regions. WTI has an API gravity of around 39.6 (specific gravity approx. 0.827). [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.\n\nThe [[National Bank of Canada]]'s Tim Simard, argued that WCS is the benchmark for those buying shares in Canadian oil sands companies, such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., or Cenovus Energy Inc., Northern Blizzard Resources Inc., Pengrowth Energy Corp., or Twin Butte Energy Ltd or others where a \"big part of their exposure will be to heavy crude\u201d.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}\n\nThe price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil (petroleum) per barrel{{sfn|Index Mundi|nd}} suffers a differential{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI){{sfn|Department of Energy|2012}} as traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (NYMEX) as published by [[Bloomberg Media]], which itself has a discount versus London-traded Brent oil.{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} This is based on data on prices and differentials from [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]] (TSX:CNQ)(NYSE:CNQ).\n\n\"West Texas Intermediate Crude oil (WTI) is a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] for the North American market, and [[Edmonton Par]] and Western Canadian Select (WCS) are benchmarks crude oils for the Canadian market. Both Edmonton Par and WTI are high-quality low sulphur crude oils with API gravity levels of around 40\u00b0. In contrast, WCS is a heavy crude oil with an API gravity level of 20.5\u00b0.\"{{sfn|NRC|2013}}{{rp|9}}\n\n[[West Texas Intermediate]] WTI is a sweet, [[light crude oil]], with an [[API gravity]] of around 39.6 and [[specific gravity]] of about 0.827, which is lighter than Brent crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur thus is rated as a [[sweet crude oil]] (having less than 0.5% sulfur), sweeter than Brent which has 0.37% sulfur. WTI is refined mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions in the U.S., since it is high quality fuel and is produced within the country.\n\n\"WCS prices at a discount to WTI because it is a lower quality crude (3.51Wt. percent sulfur and 20.5 API gravity){{sfn|Moore|2011}} and because of a transportation differential. The price of WCS is currently set at the U.S. Gulf Coast. It costs approximately $10/bbl for a barrel of crude to be transported from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, accounting for at least $10/bbl of the WTI-WCS discount. Pipeline constraints can also cause the transportation differential to rise significantly.\n\nBy March 2015, with the price of Ice Brent at US$60.55, and WTI at US$51.48, up US$1.10 from the previous day, WCS also rose US$1.20 to US$37.23 with a WTI-WCS price differential of US$14.25.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015}}{{rp|B10-11}} By 2 June 2015 with Brent at US$64.88/bbl, WTI at US$60.19/bbl and WCS at US$52.39/bbl.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Financial Post]]'', most Canadian investors continued to quote the price of WTI not WCS even though many Canadian oilsands producers sell at WCS prices, because WCS \"has always lacked the transparency and liquidity necessary to make it a household name with investors in the country\".{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} In 2014 Auspice created the Canadian Crude Excess Return Index to gauge WCS futures. Tim Simard, head of commodities at the ''[[National Bank of Canada]]'', claims \"WCS has \"some interesting different fundamental attributes than the conventional WTI barrel.\" WCS has \"better transparency and broader participation\" than Maya.

In December 2012, 2,357 Bakken wells in Saskatchewan produced a record high of {{convert|71000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|sigfig=2}}.{{Sfn|Kohlruss et al|2013}} The Bakken Formation also produces in Manitoba, but the yield is small, averaging less than {{convert|2000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|sigfig=1}} in 2012.{{Sfn|Government of Manitoba|2013}}\n\n\"Just over 21% of North Dakota\u2019s total 2013 gross domestic product (GDP) of $49.77 billion comes from natural resources and mining.\"{{Sfn|24/7 Wall Street|2014}}\n\n{{quote|\"The state levies a 5% production tax on the gross value at the wellhead of all oil produced in the state, with some exceptions.

The state\u2019s 5% oil production tax is split between state and county governments. The state treasurer takes 20% that it then allocates to cities and to an impact grant program.

That royalty rate is applied to a project's net revenue if the project has reached payout or Gross Revenue if the project has not yet reached payout. A project's revenue is a direct function of the price it is able to sell its crude for. Since WCS is a benchmark for oil sands crudes, revenues in the oil sands are discounted when the price of WCS is discounted. Those price discounts flow through to the royalty payments.\n\nThe Province of Alberta receives a portion of benefits from the development of energy resources in the form of royalties that fund in part programs like health, education and infrastructure.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|1}}\n\nIn 2006-7, the oil sands royalty revenue was $2.411 billion. In 2007/08, it rose to $2.913 billion and it continued to rise in 2008/09 to $2.973 billion. Following the revised Alberta Royalty Regime, it fell in 2009/10 to $1.008 billion.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|10}} In that year, Alberta's total resource revenue \"fell below $7 billion...when the world economy was in the grip of recession\".{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}}\n\nIn February 2012, the Province of Alberta \"expected $13.4 billion in revenue from non-renewable resources in 2013-14.{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}} By January 2013, the province was anticipating only $7.4 billion. \"30 per cent of Alberta\u2019s approximately $40-billion budget is funded through oil and gas revenues. Bitumen royalties represent about half of that total.\"{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}} In 2009/10, royalties from the oil sands amounted to $1.008 billion (Budget 2009 cited in Energy Alberta 2009.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|10}}\n\nIn order to accelerate development of the oil sands, the federal and provincial governments more closely aligned taxation of the oil sands with other surface mining resulting in \"charging one per cent of a project\u2019s gross revenues until the project\u2019s investment costs are paid in full at which point rates increased to 25 per cent of net revenue.

Effective January 1, 2009 the royalty percentage of net revenue is also indexed to the Canadian dollar price of WTI.

Defining a loss position becomes increasingly complex when [[Vertical integration|vertically-integrated]] multi-national energy companies are involved. Suncor claims their realized losses were legitimate and that [[Canada Revenue Agency]] (CRA) is unfairly claiming \"$1.2-billion\" in taxes which is jeopardizing their operations.{{sfn|Vanderklippe|2013b}}\n\n=== Oil Sands Royalty Rates ===\n\n\"Bitumen Valuation Methodology (BVM) is a method to determine for royalty purposes a value for bitumen produced in oil sands projects and either upgraded on-site or sold or transferred to affiliates. The BVM ensures that Alberta receives market value for its bitumen production, taken in cash or bitumen royalty-in-kind, through the royalty formula. Western Canadian Select (WCS), a grade or blend of Alberta bitumens, diluents (a product such as [[naphtha]] or [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]] which is added to increase the ability of the oil to flow through a pipeline) and conventional heavy oils, developed by Alberta producers and stored and valued at Hardisty, AB was determined to be the best reference crude price in the development of a BVM.\"{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| Price WTI C $/bbl || Pre-Payout Royalty Rate on Gross Revenue || Post Payout Royalty Rate on Net Revenue\n|-\n| Below C$55 || 1.00% || 25.00%\n|-\n| C$60 || 1.62% || 26.15%\n|-\n| C$75 || 3.46% || 29.62%\n|-\n| C$100 || 6.54% || 35.38%\n|-\n| Above C$120 || 9.00% || 40.00%\n|}\n\n=== Bitumen Bubble ===\n[[File:Athabasca Oil Sands Planned Production.png|thumb|150px|Athabasca Oil Sands Planned Production 2012]]\n\nIn January 2013, the then [[Premier of Alberta]], [[Alison Redford]], used the term bitumen bubble to explain the impact of a dramatic and unanticipated drop in the amount of taxes and revenue from the oil sands linked to the deep discount price of Western Canadian Select against [[West Texas Intermediate|WTI]] and Maya crude oil, would result in deep cuts in the 2013 provincial budget.{{sfn|Kleiss|2013}} In 2012 oil prices rose and fell all year. Premier Redford described the \"bitumen bubble\" as the differential or \"spread between the different prices and the lower price for Alberta's Western Canadian Select (WCS)\". In 2013 alone, the \"bitumen bubble\" effect will result in about six billion dollars less in provincial revenue.{{sfn|Redford|2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Energy|Canada}}\n{{Wikinews|Portal:Economy and business}}\n* [[Petroleum#Classification|Petroleum classification]]\n* [[List of crude oil products]]\n* [[Canadian Centre for Energy Information]]\n* [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)]]\n* [[Syncrude]]\n* [[Suncor]]\n* [[CNRL]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=Notes}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n<!-- A -->\n\n* {{citation |ref={{SfnRef|Auers|Mayes|2013}} |title=North American production boom pushes crude blending|date=5 June 2013|first1=John R. |last1=Auers |first2=John |last2=Mayes|location=Dallas, Texas|url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-111/issue-5/processing/north-american-production-boom-pushes.html|journal=Oil & Gas Journal|accessdate=28 December 2013|volume=111|number=5}}\n* {{citation |ref={{SfnRef|Aulds|2012}} |title=Rumor mill in high gear over BP buyers|first=T.J.|last=Aulds |url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story/320094 |newspaper=The Daily News (Galveston) |date=6 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711094000/http://galvestondailynews.com/story/320094 |archivedate=11 July 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}\n*{{citation |ref={{SfnRef|Ausick|2014}} |title=Will $60 a Barrell Oil Ruin North Dakota's Economy?

West Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas Light Sweet, is a type of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing and the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is a light crude oil, lighter than Brent Crude oil. It contains about 0.24% sulfur, rating it a sweet crude, sweeter than Brent. Its properties and production site make it ideal for being refined in the United States, mostly in the Midwest and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] (USGC) regions. WTI has an API gravity of around 39.6 (specific gravity approx. 0.827). [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.\n\nThe [[National Bank of Canada]]'s Tim Simard, argued that WCS is the benchmark for those buying shares in Canadian oil sands companies, such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., or Cenovus Energy Inc., Northern Blizzard Resources Inc., Pengrowth Energy Corp., or Twin Butte Energy Ltd or others where a \"big part of their exposure will be to heavy crude\u201d.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}\n\nThe price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil (petroleum) per barrel{{sfn|Index Mundi|nd}} suffers a differential{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI){{sfn|Department of Energy|2012}} as traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (NYMEX) as published by [[Bloomberg Media]], which itself has a discount versus London-traded Brent oil.{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} This is based on data on prices and differentials from [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]] (TSX:CNQ)(NYSE:CNQ).\n\n\"West Texas Intermediate Crude oil (WTI) is a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] for the North American market, and [[Edmonton Par]] and Western Canadian Select (WCS) are benchmarks crude oils for the Canadian market. Both Edmonton Par and WTI are high-quality low sulphur crude oils with API gravity levels of around 40\u00b0. In contrast, WCS is a heavy crude oil with an API gravity level of 20.5\u00b0.\"{{sfn|NRC|2013}}{{rp|9}}\n\n[[West Texas Intermediate]] WTI is a sweet, [[light crude oil]], with an [[API gravity]] of around 39.6 and [[specific gravity]] of about 0.827, which is lighter than Brent crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur thus is rated as a [[sweet crude oil]] (having less than 0.5% sulfur), sweeter than Brent which has 0.37% sulfur. WTI is refined mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions in the U.S., since it is high quality fuel and is produced within the country.\n\n\"WCS prices at a discount to WTI because it is a lower quality crude (3.51Wt. percent sulfur and 20.5 API gravity){{sfn|Moore|2011}} and because of a transportation differential. The price of WCS is currently set at the U.S. Gulf Coast. It costs approximately $10/bbl for a barrel of crude to be transported from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, accounting for at least $10/bbl of the WTI-WCS discount. Pipeline constraints can also cause the transportation differential to rise significantly.\n\nBy March 2015, with the price of Ice Brent at US$60.55, and WTI at US$51.48, up US$1.10 from the previous day, WCS also rose US$1.20 to US$37.23 with a WTI-WCS price differential of US$14.25.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015}}{{rp|B10-11}} By 2 June 2015 with Brent at US$64.88/bbl, WTI at US$60.19/bbl and WCS at US$52.39/bbl.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Financial Post]]'', most Canadian investors continued to quote the price of WTI not WCS even though many Canadian oilsands producers sell at WCS prices, because WCS \"has always lacked the transparency and liquidity necessary to make it a household name with investors in the country\".{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} In 2014 Auspice created the Canadian Crude Excess Return Index to gauge WCS futures. Tim Simard, head of commodities at the ''[[National Bank of Canada]]'', claims \"WCS has \"some interesting different fundamental attributes than the conventional WTI barrel.\" WCS has \"better transparency and broader participation\" than Maya.

In December 2012, 2,357 Bakken wells in Saskatchewan produced a record high of {{convert|71000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|sigfig=2}}.{{Sfn|Kohlruss et al|2013}} The Bakken Formation also produces in Manitoba, but the yield is small, averaging less than {{convert|2000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|sigfig=1}} in 2012.{{Sfn|Government of Manitoba|2013}}\n\n\"Just over 21% of North Dakota\u2019s total 2013 gross domestic product (GDP) of $49.77 billion comes from natural resources and mining.\"{{Sfn|24/7 Wall Street|2014}}\n\n{{quote|\"The state levies a 5% production tax on the gross value at the wellhead of all oil produced in the state, with some exceptions.

The state\u2019s 5% oil production tax is split between state and county governments. The state treasurer takes 20% that it then allocates to cities and to an impact grant program.

That royalty rate is applied to a project's net revenue if the project has reached payout or Gross Revenue if the project has not yet reached payout. A project's revenue is a direct function of the price it is able to sell its crude for. Since WCS is a benchmark for oil sands crudes, revenues in the oil sands are discounted when the price of WCS is discounted. Those price discounts flow through to the royalty payments.\n\nThe Province of Alberta receives a portion of benefits from the development of energy resources in the form of royalties that fund in part programs like health, education and infrastructure.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|1}}\n\nIn 2006-7, the oil sands royalty revenue was $2.411 billion. In 2007/08, it rose to $2.913 billion and it continued to rise in 2008/09 to $2.973 billion. Following the revised Alberta Royalty Regime, it fell in 2009/10 to $1.008 billion.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|10}} In that year, Alberta's total resource revenue \"fell below $7 billion...when the world economy was in the grip of recession\".{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}}\n\nIn February 2012, the Province of Alberta \"expected $13.4 billion in revenue from non-renewable resources in 2013-14.{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}} By January 2013, the province was anticipating only $7.4 billion. \"30 per cent of Alberta\u2019s approximately $40-billion budget is funded through oil and gas revenues. Bitumen royalties represent about half of that total.\"{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}} In 2009/10, royalties from the oil sands amounted to $1.008 billion (Budget 2009 cited in Energy Alberta 2009.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|10}}\n\nIn order to accelerate development of the oil sands, the federal and provincial governments more closely aligned taxation of the oil sands with other surface mining resulting in \"charging one per cent of a project\u2019s gross revenues until the project\u2019s investment costs are paid in full at which point rates increased to 25 per cent of net revenue.

Effective January 1, 2009 the royalty percentage of net revenue is also indexed to the Canadian dollar price of WTI.

Defining a loss position becomes increasingly complex when [[Vertical integration|vertically-integrated]] multi-national energy companies are involved. Suncor claims their realized losses were legitimate and that [[Canada Revenue Agency]] (CRA) is unfairly claiming \"$1.2-billion\" in taxes which is jeopardizing their operations.{{sfn|Vanderklippe|2013b}}\n\n=== Oil Sands Royalty Rates ===\n\n\"Bitumen Valuation Methodology (BVM) is a method to determine for royalty purposes a value for bitumen produced in oil sands projects and either upgraded on-site or sold or transferred to affiliates. The BVM ensures that Alberta receives market value for its bitumen production, taken in cash or bitumen royalty-in-kind, through the royalty formula. Western Canadian Select (WCS), a grade or blend of Alberta bitumens, diluents (a product such as [[naphtha]] or [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]] which is added to increase the ability of the oil to flow through a pipeline) and conventional heavy oils, developed by Alberta producers and stored and valued at Hardisty, AB was determined to be the best reference crude price in the development of a BVM.\"{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| Price WTI C $/bbl || Pre-Payout Royalty Rate on Gross Revenue || Post Payout Royalty Rate on Net Revenue\n|-\n| Below C$55 || 1.00% || 25.00%\n|-\n| C$60 || 1.62% || 26.15%\n|-\n| C$75 || 3.46% || 29.62%\n|-\n| C$100 || 6.54% || 35.38%\n|-\n| Above C$120 || 9.00% || 40.00%\n|}\n\n=== Bitumen Bubble ===\n[[File:Athabasca Oil Sands Planned Production.png|thumb|150px|Athabasca Oil Sands Planned Production 2012]]\n\nIn January 2013, the then [[Premier of Alberta]], [[Alison Redford]], used the term bitumen bubble to explain the impact of a dramatic and unanticipated drop in the amount of taxes and revenue from the oil sands linked to the deep discount price of Western Canadian Select against [[West Texas Intermediate|WTI]] and Maya crude oil, would result in deep cuts in the 2013 provincial budget.{{sfn|Kleiss|2013}} In 2012 oil prices rose and fell all year. Premier Redford described the \"bitumen bubble\" as the differential or \"spread between the different prices and the lower price for Alberta's Western Canadian Select (WCS)\". In 2013 alone, the \"bitumen bubble\" effect will result in about six billion dollars less in provincial revenue.{{sfn|Redford|2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Energy|Canada}}\n{{Wikinews|Portal:Economy and business}}\n* [[Petroleum#Classification|Petroleum classification]]\n* [[List of crude oil products]]\n* [[Canadian Centre for Energy Information]]\n* [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)]]\n* [[Syncrude]]\n* [[Suncor]]\n* [[CNRL]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=Notes}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n<!-- A -->\n\n* {{citation |ref={{SfnRef|Auers|Mayes|2013}} |title=North American production boom pushes crude blending|date=5 June 2013|first1=John R. |last1=Auers |first2=John |last2=Mayes|location=Dallas, Texas|url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-111/issue-5/processing/north-american-production-boom-pushes.html|journal=Oil & Gas Journal|accessdate=28 December 2013|volume=111|number=5}}\n* {{citation |ref={{SfnRef|Aulds|2012}} |title=Rumor mill in high gear over BP buyers|first=T.J.|last=Aulds |url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story/320094 |newspaper=The Daily News (Galveston) |date=6 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711094000/http://galvestondailynews.com/story/320094 |archivedate=11 July 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}\n*{{citation |ref={{SfnRef|Ausick|2014}} |title=Will $60 a Barrell Oil Ruin North Dakota's Economy?

Critically, the application storefront itself provides a secure, uniform experience that automates the electronic purchase, decryption and installation of software applications or other digital media. \n\nApp stores typically organize the apps they offer based on: the function(s) provided by the app (including games, multimedia or productivity), the device for which the app was designed, and the operating system on which the app will run.\n\nApp stores typically take the form of an [[Online shopping|online store]], where [[End-user|users]] can browse through these different app categories, view information about each app (such as reviews or ratings), and acquire the app (including app purchase, if necessary \u2013 many apps are offered at no cost). The selected app is offered as an automatic download, after which the app installs. Some app stores may also include a system to [[kill switch|automatically remove an installed program]] from devices under certain conditions, with the goal of protecting the user against malicious software.<ref name=cw-remotedisable>{{cite web|title=Microsoft: We can remotely delete Windows 8 apps|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9222518/Microsoft_We_can_remotely_delete_Windows_8_apps |work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |accessdate=8 October 2013|date=2011-12-08 }}</ref>\n\nApp stores typically provide a way for users to give reviews and ratings. Those reviews are useful for other users, for developers and for app store owners.

Apps provide a specific set of functions which, by definition, do not include the running of the computer itself. Complex software designed for use on a [[personal computer]], for example, may have a related app designed for use on a [[mobile device]]. Today apps are normally designed to run on a specific [[operating system]]\u2014such as the contemporary [[iOS]], [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\u2014but in the past [[mobile carrier]]s had their own portals for apps and related media content.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.telecomcircle.com/2009/05/the-economics-of-mobile-application-stores/ | title=The Economics of Mobile Application Store| date=2009-05-17}}</ref>\n\n== Basic concept ==\nAn app store is any digital storefront intended to allow search and review of software titles or other media offered for sale electronically. Critically, the application storefront itself provides a secure, uniform experience that automates the electronic purchase, decryption and installation of software applications or other digital media. \n\nApp stores typically organize the apps they offer based on: the function(s) provided by the app (including games, multimedia or productivity), the device for which the app was designed, and the operating system on which the app will run.\n\nApp stores typically take the form of an [[Online shopping|online store]], where [[End-user|users]] can browse through these different app categories, view information about each app (such as reviews or ratings), and acquire the app (including app purchase, if necessary \u2013 many apps are offered at no cost). The selected app is offered as an automatic download, after which the app installs. Some app stores may also include a system to [[kill switch|automatically remove an installed program]] from devices under certain conditions, with the goal of protecting the user against malicious software.<ref name=cw-remotedisable>{{cite web|title=Microsoft: We can remotely delete Windows 8 apps|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9222518/Microsoft_We_can_remotely_delete_Windows_8_apps |work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |accessdate=8 October 2013|date=2011-12-08 }}</ref>\n\nApp stores typically provide a way for users to give reviews and ratings.

In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection published in 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953. His children's books, including the 'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'' etc), and the Hartwarp adventures for younger children, were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but haven't remained in print.

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941.<ref>[http://www.carolinemdavies.co.uk/2012/06/07/collected-poems-john-pudney/ Davies, Caroline.

He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection published in 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|The Net]] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953. His children's books, including the 'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'' etc), and the Hartwarp adventures for younger children, were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but haven't remained in print. Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They had two daughters and a son, but were divorced. In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967. That process became a subject for his writing. In 1976 he developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain.
